Coordination of the timing and order of these events is critical for the high-fidelity transmission of genetic information. Work in several laboratories has demonstrated that this coordination is genetically controlled by surveillance mechanisms, termed checkpoints. Checkpoints are pathways that affect cell cycle progression in response to genotoxic agents or alteration of particular structures such as the spindle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c2">2</xref>).</p><p>Removal of introns from pre-mRNA is an important component of the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Pre-mRNA splicing requires a large number of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, which together constitute the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c4">4</xref>). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the spliceosome consists of a large number of specific proteins associated with functional small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) composed of small nuclear RNA molecules (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNA). In addition, a large number of non-snRNP proteins are either transiently associated with, or constitute an integral part of, the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c3">3</xref>). Genetic screens have identified many proteins involved in splicing in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c5">5</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>CDC40&#x0002f;PRP17</italic> gene encodes a protein that plays a role during the second step of the splicing reaction. Mutations in this gene result in accumulation of splicing intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c6">6</xref>). This gene was also independently found to function in the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles. At the restrictive temperature, <italic>cdc40&#x0002f;prp17</italic> strains arrest as large-budded cells with one undivided nucleus containing 2N content of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c8">8</xref>). Thus, the <italic>CDC40&#x0002f;PRP17</italic> gene is involved in two seemingly unrelated processes: pre-mRNA splicing and progression through the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phases of the cell cycle. For simplicity, we will refer to the gene as <italic>CDC40</italic>.</p><p>Previously, we have implemented a screen to identify mutants that are synthetically lethal in the absence of Cdc40p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c10">10</xref>). This screen identified several genes (<italic>SYF</italic>, synthetic lethal with forty). When some of the <italic>SYF</italic> genes were used as baits in two-hybrid screens, we uncovered a complex network of interactions between a group of splicing factors (including Prp8, Slu7, Prp22, Slt11, Syf1, Syf2, Syf3&#x0002f;Clf1, Cef1, Isy1 and Ntc20). Most of these splicing factors are involved in cell cycle progression and, when mutated, cells arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c10">10</xref>). Based on these results, we have suggested the existence of a protein complex &#x0005b;cell cycle and splicing complex (CSC)&#x0005d; that plays a role in both splicing andS.cerevisiae and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> has confirmed the existence of protein complexes containing several of the CSC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c12">12</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we investigate the genetic interactions between three non-essential components of the CSC, and we report the characterization of the double mutant <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394;. Our results demonstrate that the double mutant is temperature sensitive and arrests in the cell cycle. Moreover, we show that the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrest phenotype observed in this mutant is due to the low levels of &#x003b1;-tubulin protein encoded by <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic>, two intron-containing genes. The low levels of &#x003b1;-tubulin activate the spindle checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest. Our results point at an unexpected role played by pre-mRNA splicing in guarding the stability of the genome during cell division.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media, growth conditions and general procedures</title><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strains used in the present work are as follows.

In order to release cells from G<sub>1</sub> arrest, cells were washed three times and resuspended in fresh YEPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopic and flow cytometry analysis</title><p>To visualize nuclei, cells were fixed with 70&#x00025; methanol overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml 4&#x02032;,6&#x02032;-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS. To determine nuclear position, the distance from the edge of the nucleus to the bud neck was measured for each budded cell, as well as the diameter of the mother cell. The ratio between these two distances was calculated. A ratio of 0.4 or larger was considered to be indicative of nuclear localization failure. Most wild-type large-budded cells exhibited a ratio of 0.25 or lower. At least 200 cells were analyzed for each strain.</p><p>Anti-tubulin antibody staining was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c16">16</xref>). For &#x003b1;-tubulin staining we used YOL1&#x0002f;34 antibodies (Harlan Sera-lab Ltd). The secondary antibody was FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). Flow cytometry analysis was carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c10">10</xref>).

Colonies were then streaked on YEPGal plates and replicated on YEPGal and 5-FOA plates at 25 and 35&#x000b0;C. Colonies that were able to grow on YEPGal plates at 25 and 35&#x000b0;C and on 5-FOA plates at 25&#x000b0;C but not at 35&#x000b0;C were further analyzed.

Many temperature-sensitive splicing mutants have been isolated; most of them arrest at the restrictive temperature without any defined cell cycle morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c10">10</xref>). We reasoned that the cell cycle-specific arrest of the <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant strain might be caused by inefficient processing of a small number of intron-containing genes particularly dependent on Isy1p and Syf2p for their pre-mRNA splicing. If this were the case, we expected that introduction of the relevant target gene(s) in the form of cDNA should be sufficient to bypass the need for Isy1p and Syf2p and therefore should allow growth at the restrictive temperature. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a screen to isolate cDNAs able to suppress the temperature sensitivity of <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; cells. Strain YOD13 (<italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394;) was transformed with a cDNA library and screened for cell growth at 35&#x000b0;C.

The three additional cDNA clones (encoding <italic>MOT2</italic>, <italic>RPN5</italic> and <italic>YOL162w</italic>) were isolated only once each and allowed only weak growth at 35&#x000b0;C. They encode, respectively, a general transcription factor, a proteasome subunit and an unknown ORF.

To establish whether the phenotypes of the <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; mutant were related to tubulin, we checked the ability of the double mutant cells to grow in the presence of increasing nocodazole concentrations. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf563f3">3</xref>, at a semi-restrictive temperature (30&#x000b0;C), the <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant displays increased sensitivity to nocodazole relative to single mutants or to the wild-type control. Such sensitivity could not be seen at the permissive temperature. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf563f3">3</xref>B also shows that nocodazole sensitivity was completely suppressed by <italic>TUB1</italic> or <italic>TUB3</italic> cDNA expression.

Thus, during the S, G<sub>2</sub> and early M phases, a short spindle is observed, whereas spindle elongation occurs during anaphase. Since <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> encode the &#x003b1;-tubulin subunit, which is a major component of the mitotic spindle, we considered the possibility that lower expression of <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> in the <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant strain incubated at the restrictive temperature may disrupt the mitotic spindle and therefore cause cell cycle arrest. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a careful analysis of the spindle length of <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; cells at the permissive and non-permissive temperatures. The cells were grown at 25&#x000b0;C and then shifted to the restrictive temperature (37&#x000b0;C). At different time points samples were taken for tubulin staining by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-&#x003b1;-tubulin antibodies. At the permissive temperature, the <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; cells contained spindles of all sizes, as did the wild-type control. However, after 2.5 h of incubation at the non-permissive temperature, mutant cells exhibited either a short spindle or a dot of &#x003b1;-tubulin material. Following a longer incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, the mitotic spindle eventually disappeared, and after 5 h incubation at the non-permissive temperature almost no staining was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf563f4">4</xref>). These results indicate that Isy1p and Syf2p are required for maintenance of the mitotic spindle.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear migration phenotypes of <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells</title><p>In wild-type cells, nuclear migration takes place early in the cell cycle. Therefore, in large-budded cells the nucleus is almost always seen near, or extended through, the bud neck. This process of nuclear migration to the bud neck requires extranuclear microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c21">21</xref>). In tubulin mutants, the nucleus does not divide; moreover, some tubulin mutants also exhibit defects in nuclear migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c22">22</xref>). To test the effect of Isy1 and Syf2 on these tubulin-dependent events, we followed nuclear migration and nuclear division in <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; mutant and in wild-type cells. As we have shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf563f2">2</xref>C and D), the <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; strain accumulated large-budded cells when incubated at the non-permissive temperature. DAPI staining showed that more than 95&#x00025; of these cells contained one undivided nucleus. Under these conditions, a significant nuclear migration defect is observed: in 50&#x00025; of the arrested cells the nucleus is located away from the bud neck (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf563f5">5</xref>). This number may be an underestimate, as a very conservative classification limit was used: only cells in which the distance between the edge of the nucleus to the neck was at least 40&#x00025; of the diameter of the mother cells were classified as having a nucleus away from the neck. Similar defects, although less profound, can be seen in <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; cells incubated at the permissive temperature. This is in stark contrast to the wild-type control cells, in which more than 95&#x00025; of the large-budded cells had the nucleus localized to the bud neck (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf563f5">5</xref>B).

Such an accumulation was not seen in cells incubated at the permissive temperature, or in wild-type cells at either temperature. No pre-mRNA accumulation was seen using primers specific to the ribosomal gene <italic>RPL25</italic> (data not shown).

We therefore measured directly the levels of &#x003b1;-tubulin by immunoblotting. As a control we measured the amount of Vma5p, the c subunit of the vacuolar H (&#x0002b;) ATPase, which is also encoded by an intron-containing gene.

Cell cycle arrest is achieved by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex-dependent degradation of specific proteins. Sister chromatid separation requires proteolysis of Pds1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c25">25</xref>), whereas assembly of replication-competent complexes on origins (to ensure DNA replication in the next S-phase) requires degradation of B-type cyclins, such as Clb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c26">26</xref>). Recent work has shown that prevention of Pds1 degradation depends on the Mad1, Mad2, Mad3 and Bub1 checkpoint proteins, whereas the prevention of Clb2 proteolysis is mediated by Bub2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c27">27</xref>). Since mutations in genes encoding tubulin activate the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c28">28</xref>), we tested whether the inefficient splicing of <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> transcripts causes cell cycle arrest by activating this control mechanism.

However, a growing body of evidence has recently accumulated indicating that these processes may be connected. The <italic>CDC40&#x0002f;PRP17</italic> gene, for example, encodes a protein essential for G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c8">8</xref>), which also plays a role in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c31">31</xref>). Using synthetic lethal and two-hybrid screens we have previously identified a putative protein complex that genetically interacts with Cdc40p (i.e. CSC). The CSC contains proteins involved in both cell cycle progression and in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c13">13</xref>). Most of the genes encoding proteins of this complex are essential; however, the CSC also contains (at least) three proteins encoded by non-essential genes: <italic>ISY1</italic>, <italic>SYF2</italic> and <italic>NTC20</italic>. In this paper we have dissected the genetic relationships between these genes, which exhibit a complex set of interactions. While deletion of <italic>ISY1</italic> is lethal in the absence of <italic>NTC20</italic> and is temperature sensitive in combination with a deletion of <italic>SYF2</italic>, the <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>ntc20</italic>&#x00394; double mutant shows no viability or growth defect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf563f1">1</xref>).</p><p>The nature of the interactions observed between the CSC genes is still under investigation; currently the results could be interpreted in two alternative ways. (i) The three proteins could be part of one large complex with a role in both cell cycle progression and pre-mRNA splicing. The different gene interactions observed among the non-essential members of this complex could be due to different effects on the stability or function of the complex. For example, it is possible that for the protein complex to be fully stable&#x0002f;active, only the Isy1 protein is needed. In its absence, however, Ntc20p can provide some degree of stability, such that an <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; strain is only temperature sensitive, and not completely lethal. In contrast, Syf2p alone is insufficient for CSC stability and thus the <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>ntc20</italic>&#x00394; double mutant is inviable. (ii) An alternative view posits that the elaborate interactions observed are due to the existence of several alternative protein complexes with a similar core, each containing different non-essential proteins. These complexes may act redundantly or together as mediators that link splicing to cell cycle progression. For example, functional complexes may exist in the cell, some carrying Isy1p, some carrying Ntc20p. In the absence of both proteins, no active complex can be formed, and the cells die.</p><p>The nature of the connection between <italic>CDC40</italic> and the group of interacting proteins is still unclear. We were unable to detect physical or two-hybrid interactions between Cdc40p and any of the CSC proteins. Furthermore, protein complexes similar to the CSC have been recently purified biochemically from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c32">32</xref>) and <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c12">12</xref>). In neither case was Cdc40p found among the proteins isolated. On the other hand, in recent studies of a large-scale analysis of protein complexes of yeast, Cdc40p was identified in association with some (but not all) of the complexes precipitated with antibodies directed against members of the CSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c34">34</xref>). This may indicate that Cdc40p is loosely associated with some of the CSC components. Thus, Cdc40p may act alone, or in conjunction with other proteins, to affect the same cellular activity as the CSC. Alternatively, Cdc40 may associate transiently with the CSC, to facilitate the access or activity of other proteins. This process could also take place in the absence of Cdc40, provided Syf2 or Isy1 are functional.</p><p>When shifted to the restrictive temperature, the <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant cells arrest as large-budded cells with a short spindle. We isolated <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> cDNAs as suppressors of the cell cycle arrest of <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394;. RT&#x02013;PCR analysis showed that <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; cells incubated at the restrictive temperature accumulate <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> pre-mRNA at a higher level than other pre-mRNAs, indicating that the dependence on Isy1p and Syf2p for the removal of the <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> introns is specific. The <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> introns may contain unique features that make their pre-mRNA splicing highly dependent on the CSC. Dix <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c13">13</xref>) have previously shown that Isy1p is required <italic>in vivo</italic> for the splicing of introns carrying suboptimal consensus splicing sequences. The need for specific splicing factors for the efficient splicing of a subset of genes is a well known phenomenon. For example, the splicing factor Slu7 is required for the efficient splicing of introns in which the distance between the 3&#x02032;-splice site and the branch point is larger than 7 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c35">35</xref>). The fact that <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> cDNA support growth of <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; cells up to 35&#x000b0;C, but not at 37&#x000b0;C, indicates that under these conditions another transcript(s) becomes rate limiting. This putative transcript may contain introns that share some characteristics with those of <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic>.</p><p>Microtubules are ubiquitous cytoskeletal structures, consisting of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-tubulin hetrodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c36">36</xref>). In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, as in all eukaryotic cells, microtubules are necessary for chromosome movement. Unlike most other eukaryotes, however, in yeast the only other functions known to depend on microtubules are the movement of nuclei to the bud neck before mitosis and the fusion of nuclei after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c37">37</xref>). Most <italic>tub1</italic> and <italic>tub3</italic> mutants show several common phenotypes such as supersensitivity to spindle disrupting agents, accumulation of large-budded cells, and defects in nuclear division, nuclear migration or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c38">38</xref>). We have shown that the double mutant <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; cells exhibit similar phenotypes when incubated at non-permissive or semi-permissive conditions. The sensitivity to nocodazole, as well as the cell cycle arrest, could be fully suppressed by the presence of intronless &#x003b1;-tubulin cDNA, indicating that the phenotypes observed are truly due to lack of &#x003b1;-tubulin protein. Furthermore, the <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>ntc20</italic>&#x00394; strain, which grows well at all temperatures, was not sensitive to nocodazole (data not shown). These results strongly imply that the nocodazole sensitivity phenotype of <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; cells is connected to the cell cycle arrest phenotype.</p><p>The mechanism that links cell cycle progression and splicing exhibits an exquisite sensitivity to the level of pre-mRNA splicing. Our RT&#x02013;PCR results show a &#x0223c;3-fold increase in accumulation of <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> pre-mRNAs in <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; cells at the restrictive temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf563f6">6</xref>). Although splicing of the <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> transcripts is only reduced and not eliminated, a strong decrease in the levels of &#x003b1;-tubulin is seen. It is not yet clear why accumulation of unspliced transcripts has such a strong effect on the level of expression. Unspliced intermediates may exert their negative effect by affecting RNA stability or the efficiency of translation. Likewise, &#x003b1;-tubulin levels, as detected by immunoblot experiments, are strongly reduced; the protein, however, is not totally eliminated. It has been well established that the ratio between &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-tubulin is of crucial importance for microtubule stability in yeast. Microtubule function is sensitive to very small changes in tubulin stoichiometry. Several reports have demonstrated that gene dosages of &#x003b2;-tubulin in excess of &#x003b1;-tubulin, or overexpression of &#x003b2;-tubulin, are not tolerated and result in rapid depolymerization of normal microtubules and loss of viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c40">40</xref>). Thus, the small effect in splicing of the &#x003b1;-tubulin-encoding genes is amplified, resulting in a strong destabilization of the microtubules.</p><p>The spindle checkpoint of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> is able to sense a multitude of spindle defects and halt cell cycle progression before the exit from mitosis. The genes in this pathway are necessary for the cell cycle arrest phenotype observed in the presence of spindle-depolarizing drugs: spindle checkpoint mutants fail to arrest in the presence of benomyl or nocodazole (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf563f8">8</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c41">41</xref>). We have shown that the cell cycle arrest of <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; cells as a consequence of inefficient <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> splicing is not direct (i.e. the cells do not arrest with a short spindle simply because they are unable to elongate it in order to proceed in the cell cycle). Instead, the defect in microtubule structure is detected by the spindle checkpoint, which initiates a cascade of events leading to cell cycle arrest. In contrast to the <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; strain, the quadruple <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mad1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>bub2</italic>&#x00394; mutant (defective in the two branches of the spindle checkpoint) continues to divide at the non-permissive conditions in the presence of damaged spindles resulting in loss of viability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf563f8">8</xref>). Our results thus show that pre-mRNA splicing plays an important role in promoting the fidelity of chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression. While this work was in progress, Burns <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c42">42</xref>) reported that <italic>TUB1</italic> pre-mRNA splicing is also defective in temperature-sensitive <italic>cef1</italic> mutants. Similar to results presented here, <italic>TUB1</italic> cDNA could also suppress the cell cycle arrest of these mutants. These results further support our findings, since Cef1 is one of the components of the CSC. It is very likely that defects in <italic>CEF1</italic> lead to cell cycle arrest by activating the spindle checkpoint, as we have shown here for Isy1 and Syf2.</p><p>Maintaining genome stability is essential for all eukaryotes. The survival of cells and organisms requires accurate chromosomal segregation. The cell has developed several regulatory networks to maintain genome stability. Recent studies have identified some CSC components as important for sister chromatid separation and segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c43">43</xref>). Thus, one of the possible roles of the CSC could be to ensure proper chromosome segregation by linking pre-mRNA splicing to spindle integrity.</p><p>The mechanism unveiled here is probably evolutionarily conserved. Orthologs for most of the CSC proteins exist in other eukaryotes, and mutations in many splicing mutants in <italic>S.pombe</italic> cause cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c45">45</xref>). Interestingly, a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c45">45</xref>) has shown that mutations in some genes encoding splicing factors in <italic>S.pombe</italic> can lead to a reduction in &#x003b1;-tubulin levels and to defects in microtubule integrity. The splicing defects result in unequal chromosome separation and in polyploidy. These findings suggest that the link between pre-mRNA splicing and spindle integrity in both <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> may represent a common mechanism in eukaryotes.</p><p>Are all splicing factors required for maintaining the stability of the genome? As mentioned above, mutants defective in several components of the CSC cause cell cycle arrest by a similar mechanism. Cells lacking the Cdc40 protein also arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M transition upon the shift to the restrictive temperature. As in the case of <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394;, prolonged incubation at the restrictive conditions induces spindle depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c8">8</xref>). However, unlike the <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; strain, introduction of <italic>TUB1</italic> or <italic>TUB3</italic> cDNA does not suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of <italic>cdc40</italic>&#x00394; cells (data not shown). Furthermore, <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> pre-mRNA do not accumulate in the <italic>cdc40</italic>&#x00394; strain (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf563c46">46</xref>). These results suggest that the CSC and <italic>CDC40</italic> may be differentially required for the efficient splicing of two subsets of transcripts involved in cell cycle progression. Control of cell cycle progression via pre-mRNA splicing appears to be a complex process involving several regulatory pathways.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf563f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Genetic interactions between <italic>CDC40</italic>, <italic>ISY1</italic>, <italic>SYF2</italic> and <italic>NTC20</italic>.
