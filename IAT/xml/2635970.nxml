In addition, the mRNA-like domain of tmRNA encodes a peptide that tags polypeptides derived from stalled ribosomes for degradation. <italic>Streptomyces</italic> are unique bacteria that undergo a developmental cycle culminating at sporulation that is at least partly controlled at the level of translation elongation by the abundance of a rare tRNA that decodes UUA codons found in a relatively small number of open reading frames prompting us to examine the role of tmRNA in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>. Using a temperature sensitive replicon, we found that the <italic>ssrA</italic> gene could be disrupted only in cells with an extra-copy wild type gene but not in wild type cells or cells with an extra-copy mutant tmRNA (tmRNA<sup>DD</sup>) encoding a degradation-resistant tag. A cosmid-based gene replacement method that does not include a high temperature step enabled us to disrupt both the <italic>ssrA</italic> and <italic>smpB</italic> genes separately and at the same time suggesting that the tmRNA tagging system may be required for cell survival under high temperature. Indeed, mutant cells show growth and sporulation defects at high temperature and under optimal culture conditions. Interestingly, even though these defects can be completely restored by wild type genes, the <italic>&#x00394;ssrA</italic> strain was only partially corrected by tmRNA<sup>DD</sup>. In addition, wildtype tmRNA can restore the hygromycin-resistance to &#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> cells while tmRNA<sup>DD</sup> failed to do so suggesting that degradation of aberrant peptides is important for antibiotic resistance. Overall, these results suggest that the tmRNA tagging system plays important roles during <italic>Streptomyces</italic> growth and sporulation under both normal and stress conditions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In bacteria, stalled ribosomes can be released from mRNAs by the action of a specialized bifunctional RNA, called tmRNA, that acts as both an alanyl-tRNA and an mRNA encoding a short polypeptide tag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Karzai1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Wower1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

In <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae ssrA</italic> is essential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Huang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, in this organism viability is restored by expression of tmRNA encoding a tag with two C-terminal Ala residues changed to Asp. Since these substitutions alter residues critical for the recognition of tmRNA-tagged polypeptides by the Clp proteases it is thought that ribosome recycling is the essential function of tmRNA in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> whereas efficient degradation of tagged polypeptides is dispensable.</p><p>We undertook a study of <italic>ssrA</italic> function in <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> for several reasons. First, members of the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic> have unusually G&#x0002b;C-rich genomes (72&#x00025; in the case of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>) raising the possibility that some mRNAs may have significant secondary structure that might inhibit translation elongation. Second, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. undergo a developmental program when cultured on solid medium consisting of a substrate mycelial phase followed by the formation of aerial mycelia that septate to form spores. One of the genes required for the transition from substrate to aerial hyphae, <italic>bldA</italic>, encodes a tRNA that decodes the rare UUA codon and whose abundance is enhanced as cells enter stationary phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Leskiw1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Leskiw2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. UUA codons are present in restricted number of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> ORFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Li1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> including <italic>actII-ORF4</italic> controlling actinorhidin production (blue pigment) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-FernandezMoreno1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>redZ</italic> controlling undecylprodigiosin production (red pigment) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Guthrie1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, and <italic>adpA</italic> (<italic>bldH</italic>) controlling morphogenesis of aerial hyphae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Takano1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Since stalling of ribosomes at rare codons results in <italic>ssrA</italic>-mediated tagging in other organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Roche1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, it is reasonable to speculate that part of the mechanism of postranscriptional control of the abundance of proteins translated from UUA-containing mRNAs might involve tmRNA-mediated tagging and subsequent degradation of truncated polypeptides during vegetative growth when the <italic>bldA</italic>-encoded tRNA is scarce. Third, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. are used as hosts for the heterologous expression of foreign proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Anne1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Brawner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> whose mRNAs could be subject to various defects in translation efficiency that would limit the accumulation of recombinant proteins. The tmRNA-tagging system might therefore be exploited to pinpoint sites on target mRNAs prone to ribosome stalling as means of optimizing the performance of expression systems.</p><p>To explore the function of <italic>ssrA</italic> in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, we used a commonly employed strategy in which cells were transformed with a temperature sensitive replicon and then exposed to high temperature to lose the plasmid. We were able to obtain disruptions in the <italic>ssrA</italic> gene only in strains carrying an extra copy of the wild type gene at a different locus. However using a cosmid-based disruption method we obtained insertional mutants of not only the <italic>ssrA</italic> gene, but also <italic>smpB</italic> gene and both genes simultaneously. We find that &#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>smpB</italic> strains show apparent growth and sporulation defects at 30&#x000b0;C that were enhanced at 39&#x000b0;C. The slow growth phenotype and profound high-temperature sporulation defect in the <italic>&#x00394;ssrA</italic> strain explain why we were unable to recover mutants using the temperature sensitive plasmid. In addition, &#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>smpB</italic> mutants are much more sensitive to hygromycin than wild type strain. Expression of a modified tmRNA encoding a degradation-resistant tag only partially restored high-temperature growth and sporulation in &#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> strains but not hygromycin resistance suggesting that promoting the degradation of tagged proteins is an important role for tmRNA in cells challenged with a translation inhibitor. While this work was in progress a similar set of experiments investigating the role of tmRNA in the closely allied species <italic>S. lividans</italic> was published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Braud1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

To detect these products, polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits using a synthetic peptide immunogen corresponding to the C-terminal ten amino acids of the mutant tag with an N-terminal Cys residue to facilitate chemical crosslinking (NH<sub>3</sub>-CSSQQAFALDD-COOH). The antiserum was capable of detecting GFP tagged with a similar tag based on the sequence of <italic>E. coli ssrA</italic> (AANDENYALDD-COOH; data not shown) suggesting that the C-terminal four amino acids (ALDD-COOH) of the tag is enough for the recognition by these antibodies.</p><p>Western blotting with affinity-purified antibody revealed that lysates of wild type cells lacking the mutant <italic>ssrA-DD</italic> tmRNA displayed very little cross-reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004459-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Tagged proteins were readily detected in cells with a single integrated copy of the mutant <italic>ssrA-DD</italic> expressed from its own promoter. A similar pattern of tagged proteins, but with a much more intense signal, was detected in cells in which mutant tmRNA was overexpressed from a multi-copy plasmid. The fact that tagging by the mutant tmRNA can be readily detected even in the presence of the wild type <italic>ssrA</italic> gene suggests that the mutant tmRNA is at least competent to compete with its wild type counterpart for ribosome recycling. As a further test of the function of the mutant <italic>ssrA-DD</italic> construct we also expressed it in <italic>S. lividans</italic> 66, whose tmRNA sequence is identical. In a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Braud1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> tagging by a similarly modified tmRNA was detectable only when the tmRNA was overexpressed along with a model tmRNA target protein in an <italic>&#x00394;ssrA</italic> background. In contrast, we were able to easily detect tagging of endogenous proteins in <italic>S. lividans</italic> even in a wild type background with an intact wild type <italic>ssrA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004459-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Influence of <italic>bldA</italic> on tmRNA tagging</title><p>UUA codons decoded by the Leu-tRNA<sup>UUA</sup> derived fromn the <italic>bldA</italic> gene occur rarely in the G&#x0002b;C-rich <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> genome. Because ribosome stalling at rare codons is known to elicit tmRNA tagging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Roche1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> we reasoned that a strain lacking the <italic>bldA</italic>-encoded tRNA might display an altered pattern of tagged proteins in the presence of the <italic>ssrA-DD</italic> allele. We first determined that overexpression of mutant tmRNA did not alter the phenotype (delayed pigment formation and absence of aerial mycelia and spores) of the &#x00394;<italic>bldA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004459-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

Thus the tmRNA tagging system may intersect with <italic>bldA</italic>-controlled regulatory pathways to coordinate <italic>Streptomyces</italic> development.

In agreement with the temporal control of the regulatory tRNA, accumulation of GFP expressed from a UUA-containing mRNA is delayed during early differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Kataoka1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. When <italic>bldA</italic>-encoded tRNA level is low, stalled ribosomes on UUA-containing mRNA may be targeted by the tmRNA system leading to degradation of prematurely terminated polypeptides and degradation of corresponding mRNA. In line with this idea, recent analyses of both the proteome and transcriptome in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> provides evidence that levels of some UUA-containing mRNAs are reduced in the absence of <italic>bldA</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Hesketh1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Although we uniquely detected a few proteins that are tagged in &#x00394;<italic>bldA</italic> cells, we have no evidence that these specific are translated from UUA containing mRNAs. They may simply arise from the translation of mRNAs that are upregulated in &#x00394;<italic>bldA</italic> and which are subject to tagging for other reasons.</p><p>UUA codons are found in many mRNAs encoding proteins involved in the regulation of antibiotic synthesis and cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004459-Chandra1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. These include the mRNAs transcribed from the <italic>actII-ORF4</italic> and <italic>redZ</italic> genes encoding proteins that regulate the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the two antibiotics conferring blue and red pigmentation in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> colonies, and the <italic>adpA</italic> genes needed for normal morphological development. It is possible that dynamic competition between the tmRNA tagging system and the <italic>bldA</italic> tRNA for ribosomes stalled at UUA codons contributes to post-transcritional regulation of the expression of rare-codon containing genes. If so, we would predict that elimination of tmRNA would favor accumulation of some regulatory proteins and their corresponding mRNAs even when <italic>bldA</italic> tRNA is low potentially accelerating pigment accumulation and transition from vegetative to sporulative growth. By extension, tmRNA overexpression might be predicted to delay these processes. In contrast to these predictions, we see a delay in development and pigmentation when tmRNA is eliminated and no discernable phenotype when tmRNA is over-expressed. Reduction of ribosome recycling in the &#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> mutant may only marginally alter the production of efficiently translated, high abundance proteins, while severely impacting the accumulation of low abundance proteins, including regulatory proteins translated from mRNAs containing rare codons, and thereby contribute to the defects we observed.
