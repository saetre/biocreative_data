Its deficiency causes Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS), and about half the patients with ABS have ambiguous genitalia and/or impaired steroidogenesis. POR mRNA expression is up-regulated when mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiate into steroidogenic cells, suggesting that the regulation of POR gene expression is important for steroidogenesis. In this context we examined the regulation of POR expression in ovarian granulosa cells by gonadotropins, and its possible role in steroidogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Changes in gene expression in MSCs during differentiation into steroidogenic cells were examined by DNA microarray analysis. Changes in mRNA and protein expression of POR in the rat ovary or in granulosa cells induced by gonadotropin treatment were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Effects of transient expression of wild-type or mutant (R457H or V492E) POR proteins on the production of estrone in COS-7 cells were examined in vitro. Effects of POR knockdown were also examined in estrogen producing cell-line, KGN cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>POR mRNA was induced in MSCs following transduction with the SF-1 retrovirus, and was further increased by cAMP treatment. Expression of POR mRNA, as well as Cyp19 mRNA, in the rat ovary were induced by equine chorionic gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin. POR mRNA and protein were also induced by follicle stimulating hormone in primary cultured rat granulosa cells, and the induction pattern was similar to that for aromatase. Transient expression of POR in COS-7 cells, which expressed a constant amount of aromatase protein, greatly increased the rate of conversion of androstenedione to estrone, in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of mutant POR proteins (R457H or V492E), such as those found in ABS patients, had much less effect on aromatase activity than expression of wild-type POR proteins. Knockdown of endogenous POR protein in KGN human granulosa cells led to reduced estrone production, indicating that endogenous POR affected aromatase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrated that the expression of POR, together with that of aromatase, was regulated by gonadotropins, and that its induction could up-regulate aromatase activity in the ovary, resulting in a coordinated increase in estrogen production.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The ovary is one of the major steroidogenic organs, and ovarian follicular development is initiated by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) secreted by the pituitary gland. FSH-induced follicular development involves granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. FSH induces steroidogenic enzymes in ovarian granulosa cells leading to the production of steroid hormones, including estrogens. P450 aromatase (CYP19) is one of the steroidogenic enzymes regulated by FSH, and catalyzes the biosynthesis of estrogens from C19 steroids in the granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is an 82-kDa membrane-bound flavoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] responsible for the transfer of electrons from nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and finally to microsomal P450 enzymes, including aromatase, as well as to several non-P450 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Several clinical studies have reported that mutations in POR are sufficient to cause Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS), which is characterized by skeletal malformations. In some cases, ABS patients have genital ambiguity, and in some of the cases female ABS patients present with polycystic ovary syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The clinical features are primarily explained by the impaired activities of CYP21A2, CYP17A1, and CYP19 involved in steroidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are defined as pluripotent cells, and have been shown to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and hematopoietic-supporting stroma, both in vivo and ex vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We recently reported that stable transfection of MSCs with the transcription factor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), followed by treatment with cAMP, led to their conversion into steroidogenic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These cells offer a possible clinical source of stem cells for the treatment of diseases of steroidogenic organs, and represent a powerful tool for studying the differentiation of the steroidogenic lineage.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the changes in gene expression in MSCs during differentiation into steroidogenic cells. POR gene expression, as well as that of various steroidogenic enzymes, was induced by SF-1 and cAMP. It was also induced by gonadotropins in rat ovary and granulosa cells. We also examined the effects of wild-type and mutant POR expression on aromatase activity, and the effects of knockdown of endogenous POR in mammalian cell lines. Our results suggest that up-regulation of POR expression by gonadotropins, as well as that of aromatase, could enhance ovarian estrogen synthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Diethylstilbestrol (DES), 8-bromoadenosine 3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), and gentamicin were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Ovarian POR mRNA was detected at relatively low levels before gonadotropin treatment. It was induced after 48 h of eCG treatment, and was further increased within 2 h of the following hCG treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

Cyp19 mRNA and protein were barely detectable before FSH treatment.

Consistent with the results from MSCs, POR was induced in the ovary and granulosa cells when they were stimulated to differentiate into steroidogenic cells by gonadotropins. Induction of Cyp19 protein by FSH causes ovarian estrogen synthesis and follicle maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

In order to investigate aromatase enzyme activity, we measured the conversion of androstenedione to estrone in the culture medium. Estrone levels were low and were unaffected by co-transfection with both control vectors, or with the POR expression vector alone. However, time-dependent accumulation of estrone occurred when aromatase was expressed, and estrone levels were further increased by co-transfection with the POR expression vector. Co-transfection with the aromatase expression vector and 100 ng of the POR expression vector resulted in a 6-fold increase in the amount of estrone converted in 6 h, compared with the aromatase vector alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These results suggest that estrogen synthesis is up-regulated by increasing levels of POR expression, even when aromatase expression is constant.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Production of estrone by co-transfection of wild-type or mutant POR and aromatase expression vectors in COS-7 cells</bold>.

In COS-7 cells co-transfected with R457H or V492E mutant POR and aromatase expression vectors, the amount of estrone was reduced to 25% compared to co-transfection with wild-type POR and aromatase. These estrone levels were similar to those seen when aromatase was expressed alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).

These cells offer a possible clinical source of stem cells for the treatment of diseases of steroidogenic organs, and represent a powerful tool for studying the differentiation of the steroidogenic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In this study, using DNA microarray, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR analysis, we observed that POR mRNA was induced during the differentiation of hMSCs into steroidogenic cells. We also demonstrated that the expression of the POR mRNA and protein were up-regulated by FSH during the differentiation of rat granulosa cells into steroidogenic cells. Similar phenomena have been observed in adrenocortical cell lines stimulated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These results suggest that POR expression in steroidogenic cells is regulated by the pituitary hormone/cAMP pathway. In contrast, it has been reported that POR gene expression in hepatic cells and other organs was not changed by any stimuli, including cAMP, and in support of these observations, the promoter region of the POR gene supported constitutively high luciferase activity that was unaffected by any stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These results suggest that regulation of POR gene expression differs between steroidogenic and non-steroidogenic cells. Although the reasons for this difference remain unclear, the expression of SF-1 in steroidogenic cells may explain this phenomenon. SF-1 is expressed in steroidogenic cells such as adrenocortical cells, testicular Leydig cells, ovarian theca and granulosa cells, and regulates steroidogenic genes that encode cytochrome P450scc, StAR and CYP19, by binding to cAMP-response sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our results from MSCs indicate that the POR gene could represent a new target for SF-1 in steroidogenic cells. It is therefore conceivable that the expression of POR is regulated by the pituitary hormone/cAMP pathway. Such regulations may also cause similar fluctuations in POR and CYP19 expression in the ovary and in granulosa cells. However, CYP19 mRNA was induced more rapidly than POR mRNA, because the CYP19 gene is regulated by CREB, as well as by SF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. On the other hand, our preliminary study indicated that CREB was not involved in the induction of POR mRNA in granulosa cells by FSH (data not shown). The POR gene spans more than 70 kb, including an untranslated first exon residing about 38.8 kb upstream of the coding region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms regulating POR gene expression.</p><p>Based on our observations in rat ovary and in granulosa cells stimulated by gonadotropins, it is likely that increasing POR expression induced by gonadotropins further up-regulates aromatase activity, and that estrogen production is regulated not only by aromatase expression, but also by POR. This proposition is supported by the augmentation of aromatase activity coincident with increasing POR expression in COS-7 cells, despite a constant expression of aromatase. Hall and his colleagues, using purified enzymes, also reported that the activity of CYP17 was increased by the addition of POR protein in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in increased androgen production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Because almost all steroidogenic enzymes are up-regulated by the pituitary hormone/cAMP pathway, our model should be applicable to other microsomal steroidogenic P450s, such as CYP17 and CYP21. In support of this hypothesis, CYP17 expression was markedly increased, together with POR, in SF-1-transduced MSCs. Similarly, the expression of ferredoxin, which is a member of the electron transport chain in mitochondria and regulates pregnenolone production by P450scc, is known to be increased by pituitary hormones and cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that, in addition to steroidogenic enzyme expression, up-regulation of electron transporter expression plays a vital role in steroid hormone production by gonadotropins and ACTH. This mechanism should be conserved between mitochondrial and microsomal steroidogenesis.</p><p>In COS-7 cells, a low level of estrone was detected in the culture medium in the absence of transfection of CYP19, even though aromatase proteins were not detected by western blotting. COS cells (COS-1 and COS-7) have often been used for measuring aromatase activity by ectopic expression of the CYP19 gene, and low aromatase activities have been reported under non-transfected conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. It is thus conceivable that aromatase proteins are expressed at very low levels in this cell line. It has been reported that the R457H and V492E POR mutations are associated with loss of P450 enzyme activities, because these mutations in the FAD domain hamper the ability of POR to transfer electrons to its FMN group, which ultimately provides electrons to P450 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. When these mutants were expressed concomitantly with aromatase in COS-7 cells, estrone production was similar to that seen with aromatase alone. This result indicates that the augmentation of aromatase activity by POR is not a side effect of overexpression of POR, but is due to the increased electron supply resulting from increased POR expression in COS-7 cells.</p><p>FSH, forskolin, and cAMP have been reported to cause increases in aromatase activity in KGN cells (a human ovarian granulosa-like tumor cell line), as well as in rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In contrast, POR expression in KGN cells was little changed by 8-Br-cAMP treatment, and was much higher than in primary cultures of rat granulosa cells. In addition, it has been reported that the lower amount of POR protein, compared with the amount of P450 protein, was still sufficient to carry out all metabolic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Hence, the amount of POR expression after inhibition by siRNA, still seemed to be sufficient to activate aromatase induced by 8-Br-cAMP. Therefore, estrone production should not be greatly reduced by POR siRNA. POR is involved not only in steroidogenesis, but also in drug and xenobiotic metabolism, and in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. It is likely that the hormone-responsiveness of the POR gene is lost during immortalization of KGN cells. However, induction of POR in granulosa cells may play a more significant role in estrogen production, because the amount of POR protein in these cells is limited. In granulosa cells, POR and aromatase expression are regulated by gonadotropins, which in turn may be responsible for coordinated regulation of steroid hormone production at each stage of follicular growth.</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that estrogen production was caused not only by aromatase expression, but also through the promotion of aromatase activity by FSH-induced POR expression in ovarian granulosa cells. POR knockout mice are embryonically lethal, but POR heterozygous knockout mice are fertile, and do not have ambiguous genitalia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Our study suggests that a comparison of ovarian function and morphology between POR heterozygous knockout mice and aromatase knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] could provide further useful information. In addition, POR might be involved in the differentiation of these steroidogenic organs through activation of microsomal P450 enzymes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YI performed all experiments with following coauthors helps.
