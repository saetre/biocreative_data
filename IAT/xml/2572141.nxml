Viruses have developed various mechanisms to counteract this response. So far, the interferon antagonistic activity of influenza A viruses was mainly observed on the level of IFN&#x003b2; gene induction via action of the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1). Here we present data indicating that influenza A viruses not only suppress IFN&#x003b2; gene induction but also inhibit type I IFN signaling through a mechanism involving induction of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) protein. Our study was based on the observation that in cells that were infected with influenza A virus and subsequently stimulated with IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 (STAT1) was strongly reduced. This impaired STAT1 activation was not due to the action of viral proteins but rather appeared to be induced by accumulation of viral 5&#x02032; triphosphate RNA in the cell. SOCS proteins are potent endogenous inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling. Closer examination revealed that SOCS-3 but not SOCS-1 mRNA levels increase in an RNA- and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B)-dependent but type I IFN-independent manner early in the viral replication cycle. This direct viral induction of SOCS-3 mRNA and protein expression appears to be relevant for suppression of the antiviral response since in SOCS-3 deficient cells a sustained phosphorylation of STAT1 correlated with elevated expression of type I IFN-dependent genes. As a consequence, progeny virus titers were reduced in SOCS-3 deficient cells or in cells were SOCS-3 expression was knocked-down by siRNA. These data provide the first evidence that influenza A viruses suppress type I IFN signaling on the level of JAK/STAT activation. The inhibitory effect is at least in part due to the induction of SOCS-3 gene expression, which results in an impaired antiviral response.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The type I interferon (IFN) system is one of the most powerful innate defenses against viral pathogens. Most RNA viruses are sensitive to the action of type I IFN. Therefore, these pathogens have evolved strategies to evade this response. For example, influenza viruses express a viral protein, the non-structural protein 1 (NS1), that suppresses production of IFN&#x003b2; by lowering cellular sensitivity to viral nucleic acid as a pathogen pattern. Here we present data indicating that influenza A viruses are not only capable of suppressing production of the IFN&#x003b2; gene but also inhibit action of this antiviral cytokine on cells. This occurs by viral induction of a cellular protein, the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3, a potent endogenous inhibitor of IFN signaling. This is a novel mechanism by which influenza viruses inhibit the antiviral response of the host and paves the path to efficient virus replication. This may be especially relevant for influenza viruses that induce high cytokine responses (cytokine burst), such as highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype. Induction of SOCS-3 expression would allow efficient replication despite high IFN and cytokine levels.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A viruses are negative-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the family of orthomyxoviruses.

Therefore, we analyzed whether STAT phosphorylation patterns are altered in influenza A virus infected cells that were stimulated with IFN at different time points post infection (p.i.). The human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 was infected with the influenza A virus strain A/Puerto-Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells were subsequently stimulated with IFN&#x003b2; at given time-points p.i. and STAT phosphorylation was assessed in Western blots. Both STAT1 and STAT2 were readily phosphorylated upon cytokine stimulation in uninfected cells or in infected cells up to 4 h p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, virus infection alone resulted in a significant induction of STAT phosphorylation 4&#x02013;6 h p.i., presumably caused by virus-induced IFN expression. However, at later time points (6&#x02013;10 h p.i.), in A549 cells both virus- and IFN-induced STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation was markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar patterns were observed upon stimulation of cells with IFN&#x003b1; or upon infection with other viruses, such as the human influenza virus A/Victora/3/75 (H3N2) (data not shown). In addition, this phenomenon could also be detected in other epithelial cells such as the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) or the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000196.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).

Accordingly, a gradual increase of STAT1 phosphorylation was observed that was similar in both infected and uninfected cells, albeit starting from different basal levels of phospho-STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g003">Figures 3A and B</xref>). This is illustrated by an almost identical slope of the regression line in the graphical analysis of the band intensities of the IFN&#x003b2; stimulated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). If the blockade of IFN&#x003b2;-induced STAT1 phosphorylation would be mediated by specific virus-activated phosphatases, a much steeper slope for vanadate-treated infected cells would be expected. However, the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g003">Figure 3B</xref> indicates that the virus-induced suppression of phosphorylation is not compensated by phosphatase inhibition and consequently no virus-activated phosphatase appears to be involved. In support of these data, phosphatase assays revealed that the overall activity of tyrosine phosphatases in infected cells was not elevated compared to uninfected cells. This is indicated by constant levels of free phosphates released from two different phospho-peptides that represent common tyrosine phosphatase substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, involvement of phosphatases in influenza virus-induced alteration of STAT1 phosphorylation can be greatly ruled out.</p><fig id="ppat-1000196-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000196.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Phosphatases do not mediate inhibition of IFN&#x003b2;-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in infected cells.</title><p>(A) Vero cells were infected for 10 h with PR8 (MOI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5) or left uninfected.

Both cell types showed no phosphorylation of STAT1 in the uninfected state. In contrast, infection of SOCS-3 knock out cells resulted in strongly elevated phosphorylation of STAT1 in a sustained fashion. To rule out that this STAT1 phosphorylation is due to altered secretion of IFN&#x003b2; or other STAT1-activating cytokines in SOCS-3 deficient cells, we performed conditioned medium experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).

Influenza virus propagation is sensitive to IFN activities and therefore, like other viral pathogens, these viruses do not only induce type I IFN but also antagonize the production and effects of these cytokines at the same time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-GarciaSastre1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. For influenza A and B viruses, this is accomplished through their non-structural NS1 proteins that are structurally related polypeptides of 26 kDa (A/NS1) and 32 kDa (B/NS1), which are abundantly expressed in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-GarciaSastre1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. NS1 proteins predominantly act on the level of IFN gene induction in infected cells by obstructing RIG-I-dependent signaling through interaction with cellular factor(s) and/or sequestration of RNAs generated during virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Opitz1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Mibayashi1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Guo1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here we present data, showing that RNA-induced expression of SOCS-3 in early phases of infection leads to a functional inhibition of IFN-induced STAT activation and gene expression. This is a novel mechanism by which influenza virus suppresses the antiviral response of the host and paves the path to efficient virus replication.</p><p>While it was reported in the literature that expression of SOCS proteins can be induced upon stimulation with IFN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Alexander1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref> we could not detect any significant gene induction by IFN&#x003b2; in A549 cells. Instead we observed a significant up-regulation of SOCS-3 by viral 5&#x02032; triphosphate RNA, indicating that gene induction occurs via accumulation of vRNA during infection. This appears to occur through the RNA-mediated activation of the IKK/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, most likely activated through engagement of the RNA sensor RIG-I. At a first sight, this might appear controversial since NF-&#x003ba;B activation is among the RIG-I-induced signaling responses and NS1 was reported to inhibit this signaling pathway. However, despite the action of NS1 it is well known that NF-&#x003ba;B is still significantly activated upon influenza virus infection and many NF-&#x003ba;B and IFN&#x003b2; dependent genes are still expressed. We hypothesized previously that the incomplete inhibition conferred by NS1 is an indication that the virus exploits the remaining signaling activities for efficient replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Wurzer1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Ludwig2">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Ludwig3">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. The findings described here, namely NF-&#x003ba;B dependent induction of SOCS-3 and limitation of type I IFN signaling responses, provide yet another example how influenza viruses take advantage of NF-&#x003ba;B activity.</p><p>While the data show that NF-&#x003ba;B is required for viral SOCS-3 induction, the factor appears not to be sufficient, since prototype inducers of NF-&#x003ba;B, such as IL-1&#x003b2; or TNF-&#x003b1; would not induce SOCS-3. Thus there seems to be the need of additional virus or RNA-induced transcription factors. The most likely candidate would be the constitutively expressed interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), that is known to be simultaneously activated with NF-&#x003ba;B upon virus infection directly via the RIG-I RNA sensing pathway without the need of type I IFN. Furthermore IRF-3 is a factor suppressed by the NS1 protein.</p><p>Recently it was reported that IFN-induced gene expression responses are potentiated in cells, which lack the NF-&#x003ba;B factors p50 or p65 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Wei1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Although these authors described an inhibitory binding of NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors to some IFN-induced gene, this mechanism might be cell type dependent since we could not observe similar effects in the cell types used here (data not shown). Thus, the underlying molecular mechanisms appear to be not fully clear. It is striking that the effects described for p50 and p65 knock out cells in these studies fully correlate with our observations in SOCS-3 deficient cells. While in the latter case cells lack the IFN&#x003b2; signaling inhibitor SOCS-3, the p50 and p65 knock out cells are deficient for the factors required for SOCS-3 induction. Thus, given the NF-&#x003ba;B dependent induction of SOCS-3 described in the present manuscript, we provide an additional molecular mechanism that may explain the phenomenon described by Wei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Wei1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>First indications for beneficial effects of SOCS-3 gene expression on viral replication came from studies using the HCV core protein as a replacement for the influenza A viral NS1 in the context of infections with a NS1 deficient influenza virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Bode1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the hallmark responses of HCV core expression is a rapid induction of SOCS-3 expression. Given the role of SOCS-3 described here, it was not surprising that HCV core could partially rescue growth of the NS1 deficient virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Bode1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While this manuscript was in preparation it was demonstrated by Pothlichet et al. that influenza A virus-induced SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 upregulation requires a TLR-3-independent, RIG-I/MAVS-dependent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Pothlichet1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, over-expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in infected cells revealed that both molecules inhibit antiviral responses. These studies are perfectly complemented by our findings. Here we confirm involvement of RIG-I/MAVS by showing that 5&#x02032; triphosphate RNA, the ligand for RIG-I, is a major inducer of SOCS-3. Furthermore, the finding that dsRNA is only a weak inducer of SOCS-3 is also consistent with the independence from the dsRNA sensor TLR-3. The only discrepancy of this work and the study of Pothlichet et al. is that they show a dependence on the type I IFN receptor. This may be due to the different virus-strains and cell types used. It is well known that the capability of type I IFNs to induce SOCS proteins is strongly cell type specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Yokota1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. While in some cell types SOCS-3 expression appears to be type I IFN dependent (e.g. fetal liver cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Yokota1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> it is clearly independent of IFN in other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000196-Kovarik1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>.

Evidence that cell type specificities may be the cause of discrepancy is additionally provided by the fact that Pothlichet et al. show identical induction kinetics of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3. In contrast the kinetics of the two proteins differ clearly in the cells we used, with SOCS-3 being induced much earlier than SOCS-1 on mRNA and protein level.</p><p>Finally, it should be stated that regardless whether SOCS-3 is additionally induced by type I IFNs at a later stage of infection, it is important that it can be induced earlier and in parallel to IFN&#x003b2; directly by vRNA accumulation. This is supported by the finding that IFN&#x003b2; and SOCS-3 induction occurs in parallel kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>) while IFN-induced genes such as OAS1 and MxA are only up-regulated later in a delayed and more sustained fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000196-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This makes a qualitative difference since the blocking effect of SOCS-3 on IFN&#x003b2; signaling already kicks-in during the first wave of IFN&#x003b2; action.</p><p>Taken together we describe here for the first time that at least some influenza A virus strains are able to suppress type I IFN signaling by a mechanism involving NF-&#x003ba;B dependent activation of SOCS-3 expression, which negatively affects STAT phosphorylation.
