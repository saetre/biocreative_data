To evaluate the mechanisms responsible, gene targeting was used to study long-distance gene regulation. Remarkably, these targeted cell lines lost the translocated chromosome (t(11;14)). In these MCL and MM cells, the nonrearranged <italic>cyclin D1</italic> (<italic>CCND1</italic>) locus reverts from CpG hypomethylated to hypermethylated. Reintroduction of the translocated chromosome induced a loss of methylation at the unrearranged <italic>CCND1</italic> locus, providing evidence of a transallelic regulatory effect. In these cell lines and primary MCL patient samples, the <italic>CCND1</italic> loci are packaged in chromatin-containing CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) and nucleophosmin (NPM) at the nucleolus. We show that CTCF and NPM are bound at the IgH 3&#x02032; regulatory elements only in the t(11;14) MCL cell lines. Furthermore, NPM short hairpin RNA produces a specific growth arrest in these cells. Our data demonstrate transvection in human cancer and suggest a functional role for CTCF and NPM.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>cyclin D1</italic>; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CTCF, CCCTC binding factor; FISH, fluorescent in situ hybridization; immunoFISH, immunofluorescent FISH; LCL, lymphocyte cell line; LCR, locus control region; MCL, mantle cell lymphoma; MM, multiple myeloma; MSP, methylation-specific PCR; MTC, major translocation cluster; NPM, nucleophosmin; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; TUNEL, Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling.</p></fn><fn><p>H.

These translocations serve to juxtapose IgH regulatory elements, such as the intronic enhancer (E&#x003bc;;1) or 3&#x02032; C&#x003b1; locus control region (LCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), that deregulate transcription of target genes over several hundred kilobases of DNA. The mechanisms involved in long-distance deregulation of target genes by IgH regulatory elements are unknown; however, regulatory elements in the IgH locus are thought to derepress or increase the transcription of target genes such as <italic>CMYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) and <italic>cyclin D1</italic> (<italic>CCND1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) that are involved in B cell malignancies. Epigenetic changes in chromatin structure involving DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) and/or histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) have been implicated in deregulated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>The activation of the <italic>CCND1</italic> gene that occurs in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and a subset of MM was used as a model system to investigate the mechanisms responsible for long-distance gene deregulation in B cell malignancies (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Cyclin D1 is not expressed in normal lymphocytes, where the unlinked family members cyclin D2 and/or D3 are active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In B cell malignancies, cyclin D1 gene expression is activated by the insertion or translocation of IgH regulatory elements, such as the E&#x003bc; intronic or 3&#x02032; C&#x003b1; enhancer/LCR, that can be as far as 100&#x02013;300 kb away from the <italic>CCND1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). The majority of the breakpoints in MCL map to the major translocation cluster (MTC) region located &#x0223c;120 kb upstream (centromeric) of the <italic>CCND1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). The nearest gene to <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>MyeOV</italic>, is located 360 kb centromeric to <italic>CCND1</italic> and is expressed in a subset of t(11;14) MM, but not in MCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Although translocations involving the t(11;14) are most common, the MM cell line U266 contains an insertion of IgH regulatory sequences &#x0223c;10 kb centromeric of the <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter contains a CpG island that can be potentially regulated by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We have found that in normal B cells the <italic>CCND1</italic> locus is organized into hypomethylated DNA bound by acetylated nucleosomes. Analysis of the <italic>CCND1</italic> DNA methylation status in MM and MCL cell lines with t(11;14) indicates that the deregulated as well as the normal, silent <italic>CCND1</italic> loci are CpG hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>Control of DNA methylation in mammalian cells has been shown to involve a cis-acting mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). However, observations in higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), the fungus <italic>Ascobolus immerses</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), and more recently in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) demonstrated that DNA methylation can also be regulated in trans by interactions between homologous chromosomes.</p><p>A ubiquitous, complex protein that has emerged as a critical mediator of multiple epigenetic processes is the zinc finger protein CCCTC binding factor (CTCF). CTCF is a highly conserved, 11 zinc finger protein first identified as a c-myc binding factor and subsequently shown to bind to metazoan regulatory elements known as insulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Insulator elements, which act from an intervening position to prevent flanking cis-acting elements from interacting, mediate their function through CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Furthermore, the binding of CTCF to insulator elements is blocked by CpG methylation, allowing interactions between distal regulatory elements in the imprinted <italic>Igf2/H19</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Recent evidence has identified the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM) as a major CTCF-interacting protein that functions to tether promoters and regulatory elements separated by large linear distances together at the nucleolar periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the mechanisms of long-distance activation of the <italic>CCND1</italic> gene by the IgH enhancer/LCR, homologous recombination was used to target regulatory regions potentially involved in cyclin D1 deregulation. Recombinants that lost the translocated chromosome also lost the ability to maintain hypomethylation at the normal <italic>CCND1</italic> allele. These clones no longer expressed cyclin D1. These findings suggest that the translocated chromosome exerts a long-distance cis DNA hypomethylating effect on the linked <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter as well as a transallelic effect on the unlinked <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter on the homologous chromosome. Thus, in the absence of the translocated chromosome, the unrearranged <italic>CCND1</italic> locus is densely DNA methylated. CTCF and NPM are associated with both the translocated and unrearranged <italic>CCND1</italic> loci in cell lines with t(11;14). Interestingly, binding of these proteins at the unrearranged <italic>CCND1</italic> locus is dependent on the presence of the translocated allele. These results provide further evidence that long-distance control of DNA methylation in mammalian cells can be communicated in trans, and demonstrate a novel mechanism for chromosome structure and nuclear organization to participate in deregulated gene expression in human malignancy.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>B cell lines that have lost the t(11;14) translocation do not express cyclin D1 and have altered DNA methylation patterns at the unrearranged <italic>CCND1</italic> locus</title><p>A gene targeting strategy was designed to study regulatory regions involved in cyclin D1 deregulation in human B cell malignancies. Our initial approach was to target the potential regulatory regions involved in long-distance cyclin D1 deregulation in B cell malignancies. By analogy, results in the &#x003b2;-globin locus demonstrated that insertion of a selectable marker gene into the &#x003b2;-globin LCR abrogated transcription of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Two gene targeting vectors (TV1 and 2; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) were constructed and electroporated into two MCL cell lines, Granta 519 (Granta [G]) and NCEB-1 (NCEB [N]), and the MM cell line U266 (U), all of which express cyclin D1. The initial Southern blot analysis was consistent with successful gene targeting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>); however, subsequent analyses showed instability and loss of the targeted/translocated chromosomes. Additional clones were isolated using TV1 in NCEB (N1&#x02013;3) cells, and TV2 in U266 (LU clones) and Granta (LG clones) cells. Southern blot analysis using cell line&#x02013;specific translocation breakpoint probes (P519 for Granta and MTC for NCEB) demonstrated the absence of translocated chromosome breakpoint sequences in the mutant MCL cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis demonstrated that the translocated chromosomes had been lost in all of these clones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>; and Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072102/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072102/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Derivative MCL and MM cell lines have lost t(11;14).</bold> (A) Maps of the 11q13 and 14q32 regions with the locations of the gene targeting events.

However, the derivative MCL cell lines, which had lost t(11;14), did not express cyclin D1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Instead, up-regulation of cyclin D3 mRNA (not depicted) and protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) levels was observed, presumably to compensate for the loss of cyclin D1 that has been observed in other experimental cell culture and animal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of D-type cyclin protein levels in parental and mutant clones.</bold> (A) IP Western blot analysis of cyclin D1 protein in parental and mutant NCEB and Granta MCL cell lines.

The activation of the cyclin D1 gene by IgH regulatory elements was found to correlate with the absence of DNA methylation at the <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter. Interestingly, this domain of hypomethylated DNA appears to be present not only on the translocated but also on the untranslocated allele. Normal B cells and EBV lymphocytes also displayed extensive DNA hypomethylation and hyperacetylation of histones at the <italic>CCND1</italic> loci, although the <italic>CCND1</italic> gene is not expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Hypomethylation up to 90 kb upstream of the <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter was eliminated with loss of the translocated chromosome initiated through a gene targeting event.</p><p>Somatic cell hybrid fusions indicated that reintroduction of the translocated chromosome but not a nontranslocated chromosome was capable of transhypomethylating a densely methylated <italic>CCND1</italic> locus. The Granta cells used in the fusion experiments that reintroduced the t(11;14) chromosome into N1 cells also contained a nontranslocated <italic>CCND1</italic> locus that possessed the identical cyclin D1 polymorphism as the translocated <italic>CCND1</italic> locus. The recipient N1 cell line possessed a different, distinguishable polymorphism in the cyclin D1 gene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). All of the hybrid clones isolated contained the translocated chromosome. We were unable to isolate clones that contained only the nontranslocated <italic>CCND1</italic> locus from Granta cells. Thus, the translocated and nontranslocated <italic>CCND1</italic> loci could not be segregated. This result provides further, albeit indirect, evidence that the translocated and nontranslocated cyclin D1 loci are tethered together (at the nucleolus), as suggested by our immunoFISH data (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Alternatively, defects in DNA methylation have been associated with chromosomal instability, both in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) and in colorectal cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Therefore, another possibility is that the hypomethylated nontranslocated <italic>CCND1</italic> locus was unstable and was lost during the cell fusion process.</p><p>Control fusion experiments indicated that fusion of N1 cells with a B lymphocyte line without a translocated chromosome was unable to hypomethylate the densely methylated cyclin D1 locus of N1 cells in trans. Similar results using other systems demonstrated no trans epigenetic effects with nontranslocated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>Because the <italic>CCND1</italic> locus is extensively hypomethylated in normal B cells, at least three DNA methylation states of the <italic>CCND1</italic> loci are implied: (a) normal B cells in where both <italic>CCND1</italic> loci are unmethylated and independent; (b) B cells containing <italic>CCND1</italic> translocations/insertions, where the translocated locus exerts a transhypomethylating effect on the untranslocated locus; and (c) B cells that have lost the translocated chromosome and where the <italic>CCND1</italic> locus is CpG methylated. The second and third DNA methylation states are dependent on localization at the nucleolus, whereas the second DNA methylation state appears to be associated with pairing of the <italic>CCND1</italic> loci. Thus, the association of genetic loci with the nucleolus can result in either active (state 2) or inactive (state 3) chromatin, consistent with the results obtained in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). The mechanisms involved in gene expression or repression by association with the nucleolus remain obscure, but could be related to the ability of the translocated allele to recruit activator molecules that protect the tethered cyclin D1 loci from the general repressive effects of the nucleolus. There may also be subtle differences in nucleolar localization that may be important in epigenetic activation versus repression.</p><p>The change in DNA methylation patterns observed in the normal <italic>CCND1</italic> locus after loss of the translocated chromosome are consistent with transallele sensing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), which are well studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (transvection; references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) and plants (paramutation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Trans effects in both endogenous and transgenic mouse loci have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Such effects often involve DNA methylation and occur over long distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Transactivation of the endogenous <italic>Igf2</italic> gene by trangenes has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>), but given the results reported in this paper, transallelic effects should be considered.</p><p>Recent observations in transgenic mice have described paramutation-like effects at the <italic>Igf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), <italic>U2af1rs-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>), <italic>c-kit</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>), and <italic>Rosa26</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>) loci. Paramutation/transvection in human genetic disease associated with the susceptibility to type I diabetes has been suggested at the insulin minisatellite variable number tandem repeat element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). However, our observed transallelic effects are similar to transvection but differ from paramutation because the DNA transhypomethylation effects are not heritable in the absence of the inducer (translocated) allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p><p>Physical evidence of transcommunication has recently been observed between loci on nonhomologous chromosomes regulated by the T cell enhancers/LCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>), and the <italic>Igf2/H19</italic> and <italic>Wsb1/Nf1</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). CTCF has been demonstrated to be involved in long-distance cis and trans effects at the <italic>Igf2/H19</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Thus, transcommunication may be an important means of regulation in mammalian cells.</p><p>At least two nonexclusive mechanisms are implicated in the homology-based transfer of DNA methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). One mechanism involves direct communication between homologous chromosomes, as has been demonstrated in imprinted loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>) or in mouse embryonic stem cells at the onset of X inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). Recent work has shown that CTCF is required for this transient X chromosome pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). The nucleolus has also been implicated in silencing of the inactive X chromosome using immunoFISH assays similar to those performed in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). Our FISH and allelic ChIP data provide evidence for direct communication of the <italic>CCND1</italic> alleles in MCL cells that we suggest is mediated via CTCF, NPM, and the nucleolus.</p><p>Alternatively, small RNA molecules have been shown to direct chromatin modification in trans in plants and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). This epigenetic silencing mechanism involves CpG and non-CpG DNA methylation in plants. Tandem and inverted repeats have been shown to be involved in this type of RNA-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). More recently, a paramutation-like effect mediated by small RNAs has been described at the mouse <italic>c-kit</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>).</p><p>Our allelic ChIP and immunoFISH data suggest that CTCF and NPM participate in transallelic interactions by tethering the cyclin D1 loci from both translocated and nontranslocated cyclin D1 loci together at the nucleolar periphery, as depicted in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>. Our data demonstrate that the 3&#x02032; C&#x003b1; IgH LCR region is sufficient to mediate this effect and that CTCF binding to 3&#x02032; C&#x003b1; LCR HS3 and HS4 correlates with cyclin D1 activation in MCL cells.</p><p>Our finding in cyclin D1&#x02013;deregulated B cell malignancies represents the first report of the association of transvection with human cancer. The critical role of NPM in t(11;14) B cell malignancies is demonstrated by growth arrest and apoptosis selectively in t(11;14) cell lines with NPM shRNA. Our data also suggest a novel approach to therapy of t(11;14) malignancies using agents targeting NPM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cell culture, electroporation, and retroviral infection.</title><p>Cell lines were obtained and maintained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).
