The <italic>RNase 4</italic> and <italic>RNase 5/ang 1</italic> shared locus breaks a pattern that is otherwise canonical among the members of the RNase A gene superfamily. Conserved among humans, mice and rats, the locus includes two non-coding exons followed by two distinct exons encoding RNase 4 and RNase 5/ang 1. Transcription from this locus is controlled by differential splicing and tissue-specific expression from promoters located 5&#x02032; to each of the non-coding exons. Promoter 1, 5&#x02032; to exon I, is universally active, while Promoter 2, 5&#x02032; to exon II, is active only in hepatic cells in promoter assays <italic>in vitro</italic>. Transcription from Promoter 2 is dependent on an intact HNF-1 consensus binding site which binds the transcription factor HNF-1&#x003b1;.

RNase A (bovine pancreatic ribonuclease), the prototype of this gene superfamily, was one of the first proteins to have its crystal structure solved and to be chemically synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The molecular evolution of the RNase A vertebrate-specific enzyme family is startlingly complex, as the various gene lineages (13 in humans and, 9 in mice and rats) appear to be responding to unique selection pressures, generating proteins capable of reducing the infectivity of viruses, killing systemic pathogens and inducing the growth of blood vessels while maintaining conserved signature motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Until recently, the signature motifs of this family included 6&#x02013;8 cysteines which form the disulfide bonds necessary to achieve the required 3D structure and a catalytic triad composed of two histidines and a lysine within a CKXXNTF motif. With the discovery of <italic>RNases -9</italic>, <italic>-10</italic>, <italic>-11</italic>, <italic>-12</italic> and <italic>-13</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), these requirements have been somewhat relaxed as these genes are clearly the derivatives of the RNase A lineage based on sequence similarity and the presence of the characteristic disulfide bridges, but they lack the active site signature motif and, as such, are unlikely to have ribonucleolytic activity.</p><p>With the elucidation of the human genome, Lander <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) noted the unique nature of the RNase A ribonucleases as the only gene family with enzymatic activity clearly limited to vertebrate species. The genes encoding RNase A ribonucleases cluster on human chromosome 14; all with a presumed simple genomic structure consisting of a small non-coding exon I followed by an uninterrupted coding sequence on exon II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Of Interest, the transcripts encoding each of these ribonucleases are initiated from single promoters located 5&#x02032; to the non-coding exons and rely on the presence of enhancers in the introns to achieve maximum levels of transcription.</p><p>Notwithstanding the rich research history of the RNase A superfamily, relatively little is known specifically about the RNase 4 lineage. Human RNase 4 was first described by Shapiro <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) after isolating the protein from conditioned medium from an adenocarcinoma cell line. Two groups isolated the cDNA encoding human <italic>RNase 4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Rosenberg and Dyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) found human <italic>RNase 4</italic> to be a single copy gene expressed in all tissues examined by northern analysis with the exception of brain and placenta, with the highest expression found in liver.</p><p>Conversely, more is known about the <italic>RNase 5/angiogenin</italic> lineage. The angiogenins are structurally distinct from other members of the RNase A superfamily in that these proteins have only six of the eight standard cysteines. Angiogenin (ang) was originally identified as a factor stimulating blood vessel growth [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>)]. Recently, mouse angiogenin (ang) 1 and ang 4, and human angiogenin have been identified as microbicidal agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Evolutionary analysis of the angiogenin lineage from non-mammalian species suggests that this group may be the most ancient form of the superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). While examining the expressed sequence tag (EST) database, Strydom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) noted that both human <italic>angiogenin</italic> and mouse <italic>angiogenin 1</italic> (<italic>ang 1</italic>) shared 5&#x02032;-untranslated regions (5-UTRs) with RNase 4 and suggested that these genes might exist in close proximity along the chromosome and that the different mRNAs could be the products of differential splicing. Alternatively, but less likely, the shared 5&#x02032;-UTRs could have resulted from very recent duplications of the non-coding exons, as duplication events are certainly very prominent in the evolutionary history of the RNase A gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In this work, we characterize <italic>RNase 4</italic> and <italic>RNase 5/ang 1</italic> genes demonstrating that the two genes share a common locus consisting of four exons and three intervening introns in the mouse, rat and human genome. We further demonstrate that transcription from the <italic>RNase 4&#x02013;RNase 5/ang 1</italic> locus is controlled by two promoters that operate in a tissue-specific manner and that the proximal promoter is absolutely dependent on an intact HNF-1&#x003b1; consensus binding site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The following cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, <sc>l</sc>-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator: MMSV (CCL-163.2) and K-Balb (CCL-163.3) which are derivatives of the mouse 3T3 fibroblast cell line; RAW264.7 (TIB-71), a mouse macrophage cell line; Hepa 1-6 (CRL-1830), a mouse hepatoma cell line; Hep-G2 (HB-8065), a human liver cell line and H-4-II-E (CRL-1548), a rat hepatoma cell line.</p></sec><sec><title>Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RACE)</title><p>Complementary DNA was synthesized from 1 &#x003bc;g RNA from mouse liver, kidney and bone marrow with MMLV reverse transcriptase as per the manufacturer's instructions (SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and then amplified using mouse RNase 4 specific oligonucleotides.

Transcripts encoding mouse <italic>RNase 4</italic> were also detected in several cell lines with highest levels of expression in the RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage and the Hepa 1-6 hepatoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since liver expressed such abundant amounts of <italic>RNase 4</italic> message, liver RNA was used to determine the full transcript size. In addition to the experimentally derived cDNAs, several liver ESTs were found by homology search (AI787202, AI96225, AI530414, AI663624 and AW412859). The total size of the liver <italic>RNase 4</italic> transcript is 1409 nt, which is in agreement with the northern analysis.</p><p>Southern analysis reveals that mouse <italic>RNase 4</italic> is a single copy gene (data not shown). <italic>RNase 4</italic> is localized to mouse chromosome 14 between <italic>RNase 5/ang 1</italic> and <italic>RNase 6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) in both the mouse and human genome and on chromosome 15 (NW_047453, Build 2) in rat indicating a syntenic relationship as would be expected of orthologous genes. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that mouse <italic>RNase 4</italic> is more closely related to <italic>RNase 4</italic> of non-mouse species than it is to other mouse RNase A gene lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Sequence analysis reveals that the RNase 4 predicted protein sequences are 83&#x02013;99% identical to each other over the length of the mature protein. Taken together, these data suggest strong orthologous relationships among these ribonuclease sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Ribonuclease activity of mouse RNase 4</title><p>The RNases 4 from each species contain the eight cysteines necessary for folding, the histidines (amino acid position 40 and 144) and the lysine (position 68) that form the catalytic site, as well as the CKXXNTF motif found in all members of the RNase A superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Furthermore, RNA from various tissues was screened by RT&#x02013;PCR for the presence of the non-coding exons together with the coding exons of <italic>RNase 5/ang 1</italic> and <italic>RNase 4</italic>. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the transcript containing exon II is found primarily in the liver (lane 5) while exon 1 can be detected in all tissues. This differential non-coding exon usage is observed for both mouse <italic>RNase 4</italic> and <italic>RNase 5/ang 1</italic>. Note that in the kidney (lane 7), <italic>RNase 4</italic> is seen in conjunction with both exon I and exon II. The four exon gene structure and 5&#x02032;-UTR sharing between <italic>RNase 4</italic> and <italic>RNase 5/ang 1</italic> were determined to be a feature of the mouse, human and rat genome by analysis of the 5&#x02032; RACE products from at least two RNA sources from each species followed by mapping of the RACE products and database ESTs onto the appropriate genome. ESTs were identified by BLAST analysis of the protein coding region against mouse, human and rat EST databases. EST fragments extending the sequence in the 5&#x02032; direction were used in this analysis to confirm experimental RACE data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. In the human, mouse and rat transcriptomes, exon I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) is seen in transcripts from liver, kidney and placenta while exon II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) has a more restricted expression being detected primarily in the liver and occasionally in the kidney.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue-specific promoters</title><p>One way to regulate the expression of <italic>RNase 4</italic> and invoke differential expression of exons I and II would be by the use of two different promoters. We characterized the promoter activity of 500 nt 5&#x02032; to exon I (Promoter 1, Pr1, NT_039599, nt 6&#x02009;429&#x02009;595&#x02013;6&#x02009;430&#x02009;094) and 500 nt 5&#x02032; to exon II (Promoter 2, Pr2, NT_039599, nt 6&#x02009;434&#x02009;259&#x02013;6&#x02009;434&#x02009;758) in several cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The activity from the Promoter 1-containing construct was detected at 4- to 8-fold over background levels and was more or less equivalent in all cell lines examined. This is consistent with the expression of exon I-containing transcripts in multiple tissues. Interestingly, the Promoter 2-containing construct has minimal transcriptional activity in all but the Hepa 1-6 liver cell line (2-fold over background compared with 9-fold in the Hepa 1-6 cells). Promoter 2 contains a sequence similar to the consensus binding site for the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). When mutations are introduced into the putative HNF-1 site, the mutated promoter construct (Pr2mHNF-1) lost significant transcriptional activity in mouse, rat and human hepatic cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B&#x02013;D</xref>, respectively). EMSA analysis revealed specific binding of the transcription factor HNF-1&#x003b1; to this site in rat liver nuclear extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The supershift seen with two distinct anti-HNF-1&#x003b1; antibodies (lanes 5 and 6) was not replicated with an antibody directed toward the related HNF-1&#x003b2; protein which was used here as an isotype control (lane 7).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this work, we explore the <italic>RNase 4</italic> and <italic>RNase 5/ang 1</italic> gene locus in three species and demonstrate an unusual gene structure consisting of four exons and three introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We demonstrate that the shared 5&#x02032;-UTRs of <italic>RNase 4</italic> and <italic>RNase 5/ang 1</italic> arise from differential splicing of two shared non-coding exons confirming the results of Strydom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). We also demonstrate the potential for tissue-specific expression regulated by dual promoters and the presence of tissue-specific expression mediated by at least one unique consensus binding site in the proximal 5&#x02032; promoter. Transcription from multiple promoters is not uncommon in the mammalian genome and provides a means for differential production of gene transcripts in response to specific environmental cues. Among some examples, Li <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) described the dual promoters regulating the expression of eosinophil granule major basic protein (<italic>MBP</italic>) during different stages of eosinophil development. Similarly, CD94, a C-type lectin expressed on NK cells and T-cell subsets, is controlled by dual promoters that differ in their responsiveness to cytokines IL-2 and IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) and determine expression in T-cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Interestingly, we have known for quite some time that at least one of the RNase A ribonucleases, <italic>RNase 3</italic>/eosinophil cationic protein, is expressed uniquely in eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) and yet the mechanism underlying this tissue-specific expression has been elusive. Not only is this work the first demonstration of dual promoters among the RNase A ribonucleases, it is likewise the first demonstration of a mechanism underlying tissue-specific expression.</p><p>Taken together, our promoter analysis and the RACE/EST data indicate that the distal promoter, Pr1, directs the transcription of <italic>RNase 4</italic> and <italic>angiogenin</italic> utilizing the first non-coding exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In this situation, when transcripts for RNase 4 are produced, exon II and exon III (encoding RNase 5/ang 1) will be spliced out or not recognized as exons. The proximal promoter, Pr2 directs liver-specific expression resulting in the splicing of the second of the two non-coding exons with the appropriate coding exon. Again, when <italic>RNase 4</italic> transcripts are produced, exon III encoding RNase 5/ang 1 is spliced out or not recognized as an exon.</p><p>Pr2 contains a consensus binding site for the transcription factor, HNF-1&#x003b1;, and we demonstrate that point mutations in the consensus sequence reduce promoter activity to baseline levels in luciferase assays performed <italic>in vitro</italic> in relevant liver cell lines. HNF-1&#x003b1; is a dimerizing homeodomain protein that, together with other transcription factors, coordinates the expression of transcripts encoding hepatocyte proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Originally perceived to be hepatocyte-specific, HNF-1&#x003b1; expression itself is not limited to hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Moreover, specific mutations in HNF-1&#x003b1; result in the genetic syndrome known as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), and the targeted HNF-1&#x003b1; gene-deletion likewise has elucidated clear alterations in gene-expression in mouse pancreatic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). The <italic>RNase 4</italic> and <italic>RNase 5/ang 1</italic> proximal promoter Pr2 also has consensus binding sites for the transcription factors HNF-3 and the CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family which may coordinate with HNF-1&#x003b1; in promoting gene expression. Clearly, the predominant expression of <italic>RNase 4</italic> and <italic>RNase 5/ang 1</italic> in the liver tissue may be due to the action of Pr2 <italic>in vivo</italic> in humans, mice and rats as suggested by the RACE, EST and promoter data shown here.</p><p>While other members of the RNase A superfamily have intriguing evolutionary patterns, unusual expression patterns and/or unique protein structure and function, there has been only limited interest in the highly conserved <italic>RNase 4</italic> lineage. However, in this work, we demonstrate the rather unusual nature of its regulatory mechanism and demonstrate the first molecular mechanism underlying tissue-specific expression in this gene family. These findings certainly provide greater impetus to study RNase 4 and its specific function <italic>vis &#x000e0; vis</italic> hepatocytes and liver metabolism. Furthermore, given that RNase 4 and RNase 5/ang 1 are transcribed from the same promoters and can be expressed in concert, equally intriguing is the possibility of coordinate activity of the two gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the members of the Eosinophil Biology Section of LAD/NIAID for their review of this work with a special thanks to Dr Takeaki Nitto for his critical reading of the manuscript.
