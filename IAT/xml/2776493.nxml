In addition SDH plays an important role as the complex II component of the electron transport chain, ultimately leading to the generation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Combining these roles places SDH at the center of two essential energy producing processes of the cell.</p><p>The identification of <italic>SDHD</italic> (chromosome 11q23) as a tumor suppressor gene revealed, for the first time, the involvement of both a mitochondrial protein and a protein of intermediary metabolism in tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Baysal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations of <italic>SDHD</italic> lead to head and neck paragangliomas (HN-PGL), mainly benign tumors of the carotid body and other parasympathetically innervated paraganglia, but may also lead to tumors of the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytoma) and the sympathetically innervated paraganglia (extra-adrenal paraganglioma), some developing into aggressive metastatic cancers. Subsequently, two other subunits of SDH, <italic>SDHC</italic> (chromosome 1q21) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Niemann1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, and <italic>SDHB</italic> (chromosome 1p36) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Astuti1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> were implicated in paragangliomas.</p><p>A striking aspect of the natural history of <italic>SDHD</italic>-linked paraganglioma is the parent-of-origin inheritance of tumor susceptibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-VanDerMey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to paraganglioma in <italic>SDHB</italic> and <italic>SDHC</italic>-linked families, both located on chromosome 1, in <italic>SDHD</italic>-linked families and in the recently described SDH5 (<italic>SDHAF2</italic>) family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Hao1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, only a mutation inherited via the paternal line results in tumorigenesis. This strongly suggests the involvement of an imprinted locus in paragangliomas. No evidence exists to support the idea that these genes, both on chromosome 11, show monoallelic expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Baysal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Hensen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of the main cluster of imprinted human genes on the same chromosome, at 11p15.5, suggests a maternally expressed, imprinted gene as a compelling candidate for a modifier of tumor development. Loss of this gene, in addition to the maternal <italic>SDHD</italic> allele, may lead to the initiation of tumorigenesis. Loss of (maternal) chromosome 11 has been repeatedly demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Hensen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Riemann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, counterintuitive if the maternal <italic>SDHD</italic> allele is imprinted and thus non-functional. This mechanism will result in a tumor that retains only the mutated paternal <italic>SDHD</italic> allele and entirely lacks active copies of all maternally expressed imprinted genes. Several genes on chromosome 11 are known to be exclusively maternally expressed including <italic>CDKN1C</italic>, <italic>KCNQ1</italic>, <italic>KCNQ1DN</italic>, <italic>SLC22A18</italic>, <italic>PHLDA2</italic>, <italic>OSBPL5</italic>, and <italic>H19</italic>. A well-described gene in the chromosome 11p15.5 region is <italic>H19</italic>, which has both a genetic and functional interaction with the paternally expressed insulin-like growth factor 2 (<italic>IGF2</italic>) gene. <italic>H19</italic> knockout mice are viable and display an overgrowth phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Leighton1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and H19 has recently been shown to be a tumor modifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Yoshimizu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we report an <italic>Sdhd</italic> knockout mouse, lacking the entire third exon of <italic>Sdhd</italic>, which codes for the bulk of the active protein.

In the <italic>Sdhd</italic> KO mice described here we saw no development of paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma at any age in two independent cohorts of mice followed for their entire lifespan. This divergence of genotype-phenotype correlation between man and mouse is far from unprecedented, and could be the result of any number of unknown physiological, biochemical or genetic mechanisms. What we do know is that there are clear differences in the chromosomal organization of genetic elements between the two species. While in man chromosome 11 harbours both <italic>SDHD</italic> (11q23) and the main locus for imprinted genes (11p15.5), these genes are on two separate chromosomes in the mouse (imprinted locus, chromosome 7 and <italic>Sdhd</italic>, chromosome 9).</p><p>The striking parent-of-origin inheritance pattern of <italic>SDHD</italic>-linked tumors in man strongly suggests the involvement of an imprinted locus in paragangliomas. All evidence indicates that <italic>SDHD</italic> itself is not imprinted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Baysal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, and we have postulated a role for an imprinted modifier gene on chromosome 11 in <italic>SDHD</italic>-related paraganglioma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Hensen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. While <italic>SDHD</italic> and this modifier can be affected by whole chromosome loss in man, in the mouse loss of these genetic elements would require loss of two separate chromosomes, intrinsically less likely and perhaps incompatible with cell viability. The <italic>H19</italic>-<italic>SDHD</italic> double knockout included <italic>H19</italic> as the postulated <italic>SDHD</italic>-modifier, but did not lead to the development of paragangliomas even after 29 months. The modifier may not be <italic>H19</italic> but another maternally expressed gene on chromosome 11. Equally, because there was no tumor development in these mice, the true role of <italic>H19</italic> could not be properly evaluated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007987-Yoshimizu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. While knockouts of other candidate genes exist, they generally result in pre- or perinatal lethality, precluding their use in the model postulated here. Inducible tissue-specific knockouts are not yet available. It is also worth noting that no case of spontaneous development of paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma has ever been reported in mice, perhaps suggesting an intrinsic resistance to the development of tumors of the paraganglia.</p><p>Knockout of orthologous human tumor suppressor genes in mice often results in the development of tumors of different tissue origin to that seen in man. Although a number of mice in our cohorts developed tumors of diverse types, there was no evidence that knockout of <italic>Sdhd</italic> was related to their genesis.</p><p><italic>Sdhd</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice showed no notable differences in fertility, body mass, organ mass, or gross or histological morphology compared to wildtype littermates. The loss of one allele of a gene that is so essential to cellular metabolism might be expected to show some phenotypic expression, but can evidently be sufficiently compensated by transcription from the remaining allele. Any morphological changes of <italic>Sdhd</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice may be confined to a trend to a subtle increase in the size of the carotid body and adrenal medulla.
