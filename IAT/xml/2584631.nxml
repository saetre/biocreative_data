Previous studies suggest this process occurs by the production of luteolytic factors, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We examined TNF-alpha, TNF-alpha receptors (TNFR1 and 2) and steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein expression during CL regression in albino Wistar rats. CL from Days 16 and 22 of pregnancy and Day 3 post-partum were examined, in addition CL from Day 16 of pregnancy were cultured in vitro to induce apoptosis. mRNA was quantitated by kinetic RT-PCR and protein expression examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>TNF-alpha mRNA increased on Day 3 post-partum. TNFR were immunolocalized to luteal cells, and an increase in TNFR2 mRNA observed on Day 3 post-partum whilst no change was detected in TNFR1 mRNA relative to Day 16. StAR protein decreased on Day 3 post-partum and following trophic withdrawal but no change was observed following exogenous TNF-alpha treatment. StAR mRNA decreased on Day 3 post-partum; however, it increased following trophic withdrawal and TNF-alpha treatment in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results demonstrate the existence of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in rat CL and suggest the involvement of TNF-alpha in rat CL regression following parturition. Furthermore, decreased StAR expression over the same time points was consistent with the functional regression of the CL.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The demise of the corpus luteum (CL) is characterized by a decrease in progesterone synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and an increase in apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Whilst a temporal pattern is well established, the factors regulating both the functional and structural regression of the rat CL remain poorly understood.</p><p>Whilst progesterone is synthesized by the ovary, the adrenal and the placenta, the CL of pregnancy are the major source of progesterone in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Small and large luteal cells within the rat CL of pregnancy retain steroidogenic potential though large luteal cells predominate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. During pregnancy total progestin synthesis (progesterone and 20&#x003b1;-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one (20&#x003b1;-OHP)) declines from a high on Day 16 to the morning of Day 22 prior to an increase in the afternoon on Day 22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This observed pattern in total progestin production in rats has been demonstrated to be a product of decreased synthesis of progesterone toward term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and increased synthesis of 20&#x003b1;-OHP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Total progestin production is dependent on the transport of cholesterol to the mitochondria and then from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane which is mediated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. StAR protein has been reported in the ovary of the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], rabbit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and correlated with the functional state of the CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As such StAR expression has been proposed as a reliable "marker" of CL function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Several publications have reported the participation of the immune system in ovarian events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], suggesting a role for the cytokine tumor necrosis factor &#x02013; alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) in CL regression. Luteal cells and endothelial cells are capable of TNF&#x003b1; synthesis though macrophages remain the primary ovarian source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. TNF&#x003b1; expression in the ovary is coordinated between the infiltration and activation of macrophages and the hormonal regulation of the CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We have recently reported TNF&#x003b1; protein localization in the rat CL on Day 16 and Day 22 of pregnancy and Day 3 post-partum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the induction of luteal cell apoptosis following treatment with recombinant TNF&#x003b1; in a dose- and time-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Associated with the TNF&#x003b1; ligand are two similar, though distinct receptors, TNF&#x003b1; receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF&#x003b1; receptor 2 (TNFR2). The lack of homology between the two cytoplasmic domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] is thought to contribute to the different outcomes of TNF&#x003b1;. Involved in a variety of biological processes, TNF&#x003b1; is implicated in both cell proliferation and cell death; TNFR1 is generally associated with TNF&#x003b1;-induced cell death and TNFR2 with cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. TNFR binding sites have been demonstrated within the bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], porcine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] CL under various experimental conditions. TNFR are present on nearly all cell types with few exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and the subtypes are often co-expressed by the same cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The aims of this study are to examine the role of TNF&#x003b1; during the structural regression of the CL by analysis of TNFR expression, and to determine the role of TNF&#x003b1; in the functional regression of the CL through regulation of StAR protein expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The animals used were mature (12&#x02013;20 week old) nulliparous albino Wistar rats obtained from the Animal Resources Center (Murdoch, WA, Australia).

One ovary from each animal (alternating left or right) was used for immunohistochemistry, the contralateral ovary was used for Western blot and mRNA analyses (n = 4). Ovaries were trimmed of adhering tissues and the CL of pregnancy were selected and dissected as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition to the above, <italic>in vitro </italic>studies were conducted using CL collected on Day 16 of pregnancy. Three pairs each from a different animal (n = 3) were collected for each treatment group.

We have previously demonstrated TNF&#x003b1; expression during the structural regression of the CL both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>through immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], concluding that TNF&#x003b1; is a potential luteolytic factor at Day 22 of pregnancy and Day 3 post-partum. The analysis of TNF&#x003b1; mRNA expression in this study supports these earlier findings and suggests that the involvement of TNF&#x003b1; in CL regression is active (requiring transcription) rather than passive.</p><p>Critical to the effectiveness of cytokine-mediated apoptosis, is receptor-ligand binding. The immunohistochemical data in this study demonstrate for the first time the presence of the TNFR in adult rat CL during pregnancy and post-partum. Since the TNFR is an essential element in the TNF&#x003b1; cell death pathway, our findings further support a role for TNF&#x003b1; during CL regression. TNFR immunostaining appeared to be confined to rat luteal cells, despite published evidence of endothelial cell expression within the porcine and bovine CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, immunostaining was not solely localized to the cell membrane (as expected) but also the cytoplasm of luteal cells; for this reason quantitative analysis of protein expression was not undertaken since the results, whilst supporting the presence of TNFR in the CL, do not definitively define it's cellular compartmentalization. Importantly, this finding is supported by the manufacturer's (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) disclosure stating the presence of both membrane and cytoplasmic staining for either antibody. Indeed photographs presented in cited publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] clearly show both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound localization of TNFR1 and TNFR2. Whilst the significance of these findings is not discussed it is possible that it reflects either latent TNFR protein expression or is the result of the homology between the TNFR death domain and the death domain of adapter proteins localized within the cytoplasm.</p><p>TNFR mRNA was expressed in the rat CL at all stages examined during pregnancy and post-partum. One of the unanswered questions in TNF&#x003b1; biology is what types of signals are mediated through either TNFR. The hypothesis of this study was that CL fate might be regulated at the level of the TNFR; should only one receptor type be expressed during CL regression. There was no change in TNFR1 mRNA levels when compared to Day 16 of pregnancy; however, there was a significant increase in TNFR1 mRNA levels from Day 22 of pregnancy to Day 3 post-partum. This finding supports the association of TNFR1 with apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and also its association with the rapid luteal regression seen following parturition. TNFR2 mRNA was more abundant on Day 3 post-partum, a period when active growth of new follicles is occurring, and this finding further supports the cell proliferative role of TNFR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Whilst mRNA expression cannot be extrapolated to protein expression, the observed changes are intriguing.</p><p>Despite its association with cell survival, TNFR2 expression may also contribute to the apoptotic signal of TNF&#x003b1;. Anti-TNFR2 antibodies, although not directly cytotoxic, can antagonize the cytotoxic action of TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Tartaglia et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] hypothesized that the auxiliary function of TNFR2 was to cooperate in the binding of TNF&#x003b1; to TNFR1 (the ligand-passing hypothesis). An alternate hypothesis is that TNFR2 may be responsible for the DNA fragmentation activity associated with TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Although separation between the functioning of the two receptors has been demonstrated, overexpression of TNFR2 can result in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Thus the increased levels of TNFR2 mRNA observed on Day 3 post-partum may possibly contribute to TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, if none of these hypotheses hold true, these data do not diminish the role of TNF&#x003b1; during CL apoptosis since, associated with receptor expression, is a reported increase in the binding affinity of TNF&#x003b1; during the oestrus cycle and pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. A quantitative study of TNFR binding affinity and protein expression in the rat CL is required before such conclusions can be made.</p><p>The role of TNF&#x003b1; in the functional regression of the CL was assessed through analysis of StAR protein expression. Localized to luteal cells, StAR protein and mRNA expression decreased on Day 3 post-partum. StAR expression correlated with the reported changes in total progestin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and the structural regression of the CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Whilst StAR expression was significantly reduced on Day 3 post-partum, the observed increase in mRNA expression on Day 22 of pregnancy is consistent with the observed synthesis of 20&#x003b1;-OHP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Importantly, the decline in StAR expression post-partum was inversely correlated with TNF&#x003b1; expression as reported in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, following treatment with recombinant TNF&#x003b1;, StAR mRNA expression increased whilst protein expression remained unchanged. A similar effect was observed following the withdrawal of trophic support for 8 hours. We have previously demonstrated the pattern of apoptosis occurring both during pregnancy and following <italic>in vitro </italic>organ culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the decline in progesterone synthesis during the structural regression of the CL is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is possible that the elevation in StAR mRNA corresponds to the attempted compensation by remaining healthy luteal cells in a similar manner to that observed following unilaterally ovariectomized rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. As such the <italic>in vitro </italic>data present confounding evidence for the role of TNF&#x003b1; in the functional regression of the CL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study indicate the local production of TNF&#x003b1; and the presence of both TNFR in rat CL throughout pregnancy, and further support the role of TNF&#x003b1; in the structural regression of the rat CL. The data further demonstrate the relationship between StAR expression and the functional state of the rat CL and suggest that TNF&#x003b1; is associated with its functional regression. This work forms the basis from which further investigations around TNF&#x003b1; systems' biology may be undertaken and may ultimately lead to the ability to manipulate CL regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>This is part of MA's Ph.D work.
