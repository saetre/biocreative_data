For instance, Kv12.2 (ELK2, KCNH3) channels are highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and although they are most likely to contribute to resting potassium conductance, surprisingly little is known about their function or regulation. Here we demonstrate that the auxiliary MinK (KCNE1) and MiRP2 (KCNE3) proteins are important regulators of Kv12.2 channel function. Reduction of endogenous KCNE1 or KCNE3 expression by siRNA silencing, significantly increased macroscopic Kv12.2 currents in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes by around 4-fold. Interestingly, an almost 9-fold increase in Kv12.2 currents was observed with the dual injection of KCNE1 and KCNE3 siRNA, suggesting an additive effect. Consistent with these findings, over-expression of KCNE1 and/or KCNE3 suppressed Kv12.2 currents. Membrane surface biotinylation assays showed that surface expression of Kv12.2 was significantly increased by KCNE1 and KCNE3 siRNA, whereas total protein expression of Kv12.2 was not affected. KCNE1 and KCNE3 siRNA shifted the voltages for half-maximal activation to more hyperpolarized voltages, indicating that KCNE1 and KCNE3 may also inhibit activation gating of Kv12.2. Native co-immunoprecipitation assays from mouse brain membranes imply that KCNE1 and KCNE3 interact with Kv12.2 simultaneously <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting the existence of novel KCNE1-KCNE3-Kv12.2 channel tripartite complexes. Together these data indicate that KCNE1 and KCNE3 interact directly with Kv12.2 channels to regulate channel membrane trafficking.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal voltage-gated (Kv) potassium channels that open at membrane potentials close to the threshold for action potential generation have a profound effect on neuronal excitability because of their ability to stabilize membrane potentials below the threshold for action potential initiation.

Mouse brain lysates were immunoprecipitated with the following antibodies: anti-KCNE1, anti-KCNE3, or anti-Kv12.2, and the immunoblots were probed with anti-Kv12.2.

To further confirm the co-immunoprecipitation results we performed reciprocal experiments using anti-Kv12.2 as the &#x02018;pull-down&#x02019; antibody; the blots were probed with either anti-KCNE1 or anti-KCNE3. Consistent with the KCNE1 and KCNE3 co-immunoprecipitation data, anti-Kv12.2 &#x02018;pull-down&#x02019; experiments revealed that both KCNE1 and KCNE3 immunoprecipitate with Kv12.2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006330-g005">Figure 5A</xref><italic>middle and bottom panels</italic>, respectively).</p><fig id="pone-0006330-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006330.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Kv12.2 channels simultaneously associate with KCNE1 and KCNE3 &#x003b2;-subunits <italic>in vivo</italic>.</title><p>(A) Mouse brain lysates (MB) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-KCNE1, anti-KCNE3, anti-Kv12.2, or anti-Kir2.1 and were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western Blot analysis.

KCNE3 immunoprecipitates with Kv12.2 but does not interact with KCNE1. Controls show little or no IP of Kv12.2, KCNE1 or KCNE3 with anti-Kir2.1 or unconjugated beads. (B&#x02013;D) Two-step co-immunoprecipitation assays run under native protein conditions. The Kv12.2 channel complex labeled under native conditions was &#x0223c;500 Kd, consistent with a channel tetramer. (B) Kv12.2 channels were immunoprecipitated first with anti-KCNE1 or anti-KCNE3 in these native protein conditions. Specificity was assessed using the anti-Kir2.1 antibody and unconjugated beads as negative controls. Proteins immunoprecipitated in this first IP were subjected to a second IP using anti-Kv12.2. (C) Anti-KCNE1 detected the Kv12.2 tetramer complex after the second IP regardless of whether anti-KCNE1 or anti-KCNE3 was used for the first IP. (D) Similarly, anti-KCNE3 detected the Kv12.2 complex after the second IP with anti-Kv12.2 even if anti-KCNE1 was used for the first IP. These results can be explained if KCNE1 and KCNE3 simultaneously interact with individual Kv12.2 channels. Denatured mouse brain lysate was loaded into the first lane, to confirm the established size of the respective KCNE &#x003b2;-subunit. Note that some KCNE1 has dissociated from the channel complex in the KCNE1 lane of (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006330.g005"/></fig><p>To further characterize the KCNE1/KCNE3 &#x003b2;-subunit interaction with Kv12.2 channels we performed a two-step co-immunoprecipitation assay under native protein conditions. The main aim for conducting these additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments was to determine whether KCNE1 and KCNE3 &#x003b2;-subunits simultaneously interact with individual tetrameric Kv12.2 channels in neurons. Consistent with previous data, under native conditions the tetrameric Kv12.2 channel immunoprecipitates with KCNE1 or KCNE3 &#x003b2;-subunits; and again the specificity of this interaction was assessed using the anti-Kir2.1 antibody as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006330-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The size of the Kv12.2 channel complex was &#x0223c;500 Kd, which is consistent with a tetrameric pore structure and allows for small associated proteins such as KCNE1 and KCNE3. The migration of KCNE1 and KCNE3 with this large Kv12.2 channel complex is strong additional proof for specific interaction of these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> and importantly shows that channel structure is maintained under the conditions we used for co-immunoprecipitation assays. This allowed us to ask whether KCNE1 and KCNE3 simultaneously interact with individual tetrameric Kv12.2 channels, since it is believed that multiple, and most likely two, KCNE subunits associate with each tetrameric potassium channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Chen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Morin1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Since KCNE1 and KCNE3 do not interact directly, such a scenario could only be detected if tetrameric channel structure is maintained during immunoprecipitation assays. The relatively small size of the KCNE1 and KCNE3 subunits, 14 kDa and 36 kDa respectively, makes it impossible to accurately determine the stoichiometry of KCNE/Kv12.2 interactions based on the Kv12.2 channel complex size. Therefore, to determine whether both KCNE1 and KCNE3 &#x003b2;-subunits can interact with tetrameric Kv12.2 channels simultaneously, we conducted a &#x02018;second- round&#x02019; co-immunoprecipitation experiment, whereby the proteins from the &#x02018;first-round&#x02019; KCNE1 or KCNE3 &#x02018;pull-down&#x02019; were subsequently subjected to pull-down by anti-Kv12.2. Blots were then probed with either anti-KCNE1 or anti-KCNE3. Following the &#x02018;second-round&#x02019; co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Kv12.2, KCNE3 protein could be detected in samples where anti-KCNE1 was used for the &#x02018;first-round&#x02019; pull-down. In addition the reciprocal interaction occurred when anti-KCNE3 was utilized in the &#x02018;first-round&#x02019; co-immunoprecipitation and the final blot was probed for presence of KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006330-g005">Figure 5C, D</xref>). These two-step co-immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated 3 times with similar results. The results suggest that KCNE1 and KCNE3 &#x003b2; subunits form tripartite channel complexes with Kv12.2 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrate here that the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel &#x003b2;-subunits KCNE1 and KCNE3 regulate trafficking and activation of Kv12.2.

Furthermore, we show by native co-immunoprecipitation experiments that both &#x003b2;-subunits, KCNE1 and KCNE3, simultaneously interact with tetrameric Kv12.2 channels <italic>in vivo</italic>; suggesting the existence of a native channel tripartite complex (Kv12.2-KCNE1-KCNE3). As Kv12.2 channels are highly expressed in several important brain regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala and cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Zou1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Saganich1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, we predict that <italic>in vivo</italic> association of KCNE1 and KCNE3 with Kv12.2 channels has considerable significance to the modulation of neuronal excitability. The specific localization of KCNEs in the brain has not been carefully defined; however northern blot analysis in human brain has demonstrated that KCNE3 is expressed in the hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus, hypothalamus and cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-McCrossan3">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and has therefore has specific overlap with areas high in Kv12.2 channel expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Saganich1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. It is now well established that KCNQ1 channels assemble with KCNE &#x003b2;-subunits for correct physiological function; mutations that disrupt this complex formation result in congenital deafness and inherited cardiac arrhythmias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-McCrossan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Splawski1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Tyson1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly studies in the heart have shown that the expression of the KCNE &#x003b2;-subunits fluctuates during disease states, suggesting that a balance in the variety of KCNE &#x003b2;-subunits may be required to physiologically regulate K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Lundquist1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggest that a similar regulatory mechanism may exist in the brain.</p><p>Possible roles for KCNE &#x003b2; subunits in the regulation of other neuronal K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels have been proposed. Furthermore the mRNA transcripts for all five KCNE &#x003b2;-subunits have been detected in tissue from rodent brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-McCrossan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. McCrossan <italic>et al</italic>. (2003) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-McCrossan2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> have demonstrated that Kv2.1 and Kv3.1 immunoprecipitate from rat brain membranes with anti-KCNE3 antibodies. Both KCNE1 and KCNE3 reduced the current density of Kv2.1 and Kv3.1 channels in heterologous expression systems, the mechanism was shown to be via a direct effect on gating kinetics, and not regulating plasma membrane expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-McCrossan2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, as we find for Kv12.2 channels. More recent studies have demonstrated that heterologously expressed Kv4.3 channels, which are activated during neuronal excitation and are believed to have a role in spike repolarization and frequency, are dramatically inhibited by KCNE3 &#x003b2;-subunits by effects on both activation kinetics and current amplitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Lundby1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. We show here for the first time that KCNE subunits may also regulate the activity of a K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel believed to significantly contribute to neuronal resting potential. Further <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are required to characterize and determine the trafficking dynamics and physiological significance of this Kv12.2 -KCNE1-KCNE3 channel regulatory tripartite complex.</p><p>The most pronounced effect of KCNE1 and KCNE3 on Kv12.2 channels is on the regulation of plasma membrane expression. We demonstrate that KCNE1 and/or KCNE3 &#x003b2;-subunits did not affect overall Kv12.2 channel total protein expression. Previous studies have suggested a similar role of the KCNE &#x003b2;-subunits in K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel regulation. Nicolas <italic>et al</italic>. (2001) demonstrated in KCNE1 knock-out mice, that KCNQ1 channels do not traffic to the apical membranes of vestibular dark cells, where they would normally be found in wild type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Nicolas1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that KCNE1 &#x003b2;-subunits chaperone KCNQ1 to the membrane surface or alternatively stabilize membrane expression. Interestingly KCNE3 has been shown previously to inhibit hERG channels, suggesting either the formation of a non-functional channel, or one that fails to reach the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Anantharam1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly in our study Kv12.2 channel currents were increased by the knockdown of endogenous KCNE1 and/or KCNE3 &#x003b2;-subunits, and attenuated by the over-expression. Our results clearly show that increased Kv12.2 current following knockdown of KCNE1 and KCNE3 occurs primarily through enhanced surface expression. We assume Kv12.2 current reductions induced by KCNE1 and KCNE3 overexpression result from reduced surface expression, although we did not definitively determine the mechanism using the surface biotinylation assay. KCNQ1-KCNE1 assembly is chaperone mediated, suggesting that these proteins first associate in either the ER or cis-Golgi; as KCNQ1 channels assemble early in the secretory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Chandrasekhar1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests the possibility that KCNE subunits could affect membrane trafficking of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels by control of retention in or export from the ER. Interestingly a recent study by Xu <italic>et al</italic>. (2009), demonstrated that KCNQ1-KCNE1 complexes but not homomeric KCNQ1 channels undergo clathrin- and dynamin 2-dependent internalization; redefining KCNE1 as an endocytic chaperone for KCNQ1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Xu1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Further studies are required to define whether KCNE1 and KCNE3 determine membrane surface expression of Kv12.2 through control of export to the plasma membrane, promotion of endocytic recycling, or a combination of both mechanisms.</p><p>The subunit composition of KCNE-containing channel complexes can greatly influence channel function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-McCrossan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is therefore important to understand the stoichiometry of native channel complexes. Here we demonstrate <italic>in vivo</italic> that both KCNE1 and KCNE3 appear to simultaneously interact with individual Kv12.2 channel tetramers. Remixing of subunits during the co-IP assays to produce these results remains a possibility, but is extremely unlikely due to high dilution factors and removal of the proteins from the membrane context. Recent <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations with K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels have proposed that two KCNE peptides interact with the channel tetramer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Chen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-Morin1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the question of whether individual channels may contain multiple distinct KCNE proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> has never been examined prior to this study. We present evidence demonstrating that a significant portion of Kv12.2 channels contain both KCNE1 and KCNE3 &#x003b2; subunits <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Kv12.2 channels also complex separately with either KCNE1 or KCNE3 in the brain.</p><p>We observed an additive increase over the effect of either siRNA alone with both KCNE1 and KCNE3 knockdown on Kv12.2 channel plasma membrane expression. Several mechanisms may have meditated this additive effect. Firstly, it is possible that KCNE1 and KCNE3 have independent effects on Kv12.2 trafficking and are not able to substitute for each other. In this case, both subunits would have to be present for maximal inhibition of Kv12.2 channel expression on the membrane. Alternatively, it may be the case that KCNE1 and KCNE3 do have redundant effects on trafficking in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, and that removal of either may simply reduce the number of channels that contain a KCNE subunit. In support of this view, KCNE subunits have similar structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006330-McCrossan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and are thus likely to interact with K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel &#x003b1;-subunits in overlapping binding sites. It would be interesting to determine whether all or only a subset of these KCNE binding sites must be occupied to affect trafficking of Kv12.2 channels. The demonstration of heterologous assembly between a K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel (Kv12.2) and KCNE family regulatory &#x003b2;-subunits, suggests that the promiscuity of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel/KCNE interactions observed <italic>in vitro</italic> may reflect complexity in the stoichiometry of channels formed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates for the first time that KCNE1 and KCNE3 &#x003b2;-subunits form a tripartite complex with Kv12.2 channels in the brain; and furthermore suggests that regulation of membrane surface expression, and subsequent channel activation as a function of this association.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Paul Slesinger for providing Kir2.1, and Xiaofei Zhang for helpful
