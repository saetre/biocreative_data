Here, we have analyzed the single molecule motility properties of yeast cytoplasmic dynein mutants bearing mutations that prevent ATP hydrolysis at AAA3 or AAA4. Both mutants remain processive, but the AAA4 mutant exhibits a surprising increase in processivity due to its tighter affinity for microtubules. In addition to changes in motility characteristics, AAA3 and AAA4 mutants produce less maximal force than wild-type dynein.

Underscoring its biological significance, dynein has been implicated in numerous microtubule-related functions, including cargo transport, mitotic spindle positioning, and nuclear segregation (see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> for a review). Like many other biological motors, cytoplasmic dynein uses chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to perform mechanical work. However, in contrast to other cytoskeletal motors of the kinesin and myosin superfamilies, dynein has multiple ATP binding sites. This poses the question of how dynein makes use of these multiple ATP sites and whether they might be involved in the regulation of the motor.</p><p>Dyneins are AAA+ ATPases, a superfamily of enzymes that have a diverse array of functions ranging from protein unfolding to membrane trafficking (see Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>) for reviews). Despite their varied functions, AAA+ ATPases all share a similar core architecture with conserved Walker-A (P loop) and Walker-B (phosphate sensor) motifs in their nucleotide binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Most AAA+ proteins oligomerize into hexameric, ringlike structures that act upon their substrates. In some cases, the identical AAA+ subunits may fire stochastically (<italic>e.g.</italic> ClpX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>)), whereas in other cases, sequential hydrolysis around the ring may occur (<italic>e.g.</italic> helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>)). Dynein is unusual in having multiple AAA+ domains concatenated in a single polypeptide chain that folds into a ringlike structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). The first four AAA+ domains (AAA1&#x02013;AAA4) are capable of binding nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), whereas the last two AAA+ domains (AAA5&#x02013;AAA6) are highly divergent, no longer bind nucleotide, and appear to serve a structural role in completing the ring. Between AAA4 and AAA5, an antiparallel coiled-coil stalk emerges with a microtubule binding domain at the tip. NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal to the first AAA domain is a &#x0201c;linker&#x0201d; domain that is thought to swing with respect to the stalk, possibly constituting the dynein power stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>).</p><p>The roles of the four functional AAA domains have been investigated by biochemical and mutagenesis studies. AAA1, the site of ATP-vanadate photocleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), is generally acknowledged to be the major site of ATP hydrolysis and primary driver of the power stroke. Mutagenesis of this site greatly decreases ATP turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), abolishes motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), and eliminates the conformational change of the linker domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The roles of the other sites remain less well understood. Single molecule studies suggest that a single ATP binding event may suffice for dynein to take a step along the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). However, mutagenesis of the Walker A domain of AAA3 (predicted to interfere with nucleotide binding) greatly decreases microtubule-stimulated ATPase and microtubule gliding activity and causes &#x0201c;rigor-like&#x0201d; binding with the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Mutagenesis studies of AAA2 and AAA4 suggest they may have more minor roles. Collectively, these results suggest that AAA2&#x02013;AAA4 assume some sort of regulatory role, but the details of how they participate in the dynein mechanism remain unclear.</p><p>Although prior <italic>in vitro</italic> motility studies have been performed on dynein ATP site mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), they have focused upon Walker A mutations that disrupt ATP binding and have not examined the processive movement of a two-headed dynein. Here, we used previously developed single molecule motility assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) to investigate the role of ATP hydrolysis at AAA3 and AAA4 on processivity and force production. We find that dynein bearing a Walker B mutation (that specifically disrupts ATP hydrolysis) at AAA3 is still processive, despite a severe effect on ATPase activity and motor velocity. Surprisingly, the AAA4 Walker B mutant displays enhanced processivity that is most likely mediated by an increase in microtubule binding affinity. We also show that AAA3 and AAA4 mutants can only generate 2-fold lower forces than wild-type dynein. Thus, the nucleotide binding state at AAA3 and AAA4 can regulate dynein microtubule affinity, processivity, and force-generating ability.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Construction and purification of dynein ATP hydrolysis mutants.</bold><italic>A</italic>, a minimal <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cytoplasmic dynein that demonstrates processive motility was engineered as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>).

Contrary to bulk gliding assays, this method provides a direct determination of velocities and run lengths by observing single attachment, movement, and detachment events.</p><p>At 1 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, single wild-type, AAA3-E/Q and AAA4-E/Q dynein molecules demonstrated processive movement (<italic>continuous lines</italic> in <italic>kymographs</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). However, the velocity of the AAA3-E/Q mutant was substantially decreased (4.6 &#x000b1; 3.7 nm/s) compared with wild-type motors (73.9 &#x000b1; 34.2 nm/s; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, AAA4-E/Q demonstrated only a modest decrease in velocity (60.6 &#x000b1; 18.9 nm/s; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). The relative severity of these defects is reflected in the <italic>in vivo</italic> mutant phenotypes of these dyneins, where severe nuclear segregation defects are observed for the AAA3-E/Q but not the AAA4-E/Q mutant (Fig. S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). These velocity decreases are similar to those reported for AAA3 and AAA4 Walker A mutant dynein monomers assayed for microtubule gliding <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), but the results here also demonstrate that these mutants still retain processive behavior.</p><p>To further evaluate processivity, run lengths were measured by kymograph analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). The lengths of dynein runs were exponentially distributed, with the exponential decay constant representing the mean run length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). The AAA3-E/Q mutant displayed a slight decrease in run length (1.79 &#x000b1; 0.18 &#x003bc;m) compared with wild-type dynein (2.25 &#x000b1; 0.14 &#x003bc;m). In contrast, AAA4-E/Q mutants had a surprising 2-fold increase in run length (4.39 &#x000b1; 0.45 &#x003bc;m). The frequency of extremely long runs (10&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;m) further demonstrated the pronounced gain in processivity.</p><p>We wished to exclude the possibility that the longer run length of AAA4-E/Q was due to aggregation, since an aggregate might have more attachments to the microtubule and thereby detach less frequently. To test whether one or multiple dyneins are present in the moving spots, we examined their photobleaching behavior (Fig. S2). We found that all of the moving molecules (<italic>n</italic> = 47, 25, and 45 for wild-type, AAA3-E/Q, and AAA4-E/Q, respectively) showed only one- or two-step photobleaching, as expected for single dynein dimers. There was no significant difference in photobleaching between wild-type and mutant dyneins, ruling out the possibility that protein aggregation accounts for the increased run length of AAA4-E/Q or decreased velocity of AAA3-E/Q.</p><p><italic>Microtubule-stimulated ATPase Activity of Dynein ATPase Mutants</italic>&#x02014;To better understand the single molecule behaviors of the AAA3 and AAA4 ATP hydrolysis mutants, we measured their basal and microtubule-stimulated ATPase activities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). In accordance with velocity reductions in the single molecule assay, the microtubule-stimulated ATPase rates, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, of AAA3 and AAA4 mutants, were reduced 10- and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with wild-type dynein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The basal ATPase rates were reduced by a similar margin. Thus, microtubule stimulation was comparable (3&#x02013;4-fold) for the mutants and wild-type dynein, implying that the loss of motility in the mutants is not due to a lack of microtubule stimulation.

For these experiments, we bound wild-type and mutant green fluorescent protein-tagged dyneins to latex beads, which could be captured by a fixed optical trap (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). To ensure that bead movements were due to a single dynein molecule, the dynein-to-bead ratio was adjusted so that the fraction of moving beads was &#x0003c;0.3 (representing a &#x0003e;99% probability that movements were due to a single molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>)). Dynein mutants exhibited similar behavior to wild-type dynein, moving the bead away from the trap center and then stalling, often for several minutes, under a maximum opposing load (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>Both AAA3-E/Q and AAA4-E/Q (2.6 and 3.7 pN, respectively; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>) exhibited lower stall forces compared with wild-type dynein (4.5 pN; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, Student's <italic>t</italic> test).

This study differs from prior biochemical work on the AAA domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), which employed nonprocessive dynein monomers and mutated the Walker A motif, which is expected to interfere with nucleotide binding. Our results show that blocking nucleotide hydrolysis at AAA3 and AAA4 significantly affects motor velocity, processivity, and force production but not nucleotide affinity at AAA1 and microtubule binding affinity in the apo state. These studies provide new insight into how the nucleotide states of AAA3 and AAA4 can affect the main hydrolytic site (AAA1) and the mechanics of the motor.</p><p>The principal consequence of blocking ATP hydrolysis at AAA4 is on motor processivity, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the run length. The processivity of molecular motors is thought to be mediated by alternating catalysis of the two heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), resulting in hand-over-hand motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). A processive run is terminated when both motor domains simultaneously detach from the microtubule, which would be more likely if both heads are in a weak binding state. Here, we show that blocking ATP hydrolysis at the AAA4 domain increases the binding affinity for microtubules in the presence of ATP for the dimeric dynein construct. This higher microtubule binding affinity is probably responsible for the longer run length of AAA4-E/Q, since the tighter interaction would likely equate to a lower probability of dissociation from the track. AAA3-E/Q has an even higher affinity for microtubules, although its run length is similar to wild-type. However, if one calculates mean attachment times, AAA3-E/Q is attached much longer (360 s) than both wild-type (30 s) and AAA4-E/Q (72 s), showing that higher microtubule affinity is also reflected in the motility characteristics of AAA3-E/Q.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Nucleotide-independent movement of dynein induced by force.</bold><italic>A</italic>, schematic of force-induced stepping experiments.

Our finding highlights a novel example where engineering an ATPase domain, which has no known interactions with microtubules, causes an increase in processivity. ATP hydrolysis at AAA3 and AAA4 could affect microtubule binding affinity either by a direct allosteric effect communicated through the coiled-coil stalk to the microtubule binding domain or by affecting the kinetic cycle of AAA1, such that the motor spends a longer time in nucleotide states associated with tight microtubule binding. In addition, the pronounced difference of microtubule binding affinity between dimeric wild-type and AAA4-E/Q dynein, but not monomeric wild-type and AAA4-E/Q dynein, suggests the possibility that kinetic coupling is increased between the two heads of dynein in AAA4-E/Q mutants. Further studies will be required to distinguish between these mechanisms.</p><p>Our data also reveal that blocking ATP hydrolysis at AAA3 or AAA4 affects the catalytic and mechanical force production activities of dynein. This is particularly evident for AAA3-E/Q, which reduces the overall ATPase rate and movement velocity by an order of magnitude, effects that are most likely mediated by repressing ATP turnover at AAA1. Previous studies have shown that a Walker A mutation (which interferes with nucleotide binding) in AAA3 similarly reduces the ATPase and microtubule gliding velocity of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> dynein by &#x0223c;20-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that both ATP binding and hydrolysis at AAA3 are important for fast nucleotide turnover at AAA1, implying allosteric communication between different AAA sites.</p><p>Although these and other mutagenesis studies show that the nucleotide state of AAA3 and AAA4 can affect overall dynein activity, the predominant nucleotide state of AAA3 and AAA4 has yet to be determined. The nucleotide turnover rate at AAA3 and AAA4 also remains unknown, although prior dwell time analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) and the single site fit of the ATPase data in this study suggest that ATP hydrolysis at AAA3 (and AAA4) does not occur during every cycle of ATP turnover at AAA1. Thus, AAA3 and AAA4 may function as regulatory sites for AAA1, perhaps analogous to the main (D2) and regulatory (D2) catalytic sites of p97, another AAA+ protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). To answer such questions and better understand the interplay of the four AAA nucleotide sites, new tools will be needed to directly probe the nucleotide state of each AAA domain in the native dynein enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M802951200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M802951200_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mpeg" xlink:href="M802951200_movie1.mpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mpeg" xlink:href="M802951200_movie2.mpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mpeg" xlink:href="M802951200_movie3.mpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Derek Applewhite and Erin Reicha (students of the 2006 MBL Physiology Course for initial experimental work, which was instrumental for launching this project).
