Nevertheless, non-homologous recombination or other types of incorrect repair may lead to chromosomal translocations thus generating fusion proteins involved in the development of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c4">4</xref>). In particular, specific translocations of chromosome 11q23 have been consistently found in therapy-related myeloid leukemias and lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c7">7</xref>). Chromosomal translocations have been proposed to originate from the action of topoisomerase II (top2) poisons included in the chemotherapeutic regimen for a previous tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c10">10</xref>).</p><p>top2 is the target of effective antitumor agents, such as anthracyclines and demethylepipodophyllotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c14">14</xref>). The drugs stabilize a covalent enzyme&#x02013;DNA intermediate by forming a ternary enzyme&#x02013;poison&#x02013;DNA complex in which DNA strands are cut and covalently linked to enzyme subunits. top2 DNA cleavage is reversible, showing that drug-blocked top2 is able to reseal DNA ends and complete the catalytic cycle upon drug removal. Therefore, cellular repair processes are likely not triggered by top2-mediated cleavage, unless the lesion has not been repaired by the enzyme and has then become irreversible. The mechanisms by which transient top2 DNA breaks eventually result in frank and irreversible cuts have not been fully established, however, one would expect that DNA breaks are less likely to become irreversible if top2 is efficient in rejoining the strand breaks. <italic>In vivo</italic> DNA break reversibility has not been fully studied and it remains to be established whether chromatin has any role in the efficiency of break reversion. Therefore, we have here measured the kinetics of the loss of breaks upon drug removal from the medium at two genomic loci of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Kc cells. We chose to investigate two repeated sequences, the histone gene and satellite III clusters, since their chromatin structures have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c16">16</xref>) and top2-promoted DNA cleavage in living cells can be more easily detected in multi-copy DNA segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c19">19</xref>). Moreover, cleavage loss was investigated after heat shock of cells, since this treatment is known to modulate chromatin structure and top2-dependent DNA breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Drugs, enzymes and other materials</title><p>The anthracycline analog 4&#x02032;-demethoxy-3&#x02032;-deamino-3&#x02032;-hydroxy-4&#x02032;-<italic>epi</italic>-doxorubicin (dh-EPI) was kindly donated by Dr A.

To measure cleavage loss, treated cells were washed and resuspended in fresh drug-free medium and further incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for the indicated time. After treatment, DNA was purified by standard procedures and DNA cleavage was analyzed by the indirect end-labeling method using HB or HP probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c18">18</xref>).

Cleavage reversibility was assessed by adding 0.6 M NaCl before stopping the reaction with 1&#x00025; SDS and 0.1 mg&#x0002f;ml proteinase K at 42&#x000b0;C for 45 min.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>top2 cleavage sites are poison-specific in living cells and, in particular, site patterns are markedly distinct at the histone gene locus between VM-26 and dh-EPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c18">18</xref>). dh-EPI stimulates the most intense cleavage at site 10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f1">1</xref>), which maps in the TATA box of the H2A gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c18">18</xref>). In the present report, we have mapped other sites in this particular segment of the histone repeat. dh-EPI was very active, stimulating cleavage at many sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f1">1</xref>, sites 9&#x02013;12) within a segment of &#x0223c;2000 bp, whereas VM-26 was only weakly effective in the same repeat segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c18">18</xref>). Taken together, the results indicate that top2 activity was intense in that region under conditions of exponential cell growth.</p><p>To evaluate molecular aspects of <italic>in vivo</italic> cleavage reversibility, we have then measured the kinetics of loss of double-stranded DNA breaks over a wide time range (from 5 min to 5 h) at 25&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f1">1</xref>A). First, dh-EPI-stimulated DNA cleavage persisted for very long periods. Moreover, reversal kinetics were markedly different among sites mapped in the H2A&#x02013;H2B region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f1">1</xref>) and the histone cluster SAR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f2">2</xref>). Most persistent cleavage was observed at sites 10, 9 and 6a, where double-stranded DNA breaks were 43&#x02013;60&#x00025; of initial levels 4 h after drug treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f2">2</xref>). In contrast, cleavage was completely gone after 2 h at sites 5, 6b, 7b, 11 and 12 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f2">2</xref>A). Thus, the results demonstrate that dh-EPI-stimulated DNA cleavage remained even after 4&#x02013;5 h and that this slow cleavage loss was site specific.</p><p>Next, we determined cleavage levels and kinetics of break loss under heat shock conditions. It is well known that heat shock influences top2 DNA cleavage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and induces a reorganization of chromatin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c22">22</xref>). A comparison between 25 and 37&#x000b0;C showed that cleavage levels were reduced at the latter temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f1">1</xref>), even though the main sites were the same (sites 9 and 10). Recovery from cleavage was almost complete at 60&#x02013;120 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f2">2</xref>), showing a marked reduction in cleavage persistence as compared with the lower temperature. The results thus indicated that heat shock strongly affected the loss of top2 DNA cleavage at the histone gene cluster.</p><p>In contrast to dh-EPI, VM-26 can stimulate DNA cleavage at both histone gene and satellite III repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c18">18</xref>), thus allowing us to directly compare the loss of drug-stimulated DNA breaks in distinct chromatin contexts. For VM-26, we compared cleavage sites in the histone cluster SAR to the satellite III sites, since this poison stimulated strongest cleavage in SAR and not in the H2A&#x02013;H2B region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c18">18</xref>). The reversal rate of VM-26-dependent cleavage was markedly slower in the histone repeat region than in satellite DNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f3">3</xref>). All DNA cuts in the satellite III DNA were essentially gone only 5 min after drug removal, whereas cleavage persisted up to 120 min in histone cluster SAR. We also observed differences among VM-26-stimulated sites: cleavage was still readily detectable at sites 4 and 5 after 60&#x02013;120 min, whereas cleavage reversal was faster at sites 3, 6 and 7, and more similar to that of the satellite repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f3">3</xref>). The initial level of cleavage was not correlated with cleavage reversibility, since cleavage levels were similar at sites 3, 4 and 6, whereas their reversal rates were clearly different (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f3">3</xref>). Moreover, the two genomic loci studied were highly and similarly affected by VM-26, as indicated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c23">23</xref>), whereas reversal was markedly different (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f3">3</xref>). Reversal of VM-26-stimulated DNA cleavage was also determined under heat shock conditions and, in agreement with dh-EPI, an enhancement of reversal rate was detected at the histone cluster (not shown).</p><p>The results suggest that diverse molecular aspects may affect loss of top2-mediated DNA cuts in living cells. To establish whether the observed <italic>in vivo</italic> heterogeneity was due to variability in the intrinsic stability of poisoned top2 at different DNA sites, we compared the kinetics of cleavage reversal upon salt addition with purified top2 and the same DNA fragments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f4">4</xref>). VM-26-stimulated DNA cleavage reverted <italic>in vitro</italic> with much slower kinetics than top2 DNA cleavage without poison, however, no kinetic difference was observed between the two DNA templates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f4">4</xref>A). In the histone gene repeat, all dh-EPI-stimulated sites were still present 1 h after salt addition at 10 &#x000b5;M drug, whereas cleavage reverted when using 5 &#x000b5;M dh-EPI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f4">4</xref>B). Overall, cleavage reverted with similar rates, even though some differences could be detected among sites that may correspond to the <italic>in vivo</italic> sites 6a and 5 (see bands marked with arrows in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd491f4">4</xref>). Thus, the present results indicate that poison&#x0002f;enzyme interactions with different DNA sites may in part explain the kinetic differences observed for dh-EPI in nuclear chromatin, but not those detected for VM-26.</p><p>The satellite III DNA is a silent heterochromatic region whereas the histone gene cluster is a transcriptionally active chromatin domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c24">24</xref>). We have shown that top2 DNA cleavage can be extensive at the loci studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c23">23</xref>). Our present findings indicate that the most dramatic difference between the two loci is the rate of break loss. The breaks can be lost <italic>in vivo</italic> in one of two ways; either the poisoned top2 can reseal the cuts on drug removal or they can be resealed by a DNA repair pathway. Our data do not allow us to distinguish between the two possibilities. Nevertheless, the loss observed in the satellite III DNA is almost immediate upon drug removal, thus suggesting that top2 itself likely reseals the break. This would indicate that the trapped top2 remains fully active in this chromatin context. In contrast, the much slower loss observed in the histone gene cluster may suggest that top2 cannot reseal the breaks and in that case a repair pathway is more likely to be necessary to restore DNA integrity. We may therefore suggest that early events downstream from top2 DNA breaks are distinct at the two loci studied and that irreversible DNA breaks are much more likely to occur in active chromatin rather than heterochromatin.</p><p>The present findings may have implications for the pathway leading to chromosomal repair and&#x0002f;or translocation. top2 has been proposed to generate chromosome breaks that constitute the initial step of neoplastic transformation of hematopoietic precursor cells involving the human MLL gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c8">8</xref>). Recent reports have suggested that chromosomal translocations may be generated by &#x02018;error-prone repair&#x02019; mechanisms and not by the specific recombinases of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c2">2</xref>). Moreover, the authors conclude that both chromosomes most likely undergo multiple breaks before the occurrence of translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c2">2</xref>). Our findings clearly show that top2-promoted cleavage in nuclear chromatin is intense and frequent in a relatively short DNA segment, such as the 5 kb major histone gene repeat. If long-lived top2-associated breaks are more likely to be converted into irreversible lesions in active chromatin, drug action would thus result in multiple breaks at the given locus. Interestingly, DNase I-hypersensitive sites were reported near the bcr of the MLL gene, suggesting an open chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c25">25</xref>). Our observations are therefore consistent with the above reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd491c2">2</xref>) and with the hypothesis that top2 is involved in the development of therapy-related leukemias.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd491f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Top2 DNA cleavage stimulated by dh-EPI at the histone gene cluster.
