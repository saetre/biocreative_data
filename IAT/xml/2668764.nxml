Several conditions are associated with cognitive deficits such as disturbances in attention processes and learning and memory, suggesting that persistent changes in dopaminergic signaling may alter neural mechanisms underlying these processes. Dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-KO) mice exhibit a persistent five-fold increase in extracellular dopamine levels. Here, we demonstrate that DAT-KO mice display lower hippocampal theta oscillation frequencies during baseline periods of waking and rapid-eye movement sleep. These altered theta oscillations are not reversed via treatment with the antidopaminergic agent haloperidol. Thus, we propose that persistent hyperdopaminergia, together with secondary alterations in other neuromodulatory systems, results in lower frequency activity in neural systems responsible for various cognitive processes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hippocampal theta oscillations (HTO) are prominent local field potential oscillations generated by the brain, and occur within the 4&#x02013;9 Hz frequency range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-TimoIaria1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Buzsaki1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thirteen male WT mice and eleven DAT-KO mice were separated into individual cages, and surgically implanted with electrodes and electromyographic (EMG) wires.

Behaviors were recorded with a video cassette recorder. Video images were loaded onto a cassette recorder and synchronized with the neural recordings using a millisecond-precision timer.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Behavioral state and total theta power identification</title><p>Behavioral states were identified by combining two-dimensional state map and EMG cluster analysis as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Dzirasa1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, the state map generated cluster separation based on the high amplitude theta (4&#x02013;9 Hz) and gamma (33&#x02013;55 Hz) oscillations characteristic of REM sleep, the absence of gamma oscillations and the high amplitude delta (1&#x02013;4 Hz) characteristic of SWS, and the high amplitude gamma oscillations and theta oscillations characteristic of waking. Minor scoring errors typically occurred in differentiating REM sleep from active exploration, thus EMG analysis was used to identify periods of atonia consistent with REM sleep, and combined with the two-dimensional state map cluster scoring method for all sleep experiments conducted in this study. LFP's were simultaneously recorded from 8 implanted electrodes, and the LFP which produced the best cluster separation was used for all experiments presented here. Importantly, our method did not control for the layer of hippocampus in which the recording electrode used for analysis was located. This is an important confound because the amplitude of theta oscillations change as a function of depth in hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Buzsaki1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance, our experiments in which five WT mice were recorded in the novel environment, habituated environment, and during REM sleep reveal a high coefficient of variance (CV) in the maximum theta power measured across animals (CV&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.49, 0.52, and 0.52, for recordings in the novel environment, habituated environment, and during REM sleep, respectively). Additionally, our experiments in five DAT-KO mice reveal a similarly high coefficient of variation (CV) in the maximum theta power measured across animals (CV&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.56, 0.49, and 0.55, for recordings in the novel environment, habituated environment, and during REM sleep, respectively). However, we found that by normalizing the maximum mean theta power measured during the waking periods by that recorded during REM sleep for each animals, we were able to reduce the CV measured across animals by up to 80&#x00025; (CV&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0<italic>9/0.15</italic>, and 0.0<italic>9/0.11</italic> for theta power measured in the <italic>novel cage/home cage</italic> in WT and DAT-KO mice, respectively). Importantly, the mean power spectrum observed during REM sleep remained unchanged when DAT-KO and WT mice were treated with drugs, as well as during 12-hour experimental recordings conducted in their home cage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Dzirasa1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. These results indicate that the peak theta power observed during REM sleep can be utilized effectively as the baseline variable to correct for changes in theta wave amplitude recorded from different depths of hippocampus.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Determination of peak theta frequency</title><p>First, all data segments with amplitude saturation were discarded from the dataset (2&#x00025; of the total data per mouse). Using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA), a sliding window Fourier transform was applied to the LFP signal using a 2 sec window with a 1 sec step. The Fourier transform parameters were chosen to allow for a frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz. Subsequently, LFP power spectra were then averaged across each period of interest (at least 2 total minutes for REM sleep, 10 total minutes for baseline waking, and 10 total minutes for active exploration), and the frequency at which the maximum spectral power occurred in the theta frequency (4&#x02013;9 Hz) range was identified. For experiments examining REM sleep, we also determined the peak theta frequency using Fourier transform parameters chosen to allow for a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz. The instantaneous phase values of theta oscillations shift throughout the depth of hippocampus; however, oscillations are phase locked across layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Buzsaki1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, in order to examine the effects of persistent hyperdopaminergia on baseline HTOs, DAT-KO and WT mice were habituated to the recording chamber for eight hours and subsequently subjected to two-hour continuous electrophysiological and behavioral recordings. Despite WT and DAT-KO mice showing similar behavioral profiles, total delta power (normalized delta power: WT mice: 3.6&#x000b1;0.5, DAT-KO mice: 4.3&#x000b1;0.4; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5; p&#x0003e;0.05) and total theta power (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g002">2E</xref>), DAT-KO mice displayed lower peak HTO frequencies during the baseline waking period than WT mice (WT mice: 7.1&#x000b1;0.2 Hz, DAT-KO mice: 5.7&#x000b1;0.2 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>,). In order to ensure that the lower HTO frequencies observed in DAT-KO mice were truly due to changes associated with persistent hyperdopaminergia, and not simply behavioral differences that were too small to measure with our scoring technique, we implored a second behavioral scoring method based on our video data and EMG recordings. Using this method for five animals in each group, we identified the minimal EMG activity associated with movement and limited our analysis to include only one second intervals where mice displayed EMG activity below the movement threshold. Importantly, DAT-KO mice continued to display lower peak HTO frequencies than WT mice when the analysis was restricted to periods when both groups were completely still (WT mice: 6.9&#x000b1;0.3 Hz, DAT-KO mice: 5.7&#x000b1;0.4 Hz; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5 per group). Thus, the lower HTO frequencies observed in behaviorally habituated DAT-KO mice were indeed due to changes associated with persistent hyperdopaminergia and not simply small differences in behavioral profiles. This result was particularly interesting because acute treatments with DA agonists has been shown to induce high frequency HTO's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Kichigina1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Next, we investigated if these changes in HTO's were present across all baseline behavioral states observed in DAT-KO mice by analyzing HTO spectral patters observed across DAT-KO and WT mice during REM sleep. Our results indicate that DAT-KO mice show lower peak HTO frequencies than WT mice during REM sleep (WT mice: 7.2&#x000b1;0.1 Hz, DAT-KO mice: 6.5&#x000b1;0.2 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Importantly, similar results were also obtained when the frequency resolution was increased from 0.5 Hz to 0.25 Hz. This demonstrates that lower frequency HTO's are present across both baseline waking and sleeping periods in DAT-KO mice.</p><fig id="pone-0005238-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005238.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Altered HTOs in hyperdopaminergic mice.</title><p>Mean hippocampal LFP power distributions were calculated in the 2&#x02013;12 Hz range for each mouse across the behavioral periods of interest.

Interestingly, despite the marked behavioral hyperactivity displayed by the DAT-KO mice following exposure to the novel recording chamber, peak HTO frequencies were comparable to those observed in novelty-exposed WT mice (WT mice: 8.0&#x000b1;0.1 Hz, DAT-KO mice: 8.0&#x000b1;0.1 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Peak HTO frequencies were, however, higher in novelty exposed WT and DAT-KO mice than those observed during the baseline waking period. Novelty exposure also increased theta power in DAT-KO mice, but not WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Importantly, exposure to novelty does not change dopaminergic tone in WT or DAT-KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Gainetdinov3">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, as WT and DAT-KO mice display similar peak HTO frequencies following exposure to novelty, while dopaminergic tone remains constant, our results suggest that persistent hyperdopaminergia does not decrease the peak frequency of HTO's in DAT-KO mice across all behavioral states.</p><p>Overall, our findings suggest that persistent hyperdopaminergia generates compensatory network changes which decrease the peak frequency of HTO's during baseline behavioral periods. Conversely, our results also raise the possibility that hyperdopaminergia lowers peak HTO frequencies across all behavioral states, and that the similar peak HTO frequencies observed in novelty exposed WT and DAT-KO mice is a result of the higher behavioral profiles exhibited by DAT-KO animals.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Acute Dopamine D2 receptor transmission involved in novelty-induced increases in HTO frequencies</title><p>Next, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in HTO's observed in DAT-KO mice. DAT-KO mice and WT mice were treated with the D2 dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol 0.3 mg/kg, i.p. (HAL), and two-hour electrophysiological and behavioral recordings were conducted. HAL attenuated behavioral hyperactivity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>) and novelty-induced peak HTO frequency increases in both WT (vehicle: 8.0&#x000b1;0.1 Hz, HAL: 6.5&#x000b1;0.2 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and DAT-KO mice (vehicle: 8.0&#x000b1;0.1 Hz, HAL: 6.3&#x000b1;0.1 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that acute dopaminergic transmission, via the D2 dopamine receptor, plays a critical role in the induction of high frequency HTO's in DAT-KO mice following novelty exposure. Interestingly, HAL did not reduce total theta power in DAT-KO mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), suggesting that alterations in other neuromodulatory systems may mediate the novelty induced increases in theta power observed in these animals.</p><p>Next, we investigated the effect of HAL on the altered HTO's observed during baseline behavioral periods in DAT-KO mice. Systemic administration of pharmacological agents induced behavioral hyperactivity in habituated DAT-KO mice, thus we employed a modified experimental paradigm. Firstly, behavioral and electrophysiological recordings were extended to four hours in WT and DAT-KO mice treated with HAL. Secondly, analysis was limited to periods of REM sleep occurring within this four hour window. Because the four hour recording period was within the half-life of HAL in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Zetler1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, and the effect of external behavioral influences on HTO's is relatively limited during REM sleep, this experimental paradigm allowed us quantify the effect of HAL on the altered HTO frequencies observed in habituated DAT-KO mice. Our results showed that DAT-KO mice treated with HAL displayed lower peak HTO frequencies during REM sleep that WT mice treated with HAL (WT mice: 7.5&#x000b1;0.3 Hz, DAT-KO mice: 6.6&#x000b1;0.1 Hz, p&#x0003c;0.02). These results indicate that HAL does not attenuate the altered HTO frequencies observed in DAT-KO mice during baseline behavioral periods.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>DA independent modulation of HTOs</title><p>Next, we conducted our recording protocol in WT mice treated with the psychostimulant d-amphetamine 3.0 mg/kg, i.p. (AMPH). Dopamine agonists have been shown to increase peak HTO frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>; thus, we predicted that treatment with AMPT would increase peak HTO frequencies in WT animals. Surprisingly, our results showed that WT mice treated with d-amphetamine displayed peak HTO frequencies that were significantly lower than those observed in WT mice treated with vehicle (WT: 6.7&#x000b1;0.1 Hz; tstat<sub>1,8</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.9, p&#x0003c;0.005, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). We also found that AMPH increased total theta power in WT mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). While AMPH causes a profound increase in dopamine release in WT animals at the dose used for this experiment (3.0 mg/kg), it has also been shown to increase serotonin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Gainetdinov2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we set out to investigate if the lower peak HTO frequencies observed in WT mice treated with AMPH resulted from acute hyperdopaminergia or secondary changes in other neuromodulatory systems.</p><p>Firstly, WT animals were treated with both HAL and AMPH, and electrophysiological data was collected during the 2-hour recording period. Our results showed that AMPH significantly lowered peak HTO frequencies in WT animals treated with HAL (WT/HAL and AMPH: 5.9&#x000b1;0.2 Hz; tstat<sub>1,8</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.9, p&#x0003c;0.02), indicting that HAL did not attenuate the peak HTO frequency lowering effect of AMPH. Secondly, we treated DAT-KO mice with d-amphetamine. DAT-KO mice lack a key target of AMPH, the DA transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Gainetdinov1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, and thus the drug exerts a calming effect via serotonergic mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Gainetdinov2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Gainetdinov3">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In DAT-KO mice, AMPH significantly lowered peak HTO frequencies (vehicle: 8.0&#x000b1;0.1 Hz, AMPH: 5.3&#x000b1;0.4 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Upon further analysis, we also found that DAT-KO mice treated with AMPH displayed peak HTO frequencies that were even lower than those observed in DAT-KO treated with HAL (N-K<sub>10</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4.00). Incidentally, AMPH attenuated novelty-induced hyperactivity in DAT-KO mice to a lesser degree than HAL (HAL: 0.4&#x000b1;0.1, AMPH: 1.7&#x000b1;0.3, tstat<sub>1,8</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.9, p&#x0003c;0.005). Moreover, in contrast to HAL, treatment with AMPH also significantly attenuated novelty induced increases in total theta power in DAT-KO mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005238-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Finally, we treated WT animals with the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLU, 20 mg/kg i.p.). Our results showed that FLU significantly lowered the peak frequency of HTO's in WT mice (WT mice/Saline: 8.0&#x000b1;0.1 Hz, WT mice/FLU: 6.6&#x000b1;0.3 Hz, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5, p&#x0003c;0.05), suggesting that increases in serotonergic tone were sufficient to reduced HTO frequencies.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the lower peak HTO frequencies observed in WT animals treated with AMPH are likely due to secondary changes in serotonergic neuromodulatory systems, and not acute hyperdopaminergia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that DAT-KO mice display decreased hippocampal theta oscillations frequencies during baseline waking periods and REM sleep. Incidentally, these findings are in contrast to studies that have shown that acute treatment with DA agonists generates increases in HTO frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Kichigina1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, our findings reveal for the first time that persistent hyperdopaminergia lowers baseline hippocampal theta oscillation frequencies.</p><p>HTO's are prominent LFP's generated by the brain, and occur in the 4&#x02013;9 Hz frequency range.

Thus, even small changes in baseline HTO frequencies are likely to alter neural activity across large distributed brain networks, ultimately generating deficits in gross behavioral processes. Importantly, baseline HTO frequencies observed during quiet waking and REM sleep have been shown to be predictive of learning rates across rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Santos1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>HTO's are also highly correlated with behaviors such as changes in posture or limb position, walking, head movements, and rearing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Vanderwolf2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously shown that the enhanced theta power observed in DAT-KO mice following novelty exposure is not simply due to the increased locomotor activity observed in these animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Dzirasa1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. While peak HTO frequencies increase in WT and DAT-KO mice following novelty-induced hyperactivity as well, the changes in baseline HTO's observed in DAT-KO mice are unlikely to be due to gross locomotor behavioral changes. Firstly, despite demonstrating similar behavioral profiles during the baseline waking period, DAT-KO mice display significantly lower the peak frequency of HTO's. Importantly, this difference persists even when our analysis is restricted to intervals when animals are completely still. Moreover, DAT-KO mice display lower peak HTO frequencies than WT mice during periods of REM sleep where both genotypes of mice are behaviorally inactive. WT and DAT-KO also display similar peak HTO frequencies following novelty exposure, though DAT-KO mice experience a significant increase in gross locomotor activity. Collectively, these findings suggest that the altered HTO frequencies observed in DAT-KO mice HTO's can be dissociated from changes in gross locomotor behavioral activity. Secondly, though treatment with AMPH induces gross locomotor hyperactivity in WT animals, it lowered peak theta oscillations frequencies. Moreover, treatment with d-amphetamine caused greater decreases in peak HTO frequencies in DAT-KO mice than treatment with haloperidol, though haloperidol attenuated behavioral hyperactivity to a greater degree. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence that persistent hyperdopaminergia generates changes in HTO's that are locomotor activity independent, resulting in a decrease in the peak frequency of HTO's during baseline periods.</p><p>DA is critically involved in regulating neural processes responsible for complex movements and emotions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Carlsson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, altered central dopaminergic neurotransmission has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD. While recent evidence demonstrates that transient over-expression of striatal D2 dopamine receptors during development results in deficits in working memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Kellendonk1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, and that increases in tonic dopaminergic stimulation generate global deficits in learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005238-Breitenstein1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, it is unclear how persistent changes in dopaminergic transmission alter neural activity in brain areas that mediate cognitive processes. Our results demonstrate that persistent hyperdopaminergia generates a baseline slowing of hippocampal neural networks. Additionally, we show that while administration of the classic antidopaminergic agent HAL attenuates behavioral hyperactivity in DAT-KO mice, it does not correct the reduced peak HTO frequencies observed during baseline behavioral periods.</p><p>Moreover, we show that treatment with AMPH attenuates novelty-induced behavioral hyperactivity, and reduces the peak frequency of HTO's and HTO power in persistently hyperdopaminergic mutants.
