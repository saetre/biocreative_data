In addition, some studies indicated that PCDGF participated in invasion, metastasis and survival of cancer cells by regulating cell migration, adhesion and proliferation. Yet the effects of PCDGF on proliferation and invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and the mechanisms by which PCDGF mediates biological behaviors of ovarian cancer have rarely been reported.

PCDGF expression level correlated well with malignant phenotype including proliferation and invasion in ovarian cancer cell lines. In addition, the proliferation rate and invasion index decreased after inhibition of PCDGF expression by antisense PCDGF cDNA transfection in SW626 and A2780. Furthermore expression of CyclinD1 and CDK4 were downregulated and MMP-2 was inactivated after PCDGF inhibition in the pilot study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PCDGF played an important role in stimulating proliferation and promoting invasion in ovarian cancer. Inhibition of PCDGF decreased proliferation and invasion capability through downregulation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 and inactivation of MMP-2.

In teratoma cells, PCDGF expression was shown to be essential for tumorigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. High levels of PCDGF expression are found in rapidly proliferating cells, such as skin cells, deep crypts of gastrointestinal tract, and immune cells. On the other hand, low levels of PCDGF expression are found in cells that are not mitotically active, such as muscle and liver cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Overexpression of PCDGF has been linked to the growth and tumorigenicity of human breast carcinomas and to the acquisition of estrogen independence by estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Despite these strong connections with cancer and growth control, PCDGF 's mode of action is not well understood.</p><p>In addition, some studies indicated that PCDGF participated in invasion, metastasis and survival of cancer cells by regulating cell migration, adhesion and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In SW-13 adrenal carcinoma cells, the level of PCDGF expression was a major determinant of the intrinsic activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, and focal adhesion kinase signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. PCDGF resulted in exogenously stimulated cell growth and sustained cell survival of both ARP-1 and RPMI 8226 cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The role of growth factors in ovarian cancer development and progression is complex and multifactorial. Growth factors identified to date, such as transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), macrophage colony stimulating factor (m-CSF), and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) have been shown to regulate ovarian cancer cell growth and survival <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Monica BJ et al have reported that PCDGF was overexpressed in invasive epithelial ovarian cancer and was involved in the stimulation of ovarian cancer cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Yet the effects of PCDGF on ovarian cancer in vitro and the mechanisms by which PCDGF mediates ovarian cancer biological behaviors have rarely been reported.</p><p>As we know, cyclin D1 can stimulate proliferation by driving cells from the G1 into the S-phase of the mammalian cell cycle. Previous studies suggest that the expression of cyclin D1 could be induced by growth factor stimulation, and cdk4 or cdk6 associated with cyclin D1 exhibits protein kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Matrix metallo-proteinases, a family of zinc-dependent metallo-endopeptidases, are known to be involved in tumor invasion and metastasis by degradation of the extracellular matrix. MMP-2, one of these enzymes, is able to degrade type IV collagen, a major component of the basement membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Understanding the mechanisms by which PCDGF mediates tumor biological behaviors could be valuable for designing potential therapeutic schemes and improving the survival of ovarian cancer patients. In the present study we investigated PCDGF expression level in ovarian cancer cells. We also observed the proliferation rate and invasion index in Sw626 and A2780 cells after transfection with antisense PCDGF cDNA. The expression of cyclin D1, CDK4 and the activity of MMP2 along with the change of PCDGF were determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human ovarian cancer cell lines SW626, Skov-3 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas). They were maintained in Leibovitz's L-15 and McCoy's 5a media, respectively. Human ovarian cancer cell line A2780 was obtained from China Type Culture Center (Wuhan University) and cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium. All of them were cultured in a 37&#x000b0;C incubator supplied with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of PCDGF mRNA expression</title><p>Total RNA of three human ovarian cancer cell lines was isolated by TRIzolRNA kit (Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's protocol, 5 <italic>&#x003bc;g </italic>of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA, then amplified with equal cDNA. In PCR analysis the specific primer pairs used were for PCDGF: forward primer, 5'-AATGTGACATGGAGGTGAGC-3' and reverse primer, 5'-AGCAGGTCTGGTTATCATGG-3'; for GAPDH as internal standard: forward primer, 5'-CCTTCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3', and reverse primer, 5'-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3'. The reaction mixtures were subjected to 30 cycles of PCR. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, annealing at 58&#x000b0;C for 60 sec and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 60 sec. 10 &#x003bc;l of each PCR product were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels containing 0.5% ethidium bromide.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot analyses</title><p>Since PCDGF is a secreted protein, its expression was measured in cell lysates and conditioned media collected in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture of 200 &#x003bc;M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)/1 &#x003bc;M leupeptin/0.5 &#x003bc;M aprotinin/1 mM EDTA (all obtained from Sigma). Cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 followed by sonication and centrifugation. For comparative studies of PCDGF expression, the samples used for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were normalized to equivalent cell numbers (see figure legends), determined by counting cells from duplicate sets of dishes. Immunoprecipitation of PCDGF was carried out by incubating samples for 4 hr with 5 &#x003bc;g of affinity-purified anti- PCDGF IgG conjugated to agarose beads followed by centrifugation at 10,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 10 min.

The filters were coated with 50 &#x003bc;g of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (VWR Canlab, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Cells (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>) in 25 &#x003bc;l of serum-free DMEM were placed on each filter, and 26.5 &#x003bc;l of NIH3T3 conditioned medium were placed in the lower chamber as chemo-attractant. 10 h later the filters were washed, fixed, and stained as described. Cells on the upper surface of the filters were removed with cotton swabs. Cells that had invaded to the lower surface of the filter were counted by microscopy selecting 10 random fields per filter (&#x000d7;400 magnification).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction and transfection of antisense PCDGF cDNA expression vector</title><p>An antisense PCDGF cDNA expression vector was constructed by inserting a partial human PCDGF cDNA (-30 bp to 465 bp) into a pcDNA3.1(+) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) in the antisense orientation. The recombinant plasmid was certified by DNA sequencing. 4 &#x003bc;g of the antisense PCDGF cDNA construct were transfected into SW626 and A2780 cells with Lipofectamine (GIBCO) respectively.

Our results indicated that MMP-2 gene transcription level did not change in SW626 after transfection of the antisense PCDGF, while MMP-9 decreased, which suggested that activation of MMP-2 was inhibited significantly after PCDGF inhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, 4B</xref>). To make a pilot study whether other factors were involved in, the protein expression levels of CyclinD1 and CDK4 before and after transfection were detected by Western blot method. These observations provide evidence that the protein expression of CyclinD1 and CDK4 in antisense PCDGF transfected cells was much lower than other transfection groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies because of its special characteristics of histology and anatomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Defining more sensitive biomarkers of ovarian cancer may aid in the development of targeted therapeutics. PCDGF was originally identified through studies of the role of autocrine growth factors on the acquisition of tumorigenic properties in teratoma tumors and purified as a secreted growth factor from the highly tumorigenic teratoma PC cells. Biochemical characterization showed that it was an 88-kDa glycoprotein with a 20-kDa carbohydrate moiety, whereas amino acid sequencing showed that PCDGF corresponded to a family of 6-kDa double cysteine-rich polypeptides. The 6-kDa epithelins, originally purified from rat kidney extracts, were shown to be dual growth modulators for a variety of epithelial cell lines. Recently it was reported that PCDGF might play an important role in tumorigenicity, invasion and survival in various tumors such as human breast cancer, adrenal carcinoma, prostatic adenocarcinoma and multiple myeloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Neutralizing anti- PCDGF antibody reversed basal as well as LPA, ET-1 and 8-CPT-induced ovarian cancer cell growth and induced apoptosis, indicating that PCDGF is a growth and survival factor for ovarian cancer, induced by LPA and ET-1 and cAMP/EPAC through ERK1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, studies on expression of PCDGF in ovarian cancer cells and the potential molecular basis of its effects on proliferation and invasion have rarely been reported. Few studies indicated a potential mechanism by cyclin and matrix metalloproteinase.</p><p>In our study we detected mRNA and protein expression of PCDGF in three ovarian cancer cells by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot assays. The results indicated that PCDGF was strongly expressed in SW626 and A2780 cells, whereas it was weakly expressed in SKOV3 cells. The expression levels of PCDGF in three ovarian cancer cells were coincident with their malignant phenotype. Cell growth assay and Boyden chamber in vitro invasion assay were employed to evaluate the capability of proliferation and invasion. The capability of proliferation and invasion showed the same trend: SW626 &#x0003e; A2780 &#x0003e; Skov-3. Bivariate correlation analysis indicated that PCDGF mRNA and protein expression were positively correlated with the capability of proliferation and invasion in ovarian cancer. So we hypothesised that PCDGF may play multiple roles in the process of ovarian cancer occurrence and development as an independent factor, and may be a new molecular target for ovarian cancer.</p><p>To provide a good experimental model for further study of molecular characteristics of PCDGF, the eukaryotic expression vector for PCDGF antisense RNA was constructed successfully, transfected into highly malignant ovarian cancer cell lines by lipofectamine, and then detected by RT-PCR and Western-blot assay. The expression levels of PCDGF mRNA and protein decreased sharply in antisense PCDGF transfected cells as expected, which suggested that antisense PCDGF might be an effective strategy for specific inhibition of PCDGF transcription and translation in ovarian cancer. Then a good cell model for observing the inhibitory effects of antisense PCDGF on their malignant phenotype of ovarian cancer cells was provided. MTT assay and Boyden chamber in vitro invasion assays were employed to examine the effect of PCDGF on proliferation and invasion the capability. Our results demonstrated that ovarian cancer cells transfected with antisense PCDGF grew more slowly and the invasion capability in vitro decreased sharply, compared with the vector transfected cells. In order to rule out the possibility of the non-specific effect, we adopted SiRNA strategy. The proliferation rates and invasion index were decreased in the SW626 cells and A2780 cells after PCDGF SiRNA transfection as expected.</p><p>Interestingly when we introduced antisense PCDGF into less invasive SKov3 cells, cell proliferation rate and invasion index decreased slightly without statistical significance (data not shown), which might indicate that antisense PCDGF worked more efficiently in highly invasive ovarian cancer cells.</p><p>Next we investigated the interrelated mechanism of these effects. Cyclin D1, one of the G1 cyclins, was identified independently from human and murine tumors as a putative proto-oncogene associated with chromosomal translocation, gene amplification, and proviral insertion. Constitutive overexpression of cyclin D1 is likely to contribute to the development of malignancy by reducing the dependency on mitogens and other extracellular signals that are normally required to promote progression through the late G1 restriction point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In our pilot study the protein expression level of CyclinD1 and CDK4 in antisense PCDGF transfected cells were shown to be much lower than empty vector and other control groups. Our results implied that inhibition of PCDGF decreased cell proliferation and invasion through downregulation of cyclin D and CDK 4.</p><p>The changes in the expression and activity of MMP-2 involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix were evaluated by a quantitative RT-PCR method and zymography assay. As we know, invasion across the basement membrane is among the earliest steps of epithelial tumor progression. Matrix metallo-proteinases, a family of zinc-dependent metallo-endopeptidases, are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix, a central element of tumor invasion and metastasis. One of these enzymes, MMP-2, is able to degrade type IV collagen, which is a major component of the basement membrane There was a significant relationship between activated MMP-2 and invasiveness, metastasis, and disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In zymography assays we found that the activated band of MMP-2 disappeared in antisense PCDGF transfected cells, suggesting that the antisense PCDGF vector could inhibit the activation of MMP-2 significantly. At the same time it was demonstrated that the antisense PCDGF did not change MMP-2 gene transcription.</p><p>In conclusion, our present study demonstrated that PCDGF expression level in ovarian cancer cells correlated well with their potential for proliferation and invasion. Inhibition of PCDGF by antisense PCDGF vector could decrease the proliferation and invasion capability markedly, partially reversing their malignant phenotype. Inhibition of PCDGF decreased cell proliferation and invasion through downregulation of cyclin D and CDK 4 and inactivation of MMP-2. Taken together, PCDGF might be a new target for antisense gene therapy of ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our present study demonstrated that PCDGF expression level in ovarian cancer cells correlated well with their capability of proliferation and invasion capability.
