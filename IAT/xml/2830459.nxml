The notion that insulin signaling in adipose tissue is critical in the regulation of lifespan received further support by findings that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), encoded by the mammalian orthologue of SIR2 - a yeast life-extending gene -, inhibits adipogenesis by repressing PPAR-&#x003b3;, an insulin-dependent master regulator of fat cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Guarente1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It has been known for many years that caloric restriction (CR), with adequate nutrition, improves cardiometabolic health, prevents tumorigenesis, and increases life span in experimental animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Weindruch1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

We systematically analyzed Eps8KO mice to unmask possible defects pointing to phenotypes related to human disease. This analysis revealed that Eps8KO mice weigh less than WT mice and are partially resistant to aging and diet-induced obesity. Moreover, Eps8KO mice display a CR phenotype, accompanied by increased insulin sensitivity and an improved metabolic status, which are likely responsible for the increased lifespan observed in Eps8KO mice. This negative energy balance in Eps8KO mice is not caused by decreased food intake or increased energy expenditure, instead it correlates with decreased intestinal absorption and reduced intestinal microvilli length. Thus, the actin remodeler Eps8 is required for proper microvilli morphogenesis and loss of Eps8 in mice leads to altered intestinal function, improved metabolism and increased lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Eps8KO Mice Are Predisposed to Leanness</title><p>Eps8KO mice displayed a significant reduction in bodyweight, when compared to wild-type (WT) mice, something that became much more evident during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) or high-fat diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). To gain insights into the nature of these phenomena, we used Soxhlet analysis to measure whole body fat content and lean body mass in Eps8KO mice. Reduced bodyweight was due to a reduction in both the fat and the lean mass in young and, more pronouncedly, in old Eps8KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). When the weight of individual organs was measured as a fraction of total body weight, however, we observed that for the majority of inner organs there was no significant difference between Eps8KO and WT mice. Instead, a significant reduction in inguinal, epididymal and scapular fat, relative to total body weight, was observed in Eps8KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).

Using the fecal dual isotope method in which the non-absorbable sitostanol serves as an internal normalizer, we observed a significant reduction in oleic acid absorption in Eps8KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Next we measured intestinal absorption using the plasma dual isotope method in which plasma lipases were inhibited to allow accumulation of the absorbed lipids. Oleic acid and triolein (a triglyceride analog) absorption was equally reduced, indicating that the action of intestinal lipases is not impaired in Eps8KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). To address whether the absorption deficit was specific for fat or whether absorption of other nutrients was also impaired in Eps8KO mice, we used the everted sac model. Uptake of <sup>14</sup>C-MDG, <sup>14</sup>C-Gly-Sar was similar in WT and Eps8KO mice, while <sup>14</sup>C-oleic acid uptake was reduced in intestinal sacs from Eps8KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>). Permeability to <sup>3</sup>H-mannitol was negligible throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009468.s002">Fig. S1</xref>). Thus, while sugar and peptide absorption is normal, fat absorption is specifically impaired in Eps8KO mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Energy Expenditure of Eps8KO Mice</title><p>The above data show that reduced food assimilation, in particular fat, is associated with the lean phenotype of Eps8KO mice.

However, this could not be immediately ascribed to increased locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g004">Fig. 4B&#x02013;C</xref>) or to increased metabolic rate when the need for thermogenesis was minimized at the TNZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). One possibility, to explain the increased energy expenditure is that Eps8KO mice invest more than WT in thermoregulation, possibly due to reduced insulation. To gain more insights into this issue, we measured core body temperature (Tb). In Eps8KO mice, there was reduced Tb during the light but not during the dark phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). In addition, we found that, in Eps8KO mice, core body temperature inversely correlated with body weight, while in WT mice no such correlation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that, in Eps8KO mice, energy resources are limited and individual mice allocate available energy resources preferentially either into fat storage or into thermogenesis.

As expected, under conditions of increased caloric intake, core body temperature in Eps8KO mice rose to levels of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>), while it remained unvaried in mice fed a normal diet.

We analyzed the subcellular localization of Eps8 in intestinal cells. We found that EGFP-Eps8, but not EGFP alone, colocalizes with F-actin to the apical membrane of differentiated intestinal Caco-2 cells, suggesting that Eps8 is localized to intestinal microvilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Microvillar localization of Eps8 was confirmed by biochemical fractionation of the intestinal brush border membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009468.s004">Fig. S3</xref>). Thus, we analyzed the morphology of intestinal enterocytes of Eps8KO mice at the ultrastructural level. Microvilli in Eps8KO enterocytes appeared disorganized and were significantly shorter than their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009468-g006">Figure 6E&#x02013;F</xref>). This was not accompanied by a general disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton as assessed by phalloidin staining for F-actin (data not shown). Since microvilli serve to augment the absorptive surface of the intestine, their reduction in Eps8KO mice is compatible with the absorption defect and with the calorie restriction phenotype that we observed in these animals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that the genetic removal in mice of a regulator of actin dynamics, Eps8, leads to a complex phenotype characterized by leanness, improved metabolic status and increased lifespan. All these phenotypes most likely rest on the fact that Eps8KO mice are functionally calorie-restricted.</p><p>Mechanistically, our data are compatible with a model in which the lack of Eps8 causes an alteration in microvillar morphogenesis and hence in the absorptive function of the intestinal brush border. The altered absorptive function of the intestine in turn, leads to a limited but constant reduction in energy intake, which is not compensated by increased food intake. The first result of the reduced energy intake is a reduction in bodyweight with consequent leanness. The reduction in weight is, in part, due to loss of adipose tissue. The concomitant reduction in insulation leads to a greater caloric demand for thermoregulation, which, when combined with the reduced energy intake, causes a CR-like state in the mice over time. As a consequence, insulin sensitivity is increased, glucose levels are lowered, and core body temperature decreases. These phenotypes are characteristic of an improved metabolic status that is most likely responsible for the increased lifespan detected in Eps8KO mice. While this scenario needs further experimental confirmation, first and foremost the reproduction of the phenotype in an intestine-specific KO strain, our results unexpectedly link a well-characterized regulator of actin dynamics to individual variations in bodyweight, metabolic status and longevity, and mark this process as a potential co-determinant in the pathogenesis of obesity and of its co-morbidities.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Eps8 Is Essential for Proper Microvillar Morphogenesis</title><p>Our findings identify the process of microvillar morphogenesis as the most likely initial step in the determination of the lean phenotype of Eps8KO mice. How does Eps8 control this process? Microvilli are highly dynamic structures undergoing constant remodeling through actin treadmilling. Consistently, even when microvilli have reached their final length and become bundled by cross-linkers, actin monomers are continuously added at the barbed end of the actin filaments, facing the microvilli tips, and dissociate from the pointed end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Tyska1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. By controlling this process, actin binding and bundling proteins are crucial regulators of microvillar length and architectural organization, respectively.</p><p>Eps8 is a multimodular actin remodeling protein, exerting both actin barbed end capping and F-actin cross-linking and bundling activity. The switch between these activities is regulated through interaction with its binding partners: association with Abi-1 activates Eps8's capping, association with Irsp53 its bundling activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Disanza1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Disanza2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. A further degree of regulation is exerted by phosphorylation regulating both Eps8's association with F-actin as well as its capping activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Menna1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, Eps8 represents an actin remodeler that can be dynamically regulated to modulate its function. In C.elegans, the bundling activity of Eps8 is essential for microvilli formation, whereas the capping activity is dispensable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Hertzog1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether the same holds true for mammals needs to be demonstrated.

It is worth pointing out that in addition to Eps8 two other Eps8 gene family members, that display similar biochemical activities of Eps8, are expressed in the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Offenhuser1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a further and unexplored level of complexity in the regulation of microvilli growth. Single and combined knockout mice for the various Eps8 family members will be needed to dissect the specific and redundant functions of the Eps8 family members in microvilli morphogenesis.</p><p>How do other actin binding and bundling proteins fit into this picture? <italic>In vitro</italic> work in cell lines had suggested an important role for Villin and Espin, two F-actin bundling proteins, enriched in the intestinal brush border, in microvillus morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Arpin1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-CostadeBeauregard1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Loomis1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, neither knockout mice show any microvillar alterations, suggesting that, <italic>in vivo</italic> the loss of these two proteins is compensated by other F-actin bundlers. Instead, loss of Formin (Plastin 1), an F-actin bundler, which additionally, through its interaction with Keratin19, links the microvillar actin rootlets to the terminal web, leads to shortened microvilli and reduced transmembrane resistance in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-GrimmGunter1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, Formin knockout mice do not show any metabolic alterations. Since in these mice reduced microvilli length is accompanied by increased permeability, it is tempting to speculate that the two alterations balance each other, leading net to normal nutrient uptake.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Determination of the Calorie-Restricted Phenotype of Eps8KO Mice</title><p>Based on our data, we propose that the initiating event in the generation of the complex phenotype of Eps8KO mice is the reduction of the intestinal surface area available for nutrient absorption. However, we detected a specific fat absorption defect in Ep8KO mice, while sugar and peptides were equally well absorbed in comparison to WT mice. One possible explanation for the selectiveness of the defect might reside in the fact that sugars and peptides are transported across the apical surface of enterocytes via specific carriers. Such active transport mechanisms might compensate for the reduction of the transport area, either by increasing their rate or their concentration (although we did not measure these variables directly). Conversely, fatty acids enter via free diffusion, and thus a reduction in surface area would directly impinge on their influx rate.</p><p>A number of issues require further discussion. First, why do Eps8 mice not compensate the reduced absorption by eating more? Food intake is centrally regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Morton1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and Eps8 is expressed in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Offenhauser1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, raising the possibility that alterations in the CNS are at the basis of the phenotype. Although, we did not directly investigate this possibility, it is worth noting that we have previously shown that neuronal Eps8 controls at least one type of behavioral response, i.e. that to ethanol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Offenhauser1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Other, not mutually exclusive, possibilities must also be contemplated. For instance, gut signals - both hormonal and nutrients - feed back to the brain to regulate food intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Murphy1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>; it is possible that the lack of Eps8 could impinge on the regulation of gut-derived signaling to control food intake. Finally, Eps8KO mice might not feel very hungry. The reduction in intestinal absorption is fat specific meaning that normal circulating levels of glucose and amino acids are still available to signal satiety.</p><p>It should also be noted that, despite the fact that Eps8KO mice do not eat more than WT littermates in absolute terms, they do so, when food intake is normalized to bodyweight. This possibly reflects the fact that they react, at least partially, to lower levels of leptin and insulin. The fact that the differences that we observe are rather small raises another interesting point: is the absorption defect sufficient to explain the CR phenotype? The effect of CR on lifespan is observed at 20&#x02013;40&#x00025; reduction in food intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009468-Pugh1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, a condition not likely mimicked by the absorption defect of Eps8KO mice. Thus, other factors possibly contribute to the negative energy balance. From our data, the prime suspect is heat loss, consequent to reduced thermoinsulation due to diminished fat mass, as also supported by the finding that Eps8KO mice invest more than WT littermates for thermoregulation. Reduced absorption and increased heat loss would lead to a slow, but progressive, negative energy balance responsible for the functional CR of Eps8KO mice.</p><p>Finally, and compatibly with their CR phenotype, Eps8KO mice display improved metabolic status, which is the most likely cause of their increased lifespan. Indeed, we could not evidence any alterations in insulin signaling or in ROS production in primary cells derived from Eps8KO mice.
