Clarin 1, the protein product of <italic>CLRN1</italic>, is a four-transmembrane protein predicted to be associated with ribbon synapses of photoreceptors and cochlear hair cells, and recently demonstrated to be associated with the cytoskeleton. To study <italic>Clrn1</italic>, we created a <italic>Clrn1</italic> knockout (KO) mouse and characterized the histological and functional consequences of <italic>Clrn1</italic> deletion in the retina and cochlea. <italic>Clrn1</italic> KO mice do not develop a retinal degeneration phenotype, but exhibit progressive loss of sensory hair cells in the cochlea and deterioration of the organ of Corti by 4 months. Hair cell stereocilia in KO animals were longer and disorganized by 4 months, and some <italic>Clrn1</italic> KO mice exhibited circling behavior by 5&#x02013;6 months of age. <italic>Clrn1</italic> mRNA expression was localized in the retina using in situ hybridization (ISH), laser capture microdissection (LCM), and RT&#x02013;PCR. Retinal <italic>Clrn1</italic> transcripts were found throughout development and adulthood by RT&#x02013;PCR, although expression peaked at P7 and declined to undetectable levels in adult retina by ISH. LCM localized <italic>Clrn1</italic> transcripts to the retinas inner nuclear layer, and WT levels of retinal <italic>Clrn1</italic> expression were observed in photoreceptor-less retinas. Examination of <italic>Clrn1</italic> KO mice suggests that CLRN1 is unnecessary in the murine retina but essential for normal cochlear development and function. This may reflect a redundancy in the mouse retina not present in human retina. In contrast to mouse KO models of USH1 and USH2, our data indicate that <italic>Clrn1</italic> expression in the retina is restricted to the M&#x000fc;ller glia. This is a novel finding, as most retinal degeneration associated proteins are expressed in photoreceptors, not in glia. If <italic>CLRN1</italic> expression in humans is comparable to the expression pattern observed in mice, this is the first report of an inner retinal protein that, when mutated, causes retinal degeneration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Usher syndrome (USH) is a progressive disease affecting two primary senses: vision and hearing. Often by the third decade of life, affected persons have lost the majority of their rod photoreceptors, which leads to night blindness and peripheral vision loss. Similarly, hearing loss often progresses into the third or fourth decade. By the fourth decade, patients typically approach legal blindness and hearing impairment continues to decline. The proteins that when mutated cause USH are frequently found in primary sensory cells, photoreceptor and hair cells, that directly respond to light and sound, respectively. Similar to other forms of USH, the mRNA coding for the protein responsible for USH type 3 (CLRN1) is expressed in cochlear hair cells of the inner ear. However, as demonstrated in the current study, and unlike other USH disease proteins in the retina, we show that the <italic>Clrn1</italic> is expressed in glial cells in the retina (M&#x000fc;ller cells) and is not expressed in the photoreceptors themselves. For reasons that remain unclear, the <italic>Clrn1</italic> knockout mouse does not have a retinal degeneration phenotype but does become deaf soon after birth. In the current paper, we characterize the expression pattern in the retina and analyze the effects of removing the <italic>Clrn1</italic> gene on vision and hearing.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Usher syndrome (USH) is characterized by bilateral combined blindness and deafness, and is the most common cause of the dual sensory deficit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000607-Vernon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, it is interesting to consider the possibility that the shorter splice variant may exhibit distinct biophysical properties and/or functions from its longer, four transmembrane &#x0201c;full-length&#x0201d; counterpart.</p><p>Our results show that although <italic>Clrn1</italic> mRNA can be readily RT-PCR amplified from embryonic, juvenile and adult retina, the mRNA is developmentally down regulated in adult mice. These data suggest that CLRN1 (protein) expression is likely to decrease over the course of retinal maturation, and that CLRN1 is probably translated and expressed at comparably low levels in the adult mouse. It may be that CLRN1 is non-essential to the adult mouse retina, and that CLRN1 serves only a transient (and presumably non-deleterious) role during murine retinal development. We do not currently have <italic>CLRN1</italic> expression data from developing or adult human retina. However, it is intriguing to postulate that the <italic>CLRN1</italic> gene may be differentially regulated in humans. If, in fact, human regulation differs from the mouse with respect to <italic>Clrn1</italic> gene expression, and human retina exhibits (or requires) robust and/or continuous expression into adulthood, it seems reasonable to postulate that humans may develop the characteristic age-related USH3 retinal phenotype whereas mice do not. In other words, humans, but not mice, may have maintained and/or evolved a need for continuous CLRN1 expression in the retina. Another important possibility to consider is that mice, but not humans, express a compensatory protein or utilize a redundant functional pathway that obviates the need for CLRN1 in the mouse retina. Finally, it also seems reasonable to suggest that degeneration in the mouse retina could be dependent upon the expression of gain-of-function mutant CLRN1 proteins, and not simply the loss of CLRN1 altogether, as in the case of the total KO. In this case, the mouse cochlea would remain sensitive to either the absence (KO) or mutation (point mutation or truncation) of CLRN1, whereas the retina would be insensitive in the KO condition, but would degenerate when mutant CLRN1 proteins are expressed. Further studies of animal models exhibiting specific gene alterations, as well as analysis of gene expression in humans, should help to clarify the normal and pathological roles of CLRN1 in these sensory tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The USH3A Gene, <italic>Clrn1</italic>, Is Expressed in M&#x000fc;ller Cells in the Inner Retina</title><p>In situ hybridization and laser capture microdissection indicate that <italic>Clrn1</italic> is expressed in the INL, and not in the ONL (photoreceptors), as our original hypothesis proposed.

It is interesting to note that <italic>Clrn1</italic> deletion results in a broader distribution of longer stereocilia in cochlear IHCs. While degeneration of hair cells and supporting cells is a common phenomenon in hearing impaired mouse mutants, elongation of stereocilia is usually specific to defects in proteins involved in actin polymerization. The elongated stereocilia present in the <italic>Clrn1</italic> mutant mice suggest a similar role. Stereocilia contain a rigid paracrystalline array of parallel and polarized cross-linked actin filaments, whose length is tightly regulated, with continuous actin turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000607-Lin1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Many factors influence the structure of the actin core of stereocilia, including for example, myosin activity and membrane tension. Defects in actin polymerization and/or depolymerization may be caused by a mutation in any one of the factors that this dynamic process is dependent on, including any of actin's known interacting proteins. For example, myosin VIIa is involved in the dynamic regulation of elongation of stereocilia, as demonstrated by stereociliar defects in <italic>Myo7a</italic> mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000607-Prosser1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000607-Rhodes1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>.

Twenty-five to 50 ng of cDNA was used as template in all reactions, and all were amplified for 30 cycles, utilizing a 65&#x000b0;C annealing temperature. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed according to standard thermocycling conditions, using 2.5 mM Mg&#x0002b;&#x0002b;, 200 nM primers, 0.1 U Taq Polymerase, 200 nM dNTPs, and 1X PCR buffer. Cycling conditions were typically 60&#x000b0;C for 30&#x0201d; (annealing), 72&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02032; (extension), and 94&#x000b0;C for 20&#x0201d; (melting) for 30&#x02013;35 cycles.
