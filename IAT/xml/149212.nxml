We have performed luciferase reporter gene assays with promoter constructs comprising the 5&#x02032;-flanking region to identify <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory DNA elements and have mapped the minimal promoter region to 321 bp upstream of the translation start site. We have discovered a functional role for two GC-boxes located in the proximal promoter of the ABCA2 gene that contain overlapping sites for the EGR-1 and Sp1 transcription factors. We observed that oligonucleotides containing overlapping EGR-1&#x0002f;Sp1 sites bind the Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 transcription factors. When BE(2)-M17 cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, we observed inducible expression and binding of the EGR-1 transcription factor to the two GC-boxes. Transfection of Sp1, Sp3 or Sp4 expression constructs into <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 induced a dose-dependent increase in transcriptional activation of the ABCA2 promoter, but transfection of EGR-1 alone failed to activate transcription. When increasing amounts of EGR-1 were transfected into the BE(2)-M17 neuroblastoma cells we observed a dose-dependent decrease in expression of the ABCA2 promoter, although expression of the endogenous ABCA2 gene increased following transfection of EGR-1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporters utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump substrates unidirectionally across membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c1">1</xref>). ABC transporters consist minimally of a membrane-spanning domain (MSB), usually containing six transmembrane segments, which function in substrate recognition, and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) that binds ATP on the cytosolic face of the membrane. The ABC proteins are synthesized either as half transporters with a single MSB and NBD that function as homodimers or as a single polypeptide with two MSBs and NBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c2">2</xref>). The characteristic ABC consensus sequence is comprised of conserved Walker A and Walker B motifs, separated by 90&#x02013;100 amino acids containing a characteristic &#x02018;ABC signature&#x02019; motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c3">3</xref>).</p><p>ABC transporters have been identified that are specific for a variety of substrates, including amino acids, sugars, inorganic ions, polysaccharides, lipids, peptides and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c4">4</xref>). Several ABC transporters have been implicated in human diseases, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor protein (CTFR or ABCC7) and cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c5">5</xref>), the mitochondrial half-transporter (ABCB7) and X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c6">6</xref>), the rod photoreceptor ABC transporter (ABCA4) involved in the etiology of Stargardt&#x02019;s disease and other retinal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c7">7</xref>), and the ABCA1 transporter and Tangier&#x02019;s disease, affecting cholesterol transport and susceptibility to atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c8">8</xref>). The multidrug resistance protein (MDR) and the multidrug resistance-related protein subfamilies are also ABC transporters with demonstrated roles in acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c9">9</xref>).</p><p>This laboratory, investigating the mechanism of acquired resistance of ovarian carcinoma cells to the anticancer drug estramustine, detected a heterogeneously staining region in chromosomal spreads, indicative of gene amplification at position 9q34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c10">10</xref>). Chromosomal mapping has assigned the human ABCA2 gene to position 9q34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c11">11</xref>). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from estramustine-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells revealed that the ABCA2 gene was indeed amplified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c10">10</xref>). We cloned the human ABCA2 cDNA and subsequent northern blot analysis of expression patterns revealed that transcripts were dramatically elevated in the brain relative to other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c12">12</xref>). We further determined the subcellular localization of ABCA2 by immunofluorescence and observed co-localization with the late-endosomal&#x0002f;lysosomal marker lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c12">12</xref>).</p><p>In order to understand the mechanisms responsible for regulating transcription of the ABCA2 gene we have performed studies to identify the basal promoter and DNA regulatory elements. We mapped the basal promoter to 321 bp upstream of the ATG start codon and demonstrated a functional role for two GC-boxes containing overlapping early growth response protein-1 (EGR-1) and Sp1 binding sites that bind several of the Sp-family factors and the EGR-1 transcription factor and regulate transcription of the promoter. This work represents the first functional characterization of a mammalian ABCA2 transporter promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Isolation of the 5&#x02032; flanking region of human ABCA2 gene</title><p>A human cosmid library in pWE15 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was screened using a 1015 bp template generated by RT&#x02013;PCR on a human brain cDNA template (Clontech) and the probe radiolabeled with &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCTP using the Radprime kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Approximately 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> colonies were screened. The colonies were lysed and the DNA denatured on the filters by sequential incubations for 15 min in denaturing solution (0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl), neutralizing solution (1 M Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5) and wash solution (1 M Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5, 1.5 M NaCl). The DNA was fixed to the filters by UV crosslinking (Stratalinker; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Filters were hybridized with the radiolabeled probe overnight at 65&#x000b0;C in buffer containing 0.5 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 7&#x00025; SDS, and 1&#x00025; BSA, 2 mg&#x0002f;ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed twice for 15 min each at room temperature in 40 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5&#x00025; SDS, and 0.5&#x00025; BSA, twice for 30 min each in NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1&#x00025; SDS and once for 30 min in 1&#x000d7; SSC, 0.1&#x00025; SDS. Filters were exposed to X-ray film and autoradiographed.

S1 nuclease mapping of the ABCA2 transcription start site was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c13">13</xref>). Briefly, a sense primer 5&#x02032;-CCGGATGCCTCTGGGAGA AGAG-3&#x02032;, located in the 5&#x02032;-flanking DNA, 422 bp upstream of the ATG translation start codon, was 5&#x02032; phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and PCR performed on 479 bp template of cloned human genomic DNA spanning the putative transcription start site with the above phosphorylated primer and an antisense primer 5&#x02032;-GCGTTTGAGCG TCACGTTCTTCCA-3&#x02032;, located 57 bp downstream of the ATG start codon, to generate a phosphorylated 479 bp double-stranded PCR product. Two micrograms of the PCR product was digested with &#x003bb; exonuclease (Invitrogen) in 67 mM glycine&#x02013;KOH pH 9.4, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml BSA at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min to generate the antisense single-stranded DNA.

Total RNA from BE(2)-M17 neuroblastoma cells (100 &#x000b5;g) was hybridized with the radiolabeled antisense probe (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> c.p.m.) in 80&#x00025; formamide, 0.4 M NaCl, 0.2 M PIPES, pH 6.5 at 55&#x000b0;C overnight. S1 nuclease digestion buffer, 30 mM sodium acetate pH 4.6, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM zinc acetate, 5&#x00025; (v&#x0002f;v) glycerol and S1 nuclease (100 U; Invitrogen) were added to the hybridization mixture and digestion performed at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The protected fragment was precipitated, resuspended in 90&#x00025; formamide, 5 mM EDTA, 0.05&#x00025; bromophenol blue, 0.05&#x00025; xylene cyanol, boiled for 5 min and loaded on a 6&#x00025; polyacrylamide&#x02013;7 M urea sequencing gel. The &#x003c6;X174 <italic>Hin</italic>f DNA ladder was radiolabeled with &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP (10 mCi&#x0002f;ml; Amersham) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> c.p.m. loaded on the gel. The 479 bp cloned template DNA was sequenced using the antisense primer radiolabeled with &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP (10 mCi&#x0002f;ml; Amersham) and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). Following electrophoresis the gel was dried and autoradiographed using a Fuji phosphorimager.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p><italic>Neuroblastoma cells</italic>.

For electrophoretic mobility shift analysis experiments, where indicated, cells were serum starved for 16 h and then were treated with 50 ng&#x0002f;ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 1 h before the preparation of nuclear extracts.</p><p><italic>Drosophila S2 cells</italic>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider 2 cells were obtained from Invitrogen and maintained in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Expression System (DES) medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum and 100 mg&#x0002f;ml streptomycin&#x0002f;penicillin at 25&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p><italic>Cloning of ABCA2 5</italic>&#x02032;-<italic>flanking DNA and construction of 5</italic>&#x02032; <italic>nested reporter deletions.</italic> The ABCA2 cosmid clone was digested with <italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Mlu</italic>I restriction enzymes and the fragments were subcloned into the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate plasmid p-5780, extending from 5780 bp upstream to 396 bp downstream of the ATG start codon of exon 1B. The ATG start codon was mutated to ATT to ensure that translation initiated at the ATG start codon present in the luciferase reporter gene using the QuickChange&#x02122; XL site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). The primers for the mutagenesis were upper, 5&#x02032;-GCC<bold>ATT</bold>GGCTTCCTGCACCAG-3&#x02032;, lower, 5&#x02032;-GAAGC C<bold>AAT</bold>GGCGGGGCCACG-3&#x02032;, and mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The 5&#x02032; nested reporter deletion constructs were generated by sequential enzymatic activities of exonuclease III, S1 nuclease, Klenow and T4 DNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c14">14</xref>). Briefly, the reporter plasmid p-5780 was digested sequentially with <italic>Mlu</italic>I and <italic>Sac</italic>I to linearize the plasmid and generate a 5&#x02032;-overhanging end that is susceptible to <italic>Exo</italic>III digestion and a 3&#x02032;-overhanging end that is resistant to <italic>Exo</italic>III digestion. Timed samples were removed from the <italic>Exo</italic>III digestion buffer, blunt ended with S1 nuclease and Klenow, recircularized by ligation with T4 DNA ligase and the plasmids were cloned into DH5&#x003b1; <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> competent cells (Invitrogen) to generate the 5&#x02032; nested reporter deletion library.</p><p><italic>Mutagenesis of EGR-1 and Sp1 sites in GC-boxes of ABCA2 promoter</italic>. For mutagenesis of EGR-1 and Sp1 transcription factor binding sites in GC-boxes 1 and 2 of the ABCA2 promoter, we used the QuickChange&#x02122; XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. The template for mutagenesis was the p-321 luciferase reporter construct that contained the ABCA2 promoter 5&#x02032;-flanking sequence extending from 321 bp upstream of the ATG translation start site to 396 bp downstream of the ATG start site and that contained both GC-boxes with overlapping EGR-1 and Sp1 sites. The primers used for mutation of the Sp1 site on GC-box 1 were upper primer, 5&#x02032;-GGCG<bold>TT</bold>CGGGGCGCGGGCAGAG-3&#x02032;, lower primer, 5&#x02032;-CCCG<bold>AA</bold>CGCCCCCGCTTAAAGG-3&#x02032;; for the Sp1 site on GC-box 2, upper primer, 5&#x02032;-CCGAGCGC<bold>AA</bold>CGCCCC CGCGCG-3&#x02032;, lower primer, 5&#x02032;-GGGCG<bold>TT</bold>GCGCTCGGG CGTCCG-3&#x02032;; for the EGR-1 site on box 1, upper primer, 5&#x02032;-TTAAGC<bold>TA</bold>GGGCGGGCGGGGC-3&#x02032;, lower primer, 5&#x02032;-CGCCC<bold>TA</bold>GCTTAAAGGCGCCG-3&#x02032;; for the EGR-1 site on box 2, upper primer, 5&#x02032;-CCC<bold>AT</bold>GCGCGGGCGATGCC-3&#x02032;, lower primer, 5&#x02032;-GCGC<bold>AT</bold>GGGCGGGGCGCTC-3&#x02032;. The 50 &#x000b5;l PCR mixture contained 10 ng of the p-321 plasmid DNA and 10 pmol of the upper and lower primers. The PCR cycling conditions were 95&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 18 cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 50 s, annealing at 66&#x000b0;C (Sp1) or 62&#x000b0;C (EGR-1) for 50 s and extension at 68&#x000b0;C for 20 min, and a final extension at 68&#x000b0;C for 7 min. The PCR products were digested with 2 &#x000b5;l of <italic>Dpn</italic>I for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C to eliminate the parental plasmid DNA. The <italic>Dpn</italic>I digested plasmid DNA was transformed into XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells and isolated plasmid DNA was isolated (Qiagen Maxiprep, Qiagen) and DNA sequenced to identify clones containing the desired mutation.</p><p><italic>Synthesis and cloning of transcription factor expression constructs</italic>.

Briefly, 4 &#x000b5;g of nuclear extract were incubated with radiolabeled probes (4 ng) for 30 min at room temperature in a 20 &#x000b5;l binding reaction containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5&#x00025; glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mg&#x0002f;ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1&#x00025; Nonidet P-40 and 12.5 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml poly(dI-dC). For competition studies, 50-fold molar excesses of unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were added to the binding reactions as indicated and incubated for 30 min at room temperature before addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. For antibody super-shift experiments, 4 &#x000b5;g of rabbit anti-peptide antibodies to Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 or EGR-1 were added as indicated to binding reactions and incubated for 1 h on ice before addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes and incubation for an additional 30 min at room temperature.

Using a cDNA probe generated by PCR comprising &#x0223c;1 kb of the 5&#x02032; end of the cDNA we isolated several positive clones that were characterized further. One clone, containing an insert of &#x0223c;30 kb, was partially sequenced and comparison with the ABCA2 cDNA sequence suggested that it contained the 5&#x02032;-flanking DNA including the putative ABCA2 promoter. Potential transcription factor binding sites were evaluated by employing the Transcription Factor Element Search Software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c17">17</xref>) that utilizes transcription factor binding site consensus sequences included in the TRANSFAC database. In a region comprising &#x02013;549 to &#x0002b;397 relative to the ATG start codon, we detected putative binding sites for multiple transcription factors, including hepatic nuclear factor-3 (HNF-3), c-myc, activating protein 1 (AP1), and two GC-rich boxes at &#x02013;195 and &#x02013;108 bp, respectively, containing overlapping binding sites for the EGR-1 and Sp1 families of transcription factors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg192f1">1</xref>). Analysis of the sequence in a region comprising 1 kb, from &#x02013;604 to &#x0002b; 397 relative to the ATG start codon, reveals that the putative ABCA2 promoter lacks a TATA-box and is contained within a CpG island. This region is extraordinarily GC rich, and has a G&#x0002b;C content of nearly 80&#x00025; (0.791) and the CpG&#x0002f;GpC ratio is 0.882 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c18">18</xref>), which exceeds the 0.6 threshold for designation as a CpG island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c19">19</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription start site mapping</title><p>To determine the ABCA2 transcription start site, we employed S1 nuclease mapping by hybridization of a 479 bp radiolabeled antisense DNA probe that spanned the putative start site to total RNA and subsequent digestion of the single-stranded non-overlapping regions with S1 nuclease. A 152 bp protected fragment was evident following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg192f2">2</xref>) that maps the major start site to a region 95 bp upstream of the ATG start codon, although several weakly protected fragments were also evident, suggestive of multiple transcription start sites that are common in the promoters of many GC-rich TATA-less housekeeping genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional activity of the human ABCA2 promoter</title><p>We investigated the regulation of the ABCA2 promoter by generation of a series of progressive 5&#x02032; deletion reporter gene constructs that extended from over 5 kb upstream to 396 bp downstream of the ATG translation start site in the pGL3 luciferase expression vector and subsequent transfection of these promoter constructs into the neuroblastoma cell line BE(2)-M17 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg192f3">3</xref>). We selected the BE(2)-M17 neuroblastoma cell line for ABCA2 expression studies because we have previously demonstrated elevated expression of ABCA2 transcripts in the human brain by northern blot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c12">12</xref>), the mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2A line exhibited elevated expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c11">11</xref>) and by RT&#x02013;PCR analysis we measured elevated ABCA2 transcript levels in the BE(2)-M17, among the human neuroblastoma cell lines evaluated (data not shown). Analysis of these reporter constructs revealed that a region 321 bp upstream and 397 bp downstream of the ATG start codon was sufficient to provide &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of the transcriptional activity of the ABCA2 promoter, i.e., relative to the maximal expression observed in these studies for the p-403 reporter construct. Further deletion to &#x02013;103 bp reduced expression by over 60&#x00025; from the level of the p-321 basal promoter and deletion beyond &#x02013;103 bp virtually abolished expression (&#x0223c;10&#x00025; residual activity). Inspection of the DNA sequence in the basal promoter revealed two GC-boxes with overlapping EGR-1&#x0002f;Sp1 transcription factor binding sites at &#x02013;195 bp (GC-box 1) and &#x02013;108 bp (GC-box 2), respectively. We should note that deletion to &#x02013;103 and subsequent religation of the deletion construct regenerates the Sp1 site of the GC-box at position &#x02013;108 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg192f1">1</xref>), and this accounts for similar expression levels observed for the p-112 and p-103 constructs.</p></sec><sec><title>Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and EGR-1 factors bind to GC-box 1 and GC-box 2</title><p>In order to evaluate whether the overlapping Sp1&#x0002f;EGR-1 sites present in the two GC-boxes of the basal promoter bind these transcription factors, we performed gel mobility shift assays (EMSA) using GC-box 1 and GC-box 2 &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes and nuclear extracts from neuroblastoma BE(2)-M17 cells. We observed several prominent retarded complexes using GC-box 1 or GC-box 2 radiolabeled probes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg192f4">4</xref>). Virtually identical results of binding assays were observed for both GC-box probes and the results are presented for GC-box 2. Previous reports have demonstrated the appearance of an EGR-1 activity following cell culture in the presence of the phorbol ester PMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c21">21</xref>). When we cultured the neuroblastoma cells for 1 h in the presence of 50 ng&#x0002f;ml PMA before preparation of the nuclear extracts, we detect the appearance of a putative EGR-1-containing complex following EMSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg192f4">4</xref>). To confirm the specificity of protein binding to the Sp1&#x0002f;EGR-1 sites, we performed oligonucleotide competition experiments. In these experiments an unlabeled oligonucleotide is incubated with the nuclear extract prior to the addition of the radiolabled GC-box probe. When extracts were incubated with unlabeled Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides before addition of radiolabeled GC-box 2 probe, putative Sp-family transcription factor binding was dramatically reduced. Similarly, when unlabeled EGR-1 consensus oligonucleotides were added, the putative EGR-1 transcription factor binding was abrogated. A faster migrating complex that was competed with all unlabeled oligonucleotide probes was detected that we believe to be a non-specific complex. Competition studies using the unlabeled GC-box 2 probe decreased binding of both putative Sp-family and EGR-1 factors to the radiolabeled GC-box 2 probe. Mutation of the EGR-1 binding site of the box 2 competitor probe while maintaining the wild-type Sp1 site reduced putative Sp-family binding and failed to compete putative EGR-1 protein binding. Alternatively, mutation of the Sp1 site of the box 1 competitor probe while maintaining the wild-type EGR-1 site specifically reduced putative EGR-1 binding while only moderately affecting putative Sp-family binding. Mutation of both EGR-1 and Sp1 sites of the GC-box 2 competitor probe failed to compete with the radiolabeled probe for binding to either EGR-1 or Sp-family transcription factors. These findings suggest that Sp-family and EGR-1 transcription factors bind to both GC-box elements in the ABCA2 basal promoter. Additionally, the results of these gel-shift experiments indicate that the binding of Sp-family and EGR-1 proteins to the overlapping EGR-1&#x0002f;Sp1 sites was mutually exclusive, i.e., double occupancy of the GC-box probes simultaneously by these factors was not observed. We base this conclusion on the observation that there was no shift in the mobility of the individual complexes that remain after addition of the competitor oligonucleotides. To confirm the identity of the specific Sp-family and EGR-1 transcription factors that bind to GC-boxes 1 and 2, we employed antibody super-shift experiments. When the nuclear extract was incubated with an EGR-1-specific antibody before addition of the radiolabeled GC-box 2 probe, the EGR-1 protein complex was specifically super-shifted to a slower migrating species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg192f5">5</xref>). Experiments using antibodies to other family members, EGR-2, EGR-3, EGR-4 and Wilms&#x02019; Tumor protein-1, failed to shift any of the complexes (data not shown). Antibodies to Sp1 specifically shifted the Sp1-containing complex and antibodies to Sp3 resulted in the specific loss of complexes at &#x0223c;110 kDa and two faster migrating complexes of &#x0223c;60&#x02013;70 kDa that migrate as a duplex. It appears that the antibodies specifically block the binding of the Sp3 proteins to GC-box 1 probes. The mobility of the Sp-family member complexes that we observe in our experiments is consistent with the results reported in numerous studies evaluating these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c22">22</xref>). Antibodies to the Sp4 transcription factor also resulted in the specific loss of the Sp4-containing complex, which may be due to antibody blockade of Sp4 binding to GC-box 2 probes. When Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies are used together, the Sp1 and Sp3 complexes are specifically targeted. Similarly, when Sp1 and Sp4 or Sp3 and Sp4 are used together, their respective complexes are specifically targeted. Antibodies to the Sp2 transcription factor failed to super-shift or reduce protein binding in any of the complexes (data not shown). Virtually identical results were observed in antibody super-shift experiments with GC-box 1 probes. These experiments indicate that the Sp-family transcription factors Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 bind GC-boxes 1 and 2 and that following PMA stimulation of the neuroblastoma cells, EGR-1 also binds these elements present in the ABCA2 basal promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Overlapping Sp1&#x0002f;EGR-1 elements regulate ABCA2 promoter activity</title><p>In order to demonstrate a functional role for the overlapping EGR-1&#x0002f;Sp1 binding sites of the two GC-boxes in regulating ABCA2 promoter activity we mutated the EGR-1 and Sp1 sites to abrogate transcription factor binding and evaluated the effects on expression of the p-321 basal reporter construct in BE(2)-M17 neuroblastoma cells. Mutation of both EGR-1 sites in GC-boxes 1 and 2 did not significantly reduce expression of the promoter compared to the wild-type p-321 basal promoter construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg192f6">6</xref>). The mutation of both Sp1 sites in GC-boxes 1 and 2 reduced expression by &#x0223c;60&#x00025;, which was additive to the effect observed when the individual Sp1 sites were mutated. Mutation of EGR-1 and Sp1 elements in GC-box 1 resulted in a &#x0223c;20&#x00025; reduction in expression; however, when both EGR-1 and Sp1 sites of GC-box 2 were mutated, expression was reduced by &#x0223c;90&#x00025;. The 90&#x00025; reduction in expression is similar to that observed in reporter deletion experiments for the construct deleted beyond GC-box 2 (p&#x0002b;102). The sum of these findings suggest that both GC-boxes are functional in regulating expression of the basal ABCA2 promoter, that the GC-box 2 element is responsible for the majority of transcriptional activity, and that the Sp1 sites play a greater role under basal conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Sp-family transcription factors activate the ABCA2 promoter in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells</title><p>In order to evaluate the role of Sp-family transcription factors and EGR-1 in regulating transcription of the ABCA2 promoter, we co-transfected increasing amounts of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and EGR-1 expression constructs together with the p-321 basal promoter reporter construct into <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells.

The promoter region is GC rich and lacks a TATA-box element and is contained within a CpG island that is common for many housekeeping genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c18">18</xref>). Transcription start site mapping by S1 nuclease protection identifies a major transcription start site 95 bp upstream of the translation start site.</p><p>We show that the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 can bind to the Sp1 binding site of both GC-boxes by oligonucleotide competition and antibody super-shift experiments. Further, we show that when neuroblastoma cells are cultured in the presence of the phorbol ester PMA, an additional binding activity to GC-boxes 1 and 2 is detected that we identify to be the EGR-1 transcription factor. The results of mutation of Sp1, EGR-1 or both sites in GC-box 1 and 2 reveal that both GC-boxes are functional in regulating expression of the ABCA2 promoter and that the Sp1 sites play a greater role under basal conditions. Additionally, we show that both the EGR-1 and Sp1 sites in GC-box 2 are required for the majority of promoter activity because mutation of both sites reduced basal expression of the promoter by 90&#x00025;. These findings suggest that mutation of both elements in GC-box 2 essentially abrogate any role for Sp factors in mediating basal expression. Alternatively, under basal conditions, cooperative interactions between Sp factors and additional proteins that bind these elements in GC-box 2 may be required for transcription from the human ABCA2 promoter.</p><p>A growing number of genes have been identified that contain GC-boxes with overlapping EGR-1 and Sp1 factor binding sites, including the human tissue factor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c24">24</xref>), the human EGR-1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c25">25</xref>), the human synapsin I gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c26">26</xref>), the murine adenosine deaminase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c27">27</xref>), the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c20">20</xref>) and the receptor tyrosine kinase human Flt-1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c21">21</xref>).</p><p>The Sp-family of transcription factors includes Sp1, Sp2, Sp3 and Sp4 that are all structurally similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c22">22</xref>). The DNA-binding domain is comprised of three highly conserved zinc fingers near the C-terminus and glutamine-rich activation domains at their N-terminus. They also contain serine&#x0002f;threonine residues that are the targets of phosphorylation that affect DNA binding. The Sp-factors bind to the DNA sequence 5&#x02032;-GGGGCGGGG-3&#x02032; with equal affinity (with the exception Sp2) and although most show ubiquitous distribution in cell lines and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c29">29</xref>) the Sp4 factors exhibit expression predominantly in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c30">30</xref>) and we observe that forced expression of Sp4 elevates ABCA2 expression in the BE(2)-M17 neuroblastoma cell line. The Sp1 factor functions as an activator of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c23">23</xref>) although it can also function as a &#x02018;superactivator&#x02019; by the synergistic activity of Sp1 proteins in promoters that contain multiple GC-boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c31">31</xref>). Our results also suggest the synergistic activation of the ABCA2 basal promoter by the cooperative interaction of proteins that bind to the Sp1 sites of GC-boxes 1 and 2 as evidenced by the additive effect of repression of promoter expression when the Sp1 sites of both GC-boxes 1 and 2 are mutated to abrogate Sp-family factor binding. The Sp3 factor exists as three isoforms of 110&#x02013;115 kDa, and two 60&#x02013;70 kDa that arise by translational initiation at internal AUG codons resulting in N-terminal truncations of the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c32">32</xref>). We detect the binding of all three Sp3 isoforms to both of the Sp1 sites of GC-boxes 1 and 2 by gel-shift analysis. The role of Sp3 as an activator or repressor of transcription of genes is currently unresolved, as there are many reports for both activities. Evidence suggests that <italic>in vivo</italic> its function may be due to the structure and arrangement of Sp-recognition sites as well as by cell type-specific differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c33">33</xref>). Our experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells suggest that Sp3 is a strong activator of the ABCA2 basal promoter. The EGR-1 transcription factor &#x0005b;also known as NGFI-A, Zif268, krox24 and TIS8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c38">38</xref>)&#x0005d; is a member of a transcription factor family that contain three zinc fingers and binds the DNA sequence 5&#x02032;-GCGGGGGCG-3&#x02032;, each finger contacts three bases within this sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c39">39</xref>). These genes were initially characterized by their rapid synthesis in response to treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor, which induces their subsequent differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c40">40</xref>). As a result these proteins were termed &#x02018;early growth response&#x02019; analogous to the immediate-early genes, which include transcription factors that are rapidly induced following viral infection. A role for EGR-1-regulated transcription has been identified in EGR-1-deficient mice that have a deficiency in the neuropeptide, luteinizing hormone (LH) whose transcription is mediated by an EGR-1 binding site present in the LH&#x003b2; promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c41">41</xref>). Additionally, EGR-family members have been implicated in the transcription of genes whose expression is critical for the establishment and maintenance of neuronal plasticity, e.g. long term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c40">40</xref>). Whether EGR-1 functions as a transcriptional activator or repressor appears also to be gene dependent and examples of its role as an activator of transcription, multidrug resistance gene 1 (<italic>MDR1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c42">42</xref>), human tissue factor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c24">24</xref>), Flt-1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c21">21</xref>) or as a repressor of transcription, murine adenosine deaminase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c27">27</xref>), <italic>Pgp2&#x0002f;mdr1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c43">43</xref>), &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c44">44</xref>) are both well documented. Our evidence suggests that for the human ABCA2 promoter, EGR-1 functions as a transcriptional repressor, as forced expression of the factor resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of Sp-mediated transcription of the promoter in the neuroblastoma cell line. Interestingly, when the binding site of EGR-1 was mutated to abrogate binding we observed a further repression of the promoter expression. This suggests that EGR-1 binding to its cognate site is not required for transcriptional repression when the factor is overexpressed. Evidence for reciprocal modulation between Sp1 and EGR-1 through binding of EGR-1 to its own site or the Sp1 site, displacing Sp1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg192c45">45</xref>) is consistent with our observations for its role in repression of Sp-mediated transcriptional activation of the ABCA2 promoter. Paradoxically, forced expression of EGR-1 in neuroblastoma cells results in an elevation in expression of the endogenous ABCA2 gene, as measured by northern blot. There are several possible explanations for these apparently contradictory findings. The ABCA2 gene may contain EGR-1 sites that lie outside the promoter region characterized that function to activate ABCA2 expression. Alternatively, the forced expression of EGR-1 may elevate the levels of additional transcription factors that act on sites outside of the basal promoter to increase ABCA2 expression. We also observed an increase in expression of the ABCA2 gene following treatment of cells with PMA (data not shown), which is consistent with the effect of PMA on elevation of EGR-1 binding activity to the GC-boxes that we report in the gel-shift experiments. Whereas the evidence presented here suggests that effect of EGR-1 on the basal promoter as characterized is repressive to ABCA2 expression, the net effect of EGR-1 on expression of the ABCA2 gene will be a function of the inducing stimulus and the sum of effects of transcription factors acting on elements that regulate its expression.</p><p>In summary we have performed the first functional characterization of a mammalian ABCA2 transporter gene promoter and have mapped the basal promoter necessary for transcription and demonstrated a functional role for two GC-boxes containing overlapping EGR-1&#x0002f;Sp1 binding sites. We have also shown that PMA can induce binding of the EGR-1 transcription factor to its cognate site, which suggests that PMA-responsive signaling pathways may regulate the endogenous activation of this gene. The Sp-family and EGR-1 transcription factors have been shown to activate numerous genes required for cell proliferation and differentiation and those stimuli that elevate the levels of these factors are also expected to be correlated with elevated ABCA2 levels. Inasmuch as the ABCA2 gene shares significant sequence and putative structural homology to the ABCA1 gene and given the dramatic elevation of ABCA2 expression in the brain relative to ABCA1 or other cloned ABC transporters, the ABCA2 gene may have significant involvement in brain homeostasis or degenerative disease states as well as in mediating response to drugs used in chemotherapy. Future work will focus on the identification of endogenous ABCA2 transport substrates that are required for normal cell functions.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg192f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Human ABCA2 5&#x02032;-flanking DNA from &#x02013;549 to &#x0002b;397 bp relative to ATG translation start site.
