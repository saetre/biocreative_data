These microorganisms may belong to more than 500 different bacterial species, although 99% of the total community consists of only 30&#x02013;40 species. The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in human health as they contribute to inhibiting pathogen colonization, boosting the immune system, and metabolising nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Alterations in the intestinal microbiota have also been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, as well as to other immune-related disorders. IBD patients have been shown to carry higher concentrations of mucosa-associated bacteria than control groups. In addition, the gut microbiota of these patients was characterized by a decrease in protective bacteria, such as <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, and an increase in harmful bacterial groups like <italic>Bacteroides </italic>and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. This phenomenon has been named "dysbiosis" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli </italic>was the first bacterial specie to be identified in human gastrointestinal samples. This widespread commensal Gram-negative bacterium found in the intestinal tract of healthy individuals can occasionally cause intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. The pathogenic potential of <italic>E. coli </italic>stains could be influenced by host endogenous factors, as well as by the genetic structure and ecological distribution of the strains in a particular host. Human infections by <italic>E. coli </italic>strains commonly occur in immuno-compromised individuals or when the normal gastrointestinal barrier is broken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], enabling opportunistic pathogens to evade host surveillance mechanisms. Phylogenetic studies based on the analysis of 38 metabolic enzymes, have shown that <italic>E. coli </italic>strains fall into four main phylogenetic groups, denominated "A", "B1", "B2" and "D" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Strains causing extra-intestinal infections mainly belong to group B2, and to a lesser extent to group D, whereas commensal <italic>E. coli </italic>strains mostly belong to A and B1 groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>E. coli </italic>strains belonging to B2 and D groups carry more virulence-associated genes than strains from A and B1 groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, the presence or absence of certain <italic>E. coli </italic>strains or an altered distribution of their relative abundance can enhance the pathogenic potential of the enteric population in predisposed individuals.</p><p>Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathology triggered by the ingestion of wheat-gluten and similar proteins of rye, barley and, probably, oats. Coeliac disease can be present at any age with a variety of clinical features; however, typical cases manifest in early childhood with gastrointestinal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In coeliac patients, the inflammatory milieu caused by gluten antigens could lead to imbalances in gut microbial composition, characterised by higher numbers of Gram-negative bacteria and decreased numbers of beneficial Gram-positive bacteria, as compared to healthy individuals. In previous studies, <italic>E. coli </italic>proportions were significantly higher in duodenal biopsies of active coeliac patients than in controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; moreover, a similar trend was detected in faeces although the differences were not so remarkable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, little is known about the possible association between enterobacterial population and coeliac disease pathogenesis.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to determine whether intestinal <italic>Enterobacteriaceae </italic>populations of active and non-active coeliac patients and healthy children differ in diversity and virulence-gene carriage, so as to establish a possible link between the pathogenic potential of enterobacteria and the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and sampling</title><p>Thirty-one children were included in this study, 10 active coeliac patients, on a normal gluten-containing diet, showing clinical symptoms of the disease, positive coeliac serology markers and signs of severe enteropathy by duodenal biopsy examination (mean age 3.86 years, range 1.0&#x02013;8.86 years); 10 symptom-free coeliac patients (non-active coeliac), who had been on a gluten-free diet for 1&#x02013;2 years (mean age 6.2 years, range 1.0&#x02013;12.0 years); and 11 healthy children without known food intolerance (mean age 3.51 years, range 0.1&#x02013;7.75 years). None of the children included in the study had been treated with antibiotics for at least 1 month before the sampling time. Faecal samples were collected and immediately stored at 4&#x000b0;C, under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroGen, Oxoid, Hampshire, UK), and analysed in less than 12 hours. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee, and children were enrolled in the study after written informed consent was obtained from their parents.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and identification of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae </italic>clones from faeces</title><p>Faecal samples (2 g wet weight) were 10-fold diluted in phospahate-buffered saline (PBS, 130 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, [pH 7.2]), and homogenized in a Lab Blender 400 Stomacher (Seward Medical, London, UK). Serial dilutions were made in PBS and aliquots were plated on Violet Red Bile Dextrose Agar, VRBD (Scharlau, Barcelona, Spain) and incubated under aerobic conditions at 37&#x000b0;C for 48 hours. Then, five individual <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>-like colonies differing in size, shape, colour or mucoid appearance on VRBD agar were isolated and subcultured in Plate Count Agar (Scharlau, Barcelona, Spain) under aerobic conditions at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 hours. The identity of the presumptive <italic>Enterobacteriaceae </italic>isolates was confirmed by conventional microbiological methods, including colony and cellular morphology and Gram staining.

A piece of a bacterial colony was collected directly from a plate and added to the reaction mixture as a source of DNA. The PCR programme was as follows: initial denaturalization at 94&#x000b0;C for 4 min; and 30 cycles of 5 s at 94&#x000b0;C, 10 s at 59&#x000b0;C; and a final extension step of 5 min at 72&#x000b0;C. The PCR products were separated in a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualised by ethidium-bromide staining. The isolates were assigned to phylogenetic groups as follows: ChuA<sup>+ </sup>YjaA<sup>+</sup>, group B2; ChuA<sup>+</sup>YjaA<sup>-</sup>, group D; ChuA<sup>- </sup>TspE4C2<sup>+ </sup>group B1; ChuA<sup>- </sup>TspE4C2<sup>- </sup>group A.</p><p>The same isolates were also characterized by two sets of multiplex PCR as described by Nowrouzian et al.

Furthermore, the distribution of these genes was either less remarkable or bore no relationship with coeliac disease.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Prevalence percentage of virulence-associated genes in A+B1 commensal (grey bars) and B2+D virulent (black bars) <italic>E. coli </italic>groups.</bold> Data are expressed as percentage (number of positive clones/number of total analysed clones). *Significant difference at <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 by applying the Fisher's exact test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-230X-8-50-2"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Significant differences were revealed in the diversity and virulence-gene carriage of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae </italic>and <italic>E. coli </italic>clones isolated from faeces of active and non-active coeliac patients and healthy controls, suggesting that this bacterial group could be primarily or secondarily involved in coeliac disease.</p><p><italic>E. coli </italic>was the most common member of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae </italic>family isolated from human faecal samples of healthy and coeliac disease children. This result is consistent with a previous study of 49 coeliac and healthy children, in which the main <italic>Enterobacteriaceae </italic>species detected was <italic>E. coli</italic>. In the aforementioned study, the ratio of <italic>E. coli </italic>to <italic>Enterobacteriaceae </italic>was greater in active coeliac children than in healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, biopsy specimens taken from paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease also revealed that <italic>E. coli </italic>was the most common <italic>Enterobacteriaceae </italic>species detected in MacConkey agar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, a reduction in the relative abundance of non-<italic>E. coli </italic>species is associated with coeliac disease and could favour the predominance of harmful clones in the gut ecosystem.</p><p>Although several <italic>Enterobacteriaceae </italic>colonies were often selected from a sample, because they differed morphology and were suspected to represent different strains, they often turned out to be identical regarding their phylogenetic classification and virulence-associated gene patterns, usually some of them represented the same clone. This can be explained by the fact that only one clone usually dominates human gastrointestinal gut so that the other clones are not detectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2 and D were found in different proportions in healthy, active coeliac and non-active coeliac patients. This fact also suggests links between lower diversity of intestinal <italic>E. coli </italic>population and coeliac disease. In healthy children, isolates of each of the four groups were found in equal proportions. By contrast, isolates belonging to groups A and B2, followed by those of group D dominated the composition of <italic>E. coli </italic>microbiota in active coeliac children, while integrants of group B1 were not isolated; group D was the most common in non-active coeliac disease, followed by groups A, B2, and B1. These results reflect imbalances in the composition of the four <italic>E. coli </italic>phylogenetic groups in coeliac disease children, revealing the most remarkable differences between non-active coeliac patients and healthy controls. In patients with IBD, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, B2 and D phylogenetic groups were more prevalent than in the control group. Moreover, a relationship was established between the presence of serine protease autotransporter proteins (SPATE) or adhesins in B2+D-positive <italic>E. coli </italic>isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In active coeliac patients, the dominance of group B2 virulent clones could provide pathogenic inflammatory factors either causative or consequence of the inflammatory status associated with gluten intake in the active phase of this disorder creating a vicious circle. Nowrouzian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] concluded that group D strains preferentially colonize infants with less complex intestinal microbiota, since this group is more abundant than others in one-year-old infants. Both genetic make-up and gluten-free diet could contribute to changes in the gut milieu of non-active coeliac patients, leading to a predominant colonization of the virulent D group in detriment to the others. In fact, lower total bacterial populations have been detected in duodenal samples taken from this population group when compared with active coeliac patients and controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Overall, <italic>E coli </italic>clones of the virulent phylogenetic groups (B2+D) isolated from active and non-active coeliac patients, carried a higher number virulent genes than those from healthy controls. A higher prevalence of P fimbriae gene (<italic>papC</italic>) was found in coeliac patients as compared to healthy children, regardless of the phase of this disorder; however, the association of type-1 fimbriae (<italic>fimA</italic>) and S fimbriae (<italic>sfaD/E</italic>) gene carriage with coeliac disease was not so evident. Significant differences in the carriage of type-1 fimbriae (<italic>fimA</italic>) gene were not detected in the group of children under study but <italic>E. coli </italic>clones from active and non-active coeliac disease isolates tended to carry fewer type-1 fimbriae (<italic>fimA</italic>) genes than those from healthy children. Previous studies have indicated that the proportion of type-1 fimbriated <italic>E. coli </italic>is lower in IgA-deficient subjects than in control individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and this may also be the case for coeliac disease patients since this disease is associated with IgA deficiency. <italic>E. coli </italic>adhesins, including P fimbriae, confer mannose-resistant (MR) adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. MR adhesions are well-know virulence factors in urinary-tract infection, septicaemia and meningitis. Strains that persist in the human intestinal microbiota (resident strains) are more often P fimbriated, whereas S fimbriated <italic>E. coli </italic>are not associated with long-term persistence in the gut of healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, the significantly higher prevalence of P fimbriae <italic>E. coli </italic>clones in treated and untreated coeliac patients constitutes a novel link between gut microbiota and coeliac disease, and revealed that gut health may be compromised in these subjects, even when subjected to a gluten-free diet.</p><p>A higher prevalence of capsular K5 gene (<italic>kfiC</italic>) of <italic>E. coli </italic>clones belonging to the virulent groups was associated with active coeliac disease, while a similar but less remarkable trend was found in non-active coeliac patients, as compared to controls. Capsular polysaccharides are known to render bacterial surfaces hydrophilic and negatively charged, making the bacterium resistant to entrapment in mucus. In addition, capsules contribute to virulence by protecting bacteria from phagocytosis and possibly from serum killing, in part by blocking activation of the alternative complement pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, a higher prevalence of the haemolysin (<italic>hlyA</italic>) gene in <italic>E coli </italic>clones of the virulent groups was associated with non-active coeliac patients in particular. &#x003b1;-Haemolysin is the most common cytolytic protein secreted by haemolytic <italic>E. coli </italic>strains. Haemolysin activity might contribute to persistence by attacking enterocytes and releasing nutrients for the bacteria. In fact, <italic>E. coli </italic>appears to use membrane lipids as its main nutrient source in the large intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>It has also been confirmed that <italic>E. coli </italic>clones of the virulent groups (B2 + D) carried more virulent-associated genes than those of commensal groups (A + B1), with the exception of the aerobactin gene (<italic>iutA</italic>). Remarkably, genes for S (<italic>sfaD/E</italic>) and P fimbriae (<italic>papC</italic>), K5 capsule (<italic>kfiC</italic>) and haemolysin (<italic>hlyA</italic>) were significantly more common in virulent <italic>E. coli </italic>clones than in commensal strains of our population groups. In agreement, genes coding for virulence-associated genes have been found more frequently in pathogenic strains than in commensal strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, virulent <italic>E. coli </italic>isolates (B2 + D) have previously been shown to carry virulence-associated genes more commonly than commensal clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Virulence-associated genes are usually encoded on pathogenicity islands (PAIs) providing a mechanism for coordinated horizontal transfer of virulence genes, thus favouring dissemination of pathogenic determinants, as could be the case in the gut ecosystem of coeliac patients [27].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has demonstrated changes in <italic>Enterobacteriaceae </italic>diversity and increases in virulence-gene carriage in <italic>E. coli </italic>clones isolated from coeliac patients when compared to those from healthy controls. Thus, the results support the hypothesis that dysbiosis may constitute a virulence factor contributing to pathogenesis and full expression of coeliac disease. Further studies should be carried out to correlate the virulence gene carriage with specific pathogenic roles that <italic>E. coli </italic>clones could play in this disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ES and IN carried out the microbiological, molecular and statistical analyses.
