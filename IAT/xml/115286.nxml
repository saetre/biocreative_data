We describe the resolution of delta helicase from pol delta on heparin&#x02013;agarose chromatography and its purification to apparent homogeneity by affinity purification on single-stranded DNA&#x02013;cellulose chromatography, unique-sequence RNA&#x02013;agarose chromatography, and ceramic hydroxyapatite chromatography. Delta helicase isolated from fetal bovine thymus had an apparent <italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub> of 115 kDa in SDS&#x02013;PAGE, and photo-crosslinked to &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP. Tandem mass spectrometry peptide mass data derived from the bovine polypeptide matched to human UPF1 (HUPF1), a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; RNA and DNA helicase, and a requisite component of the mRNA surveillance complex. Antisera against HUPF1 cross-reacted with delta helicase on western analysis, and delta helicase activity was immunoinactivated by pre-incubation with antibodies to HUPF1, suggesting that delta helicase is the bovine homolog of HUPF1.

Helicases are nucleic acid-dependent NTPases that unwind duplex nucleic acids by translocating unidirectionally along one strand, either 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032;, thus displacing the other strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c3">3</xref>). It is widely believed that hydrolysis of the nucleoside triphosphate fuels the helicase translocation, by driving the energetically unfavorable disruption of the stable hydrogen bonds between duplex nucleic acid strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c6">6</xref>). Many of the known helicases have been shown to be active as oligomers, either hexamers or dimers, whereas some appear to be active as monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c4">4</xref>). Interest in this class of enzymes has been heightened by the ever-growing list of human diseases attributed to defects in genes encoding DNA helicases, e.g. Cockayne&#x02019;s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c7">7</xref>), xeroderma pigemtosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c7">7</xref>), Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c8">8</xref>), Werner&#x02019;s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c9">9</xref>) and Rothmund&#x02013;Thompson syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c10">10</xref>). All of these diseases are characterized by genomic instability and predisposition to various forms of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c12">12</xref>).</p><p>Faithful and timely replication of the genome is essential for cell viability. This has been shown to require DNA helicase(s) to open replication origins as well as to unwind duplex DNA at replication forks in several model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c13">13</xref>). DnaB, a hexameric 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; DNA helicase, is the replicative helicase in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c15">15</xref>). The identity of the replicative helicase(s) in eukaryotes is still unknown, however, it may prove to be the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) proteins that have recently been shown to be required for replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c16">16</xref>) as well as for initiation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c17">17</xref>).</p><p>RNA helicase activities are required for many RNA processes including transcription, translation initiation and splicing, as well as for transcript stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c18">18</xref>). Several helicases have been reported to have little or no substrate specificity, and can thus utilize duplex RNA or DNA as substrates, e.g. nucleolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c19">19</xref>), nuclear DNA helicase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c20">20</xref>), SV-40 large T-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c2">2</xref>), eIF-4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c2">2</xref>) and yeast Upf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c21">21</xref>), an ATP-dependant 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; helicase required for mRNA surveillance or nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). The NMD pathway ensures that unproductive mRNAs are not translated by selectively degrading mRNAs containing premature termination codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c23">23</xref>). Yeast NMD requires several genes, including <italic>up-frameshift 1</italic> (UPF1), UPF2 and UPF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c24">24</xref>). The NMD pathway and the requisite helicases involved are conserved across the eukaryotes from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c25">25</xref>). The human homolog of yeast Upf1 is the human UPF1 (HUPF1) helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c26">26</xref>). HUPF1 has been reported to have an ATP-dependent 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; DNA helicase activity, and ATPase activity dependent on RNA or DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c27">27</xref>). At least in the yeast model, NMD requires an appropriately positioned downstream element (DSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c28">28</xref>). Further, it has been reported that yeast DSEs must be bound by a heteronuclear ribonuclear protein (hnRNP), Hrp1&#x0002f;Nab4, which interacts with Upf1 to facilitate NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c29">29</xref>). All of the DSEs studied in yeast thus far have contained an invariant core nucleotide sequence, GAUG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c30">30</xref>).</p><p>In this report we describe the purification of delta helicase, an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that co-purifies with DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) through a number of chromatographic columns, but separates from pol delta on heparin&#x02013;agarose chromatography. The helicase has been shown to have a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; directionality and a strong preference for a fork-like DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c31">31</xref>). Delta helicase was thought to be a candidate for a replicative DNA helicase because of its substrate preference and its association with pol delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c31">31</xref>). In an effort to identify the cDNA encoding delta helicase, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity from fetal bovine thymus and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, the resulting peptide mass data derived from the bovine polypeptide matched HUPF1. In addition, western analyses, immunoinactivation studies and comparisons of biochemical characteristics indicated that delta helicase is the bovine homolog of HUPF1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>&#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;dTTP was obtained from ICN.

The bovine peptide mass data that were consistent with HUPF1(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf323f6">6</xref>, red letters) encompassed 36.3&#x00025; of the HUPF1 protein sequence and included both putative zinc finger motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf323f6">6</xref>, ZnFr1 and ZnFr2) and five of the seven helicase domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf323f6">6</xref>, motifs Ia, Ib, IV, V, VI). Several of the residues known to be invariant in the Superfamily I helicases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf323f6">6</xref>, bold letters) are also included in the bovine peptide sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf323f6">6</xref>, red letters).

The heparin&#x02013;agarose purified delta helicase sample was used because it was the first purification fraction assayed for ATP-dependent helicase activity, and would therefore have to contain any other detectable helicase(s) that might be present. The control antibodies were pre-immune antibodies, antibodies against the N-terminal one-third of the 125-kDa subunit of pol delta, and antipeptide antibodies against the 66-kDa subunit of pol delta.

The bovine tryptic peptide mass data that matched to HUPF1 encompass more than one-third (36.3&#x00025;) of the total HUPF1 sequence, and these consistent regions include five of the seven conserved helicase domains and both of the unique putative zinc finger motifs. The identification by &#x000b5;LC&#x0002f;MS&#x0002f;MS peptide analysis of delta helicase as the bovine UPF1 polypeptide was supported by comparison of the physical and enzymatic properties of bovine delta helicase with those of both human and yeast Upf1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf323tb1">1</xref>), by immunoinactivation studies, and by western analyses. In order to corroborate that delta helicase is the bovine homolog of HUPF1, and to demonstrate the presence of bovine UPF1 at all steps of the delta helicase purification, antiserum to the N-terminal 266 residues of HUPF1 was used in western analyses of pooled samples from the delta helicase purification. The data clearly indicate that bovine UPF1 was present in all purification samples (data not shown).</p><p>Human and yeast Upf1 are members of the Superfamily I group of helicases. Both the human and yeast enzymes contain two unique putative zinc finger motifs near their N-terminal ends. These zinc fingers are unique because they have unusually long intervening stretches of amino acids between the coordinating cysteine&#x0002f;histidine residues. One of these two motifs contains an extra pair of conserved cysteine residues known as a zinc finger&#x0002f;knuckle motif, found in proteins with dual roles as both RNA and DNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c39">39</xref>). Both of the zinc finger motifs are found in yeast Upf1 and HUPF1, as well as in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> homolog, SMG-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c40">40</xref>), whereas they are not found in any of the other Superfamily I helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c26">26</xref>). It is of interest that bacteriophage T7 gene 4 primase&#x0002f;helicase contains a similarly placed zinc finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c41">41</xref>) and the HSV-1 helicase-primase has a single, unusually large zinc finger at the C-terminal end of the UL52 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c42">42</xref>).</p><p>The significance of the physical interaction of the third subunit of pol delta with HUPF1 is not presently clear, even though we have demonstrated an <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction between p66 and HUPF1. An interaction between pol delta and HUPF1 might imply a role for HUPF1 in DNA replication or repair, a role for p66 in mRNA surveillance, or a possible sequestering function for one enzyme or the other, such as that seen with the WRN protein recruiting pol delta to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c43">43</xref>). In fact, it was previously reported that the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> homolog of mammalian p66, Pol32, was required for the functional interaction of pol delta with WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c44">44</xref>). Pol32 was also found to interact both genetically and physically with a DNA repair helicase, Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c45">45</xref>). Additionally, a helicase involved in <italic>Schizosarccharomyces pombe</italic> DNA replication, Dna2, was reported to interact both genetically and physically with the <italic>S.pombe</italic> p66 homolog, Cdc27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c46">46</xref>). Our western analyses indicate that p66 co-elutes with HUPF1 on heparin&#x02013;agarose chromatography, and our co-immunoprecipitation data strongly suggest an interaction between p66 and HUPF1. However, the possibility of mammalian Upf1 having a physiologically relevant interaction with pol delta is complicated by the difference in the subcellular locations of these two proteins. The nuclear processes that pol delta is known to be involved in, DNA replication and DNA repair, are segregated from the cytoplasmic process that Upf1 has been shown to be required for, i.e. mRNA surveillance. It has been reported that yeast Upf1 is associated with polysomes in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c47">47</xref>), and the subcellular location of the mammalian enzyme is also reported to be cytoplasmic by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c48">48</xref>) and western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c49">49</xref>). However, it is possible that a small amount of HUPF1 could be present in the nucleus. HUPF1 has a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c50">50</xref>), and it was suggested that nonsense-mediated decay occurs both in the cytoplasm and in association with the nucleus in mammalian cells. Other evidence that the translation machinery functions within the mammalian nucleus includes a report that the presence of a premature termination codon, which would be recognized by translation machinery, can influence co-transcriptional events within the nucleus of mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c51">51</xref>), and a recent report that 10&#x02013;15&#x00025; of cellular translation is coupled to transcription within the nucleus of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c52">52</xref>). These studies suggest the possibility that mammalian Upf1 is, at least in part, localized in the nucleus and is therefore able to interact with mammalian p66. It has recently been shown that murine Upf1 is required for the cellular viability of embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c53">53</xref>). Considering that Upf1 is non-essential in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c54">54</xref>), the absolute requirement for murine UPF1 may indicate another critical function for mammalian UPF1 in addition to its function in NMD. In a recent study in which co-localization of p66 with PCNA and the catalytic subunit of pol delta was examined in the nucleus of S-phase HeLa cells, it was found that the majority of p66 did not co-localize with these proteins at replication foci, nor did all replication foci contain p66 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c55">55</xref>). The third subunit of pol delta has now been identified in fission yeast (Cdc27), budding yeast (Pol32) and mammalian cells (p66). Cdc27, the product of an essential gene in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, has been shown to co-purify with the catalytic and second subunits of the enzyme and to be required for interaction of pol delta with its processivity factor, PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c56">56</xref>). <italic>POL32</italic>, on the other hand, is not an essential gene in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, and pol delta can be isolated from budding yeast as either a heterodimer or heterotrimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c57">57</xref>). Although the third subunit (Pol32) is not required for interaction of PCNA with pol delta in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, it stabilizes the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c58">58</xref>). In mammals, it has been reported that the third subunit of pol delta (p66) is absolutely required for interaction of the enzyme with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c59">59</xref>). However, in the present study we have demonstrated that calf thymus p66 is readily separated from the core pol delta heterodimer (p125&#x0002f;p50) by chromatography on heparin&#x02013;agarose, although it co-eluted with the core polymerase during earlier purification steps. Furthermore, complete removal of p66 from the heterodimeric pol delta had no effect on its ability to functionally interact with PCNA. These findings raise the question as to whether p66 is an integral component of mammalian pol delta.</p><p>The 57&#x02013;65-kDa proteins that co-eluted with helicase activity on ssDNAc chromatography were identified as bovine hnRNP L by sequencing of the full-length polypeptides and CNBr generated fragments. This identification was confirmed by western analysis with a monoclonal antibody raised against human hnRNP L. Numerous purification strategies were unsuccessful at resolving this major contaminant from bovine UPF1, including chromatography on cationic exchange resins, anionic exchange resins, hydroxyapatite, ssDNAc, polyU&#x02013;agarose and ATP&#x02013;agarose, as well as gel filtration (data not shown). The only method which was found to be successful in resolving hnRNP L and bovine UPF1 was sequence-specific RNA-affinity chromatography which selectively retained hnRNP L. The RNA sequence utilized to construct this chromatography matrix was reported to interact with hnRNP L specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c38">38</xref>). A member of the yeast hnRNP family, Hrp1&#x0002f;Nab4, has been reported to physically interact with Upf1, and to be required for binding to a DSE for NMD to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c29">29</xref>). Furthermore, the invariant DSE core sequence was found to be GAUG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c30">30</xref>), the first 4 nt in the 119-nt RNA sequence that binds hnRNP L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c38">38</xref>). Our data further suggest that hnRNP L and HUPF1 may physically interact, specifically the co-elution of HUPF1 and hnRNP L on both heparin&#x02013;agarose and ssDNAc affinity chromatography. These three pieces of circumstantial evidence, taken together, suggest that mammalian hnRNP L may be performing an analogous function to Hrp1&#x0002f;Nab4, and this would suggest that the mechanism of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is highly conserved between yeast and mammalian cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been reported that some of the genes involved in NMD are conserved between yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c60">60</xref>), <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c40">40</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf323c60">60</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf323f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Elution profiles of pol delta and delta helicase activities on heparin&#x02013;agarose chromatography.
