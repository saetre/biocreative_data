Questions whether SIRT3 is truly mitochondrial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Scher1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and whether the existing mSIRT3 cDNA is complete have therefore been raised.</p><p>We set out to look for novel transcripts of mSIRT3. An <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of mSIRT3 cDNA sequences predicted the presence of a splice variant that introduces two potential translational start sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Cooper1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> upstream of the one described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Shi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Yang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These potential start sites Met1 and Met15, correspond to Met1 and Tryp15, respectively, in the human SIRT3 gene. Here we describe the localization and proteolytic processing of the newly predicted proteins from cDNAs cloned from mouse 3T3 cells and compare their subcellular localization to the protein expressed from the existing mSIRT3 cDNA. In 3T3 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes the two longer mSIRT3 isoforms M1 and M2, beginning from Met1 and Met15, respectively, are mitochondrial and are both proteolytically processed to a form that corresponds in size to endogenous mSIRT3. The previously reported mSIRT3 isoform, which was over-expressed in mouse adipocytes, and was previously reported to be mitochondrial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Shi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, shows a distinct cytoplasmic distribution that is not consistent with mitochondrial localization. Moreover, it is shorter in size than the endogenous, processed mSIRT3.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>The mSIRT3 isoform predicted by Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Yang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and used in over-expression studies by Shi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Shi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> begins from a methionine codon corresponding to position 143 in the human SIRT3 amino acid sequence. This implies that the mouse SIRT3 protein is significantly shorter than its human counterpart. In a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Cooper1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, we questioned the mitochondrial localization of this truncated protein, examined the available mSIRT3 sequence data and found evidence of a SIRT3 splice variant that included two potential translational start sites at Met1 and Met15, corresponding to Met1 and Tryp15 of the human SIRT3 gene. Here, using a specific oligo that overlapped with the mSIRT3 stop codon, we made cDNA from polyA RNA isolated from mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Subsequent PCR and cloning using the same reverse oligo and a forward oligo complementary to the region of exon 1B containing the predicted M1 start codon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Cooper1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> yielded 2 distinct cDNAs. These two cDNAs are distinguished by the insertion of an additional 8 bp at the 5&#x02032;extremity of exon 2 in splice variant 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This 8 bp is present in the originally suggested major mRNA/cDNA suggested by Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Yang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. It would theoretically induce a frameshift in the translation of mSIRT3 initiated at the level of either Met 1 or Met 15 resulting in termination of translation at codon 66. In our hands, cloning and sequencing of 17 randomly selected cDNA clones yielded 9 clones without the 8 bp insertion (Genbank accession FJ621493), thus coding for the predicted full length protein, while 8 clones had the 8 bp insertion predicted to cause premature termination at codon 66. These findings suggest that at least in 3T3 cells both splice variants were present in roughly equal proportions.</p><fig id="pone-0004986-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004986.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the coding sequence of mSIRT3 splice variants.</title><p>Met1 (M1) and Met15 (M2) are in exon 1B (E1B) (nomenclature according to Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Yang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>), Met78 (M3, equivalent to M143 in hSIRT3) in exon 2 (E2). M1 and M2 were cloned from cDNA derived from mouse NIH3T3 cells using exon 1B specific forward primers (1F and 2F in picture) and a reverse primer that included the sequence for the FLAG epitope-tag, binding at exon 7. Similarly, the second splice variant that can only result in an mSIRT3 protein when translation initiates at the third ATG (for M3) was obtained using the 1F and reverse oligo. Predicted proteins M1, M2 and M3 are indicated with a wave-line.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004986.g001"/></fig><p>To further study the different mSIRT3 proteins encoded by these different cDNAs, we generated three constructs. Two distinct constructs were generated from splice variant 1 using in the first case Met1, and in the second case Met15 as the initiation codon (primers 1F and 2F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The third construct was generated from splice variant 2 but using primer 1F (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). It thus included the Met 1 and Met15 initiation codons as well as the frameshift sequence leading to termination at codon 66. Translation from the mRNA of the splice variant 2 construct should yield an mSIRT3 protein which starts at the equivalent of the human Met143 (mSIRT3 Met78) and lacks a mitochondrial leader peptide. The protein products encoded by the three constructs will hereafter be referred to as M1, M2 and M3, respectively (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). All three constructs included a 3&#x02032; in frame sequence for the FLAG epitope-tag.</p><p>To determine the subcellular localization of the different mSIRT3 isoforms, we used immunofluorescence in transiently transfected cells. Both M1 and M2 showed clear mitochondrial localization in 3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g002">Fig 2 a,b</xref>), which was further confirmed by co-staining with Mitotracker&#x000ae; Red. Despite the presence of two ATGs followed by a stop codon at position 66, the M3 construct generated a protein, which was detected using the FLAG antiserum. This would indicate that the cDNA encoded a protein starting at the third methionine. The protein encoded by this construct, called M3, showed a non-mitochondrial uniform cytosolic and sometimes nuclear staining with some clusters in case of (rare) high levels of over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g002">Fig 2c</xref>). Based on the immunofluorescence, M3 was generally expressed at lower levels than M1 and M2 and a much lower number of cells could be identified as clearly positive. We conclude that the proteins M1 and M2, starting from translational start sites at Met1 and Met15, respectively, yield proteins that are mitochondrial, whereas the shorter M3, which is the previously predicted full-length mouse Sirt3 protein, is not targeted to mitochondria.</p><fig id="pone-0004986-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004986.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Mouse SIRT3 variants M1 and M2 show mitochondrial localization, whereas M3 does not.</title><p>Three FLAG-tagged mSIRT3 variants M1, starting at Met1 (A), M2, starting at Met15 (B) and M3, starting at Met78 (C), were over-expressed in mouse 3T3 cells.

M3, on the other hand is more uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm and does not show mitochondrial localization.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004986.g002"/></fig><p>We studied the expression profile of the mSIRT3 isoforms by Western blot using either an antibody against the FLAG epitope tag for the detection of over-expressed FLAG-tagged variants or an antibody specific for mouse SIRT3 for the detection of endogenous and over-expressed proteins. Human SIRT3 has previously been shown to be cleaved into an enzymatically active form by mitochondrial processing peptidase MPP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004986-Schwer2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression from both the M1 construct (starting at Met1) and the M2 construct (starting at Met15) could be detected as 2 major forms: an uncleaved precursor (indicated by arrows &#x02018;M1&#x02019; and &#x02018;M2&#x02019;, respectively) and an identical processed form (indicated by &#x02018;proM1&#x02013;2&#x02019;), which corresponded in size to the endogenous protein (including the epitope tag). This expression pattern was seen upon over-expression in 3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g003">Fig 3A</xref>, right part for &#x02018;endogenous Kozak&#x02019;), and was more clearly visible in mouse hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g003">Fig 3B</xref>) as well as in human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The M2 variant seemed to be processed more efficiently than M1. This conclusion is based on the observation that the ratio of the cleaved form versus the uncleaved precursor appeared higher for M2 compared to M1 in all cell types examined. Especially in 3T3 and HEK293 cells, the precursor protein from the M2 construct was often barely visible (see panels 3A and C) unless expression was boosted by replacing the endogenous sequence upstream of the start codon by a consensus Kozak sequence, as can be seen in the left part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. Introduction of the consensus Kozak, in particular into the M2 construct, helped to clearly identify the precursor and cleaved form of the M2 protein in 3T3 cells. The full-length M1-encoding vector also gave rise to a protein, which was the same size as the precursor protein expressed from the M2-encoding vector. This observation suggests that translation also initiated at Met15 in the M1 construct; at low levels in 3T3 cells and mouse hepatocytes but seemingly at much higher levels in HEK293 cells. Accumulation of uncleaved precursor was also clearly detected in human cells over-expressing full length hSIRT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g004">Fig 4</xref> and not shown), suggesting that this is not a peculiarity of the mouse SIRT3 protein but rather something that SIRT3 proteins from various species have in common.</p><fig id="pone-0004986-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004986.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Over-expressed variants M1 and M2 appear in two forms.</title><p>FLAG-tagged mSIRT3 variants M1, M2 and M3 were expressed in 3T3 cells (A) and primary mouse hepatocytes from both wild type and ko-mice (B) while both FLAG-tagged M1&#x02013;3 and untagged M1 and M2 were expressed in HEK293T cells (C). Crude mitochondrial lysates (3T3 cells, panel A) or total cell lysates (mouse hepatocytes and HEK293T cells, panels B and C) were analysed by western blot with an anti-FLAG antibody and an antibody against mSIRT3 as indicated in the various panels. In an attempt to boost expression, all three variants were also analyzed in 3T3 cells only, using constructs into which we introduced a consensus Kozak sequence, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;CCACC</named-content> (using PCR cloning), immediately upstream the respective ATG for M1&#x02013;3 (Left part of panel A). A mouse liver extract was run alongside the HEK293T derived samples (panel C) to denote the size of endogenous mSIRT3 (indicated by &#x02192;&#x02018;endogenous&#x02019;). Similarly, non-transfected wild-type (wt) and mSirt3 knock-out (ko) mouse hepatocytes were run along transfected samples to clearly detect the endogenous protein (panel B, &#x02192;&#x02018;endogenous&#x02019;).

Translation of M2 but not M1 or M3, was greatly improved with the consensus Kozak sequence (panel A). M2 was processed more efficiently than M1 (all three panels). M2 processing may even account for all of the processed over-expressed protein in M1 lanes, since the M1 construct was also transcribed to yield a band the size of M2 in all cell types (all panels).

Furthermore, over-expression of non-tagged versions of M1 and M2 in 293T cells showed processed proteins larger than the FLAG-tagged M3 but identical in size to endogenous mouse liver SIRT3.

PCR amplification of cDNA used the NotI/FLAG-mSirt3R and one of the following forward oligos to amplify cDNA from the M1 or M2 codon from within exon 1B (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and main text): HindIII-M1-mSirt3- <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTT AAG CTT ATT CGG ATG GCG CTT GAC CC-3&#x02032;</named-content>; HindIII-M2-mSirt3- <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTT AAG CTT AGC ATC ATG GCG CTA AGC GG-3&#x02032;</named-content>. PCR used standard conditions with Pfu polymerase and the amplified cDNA was initially cloned using Zero-blunt cloning (Invitrogen), and selected clones partially sequenced to identify those cDNAs that did or did not include the 8 bp extension to exon 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004986-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Fully sequenced clones for both splice variants were subsequently recloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) using the HindIII/NotI restriction sites. All subsequent recloning, e.g. to introduce a consensus Kozak and/or stop codon used these original clones and standard PCR and cloning methods. All constructs were completely sequence verified.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Cell culture and transfections</title><p>HEK293T cells and NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) (Sigma) with 2 mM L-glutamine (Cambrex Biosciences) and 10&#x00025; FCS (foetal calf serum) (Euroclone) unless stated otherwise.

(A) Similar amounts of total cell and crude mitochondrial lysates from cells expressing mSirt3 variants M1-3 from plasmids with endogenous Kozak sequences 5&#x02032; of the respective ATG start codons. (B) Samples from cells expressing mSirt3 variants M1-3 from plasmids with consensus Kozak sequences 5&#x02032; of the respective ATG start codons. To illustrate the quality of mitochondrial lysates, membranes were reprobed to detect the cytosolic marker protein gamma-Actin (polyclonal antibody from Novus Biologicals) and the mitochondrial marker protein subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase (COXI, monoclonal antibody from Invitrogen). These results illustrate the poor expression of the M3 variant in 3T3 cells as it is not clearly visible in mitochondrial nor in total cell lysates. The only modest enrichment of the mSirt3 proteins in the mitochondrial lysates is typical for transient over-expression of mitochondrial proteins. Transient expression in our experience always results in a mosaic of expressing cells with a considerable population of cells expressing transgenes at such high levels that they show cytosolic clustering (reminiscent of inclusion body formation in bacterial expression) and aberrant targeting.
