Although the crystal structure of Kv1.2 provided the first atomic resolution view of a eukaryotic Kv channel, several components of the voltage sensors remain poorly resolved. In particular, the position and orientation of the charged arginine side chains in the S4 transmembrane segments remain controversial. Here we investigate the proximity of S4 and the pore domain in functional Kv1.2 channels in a native membrane environment using electrophysiological analysis of intersubunit histidine metallic bridges formed between the first arginine of S4 (R294) and residues A351 or D352 of the pore domain. We show that histidine pairs are able to bind Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with high affinity, demonstrating their close physical proximity. The results of molecular dynamics simulations, consistent with electrophysiological data, indicate that the position of the S4 helix in the functional open-activated state could be shifted by &#x0223c;7&#x02013;8 &#x000c5; and rotated counterclockwise by 37&#x000b0; along its main axis relative to its position observed in the Kv1.2 x-ray structure. A structural model is provided for this conformation. The results further highlight the dynamic and flexible nature of the voltage sensor.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Voltage-dependent K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (Kv) channels are formed by the assembly of four protein subunits encompassing a central aqueous pore allowing for selective K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> permeation across the lipid membrane. Each subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments (S1&#x02013;S6), the first four segments (S1&#x02013;S4) constitute the voltage sensor domain, while the last two segments (S5&#x02013;S6) from each of the four subunits form the pore domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bezanilla, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hille, 2001</xref>). Upon membrane depolarization, the four voltage sensor domains undergo a conformational change promoting the opening or the closing of the ion permeation pathway, a process referred to as &#x0201c;voltage gating&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sigworth, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bezanilla, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hille, 2001</xref>). Four highly conserved positively charged arginine residues within the transmembrane segment S4 have been identified as being predominantly responsible for the gating charge controlling the voltage activation of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seoh et al., 1996</xref>). Accessibility data show that membrane depolarization causes the S4 segment to move toward the extracellular side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larsson et al., 1996</xref>). However, voltage gating is obviously a very complex process involving multiple intermediate conformations of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zagotta et al., 1994</xref>). At a simple level, the process may be conveniently discussed in terms of two dominant states: a closed or resting conformation in which the four voltage sensors are resting in the &#x0201c;down&#x0201d; position and ion conduction through the central pore is blocked, and an open or active conformation in which the four voltage sensors are activated in the &#x0201c;up&#x0201d; position in which the central pore is opened to allow ion conduction.</p><p>Even though there remains significant uncertainty about the nature of the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pathak et al., 2007</xref>), there is now a broad consensus concerning the overall three-dimensional structure of Kv channels in the open-activated state. This was confirmed from the x-ray structure of the Kv1.2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2005</xref>), which is in agreement with what had been previously deduced on the basis of a wide range of structural, functional, and biophysical experiments using the homologous <italic>Shaker</italic> K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel in its open-activated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laine et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2004</xref>). First, the voltage sensor domain is formed by a bundle of four anti-parallel transmembrane helices, S1&#x02013;S4, packed counterclockwise with their N- and C-terminal ends exposed alternatively to the intra and extracellular solution and second, the voltage sensor makes contact with the adjacent subunit pore domain in the clockwise direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laine et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>One striking feature revealed by the x-ray structure is the modular nature of the voltage sensor formed by S1&#x02013;S4. In part, this explains why only a small number of specific interactions of the voltage sensor with the pore domain of Kv channels have been identified experimentally before the determination of the x-ray structure of the Kv1.2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elinder et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gandhi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soler-Llavina et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, a high affinity intersubunit His&#x02013;Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;His metal bridge engineered in <italic>Shaker</italic> between R362 in S4 and A419 in S5 was discovered to greatly stabilize the channel in the open-activated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laine et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that those two residues are in close atomic proximity. Paradoxically, the corresponding residues R294 and A351 in the x-ray structure of Kv1.2 are relatively distant from one another, with a C&#x003b2;&#x02013;C&#x003b2; distance of 13.7 &#x000c5;. At first view, it seems that the backbone of S4 might need to translate by at least 5&#x02013;7 &#x000c5; to allow the formation of the bridge.</p><p>Whether such a discrepancy is indicative of structural distortions induced by the engineered metal bridge, deviations in the crystal environment, or genuine differences between <italic>Shaker</italic> and Kv1.2, is unclear. In fact, relatively large lateral fluctuations are displayed by the voltage sensor and a tendency to shift toward a shorter distance between R294 and A351 has been observed in previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the Kv1.2 channel in a membrane environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Treptow and Tarek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jogini and Roux, 2007</xref>). This suggests that the extracellular parts of S4 and S5 might alter their relative positions without causing costly structural distortions when the channel is in its membrane environment. The recent x-ray structure of a chimeric Kv1.2 channel in the presence of lipids, comprising the S3b&#x02013;S4 segment from Kv2.1, provides an additional piece of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Long et al., 2007</xref>). The distance between the C&#x003b2;&#x02013;C&#x003b2; of corresponding residues in the chimera structure is 10.7 &#x000c5;, shorter than the 13.7 &#x000c5; in the Kv1.2 structure. However, the equivalent residue to R294 in the chimera structure is actually a neutral glutamine (Q290). In spite of the difference in sequence, the shorter distance is suggestive of the structural variability in the relative position of S4 and S5 in Kv channels.</p><p>The goal of the present study is to examine the possibility of engineering a histidine&#x02013;histidine metal bridge between the voltage sensor domain and the pore domain in Kv1.2, and to use this information to refine our knowledge of the open-activated conformation of functional Kv channels in the membrane environment. Mutant Kv1.2 channels were engineered with site-directed mutagenesis and assayed electrophysiologically in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. In addition, computational models of the various mutants were constructed and simulated with MD. The experimental methods and simulation methodology are described in the next section. In the following sections, the results are first given and then discussed.

The procedure to construct the model of Kv1.2 was described previously in Jogini and Roux (2007). In brief, the missing coordinates of the Kv1.2 channel were constructed using the structural information from the crystal structure of the Kv1.2 channel (PDB id 2A79) and of the isolated voltage sensor of the KvAP channel (PDB id 1QRS). For the S1&#x02013;S2 linker, the residues 185&#x02013;214 were not included, and for the S3&#x02013;S4 linker, the residues 282&#x02013;286 were deleted in accord with experimental data, indicating that such deletions are not detrimental to the channel function. To complete the missing parts of the crystal structure we used structural alignments and mutagenesis functional data to assign the residues forming the S1 and S3 helices. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jogini and Roux, 2007</xref>). The most critical parts for the present study, i.e., the S5&#x02013;S6 pore domain, the S4&#x02013;S5 linker and the S4 (up to residue 287), are taken directly from the x-ray structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2005</xref>). The total number of atoms in the channel/membrane system is &#x0223c;77,000. The channel is oriented perpendicular to the membrane plane such that the pore is along the <italic>Z</italic>-axis, and the center of the bilayer is at <italic>Z</italic> &#x0003d; 0. The simulation methodology is essentially the same as that described previously in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jogini and Roux, 2007</xref>). In brief, all the simulations were performed at constant temperature and constant pressure with fixed cross-sectional area and no truncation of electrostatic interactions using the program CHARMM version c32a2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacKerell et al., 1998a</xref>). Periodic boundary conditions were applied to mimic a multilayer membrane system extending in the <italic>XY</italic> plane. The all-atom potential energy function PARAM27 for protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacKerell et al., 1998b</xref>), phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schlenkrich et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klauda et al., 2006</xref>), and ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beglov and Roux, 1994</xref>) were used with the TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>). The histidine side chain was modeled as a deprotonated imidazole carrying a net charge of &#x02212;1, yielding a neutral complex with the divalent Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Though the protonation state of histidine depends on its environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin and Lim, 2004</xref>), the details of the charge distribution are not critical because the geometry of the bridge is imposed by harmonic distance restraints in the present simulations.</p><p>The final configurations from the two previous MD simulations of 20 ns were used to construct the various mutants simulated for the present study. Two systems were generated and simulated for each of the three mutants: R294H-A351H, R294H-A351H-D352G-E353S, and R294H-D352H. A flat-bottom harmonic energy restraint with maximum distance of 3.0 &#x000c5; and force constant of 10 kcal/mol/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> was imposed between the Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and the NE2 atom of each of the two histidine side chains in S4 and S5 of adjacent subunits (respectively at positions 294 and 351 or 352). Because the optimized distance between Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and a NE2 atom is on the order of 2.1 &#x000c5;, the energy restraint only maintains the existence of the metal bridge but does not interfere with its local geometry. The distance restraints are rapidly satisfied during the early stage of the trajectory without distorting the local structure. Taking the end-point of previous simulations as starting point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jogini and Roux, 2007</xref>), a total of two MD simulations per mutant, each of 2.5 ns, were generated (six MD simulations in total). The trajectories were stored every 2 ps for analysis. To provide a unique reference frame for analyzing the orientation of the voltage sensor, the channel configurations were reoriented with respect to the pore domain (S5&#x02013;S6) accounting for the fourfold symmetry of the channel; see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> in Jogini and Roux (2007).

The determination of the structure of the mammalian voltage-gated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel Kv1.2 by x-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2005</xref>) prompted us to assess the S4-pore interaction in the context of a channel of known 3D structure.

This was an unexpected result and one that differs markedly from those obtained with <italic>Shaker,</italic> where the equivalent residues form a strong disulphide bridge shifting the V<sub>1/2</sub> by &#x0223c;35 mV in the hyperpolarized direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laine et al., 2003</xref>), stabilizing the open channel conformation without reducing current magnitude. The loss of current in the Kv1.2 R294H-A351H mutant was also apparent in the normalized <italic>G-V</italic> relationships (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) but was not observed in either of the single mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2, D and E</xref>). However, addition of lower concentrations of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (10 nM) did lead to a small, but unambiguous, hyperpolarizing shift in V<sub>1/2</sub> of &#x02212;15.8 mV, without any significant loss of current magnitude (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C, P</xref> &#x0003c; 0.05). This suggests that Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is able to bind both R294H and A351H in Kv1.2, confirming these residues are in close proximity in the open-activated state. The strong effect seen by the addition of small concentrations of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> also implies that the engineered binding site has high affinity. The loss of current magnitude in the R294H-A351H mutant Kv1.2 channel at concentrations of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> &#x0003e;10 nM infers that Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is able to bind to a nonspecific binding site with lower affinity that likely involves the histidine introduced at position R294 and one or more acidic residues that are present in the S4&#x02013;S5 loop adjacent to A351 (D352 and E353), residues that are absent at the equivalent positions in <italic>Shaker</italic>. Furthermore, 1 &#x003bc;M Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is able to induce a small but significant shift (P &#x0003c; 0.05) in the V<sub>1/2</sub> of the single mutant R294H but not A351H (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), suggesting that the introduced histidine at R294 and acidic residues at D352 and E353 probably form an interaction site for Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. We were able to overcome the problem of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-induced loss of current by using Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, which also has the ability to bind histidine but with lower affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rulisek and Vondrasek, 1998</xref>). The addition of 1 &#x003bc;M Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> to Kv1.2-R294H-A351H significantly shifted the voltage dependence of activation in the hyperpolarized direction by &#x02212;17.2 mV from &#x02212;26.7 &#x000b1; 0.9 mV to &#x02212;43.9 &#x000b1; 0.6 mV, without loss of current magnitude (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;C</xref>, P &#x0003c; 0.05).

Nevertheless, one might be tempted to argue the converse, namely that the formation of the metal bridge causes a destabilization of the closed state of Kv1.2. To draw clear structural inferences from the experimental observations requires that one be able to distinguish between these two possibilities. To address this issue, we studied deactivating tail currents from the quadruple mutant Kv1.2-R294H-A351H-D352G-E353S in the absence and presence of 1 &#x003bc;M Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> we show that metal bridge formation induces a slowing of tail current deactivation kinetics at all voltages between &#x02212;150 and &#x02212;80 mV. This data shows that in the presence of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> it is harder for the channel to return to the closed state, suggesting it is indeed the open-activated channel conformation that sits in a deeper free energy well under conditions were the metal bridge is formed. In fact, the kinetic data in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> are in semi-quantitative agreement with the shift in channel activation shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. The presence of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> slows the deactivation rate by a factor of &#x0223c;8, corresponding to an increased stabilization of the open state by &#x0223c;2 k<sub>B</sub>T, which manifests itself by a 27.4 mV hyperpolarizing shift in V<sub>1/2</sub>. It is essentially as if the shift in the open-activated (O) state versus the closed (C) state was due to a slowing of the O&#x02192;C rate with no change in the O&#x02190;C rate.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Metal bridge formation slows channel closure signifying stabilization of the open-activated channel conformation.

Removal of the acidic residues in Kv1.2 should induce a rightward shift in the voltage of half-maximal activation by eliminating the salt bridge formed between R294 of S4 and D352 and/or E353 of S5 in the activated state, thereby making it harder to open the channel. To ascertain this hypothesis, we mutated the acidic residues D352 and E353 of Kv1.2 to the equivalent neutral glycine and serine residues of <italic>Shaker</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>, neutralization of these two residues did indeed induce a depolarizing shift in V<sub>1/2</sub> by &#x0002b;9.4 mV (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Conversely, substituting the normally neutral G420 and S421 residues of <italic>Shaker</italic> by the negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acid residues of Kv1.2, we would expect to see the opposite effect, making it easier to open the channel by promoting salt bridge formation between <italic>Shaker</italic> residues R362 of S4 and 420D and/or 421E of S5.

To form the metal bridge with S5 of the adjacent subunit, the S4 helix must shift slightly in a counterclockwise direction and adopt a position that is more vertical than in the x-ray structure. Overall, a displacement of &#x0223c;7&#x02013;8 &#x000c5; relative to the x-ray structure is required at the level of the C&#x003b2; of R294. The voltage sensor fluctuates significantly, even in the presence of the metal bridge.

As a consequence, the recent history with KvAP and Kv1.2 might lead to the view that crystal structures are either detectably distorted (like KvAP), or are otherwise representative of the native conformation in all respects (like Kv1.2). The reality is probably more complex. In fact, assessing the functional significance of any protein conformation captured in a crystal environment is always a fundamental issue that must be addressed carefully.</p><p>The four highly conserved arginine residues along S4 are largely responsible for the gating charge controlling the voltage activation of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seoh et al., 1996</xref>). Accessibility data show that membrane depolarization causes the S4 segment to move toward the extracellular side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larsson et al., 1996</xref>). In particular, the position of the first gating charge near the N terminus of S4 is an important marker of the conformational change that underlies voltage gating. This first charge is known to alternate between two locations, exposed to the extracellular side of the membrane in the open-activated state of the channel, and displaced toward the intracellular side of the membrane in the closed resting channel state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Starace and Bezanilla, 2001</xref>, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruta et al., 2005</xref>). To refine our knowledge of the open-activated state of Kv1.2, three different sources of information were taken into consideration: (1) the crystallographic x-ray structure (2A79), (2) electrophysiological measurements of Kv1.2 mutant channels, and (3) MD simulations of all the systems studied experimentally.</p><p>A first step is to obtain electrophysiological data leading to unambiguous interpretation. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, the results for the double mutant R294H-A351H are shown. In the absence of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, the mutant channels behave essentially as wild type. However, in the presence of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> the ionic currents of the mutant channels are significantly reduced, an effect that is not observed in the wild-type Kv1.2 channel. In the presence of Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> the <italic>G-V</italic> relationship is shifted to a more negative voltage without any reduction of the current. This phenotype is qualitatively similar to the R362H-A419H bridge engineered in <italic>Shaker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laine et al., 2003</xref>). Differences between the sequence of <italic>Shaker</italic> and Kv1.2 in this region could be responsible for the markedly different behavior. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, two acidic residues near A351 at the extracellular end of S5 in Kv1.2 (D352 and E353) are neutral residues in <italic>Shaker</italic> (G420 and S421). The Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> cation can be effectively coordinated by the nitrogen atom of histidine as well as by carboxylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberts et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jain and Jayaram, 2007</xref>), but not so for Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, which prefers to bind softer ligands such as sulfur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rulisek and Vondrasek, 1998</xref>). A reasonable hypothesis is that the negatively charged side chains, somehow, interfere with the activated position of S4 in the presence of the His-Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-His metal bridge, perhaps promoting some inactivation of the pore. In fact, the double mutant R294H-A351H displays a slight shift of the <italic>G-V</italic> at very low Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration before the current starts to collapse (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). This suggests that activation of the voltage sensor and inactivation of the pore involve two different processes, which are not affected in the same way by the formation of the bridge. Although more work would be required to ascertain and characterize this phenomenon in wild-type Kv1.2, this is not our main interest here. Rather, we try to recover the physical environment of metal coordination engineered previously in <italic>Shaker</italic> by substituting the neutral glycine and serine residues of <italic>Shaker</italic> back into Kv1.2. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the His-His metal bridge behaves essentially as the corresponding bridge in <italic>Shaker</italic> once the two acidic residues have been neutralized. In particular, there is a shift of &#x02212;27.4 mV in the <italic>G-V</italic>, indicating that the open-activated state of functional channels is stabilized in the presence of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. In <italic>Shaker</italic>, the corresponding metal bridge caused a shift of &#x02212;40 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laine et al., 2003</xref>). The dissociation constant for Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is 360 nM, which is quantitatively similar to the value previously reported for <italic>Shaker</italic> (400 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laine et al., 2003</xref>). The high apparent affinity is consistent with the conclusion that the Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion binds simultaneously to the two histidine side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kiefer and Fierke, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loland et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Norregaard et al., 2000</xref>), confirming that these positions are within atomic distance of each other in the open-activated state. Furthermore, analysis of the deactivation rate from tail currents demonstrates that the observed effect clearly arises from a stabilization of the open-activated state promoted by the formation of the metal bridge, as opposed to a destabilization of the closed state. The hyperpolarizing shift in the activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and the slowed deactivation rate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) are both consistent with an open-activated conformation that sits in a free energy well deepened by &#x0223c;2 k<sub>B</sub>T upon formation of the His-His metal bridge. By comparison, the activation rate of the quadruple Kv1.2 mutant (R294H-A351H-D352G-E353S) slows down by less than a factor of 2 in the presence of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (see Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200809962/DC1">http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200809962/DC1</ext-link>), again indicating that the closed state of the channel is not destabilized by the formation of the metal bridge. The structural interpretation of the effect of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> as stabilizing a functional open-activated state is therefore unambiguous.</p><p>From a functional point of view, the open-activated state of the Kv1.2 channel is structurally stabilized by the formation of a His-His metal bridge engineered between position 294 in S4 and position 351 in S5. The metal bridge promoting the activated open state is not unique, as it is also possible to engineer a bridge between R294H and D352H. The voltage shift in the <italic>G-V</italic> is slightly smaller, &#x02212;15 mV, which suggests that this metal bridge might be promoting a conformation that does not match the open-activated state as well as the R294H-A351H bridge. In the x-ray structure of Kv1.2, the distance between those residues is on the order of 13.7 &#x000c5;. While this distance seems large, the implications for the formation of a His-His metal bridge must be ascertained carefully. In crystal structures of metal binding proteins the C&#x003b1;-C&#x003b1; distance between residues involved in a His-His metal bridge can be as short as 5&#x02013;6 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberts et al., 1998</xref>). However, in a fully extended position of the histidine side chain, it is also possible to form a bridge while keeping the backbone C&#x003b1; separated by a distance of 9&#x02013;10 &#x000c5;. Therefore, whether the formation of a R294H-A351H metal bridge stabilizing the open-activated state is truly inconsistent with the relative position of S4, with respect to the pore domain observed in the x-ray structure, needs to be clarified. Simple arguments based on backbone-to-backbone distances are actually too simplistic, as one must also consider the relative orientation of the S4 and S5 helices, as well as steric clashes with neighboring residues. Without further information, it is nearly impossible to assess the relative significance of the x-ray structure and of the functional data, and further advance our knowledge of the open-activated state.</p><p>Atomistic MD simulations of the Kv1.2 channel and the various mutants studied experimentally can help shed some light on this issue. In a previous study of the Kv1.2 channel embedded in a lipid membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jogini and Roux, 2007</xref>), it was reported that residue R294 of S4 was shifting toward residue A351 of S5. Furthermore, intersubunit salt bridges between the side chains of R294/R297 and D352 near the extracellular end of S5 from the adjacent subunit formed spontaneously during the simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jogini and Roux, 2007</xref>). Similar observations were made in an independent MD simulation of Kv1.2 based on a different model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Treptow and Tarek, 2006</xref>). Following the shift of the C&#x003b2; corresponding to the first side chain atom at position 294 is most informative. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, the position of 294 in the simulation of the wild-type Kv1.2 form a wide cluster that is displaced roughly by 7.5 &#x000c5; compared with the x-ray structure. Although there is significant overlap with the configurations generated with the wild-type Kv1.2 channels, the simulations in which the R294H-Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-A351H bridge was imposed via a harmonic restraint form a more well-defined cluster. A slightly more compact cluster of positions is obtained when the metal bridge is simulated in the background of the <italic>Shaker</italic>-like neutralized D352G-E353S mutations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>, blue mesh). Systematically, the shift in the position of the C&#x003b2; of 294 in S4 relative to the x-ray structure is observed for all simulations. Interestingly, the x-ray structure of the Kv1.2-Kv2.1 chimera channel (PDB id 2R9R) in the presence of a lipid environment displays a shift of &#x0223c;5.5 &#x000c5; in a similar direction (the C&#x003b2; of Q290 is indicated by a green sphere). The latter observation highlights the importance of a dynamic lipid membrane environment on the conformation of Kv channels, a point previously emphasized in crystallographic studies of the KvAP and Kv1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Before concluding this discussion, we wish to summarize the issue one more time for the sake of clarity. The residues R294 and A351 are too far apart in the Kv1.2 crystal structure to allow the formation of the metal bridge that was previously engineered in <italic>Shaker</italic>. Only four possible reasons could explain this observation: (1) the Kv1.2 channel is slightly different from <italic>Shaker</italic>; (2) the formation of the Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bridge destabilizes the closed state of Kv1.2; (3) the metal bridge stabilizes a somewhat distorted open-activated state; (4) the conformation seen in the Kv1.2 crystal structure does not correspond precisely to that of the open-activated state of a Kv channel. Several factors argue in favor of the latter explanation.</p><p>The possibility that <italic>Shaker</italic> and Kv1.2 are different (1) can be readily eliminated. We were able to engineer the same S4&#x02013;S5 high affinity metal bridge in a charge-neutralized mutant of Kv1.2 that worked previously in <italic>Shaker</italic>, thus ruling out the possibility that those channels display any fundamental differences. The possibility that the metal bridge stabilizes the closed state (2) is not consistent with the electrophysiological data. As demonstrated by the rate of activation and the analysis of tail currents, the bridge is clearly stabilizing the open-activated state, as opposed to destabilizing the closed state. The possibility that the metal bridge actually stabilizes a somewhat distorted open-activated state (3) deserves to be addressed carefully. First, it is important to establish the magnitude of the distortion. MD simulations of the mutant Kv1.2 channels indicate that a shift of &#x0223c;7&#x02013;8 &#x000c5; is needed to allow the formation of the His-His metal bridge, yielding an unambiguous structural constraint. Second, it is important to recall that high affinity metal bridges (nM) are typically occurring in undistorted structures like active site of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kiefer and Fierke, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loland et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Norregaard et al., 2000</xref>). To retain the high Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> affinity, the flexibility of the voltage sensor would need to be such that very little energy cost would be incurred by the structural distortion. Furthermore, even in the case of a very freely flexible sensor with no energy cost, the loss of conformational entropy upon formation of the metal bridge would act to decrease the high Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> affinity. In this context, the possibility that the metal bridge might actually stabilize some open channel conformation distorted by 7&#x02013;8 &#x000c5; at nM Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration seems very unlikely.</p><p>This leaves the only possible alternative explanation (4): the crystal structure of Kv1.2 does not correspond precisely to that of the open-activated state. According to the structural constraint deduced from MD, a 7&#x02013;8 &#x000c5; shift is needed to allow the formation of the His-His metal bridge. It is particularly noteworthy that a similar shift&#x02014;in the same direction&#x02014;was already observed to occur spontaneously in unbiased MD simulations of the WT channel, without any biasing constraints between R294 and A351 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jogini and Roux, 2007</xref>), and that a similar shift of about 4&#x02013;5 &#x000c5;&#x02014;in the same direction&#x02014;is also seen in the recent x-ray structure of the Kv1.2-Kv2.1 chimera in which R294 is a Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Long et al., 2007</xref>). This analysis gives us the confidence to conclude that the position and orientation of R294 in S4 in the activated and open functional state of the Kv1.2 channel in a fluid lipid membrane is shifted by &#x0223c;7&#x02013;8 &#x000c5; and rotated by &#x0223c;37&#x000b0; counterclockwise along its main axis relative to the x-ray structure 2A79. As a consequence, the first two arginines of S4 are exposed to the water molecules near the bulk-membrane interface, or interact with the lipid headgroups as shown in MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Treptow and Tarek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jogini and Roux, 2007</xref>). Consequently, the picture emerging from the present results contrasts with the conclusion initially drawn from the x-ray structure that those side chains pointed directly into the lipid hydrocarbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The position of S4 in the open-activated state deduced here on the basis of functional data and MD simulations can be put within the context of a proposed atomic model of the voltage sensor in the resting-closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pathak et al., 2007</xref>), which is consistent with a wide range of experimental constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahern and Horn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chanda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Posson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tombola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campos et al., 2007</xref>). According to the resting state model, the S4 segment is configured such that the first charge R294 points toward S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pathak et al., 2007</xref>). In this conformation, a salt bridge is formed between R294 and E226 in S2, previously identified experimentally using second site charge reversal mutations in the homologous <italic>Shaker</italic> channel where it corresponds to E283 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tiwari-Woodruff et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiwari-Woodruff et al., 2000</xref>). To reach this proposed resting state starting from the Kv1.2 crystal structure, the helix S4 must undergo a counterclockwise helical screw rotation of &#x0223c;180&#x000b0; along its main axis. However, a more modest displacement and rotation of S4 would be required if the conformational transition started from the functional open-activated conformation proposed here. In fact, when starting from the x-ray structure the charges R294 and R297 must initially move up toward the extracellular side before coming down in between S1 and S2, a process that presumably would not be accelerated by membrane hyperpolarization. On a speculative note, this raises the interesting possibility that the crystal structure might have captured the channel in a conformation related to a zero-voltage inactivated state of the voltage sensor domain. This functional state, which differs from the resting (down) state and the activated (up) state, manifests its existence as a history-dependent hysteresis in measured gating currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bezanilla et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuzmenkin et al., 2004</xref>).</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present analysis provides evidence that, in the &#x0201c;functional&#x0201d; open-activated state of Kv1.2, the S4 helix is actually shifted by &#x0223c;7&#x02013;8 &#x000c5; and rotated counterclockwise by &#x0223c;37&#x000b0; along its main axis relative to its position in the crystal structure. As a result, the helix sits in a more upright orientation relative to the membrane. While the overall topology of Kv channels in the open-activated state is not in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2005</xref>), the magnitude of the conformational shift deduced here is certainly not negligible and should be taken into account in efforts aimed at relating channel structure to function. The present findings highlight the difficulties in trying to grasp the genuine molecular realities of Kv channels. Details from any experiments and computations have to be interpreted with caution, in large part because the voltage sensor is dynamic, flexible, and highly sensitive to its environment. The wide range of dynamical fluctuations also partly explains the contrasting results concerning the magnitude of the conformational change underlying voltage gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chanda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Posson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruta et al., 2005</xref>). The complexity of Kv channels and voltage sensors argues in favor of a perspective built from a broad consensus of all available information from structural, spectroscopic, biophysical, functional, and computational approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200809962_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200809962_1.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_131_6_jgp.200809962__JGP_200809962_FS1.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_131_6_jgp.200809962__JGP_200809962_FS1-01.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jgp.200809962_2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. Steve Goldstein for his gracious support of A.
