Mutations that lead to loss of function of the protein and to haploinsufficiency cause GCPS, while truncating mutations that result in constitutive repressor function of GLI3 lead to PHS. As an exception, some point mutations in the C-terminal part of GLI3 observed in GCPS patients have so far not been linked to loss of function. We have shown recently that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulates the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity a of GLI3 function.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>We have shown recently that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the ubiquitin ligase MID1 regulate the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of GLI3. Here we show mapping of the functional interaction between the MID1-&#x003b1;4-PP2A complex and GLI3 to a region between amino acid 568-1100 of GLI3. Furthermore we demonstrate that GCPS-associated point mutations, that are located in that region, lead to misregulation of the nuclear GLI3-localization and transcriptional activity. GLI3 phosphorylation itself however appears independent of its localization and remains untouched by either of the point mutations and by PP2A-activity, which suggests involvement of an as yet unknown GLI3 interaction partner, the phosphorylation status of which is regulated by PP2A activity, in the control of GLI3 subcellular localization and activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present findings provide an explanation for the pathogenesis of GCPS in patients carrying C-terminal point mutations, and close the gap in our understanding of how GLI3-genotypes give rise to particular phenotypes. Furthermore, they provide a molecular explanation for the phenotypic overlap between Opitz syndrome patients with dysregulated PP2A-activity and syndromes caused by GLI3-mutations.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>GLI3 and two other GLI-proteins, GLI1 and GLI2, are mammalian homologues of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein Cubitus interruptus (Ci), which is a transcriptional effector of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Ci was shown to be part of a microtubule-associated protein complex that also contains Fused (Fu), Suppressor of Fused (SuFu) and Costal2 (Cos2). In absence of Hh signaling, Ci gets phosphorylated by PKA and is subsequently cleaved by the proteasome. The N-terminal cleavage product enters the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional repressor of target genes. In the presence of the Hh signal, this cleavage is blocked and Ci matures into a transcriptional activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-Murone1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-Therond1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

An increase in PP2A activity results in the cytosolic retention and decreased transcriptional activity of GLI3, while inhibition of PP2A leads to nuclear accumulation and increased transcriptional activity. We have further seen that this mechanism is critically influenced by the MID1-&#x003b1;4-ubiquitin-ligase complex that targets microtubule-associated PP2Ac (catalytic subunit of PP2A) to ubiquitin-specific modification and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-Trockenbacher1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

While patients with GCPS share facial features such as hypertelorism and broad nasal bridge with OS patients, PHS patients can present with cleft lip/palate and laryngotracheal and anal malformations, which can also be found in OS patients. Patients with acrocallosal syndrome however, similar to OS patients, can show a full spectrum of midline malformations, including hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, cleft lip/palate, congenital heart defects, imperforate anus and hypospadias.</p><p>In this study, we have narrowed down the protein region of GLI3 that is necessary for its functional interaction with the MID1-&#x003b1;4-PP2A complex. Furthermore, we show that missense mutations in this region, as observed in GCPS and acrocallosal syndrome patients, lead to changes in the subcellular localization of the GLI3 protein and interfere with its regulation by the MID1-&#x003b1;4-PP2A complex. Our data give insight into a molecular cross-talk between the MID1-&#x003b1;4-PP2A complex and GLI3, paving the way to a molecular explanation for the loss-of-function phenotype in GCPS patients with C-terminal missense mutations. In addition, they provide evidence for a shared molecular mechanism underlying several malformation syndromes with significant phenotypic overlap.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Constructs</title><p>All expression-vector-constructs are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007471-t001">table 1</xref>.

Endogenous GLI3 is expressed in all these cell lines including HeLa (cervix carcinoma) and U373MG (glioblastoma). In confirmation of these results, we have now co-transfected GFP-GLI3 in HeLa cells either with MID1- or &#x003b1;4-specific siRNA oligonucleotides and analyzed its subcellular localization as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-Krauss1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcriptional activity of GLI3 was monitored by real-time PCR of the GLI3 target <italic>cyclin D1</italic> and in a luciferase reporter assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>, over-expressed C-terminally GFP-tagged GLI3 localized predominantly to the nucleus in 51&#x00025; of transfected cells, exclusively in the cytosol in 13&#x00025; of cells, and showed a diffuse pattern in 36&#x00025; of transfected cells. To verify the precise localization of GFP-GLI3 and the proper co-detection of nuclei (DAPI) and nuclear protein we applied confocal microscopy, showing comparable localization patterns as detected by epifluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007471.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This is in line with our previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-Krauss1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Disruption of the MID1-&#x003b1;4-PP2A complex by RNAi-mediated knock-down of endogenous &#x003b1;4 caused a significant reduction in nuclear GLI3 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). Concomitantly, cells with diffuse and strictly cytosolic GLI3 were increased. The cytosolic retention of GLI3 correlated with a reduced transcription of its target gene <italic>cyclin D1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>) and a decreased transcriptional activity of GLI3 in a GLI3-reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>). To check the specificity of the reporter assay for GLI3 transcriptional activity, we used GFP tagged GLI3-deletion constructs, which either lack the DNA-binding zinc-finger domains (constructs containing amino acids 1-396, 824-1100), or a construct containing only two out of the five zinc-finger domains (amino acids 568-1549). While only weak induction of the GLI3 reporter by the deletion constructs was observed, full-length GFP-GLI3 caused a significant increase in reporter activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007471.s002">Figure S2</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the observed reduction of the GLI3-reporter after &#x003b1;4-knockdown was caused by destabilization of the GFP-GLI3 protein, GFP-GLI3 was detected on a Western blot, showing no differences in protein amounts after knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>). The efficiency of the knock-down procedure was proven by Western blot detecting the &#x003b1;4 protein and Real-time-PCR amplifying the &#x003b1;4 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g001">Fig. 1e</xref>). Comparable results were obtained using different, non-overlapping siRNA molecules and with N-terminally tagged GLI3 constructs, indicating that the observed localization effects are independent of target sequence and protein cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007471.s006">Table S2</xref>). Similarly, nuclear GFP-GLI3 was also reduced after knock-down of the MID1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). Again, cytosolic retention of GLI3 resulted in a decreased transcriptional activity on its target gene <italic>cyclin D1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>) and in a reduced GLI3-reporter activity, without reduction of overall GFP-GLI3 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>).

This regulation could be mediated either by phosphorylation of the GLI3 molecule itself (which would predict a different phosphorylation pattern of nuclear and cytosolic GLI3) or by phosphorylation of one of its interaction partners. To distinguish between the two possibilities we analyzed the phosphorylation status of GLI3. In a first set of experiments we tested if GLI3 is differentially phosphorylated in dependency of its localization to the cytosol or the nucleus by expressing Flag-GLI3 in HeLa cells. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared, immunoprecipitated and analyzed with a cocktail of anti-phospho-serine and -threonine antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g007">Fig. 7a</xref>, serine/threonine phosphorylation was detectable in both, the nuclear and cytosolic fraction. Purity of the fractions was controlled by lamin A/C and tubulin detection. To detect eventually differing phosphorylation patterns between nuclear and cytosolic GLI3, 2D PAGE and Phos-Tag-SDS-PAGE were performed: The isoelectric focusing pattern obtained in a 2D PAGE analysis, which is highly sensitive to changes in phosphorylation, showed an identical phosphorylation status of a GFP-GLI3-construct (amino acids 568-1549) containing the PP2A-dependent regulatory domain in both cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g007">Fig. 7b</xref>). These results were confirmed by the analysis of total lysates of full-length GFP-GLI3 expressing cells using the Phos-Tag-technology, by which differentially phosphorylated protein-isoforms can be separated by their molecular weight. On gels containing increasing concentrations of the acrylamide-pendant Phos-tag ligand only one GLI3 band was detected suggesting that GLI3 is a mono-phosphorylated protein in the cell system used, where PKA is not stimulated. Furthermore the separation of the wt and mutant GFP-GLI3 constructs on Phos-tag-gels showed no differences between wt and mutant GLI3-proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007471-g007">Fig. 7c</xref>). Taken together these data strongly argue against the PP2A-dependent regulation of GLI3 localization by its own phosphorylation pattern, thereby suggesting the involvement of phospho-modified co-factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the SHH target GLI3 is regulated by a functional interaction between a MID1-&#x003b1;4-PP2A complex-dependent regulation domain of GLI3 and the MID1-&#x003b1;4-PP2A complex. Increased PP2A activity mediated by MID1 or &#x003b1;4 knock-down resulted in the cytosolic retention of full-length GLI3 and led to a reduced transcriptional activity. Interestingly, GCPS- and acrocallosal syndrome-associated point mutations within the MID1-&#x003b1;4-PP2A complex-dependent interaction domain led to a misregulation of the subcellular localization, a loss of the MID1-&#x003b1;4-PP2A complex-dependent nuclear localization of GLI3, and a reduction of the transcriptional activity of mutant GLI3.

In this model system, changes in the subcellular localization of GLI3 correlated with changes of its transcriptional activity: a decrease of nuclear GLI3 protein led to a reduction of transcriptional activity. In addition, transfection of a luciferase reporter under the control of a GLI3-dependent promoter together with wild-type GLI3 resulted in an increase in reporter activity, while mutant proteins led to a much smaller induction of the reporter, and knock-down of GLI3 in the model system led to a reduction of target expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-Krauss1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, the PP2A-dependent regulation of the subcellular localization was modified in the mutant GLI3 proteins.

GCPS patients may show symptoms like hypertelorism, broad nasal root, and limb abnormalities such as pre- and postaxial polydactyly and syndactyly. PHS patients may present with cleft lip, palate or uvula, laryngeal clefts and tracheal defects, anal defects, and limb malformations like syn-, poly- or oligodactyly.

In GCPS, one full-length GLI3 allele is lost, causing a reduction of both activator and repressor, resulting in apparent haploinsufficiency of GLI3 activator and repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-KalffSuske1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

In OS, mutations in MID1 cause reduced nuclear activator GLI3 products, resulting in overlap with the haploinsufficiency in GCPS. Since only the full-length activator form is removed from the nucleus, the net effect in OS is also an excess nuclear abundance of GLI3 repressor, yielding phenotypic overlap with PHS. Thus, while mutations in the target protein GLI3 result in diverse phenotypes depending on the location of the respective mutation, dysfunction of MID1 leads to a &#x02018;compound&#x02019; syndrome. Interestingly, in an analysis using fully automated text mining, Brunner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-Brunner1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> have identified OS as the second nearest phenotypic neighbor of PHS. Our data now fill the gap between the phenotypic overlap of the two syndromes and possible underlying molecular mechanisms by suggesting a biochemical crosstalk between the involved gene products. In contrast to the shared midline phenotypes, limb development is affected by loss-of-function of GLI3 but rarely by MID1 mutations. This difference might be either due to the fact that polydactyly phenotypes, as seen in GCPS, are primarily caused by a loss of GLI3-repressor, the regulation of which might be unaffected by the MID1-&#x003b1;4-PP2A complex or it might reflect a fine-tuned, tissue-specific regulation of the MID1 function and/or a compensation of MID1 function by MID2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-Trockenbacher1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-Buchner1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007471-Winter2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> in some tissues. Thus, it might be that, due to as yet undefined mechanisms, tissues that participate to the development of ventral midline structures and their abnormalities are particularly sensitive towards MID1 dysfunction.
