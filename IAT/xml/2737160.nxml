Injection of TNF in humans and mice leads to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with major effects on liver and bowels. TNF is also a central mediator in several inflammatory diseases. We report that type I interferons (IFNs) are essential mediators of the lethal response to TNF. Mice deficient in the IFN-&#x003b1; receptor 1 (IFNAR-1) or in IFN-&#x003b2; are remarkably resistant to TNF-induced hypothermia and death. After TNF injection, IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice produced less IL-6, had less bowel damage, and had less apoptosis of enterocytes and hepatocytes compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Extensive gene expression analysis in livers of WT and IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice revealed a large deficiency in the response to TNF in the knockout mice, especially of IFN-stimulated response element&#x02013;dependent genes, many of which encode chemokines. In livers of IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, fewer infiltrating white blood cells (WBCs) were detected by immunohistochemistry. Deficiency of type I IFN signaling provided sufficient protection for potentially safer therapeutic use of TNF in tumor-bearing mice. Our data illustrate that type I IFNs act as essential mediators in TNF-induced lethal inflammatory shock, possibly by enhancing cell death and inducing chemokines and WBC infiltration in tissues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The cytokine TNF, especially in combination with IFN-&#x003b3;, has a very strong antitumor effect. In mice, for example, established tumors completely regress during 10 d of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brouckaert et al., 1986</xref>). In patients, treatment of tumors with TNF leads to remarkable results, as in the treatment of melanoma metastasis in the limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eggermont et al., 2004</xref>). However, TNF is a very strong inducer of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal and Natarajan, 1996</xref>). After TNF binds to its major receptor TNFR1 (p55), it activates a broad range of transcription factors, leading to induction of cytokines, enzymes, and adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kollias et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, injection of TNF leads to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) characterized by hypotension, hepatitis, and bowel necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tracey et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vassalli et al., 1992</xref>). Several molecules have been proven to mediate the acutely lethal effects of TNF: IL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Everaerdt et al., 1994</xref>), NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cauwels et al., 2000</xref>), and, more recently, IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>). Because of these strong proinflammatory effects, treatment with TNF is restricted to loco-regional settings.</p><p>Three types of IFNs have been identified: type I, type II, and the recently discovered type III IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ank et al., 2006</xref>). Type I IFNs form a group of almost 20 members, of which IFN-&#x003b2; is one of the most important. They all signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of an IFN-&#x003b1; receptor 1 (IFNAR-1) and an IFNAR-2 chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Uz&#x000e9; et al., 2007</xref>). Also, type I IFNs have antiviral, apoptotic, and antitumor activities, and they have been shown to mediate the acute inflammatory shock that occurs during endotoxemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Karaghiosoff et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mahieu and Libert, 2007</xref>).</p><p>It was recently shown that TNF stimulates the expression of type I IFNs through IRF-1 in macrophages and, via IFNAR-1, the expression of IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)&#x02013;dependent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yarilina et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore wondered whether type I IFNs play a role in the TNF-induced acutely lethal SIRS. Our data clearly support the idea that type I IFNs are strong mediators of the in vivo TNF effects and that their inhibition could lead to safer antitumor therapy based on TNF.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and IFN-&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are protected against TNF-induced lethal SIRS</title><p>We studied the role of type I IFNs by using IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, IFN-&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and WT mice. All mice had a matching genetic background of C57BL/6. IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT mice were injected i.p. with 30 &#x000b5;g of recombinant mouse TNF (2xLD<sub>100</sub> for WT mice) and mortality was recorded during 72 h, after which no further deaths occurred. All WT mice died, whereas all IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice survived (P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Moreover, although IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed a mild and transient hypothermia, WT mice suffered pronounced hypothermia before dying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In another experiment, 24 mice per genotype were injected i.p. with 30 &#x000b5;g TNF, and groups of six WT and six IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were bled at different times to study the induction profile of IL-6. Although this cytokine is functionally inert in this TNF model, its induction profile illustrates the extent of gene induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Libert et al., 1994</xref>) and inflammation. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, basal serum levels of IL-6 were comparable in WT and IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, but 2, 6, and 10 h after TNF challenge, the increase in IL-6 serum concentrations was significantly more pronounced in WT than in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. It is notable that the difference from the WT developed relatively quickly. Furthermore, serum concentrations of IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 were also much lower in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice 6 h after challenge (unpublished data). Because we found that our IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed a mild reduction in the numbers of NK and NKT cells in liver but not in spleen (unpublished data), we also tested the response of IFN-&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to TNF. These mice were also significantly resistant to the lethal effects of TNF (P = 0.0027) and to hypothermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and IFN-&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are resistant to TNF-induced shock.</bold> 30 &#x000b5;g TNF was injected i.p. in WT (<italic>n</italic> = 14) and IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 14) mice.

The apoptosis-enhancing activity of type I IFN was recently shown for macrophages as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Qiu et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, type I IFNs have been shown to exert apoptotic effects on renal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lechner et al., 2008</xref>). TNF not only induces apoptosis of enterocytes, it also induces multiple mechanisms through the death receptor pathway to initiate hepatocyte apoptosis leading to liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ding and Yin, 2004</xref>). Liver injury has been identified as a major dose-limiting toxicity of TNF. We therefore compared the degree of acute enterocyte apoptosis and liver damage after TNF injection in WT and IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice by several techniques. Mice were injected with 30 &#x000b5;g TNF, and the degree of apoptosis was estimated in bowels and livers 1 and 6 h after injection by measuring the extent of DNA fragmentation, caspase 3/caspase 7 activity, and TUNEL staining. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, the extent of DNA fragmentation induced by TNF was very high in intestines 1 h after challenge and in liver 6 h after challenge, but it was significantly less in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice than in WT mice (P = 0.03986 and P = 0.0313, respectively).

The protective effect is initiated early and is reflected in the lower degree of hypothermia and lower level of circulating IL-6, as well as in reduced enterocyte and liver apoptosis, which are the major dose-limiting toxicities of TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tracey et al., 1986</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced expression of genes after TNF injection in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>Very moderate induction of the major type I IFN (IFN-&#x003b2;) by TNF was recently shown in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yaralina et al., 2008</xref>). Because the liver has been reported as a major target for TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wielockx et al., 2001</xref>), we studied the levels of IFN-&#x003b2; messenger RNA in livers by quantitative PCR and found a sharp but transient induction in WT mice and a slow gradual increase in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The late appearance of IFN-&#x003b2; at the RNA level after injection of TNF in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice might be, as has been proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fenner et al., 2006</xref>), the result of weaker induction of inhibitors of the Jak&#x02013;Stat pathway, such as SOCS molecules, by IFN-&#x003b2;.

In both the liver and spleen, the expression of all studied genes was compromised in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. When we examined the induction of early genes by TNF, the large difference in induction of IRF-1 was remarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The induction of other genes that depend on NF-&#x003ba;B, such as those coding for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-1&#x003b2;, and c-Flip, was also substantially compromised in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, especially at the early time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C&#x02013;E</xref>). This can be explained, at least for the iNOS and IL-1&#x003b2; genes, by their coregulation by NF-&#x003ba;B and IRF factors and also in the promoter of the c-Flip-encoding gene because NF-&#x003ba;B, as well as IRF-responsive elements, was found by using the bioinformatics program Contra (not depicted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hooghe et al., 2008</xref>). The lower level of serum IL-12 can also be explained by this reduced expression of IRF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>When comparing the induction of later Jak&#x02013;Stat-dependent genes, the expression in the IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was again found to be greatly reduced. The genes encoding CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, IFIT2, STAT1, and IRF-7 were induced by TNF in the liver of WT mice but to a much smaller extent (or not at all) in the absence of the IFNAR-1 receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, F&#x02013;K</xref>). These genes belong to the group of ISRE genes, the promoters of which are controlled by the transcription complex ISGF3. This complex consists of STAT-1&#x02013;STAT-2&#x02013;IRF-9 heterotrimers and is formed after stimulation of the IFNAR receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maher et al., 2007</xref>). Most ISRE genes have immune modulatory, antiviral, or chemotactic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Der et al., 1998</xref>). Deficient induction of a whole set of chemokines, such as CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IFIT2, should have profound effects on the chemotaxis of white blood cells (WBCs) in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced infiltration of WBC in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>Because the induction of several chemokines upon TNF injection seemed much weaker (or altogether absent) in livers of IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with WT mice, we investigated whether infiltration of tissues by WBCs was reduced. Indeed, stimulation of the IFNAR-1 receptor in WT mice is expected to produce chemokines, which attract WBC from the blood stream into the tissue to cause further damage. Therefore, we injected mice i.p. with 30 &#x000b5;g TNF and sampled livers 6 h later. We also took samples from untreated mice. Tissue sections were stained for several WBC markers, namely the general WBC marker CD45, the T cell marker CD3, the marker for polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes MPO, and F4/80, a marker of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). The numbers of positive cells in WT and IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were compared.

It is noteworthy that WBCs in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice seemed to accumulate in veins and arteries, whereas in WT mice they crossed the endothelial barrier into the parenchyma. Because CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 bind to the rather generally expressed receptor CxCR3 on WBCs, the reduced infiltration of CD3-, CD45-, MPO-, and F4/80-positive cells can be explained.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Reduced tissue migration of WBC in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after injection with TNF.</bold> WT (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 6) mice were injected i.p. with 30 &#x000b5;g TNF and livers were isolated 0 or 6 h later.

We studied this possibility in a standard tumor model. We inoculated 19 WT and 20 IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> B16BL6 melanoma cells in the right thigh. 10 d later, tumors in IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had grown slightly larger than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). This confirms earlier findings and illustrates that type I IFNs have some antiproliferative activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2008</xref>). The mice were then divided into four groups and injected near the lesions with PBS or with 15 &#x000b5;g TNF + 5,000 IU IFN-&#x003b3; per mouse per day. Daily measurement of tumor index showed that tumors regressed equally in WT (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<italic>n</italic> = 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). All 10 WT mice and only 2 out of 10 IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice died from the treatment (P = 0.0003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>).

Although these patients suffer from severe side effects of the treatment, no serious accidents have been reported. However, although type I IFNs have been shown to possess some antiinflammatory activities, especially in the central nervous system, several authors have shown that they should be considered as important mediators in acute inflammatory conditions. Absence of IFN-&#x003b2; or IFNAR-1 in knockout mice leads to complete protection against LPS-induced lethal inflammatory shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Karaghiosoff et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mahieu and Libert, 2007</xref>). In our study, we found that the presence or absence of type I IFN signaling also has a large impact on the outcome of TNF-induced inflammation. We expect that type I IFNs are also involved in other TNF-induced or TNF-mediated pathologies such as arthritis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yarilina et al. (2008)</xref> found that TNF in macrophages induces a typical type I IFN program through IRF-1 and that IFN-&#x003b2; was elevated in synovial fluids of arthritic patients. Therefore, therapeutic inhibition of type I IFNs is conceivable. The endogenous type I IFNs, however, are crucial for antiviral defences, and IFNAR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are hypersensitive to many viral infections. Hence, although therapeutic inhibition of type I IFNs in inflammatory conditions seems logical, it is difficult to achieve in practice.</p><p>In conclusion, deficiency of type I IFNs in vivo leads to considerable protection against the deleterious effects of TNF. Two mechanisms might be involved in this protection. Type I IFNs seem to enhance TNF-induced apoptosis in enterocytes and hepatocytes. In contrast, deficient induction of chemokine genes is observed and is reflected in reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells in mice deficient in type I IFN receptor. Therapeutic inhibition of this family of IFNs should be evaluated for treatment of disorders in which TNF is implicated or for increasing the therapeutic index of TNF in cancer therapy. The safety of therapeutic inhibition with anti&#x02013;type I IFN agents should be evaluated because these IFNs possess essential antiviral activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">M&#x000fc;ller et al., 1994</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6J WT mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.
