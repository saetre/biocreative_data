However, their roles at other axial levels remain unknown. Here we examine expression of Robo proteins by cerebellofugal (CF) commissural axons in the rostral hindbrain and investigate their roles in CF axon pathfinding by analysing Robo knockout mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We analysed the expression of Robo proteins by CF axons originating from deep cerebellar neurons in rodent embryos, focusing on developmental stages of their midline crossing and post-crossing navigation. At the stage of CF axon midline crossing, mRNAs of Robo1 and Robo2 are expressed in the nuclear transitory zone of the cerebellum, where the primordium of the deep cerebellar nuclei are located, supporting the notion that CF axons express Robo1 and Robo2. Indeed, immunohistochemical analysis of CF axons labelled by electroporation to deep cerebellar nuclei neurons indicates that Robo1 protein, and possibly also Robo2 protein, is expressed by CF axons crossing the midline. However, weak or no expression of these proteins is found on the longitudinal portion of CF axons. In <italic>Robo1</italic>/<italic>2 </italic>double knockout mice, many CF axons reach the midline but fail to exit it. We find that CF axons express Rig-1 (Robo3) before they reach the midline but not after the longitudinal turn. Consistent with this <italic>in vivo </italic>observation, axons elicited from a cerebellar explant in co-culture with a floor plate explant express Rig-1. In <italic>Rig-1 </italic>deficient mouse embryos, CF axons appear to project ipsilaterally without reaching the midline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results indicate that Robo1, Robo2 or both are required for midline exit of CF axons. In contrast, Rig-1 is required for their approach to the midline. However, post-crossing up-regulation of these proteins, which plays an important role in spinal commissural axon guidance, does not appear to be required for the longitudinal navigation of CF axons after midline crossing. Our results illustrate that although common mechanisms operate for midline crossing at different axial levels, significant variation exists in post-crossing navigation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In the bilaterally symmetrical central nervous system, information transfer between both sides of the body is mediated by commissural neurons. Commissural axons that cross the ventral midline of the hindbrain and the spinal cord show a stereotyped growth behavior during development: They initially grow straight toward the midline along the circumferential axis, but after midline crossing turn at a right angle to grow along the longitudinal axis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]).</p><p>The floor plate (FP) at the ventral midline plays a key role in guiding commissural axons between the spinal cord and the hindbrain. At both axial levels, the FP located at the ventral midline of the neural tube attracts commissural axons by releasing the chemoattractant Netrin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. After arriving at the FP, commissural axons continue growing across the FP without stalling. This is because commissural axons change their responsiveness to the FP chemoattractant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and chemorepellents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the <italic>Drosophila </italic>ventral nerve cord, Robo, a receptor for chemorepellent Slits concentrated around the midline, controls commissural axon midline crossing. Commissural axons express low levels of Robo before they cross the midline but up-regulate Robo after crossing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], augmenting a repulsive response to Slits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Consistent with this idea, post-crossing but not pre-crossing axons of a rodent spinal cord explant are inhibited by Slit2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Genetic analysis supports the involvement of the Slit/Robo system in spinal cord commissural axon guidance. In <italic>Slit1</italic>, <italic>Slit2 </italic>and <italic>Slit3 </italic>triple knockout mice as well as in <italic>Robo1 </italic>single mutant mice, fewer commissural axons exit the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Robo1 and Robo2 are expressed at low levels by pre-crossing commissural axons but are highly up-regulated after crossing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, removal of Rig-1 (Robo3), which is expressed by a pre-crossing portion of commissural axons, prevents midline crossing of commissural axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] suggesting that Rig-1 plays a pivotal role in axonal guidance in the spinal cord. Genetic and <italic>in vitro </italic>analysis showed that Rig-1 functions to repress axon sensitivity to Slits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Despite the abundance of evidence describing the important role of Robo proteins in midline crossing of spinal commissural axons, their role at other axial levels remains unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to uncover whether a common molecular mechanism guides commissural axons at other axial levels. To this end, we examined the expression patterns of Robo proteins in cerebellofugal (CF) axons, rostral hindbrain commissural axons originating from the deep cerebellar nuclei, and the guidance of CF axons in <italic>Rig-1 </italic>knockout mice and <italic>Robo1</italic>/<italic>2 </italic>double knockout mice. We find that in Rig-1 deficient mouse embryos, CF axons extend longitudinally on the ipsilateral side, failing to cross the midline. In <italic>Robo1</italic>/<italic>2 </italic>double knockout mice, many CF axons reach the midline but fail to exit it. Curiously, expression of Robo proteins does not seem to be up-regulated in post-crossing CF axons, unlike the spinal cord commissural axons. These results suggest that Robo proteins are crucial regulators of midline crossing but may not be essential for post-crossing longitudinal navigation in developing CF axons.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the rat, CF axons initiate growth at embryonic day (E)12&#x02013;13, reach the ventral midline at E14, and then execute rostral and caudal turns at E15&#x02013;16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><sec><title>Generation of specific antibodies against Robo1, Robo2 and Rig-1 proteins</title><p>To determine the precise localization of Robo1, Robo2 and Rig-1 proteins on CF axons before and after midline crossing, we generated antibodies against these three Robo proteins. The antibodies described here were first reported in Sabatier <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and have been successfully used in several other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], although detailed methods of antibody generation and characterization of their specificity have not been reported. We prepared recombinant Fc fusion proteins of the ectodomains of rat Robo1 (Robo1eFc), rat Robo2 (Robo2eFc) and mouse Rig-1 (Rig-1eFc), and immunized rabbits with them. Immunoblot analysis showed that each Robo antibody recognized a major band at about 160 kDa of the corresponding recombinant Robo-Fc protein, which was also recognized by the anti-Fc antibody (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies pre-absorbed with Robo2eFc, Rig-1eFc, or Fc protein and observations of immunoreactivities in <italic>Rig-1 </italic>or <italic>Robo1</italic>/<italic>2 </italic>double knockout mice preparations.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression patterns of Robo1 and Robo2 proteins in the rostral hindbrain</title><p>To examine the expression patterns of Robo1 and Robo2 proteins in the region corresponding to the CF axonal tracts, immunohistochemical analyses with anti-Robo1 and anti-Robo2 antibodies was performed using flat, whole-mount preparations of the rat rostral hindbrain from E13 to E16. In the descriptions hereafter, the terms 'circumferential axis' and 'longitudinal axis' refer to the axis along the dorsoventral and rostrocaudal axes, respectively.</p><p>In most cases, Robo1 and Robo2 immunoreactivities were observed on the axonal processes but not in the cell soma. At around E13, the CF axons have just left the cerebellar plate (CP), and started to grow circumferentially toward the FP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. At this stage, Robo1 immunoreactivity was largely confined to longitudinally extending axonal profiles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Immunoreactivity was not found in the CP where the cell bodies of prospective deep cerebellar neurons should be located, suggesting minimal Robo1 expression on the cell body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Near the FP, Robo1 immunoreactive fibres were densely distributed, running longitudinally (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), while only a weak immunoreactivity was found on some circumferentially growing axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, arrow). The latter are unlikely to be CF axons because these axons had not arrived at the midline at this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression patterns of Robo1 and Robo2 proteins in the rostral hindbrain</bold>. <bold>(A-F) </bold>Embryonic rat hindbrain was flat, whole-mounted and immunostained for Robo1 (A,C,D,E) and Robo2 (B,F).

At E13, most Robo2 immunopositive fibres also extended longitudinally, but were excluded from the ventral (medial) neural tube. Furthermore, they ran more dorsally (laterally) compared to Robo1 immunoreactive fibres. As development proceeded, both Robo1 and Robo2 immunoreactivities were detected in a wider area in the rostral hindbrain, but were still confined mainly to longitudinally growing fibres (data not shown). At E16, when the CF axons execute a longitudinal turn in the medial region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], both Robo1 and Robo2 immunopositive fibres were more marked in the lateral half of the rostral hindbrain, occupying almost the entire region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E,F</xref>).</p><p>Immunohistochemical analysis using coronal sections was consistent with the results in flat whole-mount preparation; both Robo1 and Robo2 were expressed strongly by longitudinal axons and weakly by circumferential axons crossing the midline at E14 (Figure S2A,C,D,F in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these observations indicate that Robo1 and Robo2 are largely expressed by longitudinally extending fibers during the stage when CF axons cross the midline and extend longitudinally.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Robo1 and Robo2 mRNAs in the CP</title><p>The failure to detect Robo1 and Robo2 immunoreactivities in the CP prompted us to perform <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization experiments to examine the expression of mRNA of Robo1 and Robo2 in the cell soma of CF axons.

Similar results were obtained at E14 and E15 (data not shown), suggesting that deep cerebellar neurons continue to express mRNA of Robo1 and Robo2 at the time when CF axons cross the midline and extend longitudinally.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>(A,B) <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization for <italic>Robo1 </italic>(A) and <italic>Robo2 </italic>(B) in coronal sections of the cerebellar plate (CP).</bold> Both <italic>Robo1 </italic>and <italic>Robo2 </italic>mRNAs are expressed in the region where deep cerebellar nucleus neurons should be located (arrows). d is dorsal and v is ventral.

To directly examine whether axons originating from the deep cerebellar neurons express Robo1 or Robo2, we labelled progenitors of deep cerebellar neurons by <italic>in utero </italic>electroporation. For this, <italic>egfp </italic>plasmid was introduced into the ventricular zone of the CP using E11 mouse embryos and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fluorescence was observed in coronal sections of the E13 mouse hindbrain (note that E13 mouse roughly corresponds to E15 rat). We found that EGFP-labelled axons emanating from the CP extended circumferentially toward the ventral midline and crossed it (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D&#x02013;F</xref>). Immunostaining for Robo1 demonstrated that at least a subset of these axons express Robo1 protein near the midline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G&#x02013;I</xref>). Robo2 also appeared to be expressed by CF axons, although its expression was somewhat ambiguous (data not shown). These findings together suggest that Robo1 protein, and possibly Robo2 protein as well, are expressed on CF axons near the midline, raising the possibility that these proteins are involved in midline crossing of CF axons.</p></sec><sec><title>Robo1 and Robo2 immunoreactivities are segregated from CF axon trajectories when these axons extend longitudinally</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila </italic>as well as in the rodent spinal cord, expression of Robo proteins appears to be up-regulated in commissural axons after midline crossing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which is thought to help them quit the midline and navigate longitudinally after midline crossing. To examine the possibility that Robo expression is also up-regulated in the hindbrain, we examined the expression of Robo1 at E16, when CF axons have crossed the midline and extend longitudinally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To identify CF axons, 3,3'-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) was injected into the CP (Figure S3A in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). As can be seen in Figures S3B,D in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, DiO-labelled fibres in the transverse section ran at a distance from the pial surface of the neural tube near the ventral midline. This tendency was retained after they had made a longitudinal turn (Figure S3E,G in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Near the region of the longitudinal turn, Robo1 immunoreactivity was clearly seen (Figure S3F,G in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). However, its expression level was the highest near the pial surface (Figure S3C,F in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>), and barely detectable at the depth of the hindbrain where most CF axons were observed (Figure S3E,G in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Thus, contrary to our expectation, no or undetectable levels of Robo1 were expressed on CF axons in E16 rat embryos.</p><p>Similar results were obtained when the distribution of Robo2 immunoreactivity was compared with that of CF axon trajectories at E16 (Figure S4A in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). As demonstrated in the previous section, DiO-labelled fibres ran at a distance from the pial surface of the neural tube in the ventral midline (Figure S4B in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>) and began to extend longitudinally at a distance from the midline (Figure S4E in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). However, at this position along the dorsoventral axis, we could not observe immunoreactivities for Robo2 (Figure S4C in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Likewise, at this position along the mediolateral axis, we could not observe immunoreactivities for Robo2 (Figure S4F in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>), which are located more laterally. Thus, similar to Robo1, Robo2 expression in CF axons could not be detected at E16, although this does not preclude the possibility that these proteins are expressed at low levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Trajectories of CF axons in Robo1/2 double knockout mice</title><p>The expression of Robo1 and Robo2 on CF axons during midline crossing raises the possibility that Robo1, Robo2 or both are involved in midline crossing of CF axons. If this is the case, removal of Robo1 and 2 should cause pathfinding errors of CF axons in midline crossing. To test this, we first examined the trajectories of CF axons in <italic>Robo1</italic>/<italic>2 </italic>double knockout mice on E13 coronal sections immunostained for TAG-1. In coronal sections of wild-type and heterozygous (<italic>Robo1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>; <italic>Robo2</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) mice hindbrains at the level of CF axon decussation, TAG-1 immunoreactivity was found in circumferentially growing axons coursing not only superficially but also within the deep region where CF axons should reside (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,F</xref>). In the midline region, no interruption of stained profiles was found, indicating that TAG-1 continues to be expressed in axons undergoing midline crossing, perhaps only being switched off when axons exit the FP. In contrast, in homozygous (<italic>Robo1</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>;Robo2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mutants, TAG-1 staining appeared much weaker around the midline, leaving a dark strip in the middle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K</xref>, arrow). Similar results were obtained by staining with anti-Rig-1 (data not shown), which stains commissural axons in a pattern similar to TAG-1 (see below). The most straightforward interpretation of these results is that CF axons stall at the FP, with most failing to cross the midline. Alternatively, it is possible that there is no change in CF trajectory but rather TAG-1 (or Rig-1) expression is down-regulated before CF axons enter the midline in the double knockout mice.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Midline crossing errors in <italic>Robo1</italic>/<italic>2 </italic>double knockout mice</bold>.

There were also a small number of midline crossing axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, arrow). These results raise the possibility that axons other than CF axons also express Robo1 and Robo2 in the rostral hindbrain. In the hindbrain, the earliest commissural axons originate from neurons located near the midline and cross the midline at around E10 in mouse (Y Furukawa, K Yamauchi and F Murakami, unpublished observations). Moreover, <italic>Robo1 </italic>and <italic>Robo2 </italic>are also expressed in the basal plate (data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that Robo1- and Robo2-immunoreactive longitudinal axons originate from these early developing commissural axons whose cell bodies are located near the ventral midline.</p><p>Rig-1 was highly expressed in a large population of CF axons before they crossed the FP, but not in the post-crossing portion of CF axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, green).

Taken together, these results support the notion that Robo1 and Robo2 play crucial roles in midline crossing of CF axons.</p><p>However, the present double labelling experiments failed to show immunoreactivities of either Robo1 or Robo2 in CF axons at the stages when they initiate longitudinal growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). This contrasts with observations in the spinal cord where expression of Robo1 and Robo2 appears to be up-regulated in the longitudinal portion of post-crossing commissural axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, while pathfinding of spinal commissural axons is consistent with the model describing augmented repulsion by FP-derived repellents, including Slit, after axons cross the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], this does not seem to hold true for hindbrain commissural axons. In the rostral hindbrain, where CF axons execute a longitudinal turn, the motor column, which expresses Slit in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and is thought to contribute to post-crossing navigation of commissural axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], does not exist. Thus, the model that post-crossing axons are propelled into a longitudinal pathway by Slit expressed in the midline and ventral spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] does not seem to hold true for post-crossing navigation of CF axons (see below).</p><p>The midline-crossing phenotype in <italic>Robo1</italic>/<italic>2 </italic>double knockout mice reported here may be explained by assuming that activation of Robo1 or Robo2 is required to silence the attractive effect of Netrin-1, as was proposed previously based on <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments using <italic>Xenopus </italic>neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], thus promoting midline exit.

Robo 1 and Robo 2 appear to cooperatively guide axons of the lateral olfactory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and forebrain major axonal tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, the previous finding that Robo1 regulates midline crossing of the spinal commissural axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] favours the view that Robo1 is crucial for the phenotype observed in this study. A similar finding was recently reported for the formation of the corpus callosum, where Robo1 but not Robo2 is expressed and <italic>Robo1 </italic>knockout mice display malformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Consistent with this, we found that Rig-1 was expressed by CF axons before midline crossing and was dramatically reduced after midline crossing (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Similar expression patterns for Rig-1 and phenotype in <italic>Rig-1 </italic>knockout mice have been observed in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], suggesting that a common mechanism operates for midline crossing between the spinal cord and the hindbrain. Recently, two isoforms of Rig-1 (Robo3) with distinct cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal regions have been found, one of which, Robo3.1, is expressed on the pre-crossing portion and another, Robo3.2, on the post-crossing portion of spinal commissural axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Since our antibody against ectodomain recognizes both isoforms, post-crossing CF axons do not seem to express either isoform.</p><p>The phenotype of midline crossing failure observed in the spinal cord can be partially rescued by removing <italic>Slit1 </italic>and <italic>Slit2 </italic>or <italic>Robo1</italic>, suggesting that removal of Rig-1 up-regulates commissural axon sensitivity to midline Slits, preventing midline crossing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Consistent with this, a failure of neurite outgrowth from the dorsal spinal cord explant of <italic>Rig-1 </italic>knockout mice towards a FP explant turns into robust growth of neurites in the presence of Robo2 ectodomain proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our results showing that CF axons had midline crossing defects similar to spinal commissural axons suggest that Rig-1 also plays a crucial role in midline crossing of hindbrain commissural axons and support the possibility that Rig-1 plays a global role in commissural axon guidance at all axial levels.</p><p>It is noteworthy that all commissural axons as visualized by TAG-1 staining were affected in the Rig-1 mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).

One possibility to explain the behaviour of post-crossing axons without assuming a Rig-1-Robo1 interaction is gain of responsiveness to a favourable cue. We have previously proposed a model that CF axons develop a gain of responsiveness to a favourable cue to explain the behaviour of the longitudinal turn in CF axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. CF axons become sensitive to a longitudinally aligned putative cue in the basal plate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>, yellow strip) after ventral midline crossing, allowing them to make a longitudinal turn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This idea tempts us to hypothesize that pre-crossing CF axons may normally be unable to respond to this presumptive cue expressed in the basal plate due to the presence of Rig-1. However, down-regulation of Rig-1 in post-crossing CF axons abolishes the inhibition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In <italic>Rig-1 </italic>mutants, CF axons turn longitudinally on the ipsilateral side because the absence of Rig-1 should enable them to recognize the basal plate cue there. The validity of this model awaits further studies on this hypothesized basal plate cue.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We provide evidence that Rig-1 is expressed by CF axons and is required for their approach to the midline, suggesting that Rig-1 plays a critical role in ventral midline crossing of commissural axons at all axial levels. Moreover, disruption of CF axon pathfinding in <italic>Robo1</italic>/<italic>2 </italic>double knockout mice demonstrates that Robo1, Robo2 or both contribute to the midline crossing of these axons. However, the failure to detect high level Robo1 and Robo2 expression on these axons during the longitudinal growth of CF axons suggests that expression of Robo1 and Robo2 are not required for longitudinal navigation of CF axons. Nevertheless, CF axons share some guidance mechanisms with spinal commissural axons as both: are attracted by midline Netrin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; express TAG-1 before midline crossing; change responsiveness to FP cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; and show a sharp turn from the circumferential to longitudinal axis after midline crossing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

The protein was separated by 5&#x02013;20% gradient SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BA-S85, Schleicher&#x00026;Schuell, Dassel, Germany) by a semidry blotting system (AE-6677, ATTO, Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>The membrane was incubated at room temperature with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween20 (TTBS) for 30 minutes, followed by a primary antibody in TTBS (2 &#x003bc;g/ml for Robo1 or Robo2, 5 &#x003bc;g/ml for Rig-1) or alkaline-phosphatase (AP) conjugated anti-human IgG-Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, U.S.A) overnight. They were washed three times with TTBS for 5 minutes. When Robo antibodies were used, membranes were further incubated with AP conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for 2 h. After washing three times with TTBS for 5 minutes, membranes were incubated with AP buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and immersed in NBT/BCIP solution (NBT, 0.375 mg/ml; BCIP, 0.188 mg/ml; Roche) in AP buffer to develop colour signals.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The procedures for preparing flat, whole-mount hindbrain followed those described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] with some modifications. E13&#x02013;E16 rats were removed and the hindbrain was dissected. After the hindbrain was cut along the dorsal midline, meninges were removed and the remainder of the brain was opened and flat, whole-mounted with the ventricular side down. All dissection procedures were performed in cold PBS solution. The brain was then fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH. 7.4) and stored at 4&#x000b0;C for several days. All procedures were done at room temperature thereafter. The preparations were incubated in a solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 minutes to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2% Triton X-100 (TBS-T) for 10 minutes. The preparations were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in TBS-T for 30 minutes and treated with primary antibodies (2 &#x003bc;g/ml against Robo1 or Robo2; 5 &#x003bc;g/ml against Rig-1) diluted in TBS-T containing 1% normal goat serum overnight. When the specificity of the primary antibodies was examined, preparations were pre-absorbed overnight with recombinant protein at a ratio of 100:1. After preparations were washed three times with TBS-T for 20 minutes, they were incubated with biotin conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (BA-1000, 1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) as the secondary antibody for 2 h. After three washes with TBS-T for 20 minutes and with TBS for 20 minutes, the preparations were incubated in avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC; Vector Vectastain ABC Elite kit, diluted 1:100 in TBS) for 2 h. After three washes with TBS for 20 minutes, the preparations were incubated for 40 minutes in diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (0.1% in TBS) with 0.002% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and 0.04% NiSO<sub>4</sub>.</p><p>For frozen sections, brains were removed from the pregnant rat and fixed in 4% PFA/0.1 M PB. The fixed brains were immersed in 20% sucrose/0.1 M PB overnight and embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Coronal sections were cut at 16 &#x003bc;m thickness with a cryostat (Microm, HM500M, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and mounted on slides coated with poly-L-lysine (Matsunami Glass Inc., Ltd, Osaka, Japan). For immunohistochemistry, almost all procedures were the same as above, but with some modifications. Sections were incubated in TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 instead of 2% Triton X-100. In all washing steps, the time for incubation was 10 minutes.</p><p>For immunohistochemistry of <italic>Rig-1</italic>-deficient mice and <italic>Robo1</italic>/<italic>2 </italic>double knockout mice, E13 embryos were fixed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and cut into 20 &#x003bc;m thick transverse sections. The sections were reacted with the anti-Rig-1 or anti-TAG-1 (4D7, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, no dilution) antibodies, then with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Whole-mount preparations of <italic>Rig-1 </italic>deficient mice were stained for TAG-1 as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization</title><p>cDNAs encoding ectodomains of rat Robo1 and Robo2 subcloned into pBluscriptSK were used to prepare sense and antisence RNA probes.

In brief, 2 &#x003bc;l EGFP plasmid was injected into the fourth ventricle and was electroporated to the cerebellar ventricular surface and the upper rhombic lip of E11 C57BL6 mice embryos. For electroporation, five 50 ms pulses with an amplitude of 40 V were applied at 950 ms intervals. One to two days after the electroporation, the embryo was fixed and the hindbrain was dissected out for cryosectioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Double labelling with DiO or DiD and fluorescence immunohistochemistry</title><p>Flat, whole-mount preparations were fixed in 4% PFA/0.1 M PB for 1 day at 4&#x000b0;C. Small crystals of the fluorescent tracer DiO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or DiD (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, U.S.A.) were implanted into the CP, which is the primordium of the cerebellum. The preparations were kept in 4% PFA/0.1 M PB overnight at room temperature. Then the preparations were stored in PBS containing 0.1% EDTA for 2&#x02013;4 days at room temperature to allow for dye diffusion. Afterwards, the preparations were embedded in 4% low-melting agarose (SIGMA Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) followed by sectioning coronally or parasagittaly into 50 &#x003bc;m thick slices by a vibrating blade microtome (VT1000S, Leica Microsystems, Tokyo, Japan) in PBS followed by immunohistochemistry.</p><p>Fluorescence immunohistochemistry on these sections was performed essentially the same as immunostaining on flat-mount hindbrain (see above) with some modifications. The incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide was omitted. All procedures were carried out in solutions without any detergent. And lastly, Cy3- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated streptavidin instead of avidin-biotin peroxidase complex was used for visualization.</p><p>Mouse embryos single labelled with DiI were treated similarly to double labelled ones.</p></sec><sec><title>Explant culture preparations</title><p>E13&#x02013;14 rat embryos were dissected in DMEM/F12 medium (Sigma, cat. no D-8900) with glucose (3.85 mg/ml). CP and FP explants were removed from longitudinally opened hindbrain using tungsten needles. After trimming, the explants were embedded together in collagen gels (separation &#x0003c; 500 &#x003bc;m). CP explants were co-cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 24&#x02013;48 h with FP explants. The culture medium was DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 3.85 mg/ml glucose, N2 Supplement (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, catalogue no 17502-048) and 10% FBS. Explant cultures were fixed in 4% PFA/0.1 M PB for 6&#x02013;12 h and observed with a phase contrast microscope. Following capture of phase contrast images, they were subjected to immunohistochemistry. For immunostaining, the explants were washed with PBS and permeated in PBS containing 0.2% TritonX-100 (0.2% PBST) followed by blocking in 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The explants were incubated with the anti-Rig-1 antibody (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After two washes each, for 30 minutes in 0.2% PBST, they were incubated in Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h at room temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Image processing</title><p>Flat, whole-mount preparations were gently coverslipped in TBS. The preparations were then observed with a light microscope (BX60, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CCD camera (HRc, AxioCAM, Zeiss or CoolSNAP HQ, Roper). For vibratome sections double labelled with DiO or DiD and Cy3-conjugated (or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated) streptavidin, images were captured by a CCD camera (C4880-40-26A, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan) for DiO and confocal microscopy (MRC1024ES, BIORAD) for DiD. For phenotype analysis in <italic>Rig1 </italic>or <italic>Robo1</italic>/<italic>Robo2 </italic>mutants, vibratome sections with DiI labelling were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (BX60, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) coupled with a CCD camera (AxioCAM, Zeiss).
