However, the in vivo function of EpCAM still remains elusive due to the lack of genetic loss-of-function studies. Here, we describe <italic>epcam</italic> (<italic>tacstd</italic>) null mutants in zebrafish. Maternal-zygotic mutants display compromised basal protrusive activity and epithelial morphogenesis in cells of the enveloping layer (EVL) during epiboly. In partial redundancy with E-cadherin (Ecad), EpCAM made by EVL cells is further required for cell&#x02013;cell adhesion within the EVL and, possibly, for proper attachment of underlying deep cells to the inner surface of the EVL, thereby also affecting deep cell epiboly movements. During later development, EpCAM per se becomes indispensable for epithelial integrity within the periderm of the skin, secondarily leading to disrupted morphology of the underlying basal epidermis and moderate hyper-proliferation of skin cells. On the molecular level, EVL cells of <italic>epcam</italic> mutant embryos display reduced levels of membranous Ecad, accompanied by an enrichment of tight junction proteins and a basal extension of apical junction complexes (AJCs). Our data suggest that EpCAM acts as a partner of E-cadherin to control adhesiveness and integrity as well as plasticity and morphogenesis within simple epithelia. In addition, EpCAM is required for the interaction of the epithelia with underlying cell layers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>EpCAM is a well-established marker for carcinomas of epithelial origin and a potential target for immunotherapy. In vitro analyses have implicated EpCAM in a plethora of different cellular processes, such as adhesion, motility, proliferation, differentiation, and signaling. Strikingly, depending on the context, EpCAM displayed rather opposite effects, either promoting or attenuating cell&#x02013;cell adhesion versus cell migration and tissue invasion, a phenomenon described as the &#x0201c;double-face&#x0201d; of EpCAM. However, the in vivo relevance of its different effects remained largely unclear. Here, we present the first genetic analysis of EpCAM function in vivo, based on loss-of-function mutants in the zebrafish. As it is in mammals, zebrafish EpCAM is expressed in simple epithelia. Mutant embryos display defects both in epithelial morphogenesis and in epithelial integrity. Reduced epithelial morphogenesis is accompanied, and possibly caused, by an extension of apical junctional complexes and compromised basal protrusive activity. Furthermore, mutant epithelia display alterations in the relative abundance of adherence junction versus tight junction components. In addition, EpCAM tightly cooperates with E-cadherin and has a previously unrecognized trans effect on the morphogenesis and integrity of underlying cell layers. Cell differentiation and proliferation in EpCAM mutants are not, or only secondarily, affected. During later development and adulthood, EpCAM is largely dispensable, reinforcing its suitability as a target for anti-carcinoma immunotherapy with minimal side effects.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="21"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Like in mammalian gestation embryos, the epidermis of teleost larvae is bi-layered, consisting of an outer enveloping cell layer (EVL), which morphologically and functionally resembles the periderm of mammalian embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-MBoneko1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, and a basal layer of keratinocytes.

In this study we generate maternal-zygotic zebrafish EpCAM mutants and chimeric embryos, revealing essential roles of EpCAM in the EVL for proper epithelial morphogenesis integrity during epiboly and skin development. Some of these roles are fulfilled in partial or complete redundancy with E-cadherin, whereas for others, EpCAM is absolutely indispensable. The molecular mechanisms underlying these in vivo functions are not completely clear. However, mutant cells display basal extensions of TJs and increased membrane levels of TJ components, coupled with reduced Ecad membrane localization and reduced protrusive basal activity. After skin formation, mutants also display hyper-proliferation of EVL and the underlying epidermal cells, which, however, seems to be a secondary consequence of the epithelial defects. We conclude that EpCAM acts as cell-cell adhesion molecule and a partner of E-cadherin, promoting both epithelial integrity and epithelial morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>epcam</italic> zebrafish mutants were identified in screen for abnormal skin development</title><p>To identify genes with essential functions during zebrafish skin development, we performed an antibody-based screen on a previously described bank of retroviral insertional mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Amsterdam1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, staining larvae at 120 hours post fertilization (hpf) for the basal keratinocyte-specific transcription factor &#x00394;Np63, which is required for epidermal development in both fish and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Mills1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Suh1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, p63-positive basal cells underneath the foci seemed unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g003">Figure 3C&#x02013;3E</xref>), and only formed aggregates much later (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000563.s001">Figure S1A</xref> for 48 hpf).

EpCAM-specific antibodies will be required to test this notion.</p><p>In addition to the epiboly and skin defects that are the focus of this work, <italic>epcam</italic> zebrafish mutants display compromised otolith formation in the developing inner ears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Amsterdam1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>).

Another site of prominent zygotic zebrafish <italic>epcam</italic> expression are the neuromasts of the lateral line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Indeed, Villablanca et al. had to inject highest amounts of morpholinos to obtain the phenotype, suggesting that it might have been an unspecific effect.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The role of EpCAM in the enveloping cell layer of gastrulating zebrafish embryos</title><p>During gastrulation, <italic>epcam</italic> is exclusively expressed in cells of the enveloping layer (EVL; see Introduction). Nevertheless, MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutants display moderate defects during epiboly movements of both the EVL and the underlying deep cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Our chimeric analyses in combination with E-cadherin inactivation indicate that the deep cell defects are secondary consequences of failed EpCAM function in the EVL, whereas the EVL defects themselves are layer autonomous (see below). During their spreading over the yolk, EVL cells normally change their shape and flatten out along the radial axis to increase their horizontal size. The cellular mechanisms underlying this transition are largely unknown. Here, we show that they involve basal protrusive activity of EVL cells, and that this activity is severely compromised in MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutants, leading to an overall reduction in the average horizontal size of mutant EVL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Recently, a similar impairment of EVL epiboly has been described for MZ<italic>pou5f1</italic> mutants. However, in this case, epiboly defects are accompanied by increased, rather than reduced protrusive activity of EVL cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Lachnit1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. This indicates that both gain and loss of protrusive activity can compromise epiboly. Future experiments have to address the functional connection between <italic>pou5fl</italic> and <italic>epcam</italic>. In MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutants, the lack of basal activity is accompanied by a basal extension of apical junctional complexes (AJCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g007">Figure 7</xref>), and by increased levels of TJ components in apico-basal membranes, whereas levels of E-cadherin (Ecad) and catenins are reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g008">Figure 8</xref>). These effects are consistent with the co-localization of EpCAM and Ecad in the basolateral membranes of wild-type EVL cells, and their exclusion from the apical Tjp1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Together, this suggests that EpCAM pushes the molecular composition of apico-basal membranes from TJ towards AJ components. In addition to the membrane, mutants displayed reduced perinuclear Ecad staining in the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that EpCAM also affects de novo synthesized Ecad protein. Currently, we cannot distinguish which of the observed phenotypic traits are primary, and which secondary. However, neither knockdown of tjp1&#x02013;3 nor re-introduction of Ecad led to an alleviation of the mutant phenotype or a restoration of basal protrusions, suggesting that EpCAM might have multiple targets and interaction partners, rather than acting via a single mediator. Generally, protrusion formation is driven by rearrangements of the cortical cytoskeleton that are coordinated with local modulations in cellular adhesiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Hammerschmidt1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, according to our TEM studies, the protrusions of EVL cells primarily attach to the basal membrane of adjacent other EVL cells, rather than to underlying deep cells or extracellular matrix components, while protrusions remain much shorter and broader in MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In this light, it is tempting to speculate that the thinning of EVL cells underlying EVL epiboly might be driven by the &#x0201c;crawling&#x0201d; of basal protrusions on the basal surface of adjacent EVL cells, and that EpCAM might be particularly involved in modulating cell-cell adhesiveness and cortical tension in basolateral domains of EVL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g011">Figure 11A and 11B</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000563-g011" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000563.g011</object-id><label>Figure 11</label><caption><title>Model of cellular processes at play during EVL epiboly in wild-type embryos and different EpCAM/Ecad-deficient combinations.</title><p>Schematic drawings of EVL&#x02013;EVL&#x02013;deep cell interphase regions at, from left to right, progressing stages of zebrafish gastrulation.

(A) wild-type conditions; (B) MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutant; (C) MZ<italic>ecpam</italic> mutant with concomitant partial loss of E-cadherin; (D) MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutant with concomitant complete loss of E-cadherin. At the onset of gastrulation, EVL cells start to from basal protrusions, initiated by cytoskeletal rearrangement to overcome the cortical surface pressure, as indicated by grey arrow. Protrusions attach to the basal surface of adjacent EVL cell and increase in length. This leads to a progressive narrowing of the lateral side of the EVL cell, and to an increase of its basal surface, and eventually of its entire horizontal size. Protrusion growth is dependent on EpCAM function, which might be involved both in the cytoskeletal rearrangement (crossed out grey arrow in B), and/or in mediating adhesion between the protrusion and the adjacent cell. The latter notion, which would be in line with the existence with homophilic EpCAM trans bonds, is supported by results obtained via re-introduction of EpCAM into single EVL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The gain of basal surface and the transition from a curved to a straighter shape increases the chance of successful attachment of emerging deep cells (green cell number 2) to the inner surface of the EVL, thereby linking progression of EVL and deep layer epiboly. However, simultaneous further movement forces are required, such as directed pulling from the EVL margin, to account for a net gain of basal surface throughout the entire layer (indicated by black arrows). Otherwise, the surface gain of one cell would be equalized by a corresponding loss of free surface in the adjacent cell. These dynamic EVL cell shape changes are layer-autonomous and largely independent of the underlying deep cells. Otherwise, it would be impossible to uncouple EVL from deep layer epiboly, as seen in strong <italic>ecad</italic> mutants and morphants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Kppen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, deep layer epiboly is strictly dependent on a functional EVL. Partial loss of Ecad in MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutant EVL cells causes destabilization of the adhesion between the basal side of EVL cells and underlying deep cells (C). As a consequence, deep cells can move back into more internal layers, and deep layer epiboly is severely compromised. In contrast, EVL epiboly is only slightly retarded, as in regular MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutants (due to the persistence of the other moving forces indicated by the black arrow). Adhesion among EVL cells becomes only severely compromised upon combined complete loss of EpCAM and Ecad (D). This indicates that EVL&#x02013;deep cell adhesion requires higher Ecad/EpCAM levels than EVL&#x02013;EVL cell adhesion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000563.s008">Text S1</xref> for further details). Our chimera analyses further indicate that for proper deep cell epiboly, both EpCAM and Ecad are only crucial in the EVL, but dispensable in the deep cells themselves, suggesting that here, other or additional adhesion molecules (indicated in green) might be involved in mediating trans-adhesion to the overlying EVL. It remains unclear whether EpCAM and Ecad act in a complex, or as rather independent molecules with partially redundant adhesive properties. Therefore, this model does distinguish between the two molecules (commonly indicated in red). Not considered is the basal extension of apical junctional complexes in mutants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000563.g011"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>In vivo interaction of EpCAM and E-cadherin to regulate layer-intrinsic and trans-layer adhesion of the zebrafish EVL</title><p>In contrast to cell culture studies identifying EpCAM as a functional antagonist of Ecad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Winter1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Litvinov2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that zebrafish EpCAM and Ecad tightly interact and enhance each other's effects to promote EVL integrity as well as deep cell epiboly. While each of them per se was dispensable for EVL integrity, combined loss of both EpCAM and Ecad led to severe and layer-autonomous EVL disassembly during early gastrulation stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This indicates that EpCAM and Ecad play essential, yet redundant roles to mediate proper cell-cell adhesion among EVL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g011">Figure 11D</xref>). Similarly, partial inactivation of Ecad, which had no effect in a wild-type background, led to a complete arrest of deep cell epiboly in MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g010">Figure 10A and 10B</xref>). Interestingly, also here, the effect depended purely on EpCAM and Ecad function in the EVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g010">Figure 10C and 10D</xref>). On the cellular level, the epiboly arrest was accompanied by a failure of intercalating deep cells to remain in the external deep layer directly underneath the EVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g010">Figure 10E&#x02013;10G</xref>), pointing to defects in the adhesion between EVL and underlying deep cells, thus, across different layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g011">Figure 11C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In this light, both the tissue integrity defects caused by loss of EpCAM function in the background of complete <italic>ecad</italic> inactivation, and the tissue morphogenesis defects caused by loss of EpCAM function in the background of partial <italic>ecad</italic> inactivation, seem to result from reduced intercellular adhesion. But what are the reasons for the exclusive effects on epiboly, but not EVL-EVL adhesion, in the <italic>ecad</italic> hypomorphic background? Differential contributions of Ecad and EpCAM to EVL-EVL versus EVL-deep cell binding could be one factor. EVL-EVL cell adhesion involves apical junctional complexes and desmosomes, and might therefore be less dependent on &#x0201c;free&#x0201d; basolaterally localized EpCAM and Ecad than EVL-deep cell adhesion, which lacks such junctions. Alternatively or in addition, the deep cell epiboly arrest might be due to combined effects on cell adhesiveness <underline>and</underline> its dynamic regulation. During gastrulation, deep cells undergo massive spatial rearrangements in addition to radial intercalations, one of the driving forces of epiboly. For instance, they simultaneously move from ventrolateral into dorsal regions of the embryo to form the embryonic body axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Hammerschmidt1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, neighborships between EVL and deep cells need to change rather rapidly. In this light, it is feasible to speculate that EpCAM might also be involved in regulating the dynamic dis- and re-assembly of EVL-deep cell contacts to allow proper morphogenesis. Cadherin contacts can be regulated at multiple levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Yap1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, and membrane localization of Ecad has recently been shown to be dynamically regulated via endocytosis and recycling during gastrulation movements of deep cells in zebrafish and frog embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Hammerschmidt1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Ulrich1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Ogata1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, they seem to mutually influence each other, with a positive effect of EpCAM on membranous Ecad levels and, possibly, Ecad synthesis and recycling. Subject to dynamic regulation, cadherins are well known for their multiple, and seemingly contrary effects, not only promoting cell-cell adhesiveness and tissue integrity, but also cellular plasticity and cellular &#x0201c;grip&#x0201d; during morphogenesis. Similar mechanisms might underlie EpCAM's reported &#x0201c;double face&#x0201d; function also revealed in this work. Future biochemical studies will be necessary to elucidate the molecular basis of the EpCAM &#x02013; E-cadherin partnership. Since they play largely redundant roles, they do not necessarily have to physically interact at all. They could for instance mediate different modes of adhesion, cadherins in connection with the highly structured actin cytoskeleton and EpCAM more independently of the cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Trzpis1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Wrfel1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this notion, our immunolocalization studies indicate a salt-and-pepper like distribution of EpCAM and Ecad, rather than complete co-localization in the basolateral membrane of EVL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g008">Figure 8J</xref>). However, it is interesting to note that in the context of nuclear signaling, complex formation between the intracellular domain of EpCAM and &#x003b2;-catenin has been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Maetzel1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

From mid-segmentation onwards (14 hpf), the outer EVL, now also called periderm, is juxtaposed against a single layer of basal keratinocytes, which derive from the ventral ectoderm, a subpopulation of deep cells initially located in ventral-animal regions of the pregastrula embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Kimmel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Both layers display <italic>epcam</italic> expression, and both display compromised epithelial integrity in <italic>epcam</italic> mutants. However, the defects in the periderm are already apparent when the basal layer is still normal (16 hpf; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g003">Figure 3C&#x02013;3E</xref>). This later periderm defects are very similar to those caused by combined loss of EpCAM and E-cadherin during gastrulation. It remains unclear, however, why in contrast to the early stages and despite its maintained expression, E-cadherin fails to compensate for loss of EpCAM after skin formation. Furthermore, consistent with the aforementioned effect of EpCAM from the EVL on epiboly movements of the underlying deep cells, our chimera analyses reveal that defects in the basal layer are due to a non-autonomous effect from the EVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g003">Figure 3H and 3I</xref>). Also, similar to the situation during epiboly, <italic>epcam</italic> mutants display a persistent basal extension of AJCs in EVL cells during such later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g007">Figure 7J and 7L</xref>). Although the role of tight junctions in cell adhesion is still disputable, it is generally accepted that their impact compared to adherence junctions and desmosomes is minor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Kubota1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Turksen1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>. In this light, and in light of the observed negative effect of the MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutation on membranous Ecad levels and cell-cell adhesiveness during gastrulation, we assume that the epithelial defects of the mutant periderm are due to reduced, rather than enhanced cell-cell adhesiveness. In addition, defects might be enhanced by reduced epithelial plasticity. Consistent with this notion, initial epithelial lesions in the periderm of <italic>epcam</italic> mutants were most prominent on the tailbud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and the head, regions that undergo massive morphogenesis and that are exposed to highest mechanical stress.

However, no mesenchymal-like behavior was observed in time-lapse recordings of basal keratinocytes or EVL cells of <italic>epcam</italic> mutants (K.S. and M.H., unpublished observations). In sum, these data suggest that similar to the defects during epiboly, the later skin defects of <italic>epcam</italic> mutants are due to compromised intercellular adhesion and cellular plasticity of epithelial cells.</p><p>In light of the reported roles of EpCAM in multiple other cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and cell differentiation, we also investigated whether and when skin cells of MZ<italic>epcam</italic> mutants develop corresponding defects. However, in contrast to other reported zebrafish skin mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Webb1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>, EVL and basal cells showed normal levels of terminal differentiation markers (Keratin, ATPases; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000563.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Also, although EVL and basal cells displayed an up to 50&#x00025; increase in proliferation, this hyper-proliferation only became apparent several hours after the epithelial defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, aggregates of both EVL and basal cells displayed similar rates of BrdU incorporation like regions remote of the aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000563-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). An interesting side outcome of the BrdU incorporation studies, also confirmed by time-lapse recordings (K.S. and M.H., unpublished data), was the demonstration that EVL cells divide at all. This had not been shown before. Rather, it was widely believed that the EVL grows by cell shape changes, and that it later sloughs off, being replaced by cells deriving from basal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000563-Kimmel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our data suggest that the growth of the two larval zebrafish skin layers might involve layer-autonomous, horizontal cell divisions, rather than or in addition to vertical growth/replacement, the typical concept of stratified epithelia.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies indicate that loss of EpCAM in the developing zebrafish skin primarily leads to compromised epithelial plasticity and adhesiveness, whereas hyper-proliferation is a secondary consequence, possibly due to the loss of contact inhibition.

DAPI-stained nuclei are shown in blue (A,D,G,J,M,P); scale bar, 10 &#x000b5;m. Fluorescent labeling of key components of tight junctions reveals a reduction in membrane localization of Tjp1 in EpCAM- (F) versus GFP-transfected (C) cells. Similarly, Occludin staining is reduced in EpCAM expressing MDCK cells (I, L). However, proteins localizing to adherens junctions or desmosomes are not altered in expression or cellular distribution, as shown for DPI/II (O, R).
