In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, germline inheritance of the protein PIE-1 is accomplished by first asymmetrically localizing the protein to the germplasm before cleavage and subsequently degrading residual levels of the protein in the somatic cytoplasm after cleavage. Despite its critical involvement in cell fate determination, the enrichment of germline determinants remains poorly understood. Here, combining live-cell fluorescence methods and kinetic modeling, we demonstrate that the enrichment process does not involve protein immobilization, intracellular compartmentalization, or localized protein degradation. Instead, our results support a heterogeneous reaction/diffusion model for PIE-1 enrichment in which the diffusion coefficient of PIE-1 is reversibly reduced in the posterior, resulting in a stable protein gradient across the zygote at steady state.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The faithful segregation of several cell fate determinants in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> early embryo is mediated by the formation of stable intracellular gradients during the first few embryonic cleavages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Priess, 1994</xref>). Newly fertilized zygotes undergo drastic cortical and cytoplasmic polarization along the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis, resulting in posterior enrichment of multiple germline determinants, collectively referred to as the germplasm, that become preferentially inherited by the nascent posterior germline daughter cell upon cleavage. One such determinant is the CCCH zinc finger protein PIE-1, an essential maternally encoded component of the germplasm, which participates in germline specification by both repressing transcription and promoting expression of maternally encoded programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Seydoux et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tenenhaus et al., 2001</xref>). Asymmetrical inheritance of PIE-1 involves two distinct mechanisms, both of which are mediated by separate domains at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reese et al., 2000</xref>): PIE-1 is initially enriched in the posterior of the zygote before division (enrichment) and residual levels of PIE-1 are subsequently cleared from the somatic blastomere through cullin-dependent ubiquitination (degradation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeRenzo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Spike and Strome, 2003</xref>). Here we address the open questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Pellettieri and Seydoux, 2002</xref>) of how PIE-1 becomes enriched in the germplasm of the zygote and what prevents the PIE-1 protein gradient from dissipating before the first cleavage.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To characterize PIE-1 behavior in the early embryo, we quantitatively measured fluorescence levels within zygotes expressing a GFP::PIE-1 fusion gene under control of the <italic>pie-1</italic> promoter and 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, a and b</xref>). GFP::PIE-1 becomes enriched in the posterior, on and around punctate structures known as P granules, which are RNA-rich components of the germplasm. Although GFP::PIE-1 also becomes enriched in pronuclei, the nuclear localization of PIE-1 has been shown to have little effect on cytoplasmic enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tenenhaus et al., 2001</xref>). Posterior fluorescence intensity reached a plateau value approximately three times the initial prefertilization level, whereas anterior fluorescence intensity decreased to approximately half its initial value. Overall fluorescence intensity in the zygote increased slightly during the first cell division, suggesting a low level of expression throughout the first division.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Posterior enrichment of GFP::PIE-1 does not involve degradation.</bold> Zygotes expressing GFP::PIE-1 under the <italic>pie-1</italic> promoter and 3&#x02032;-UTR (a) and the corresponding fluorescence intensity levels in distinct regions of the zygote (b; pronuclear meeting is denoted as <italic>t</italic> = 0 and <italic>n</italic> = 6).

These findings have prompted speculation that MEX-5/6 may mediate PIE-1 enrichment by locally degrading PIE-1 in the anterior of the zygote, where MEX-5/6 become enriched before the first cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Betschinger and Knoblich, 2004</xref>). To investigate this hypothesis, we used RNAi to compare GFP::PIE-1 behavior between wild-type and <italic>mex-5/6</italic> embryos. If <italic>mex-5/6</italic> mediate the degradation of PIE-1 in the zygote, the overall level of fluorescence is expected to become lower in wild-type than in <italic>mex-5/6</italic> embryos, where targeted degradation would be absent. Our data show that although GFP::PIE-1 failed to become enriched in <italic>mex-5/6</italic> embryos (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809077/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809077/DC1</ext-link>), the overall fluorescence levels remained essentially identical to those of wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>). Therefore, <italic>mex-5/6</italic> appear to mediate PIE-1 enrichment by a mechanism that does not involve targeted protein degradation.</p><p>To further test the possibility that protein degradation plays a role in PIE-1 enrichment, we compared the overall zygotic fluorescence intensity levels of GFP::PIE-1 with those of an otherwise identical genetic construct (denoted as GFP alone), lacking the <italic>pie-1</italic> ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>). If the PIE-1 protein were targeted for degradation within the zygote, we should expect levels of GFP::PIE-1 to decrease in comparison to GFP alone. Furthermore, if a nonspecific polarized degradation process were taking place, GFP molecules would be expected to exhibit a gradient across the zygote as well. Our results show that the absence of the <italic>pie-1</italic> ORF did not affect the overall relative levels of the fluorescent gene product nor did any gradient result (Fig. S1). Together these results strongly suggest that the posterior enrichment of PIE-1 is not mediated by protein degradation.</p><p>Another hypothetical explanation for PIE-1 enrichment is asymmetrical protein immobilization or &#x0201c;protein trapping.&#x0201d; To investigate this possibility, we used FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Axelrod et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Reits and Neefjes, 2001</xref>) to characterize GFP::PIE-1 dynamics in the germplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, a and b</xref>). We photobleached 4.5-&#x000b5;m-diameter circular regions in the posterior cytoplasm of zygotes at pronuclear meeting and measured the subsequent fluorescence intensity recovery within the photobleached region. Because photobleaching can be considered irreversible over our experimental time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Axelrod et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2001</xref>; Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809077/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809077/DC1</ext-link>), fluorescence recovery can be used to measure the mobility of GFP::PIE-1. The photobleached regions underwent essentially full recovery (immobile fraction &#x0003c;5%), demonstrating that GFP::PIE-1 remains freely mobile in the germplasm during the enrichment process.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>GFP::PIE-1 exhibits unrestricted mobility within the zygote.</bold> (a and b) At pronuclear meeting, 4.5-&#x000b5;m-diameter circular regions (arrow) were photobleached in the posterior cytoplasm of embryos expressing GFP::PIE-1.

Many cells, including <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygotes, have the ability to maintain nonuniform intracellular concentrations by sequestering certain components to subcellular organelles, such as the nucleus or Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Poteryaev et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, if the diffusion of GFP::PIE-1 from the posterior to the anterior were prevented by a physical boundary, we might expect concentration asymmetries to develop. To test the hypothesis that subcellular compartmentalization plays a role in PIE-1 enrichment, we measured the fluorescence loss in photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2001</xref>) of GFP::PIE-1 across the A/P boundary. Beginning at pronuclear meeting, we repeatedly photobleached the posterior cytoplasm while alternately measuring the fluorescence intensity in the anterior cytoplasm and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, c&#x02013;f</xref>). After 500 s (around the time of cleavage), the mean anterior fluorescence intensity in embryos that were repeatedly bleached in the posterior decreased to a value of 55 &#x000b1; 5% of that of control embryos (P = 0.00011). Similarly, the mean posterior fluorescence intensity in embryos repeatedly bleached in the anterior decreased to a value of 40 &#x000b1; 6% of that of control embryos (P = 0.000032). Together, these results show that GFP::PIE-1 is able to diffuse across the A/P boundary.</p><p>Having eliminated the leading hypotheses for enrichment, we propose a diffusion-limited reaction/diffusion model involving two distinct species of PIE-1 with unequal diffusion coefficients. Our model involves a cyclic change in the effective diffusion coefficient of PIE-1 caused by a diffusion-limited heterogeneous reaction taking place in the posterior coupled with a homogeneous reverse conversion taking place in the bulk cytoplasm. Specifically, free PIE-1 (<italic>P</italic>) is catalyzed by a heterogeneous posterior component to undergo an instantaneous conversion to a &#x0201c;slow&#x0201d; form (<italic>P</italic>*) that has a diffusion coefficient less than that of the free protein. This slow form then diffuses through the cytoplasm where it undergoes homogeneous conversion back to the rapidly diffusing form as governed by first-order kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Posterior enrichment of PIE-1 is driven by binary counterdiffusion.</bold> (a) We propose that free PIE-1 (<italic>P</italic>) undergoes a heterogeneous surface reaction in the posterior of the zygote that causes a reduction in its effective diffusion coefficient. This resultant &#x0201c;slow&#x0201d; species of PIE-1 (<italic>P</italic>*) homogenously reverts back to its initial form in the cytoplasm. (b) Analytical solutions of the concentration profiles of both species of PIE-1, <italic>x</italic> = 0 to <italic>x</italic> = <italic>L</italic>, reveal an overall concentration gradient along the A/P axis. The experimental concentration profiles were taken from the central 30 &#x000b5;m of the A/P axis (where the shape of the gradient is most pronounced) to avoid intensity spikes from P granules in the posterior and large plateaus in intensity in the anterior, which interfere with data fitting. (c) The half-times of recovery of GFP::PIE-1 intensity in 4.5-&#x000b5;m-diameter circular photobleached region experiments from the anterior and posterior cytoplasm were 0.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 (<italic>n</italic> = 38) and 4.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 s (<italic>n</italic> = 7), respectively. (d) Normalized autocorrelation curves of FCS fluctuation data showed differences between anterior and posterior diffusion of GFP::PIE-1. Theoretical diffusion curves suggest the presence of two species of PIE-1 in the anterior cytoplasm, with diffusion coefficients of 8.7 &#x000b1; 0.6 and 0.6 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively. The posterior cytoplasm is well described by a three-component model with diffusion coefficients of 14.2 &#x000b1; 7.8, 0.6 &#x000b1; 0.3, and 0.006 &#x000b1; 0.002 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>/s.

This theoretical PIE-1 concentration profile predicted from our model agrees remarkably well with experimental concentration profile data obtained from fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, simple dynamic association (equilibrium binding) of PIE-1 with a posterior component does not have the capability to generate a stable cytoplasmic gradient at steady state. Although the protein may become enriched on the surface itself, there is nothing to prevent any hypothetical protein gradient from dissipating. Therefore, equilibrium binding cannot explain the PIE-1 concentration gradient that persists along the A/P axis of the zygote before cleavage. Mathematically, the equation of change for this system becomes <italic>D<sub>P</sub></italic>&#x02207;<sup>2</sup><italic>P</italic> = 0, with zero-flux boundary conditions at both the binding surfaces and cell membrane at steady state. From this equation and boundary conditions we easily obtain a concentration profile of <italic>P</italic>(x) = constant, revealing the absence of a concentration gradient within the embryo. Furthermore, protein anchoring (irreversible binding) will cause PIE-1 to be locally depleted from the posterior cytoplasm. This is contrary to experimental observation, and, similar to equilibrium binding, irreversible binding cannot prevent the dissipation of a hypothetical gradient. Thus, neither equilibrium binding nor irreversible binding of PIE-1 have the capacity to give rise to a stable cytoplasmic gradient at steady state.</p><p>Our model predicts that the relative amounts of slow and fast diffusing species of PIE-1 will vary along the A/P axis, with a greater fraction of slow diffusing <italic>P</italic>* in the posterior cytoplasm than in the anterior cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>). Therefore, the overall bulk rate of diffusion of PIE-1 should be slower in the posterior cytoplasm than in the anterior cytoplasm. To verify this prediction, we performed FRAP on 4.5-&#x000b5;m-diameter circular regions in the anterior and posterior cytoplasm and fit the fluorescence recovery profiles to theoretical recovery curves for simple diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, c and d</xref>). Because control GFP recovers at the same rate in both the anterior and posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tenlen et al., 2008</xref>), differences between the rates of recovery of GFP::PIE-1 in the anterior and posterior are not caused by bulk cytoplasmic differences. Indeed, our results demonstrate a ratio of A/P recovery half-times of 6.4 &#x000b1; 2.8 s (0.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 and 4.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 s in the anterior and posterior, respectively).</p><p>We further characterized asymmetries in the diffusion of GFP::PIE-1 using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kim et al., 2007</xref>), in which the time correlation of fluctuations in fluorescence intensity within a small focal volume is analyzed to characterize the behavior of the diffusible species within that volume. We continuously monitored photon emission from 0.2 femtoliters of control volumes in both the anterior and posterior cytoplasm of zygotes during mitosis and generated normalized autocorrelation curves for each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 e</xref>), from which we can infer properties of the diffusion of the fluorescent molecules in the zygote. As predicted by our model, we found that the decay in autocorrelation was markedly different in anterior and posterior cytoplasm and that one-component diffusion did not accurately fit our data (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809077/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809077/DC1</ext-link>), suggesting the presence of multiple species of PIE-1 in the zygote. FCS analysis in the anterior cytoplasm indicated a two-component mixture with diffusion coefficients of 8.7 &#x000b1; 0.6 and 0.6 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively, which reflect the diffusion coefficients of fast and slow diffusing species, <italic>P</italic> and <italic>P</italic>*. Similarly, the posterior cytoplasm was well described by a three-component fit, which yielded diffusion coefficients of 14.2 &#x000b1; 7.8, 0.6 &#x000b1; 0.3, and 0.006 &#x000b1; 0.002 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>/s. The first two diffusion coefficients are experimentally equivalent to those of <italic>P</italic> and <italic>P</italic>* from anterior FCS, whereas the third agrees well with the mean diffusion coefficient of P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2006</xref>). The composition of the fluorescence in the anterior cytoplasm was determined to be &#x0223c;80% <italic>P</italic> and &#x0223c;20% <italic>P</italic>*, whereas the posterior cytoplasm mixture was &#x0223c;30% <italic>P</italic>, &#x0223c;40% <italic>P</italic>*, and &#x0223c;30% P granules (hence the cytoplasmic protein composition is &#x0223c;40% <italic>P</italic> and &#x0223c;60% <italic>P</italic>*). This difference in the <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>* ratio along the A/P axis is in excellent agreement with the predictions of our model. Thus, our FCS data verifies multiple predictions of our model and further reveals that the ratio of the diffusion coefficients of <italic>P</italic> and <italic>P</italic>* is at least an order of magnitude.</p><p>Based on previous studies showing that PIE-1 and P granules are coordinately enriched in the germplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tenenhaus et al., 1998</xref>) and that the ability to associate with P granules may be necessary for PIE-1 enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reese et al., 2000</xref>), we considered the possibility that the heterogeneous reaction described in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>) occurs on the surface of P granules. In this case, PIE-1 is predicted to become enriched in the vicinity of P granules, and the overall sum of the contribution of each P granule will yield an equivalent gradient across the embryo. We photobleached individual P granules in GFP::PIE-1 embryos and found that their fluorescence recovered significantly and was well described by a theoretical diffusion curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, a and b</xref>). Because of the fact that P granules do not recover in whole embryo FRAP (unpublished data), we conclude that this recovery of P granules must be caused by dynamic association with GFP::PIE-1. Moreover, we found that the recovery half-time of P granule FRAP (9.8 &#x000b1; 1.3 s) is significantly longer than that of GFP::PIE-1 in the germplasm (4.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 s; P = 0.00096). As explained above, the steady-state flux at the surface will be limited by the diffusion of the slower species, which may explain differences in recovery time between posterior cytoplasmic FRAP and P granule FRAP. Furthermore, because the composition of the anterior cytoplasm is predicted to consist of mostly fast diffusing species <italic>P</italic>, the ratio of recovery half-times from P granule FRAP and anterior cytoplasmic FRAP should be a more accurate estimation of the actual ratio of the diffusion coefficients of both species of PIE-1. Indeed, this ratio (14.0 &#x000b1; 6.2) agrees well with the ratio of diffusion coefficients predicted from FCS (14.5 &#x000b1; 4.9). Thus, we propose that P granules may act, at least in part, to selectively slow the diffusion of germline proteins in the germplasm.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>PIE-1 exhibits dynamic interaction with P granules.</bold> (a and b) Individually photobleached P granules (arrows) in GFP::PIE-1 embryos underwent significant fluorescent recovery with a mean half-time of 9.8 &#x000b1; 1.3 s (<italic>n</italic> = 6).

P granule localization is mediated by <italic>mex-5/6</italic>&#x02013;dependent cytoplasmic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hird and White, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Golden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheeks et al., 2004</xref>) as well as by localized degradation in the anterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hird et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>), and P granules fail to localize in <italic>mex-5/6</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheeks et al., 2004</xref>; this study; unpublished data). This may explain how <italic>mex-5/6</italic> are able to mediate PIE-1 localization without mediating its degradation. Similarly, the symmetry of PIE-1 in <italic>mbk-2</italic> embryos may also be explained by the inability of these embryos to properly segregate P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Pellettieri et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Formally, there are several plausible physical explanations for a change in diffusion coefficient for cytoplasmic proteins including conformational changes or the formation of a complex. Because the diffusion coefficient scales inversely with hydrodynamic radius (from the Stokes-Einstein equation), an order of magnitude decrease in diffusion coefficient would be expected from an order of magnitude increase in radius, which is equivalent to a 1,000-fold increase in volume. Therefore, it seems doubtful that a conformational change alone could explain the large difference in the diffusion coefficient between species. Rather, we speculate that the diffusion of PIE-1 is slowed because of the formation of a complex. Based on the facts that PIE-1&#x02019;s second zinc finger plays an important role in PIE-1 enrichment, RNA is a major component of P granules, and the diffusion coefficient of RNA is typically significantly smaller than that of globular proteins (because of its larger hydrodynamic radius), we speculate that the effective change in the diffusion coefficient of PIE-1 may result from binding with a putative RNA.</p><p>We demonstrate how long range intracellular molecular gradients can be maintained by diffusion-controlled mechanisms, without localized degradation or immobilization and without the presence of physical barriers. Preliminary evidence suggests that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote may use a similar mechanism to enrich other proteins in both the germplasm as well as the somatic cytoplasm (unpublished data). Indeed, our model offers an alternative interpretation of the data from a recent study of the asymmetrical enrichment of MEX-5 in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tenlen et al., 2008</xref>). We anticipate that similar diffusion-controlled mechanisms may mediate protein gradients required for a variety of key cellular processes, including tissue/organ morphogenesis, localized cell differentiation, and collective cell migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>C. elegans</title><p>The GFP::PIE-1 <italic>C. elegans</italic> strain used in this study (JH1545; provided by G.

We collected fluorescent images of individual embryos with a scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) with a Plan Apochromat 100&#x000d7; 1.4 NA differential interference contrast oil immersion lens (Carl Zeiss, Inc.), using 1.2 scan zoom and 512 &#x000d7; 512 resolution. The microscope was controlled using the LSM acquisition software (version 4.2; Carl Zeiss, Inc.). GFP was excited at 488 nm using the argon laser. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using LSM Image Examiner software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). All embryos were monitored until at least the eight-cell stage to ensure viability. Imaging acquisition temperature was maintained at 25&#x000b0;C using an ASI 400 stage warmer (Nevtek), except for FCS, which was performed at room temperature.

The microscope was controlled using the LSM acquisition software. Images of photobleached embryos were acquired immediately before and continuously after photobleaching using the image acquisition settings and laser output power described in the Quantitative live-cell fluorescence microscopy section.

For each embryo, we collected five sequential measurements (10 s each) from anterior and posterior positions selected using an image captured immediately before measurement and positioned with the scanning mirrors. We chose positions in the cytoplasm away from the pronuclei and the cell cortex. The confocal volume was calibrated using freely diffusing rhodamine green succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen) and the data were collected and analyzed with the LSM 510/Confocor 4.2 software. Our system parameters were determined to be V = 0.2 femtoliters, S = 6.113, and &#x003c9;<sub>xy</sub> = 0.17335591.</p><p>The autocorrelation data presented was fit using models of multiple freely diffusible components with Confocor 4.2 software for time lags between 7.2 &#x000b5;s and 104.8 ms. Because P granules exhibit both irregular size and shape, autocorrelation was ignored at longer time lags to reduce the heterogeneity expected for this slow diffusing species. The first scan of each set of five scans was omitted from the analysis because of bleaching of immobile elements evident in the photon counts.</p><p>For the anterior measurements, a two-component model was determined to be most appropriate as it fit significantly better than the one component (Fig. S3) and was the simplest model to accurately represent the data. For the posterior, a three-component fit was selected to account for the two components known to occupy the anterior cytoplasm as well as P granules. Adding an anomalous diffusion component to the model did not improve the fitting of the data. To further investigate the effects of the large diffusing particles, and possible autofluoresence, two- and three-component models were fit to the data over a restricted range of lags (7.2 &#x000b5;s and 12.3 ms).
