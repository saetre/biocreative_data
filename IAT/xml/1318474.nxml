The activity of natural killer (NK) cells, which are important effectors of innate immunity and regulators of adaptive immunity, is controlled primarily by receptors that are at the cell surface. Here we show that cytokine secretion by resting human NK cells is induced by soluble, but not solid-phase, antibodies to the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 2DL4, a receptor for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G. KIR2DL4 was constitutively internalized into Rab5-positive compartments via a dynamin-dependent process. Soluble HLA-G was endocytosed into KIR2DL4&#x02013;containing compartments in NK cells and in 293T cells transfected with KIR2DL4. Chemokine secretion induced by KIR2DL4 transfection into 293T cells occurred only with recombinant forms of KIR2DL4 that trafficked to endosomes. The profile of genes up-regulated by KIR2DL4 engagement on resting NK cells revealed a proinflammatory/proangiogenic response. Soluble HLA-G induced secretion of a similar set of cytokines and chemokines. This unique stimulation of resting NK cells by soluble HLA-G, which is endocytosed by KIR2DL4, implies that NK cells may provide useful functions at sites of HLA-G expression, such as promotion of vascularization in maternal decidua during early pregnancy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>KIR2DL4, a human killer cell immunoglobulin receptor expressed on natural killer cells, can be stimulated by soluble antibody or the soluble version of its natural ligand (HLA-G), and may signal from within endosomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are a subset of lymphocytes that mediate innate immunity and regulate adaptive immunity via cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity.

Activation of NK cells with interleukin (IL)-2 and feeder cells resulted in a transient increase in the level of cell surface KIR2DL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The increase usually peaked between 7 and 14 days, and by 3 weeks in culture, receptor levels were no longer detectable. However, despite low surface levels of KIR2DL4 on resting NK cells, secretion of IFN-&#x003b3; was observed upon engagement by anti-KIR2DL4 mAbs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Three different mAbs (IgG1 33 and IgM 36 and 64) in solution, and even purified Fab of mAb 33, could enhance IFN-&#x003b3; secretion in the absence of cross-linking with secondary antibodies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and unpublished data). In contrast, plate-coated or bead-bound mAb 33 did not enhance IFN-&#x003b3; secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The lack of stimulation by cross-linked antibodies was not due to induction of cell death, as determined with annexin-V&#x02013;FITC and propidium iodide to detect apoptotic and necrotic cells (unpublished data). Activation by soluble antibodies to KIR2DL4 was in direct contrast to the response to other NK cell receptors such as CD16 or 2B4 (CD244), for which soluble antibodies were not sufficient to trigger a response, and cross-linking by plate-coating or by binding to beads was required to obtain comparable IFN-&#x003b3; release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Dynamin-Dependent Endocytosis of KIR2DL4</title><p>Activation by soluble antibodies to KIR2DL4, despite negligible receptor expression at the cell surface, could be explained if KIR2DL4 were actively endocytosed into resting NK cells. To examine the subcellular distribution of KIR2DL4, both resting and activated NK cells were fixed, permeabilized, stained with KIR2DL4-specific mAb 33, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Most of the receptor resides in vesicular structures, in contrast to other KIR receptors such as KIR2DL1, which is detectable at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). To test if active endocytosis was a mechanism for delivery of KIR2DL4 into intracellular compartments, resting NK cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated mAb 33 at 37 &#x000b0;C for different times prior to analysis by confocal microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, at 30 min, some of the KIR2DL4 had begun to internalize, and by 120 min, extensive endocytosis of KIR2DL4 was detected by the presence of the 33-Cy3 mAb in intracellular vesicles. The staining of internalized KIR2DL4 at 120 min was very similar to that detected by intracellular staining for total KIR2DL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Endocytosis was also seen with the Fab portion of the KIR2DL4-specific mAb 33, ruling out Fc receptor&#x02013;mediated internalization of mAb 33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>An intracellular, vesicular pattern of KIR2DL4 distribution was also observed after stable transfection of gfp-tagged KIR2DL4 in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, center). In addition, good co-localization of anti-2DL4 mAb 33 and gfp-tagged KIR2DL4 was observed, validating the specificity of the staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Uptake of mAb 33 was also detected in 293T-2DL4-gfp cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Endocytosis of KIR2DL4 was not induced by mAb-mediated cross-linking, because the purified Fab portion of mAb 33 was also endocytosed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). In both instances, mAb was internalized to the same compartments where endogenous KIR2DL4-gfp was localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). These data show that KIR2DL4 can also be endocytosed in non-NK cells.</p><p>Next, we tested whether endocytosis of KIR2DL4 was dependent on the GTPase dynamin, a central player in clathrin-mediated endocytosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. The endocytosis assay was performed in transfected 293T cells expressing HA-tagged KIR2DL4 and either wild-type gfp-tagged dynamin or a dominant-negative mutant (K44A) of gfp-tagged dynamin, which competes for dynamin function due to a defect in GTP binding and hydrolysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-KIR2DL4 mAb 33 for 2 h and processed for confocal imaging. Cells expressing dynamin were identified by fluorescence of gfp. Whereas endocytosed KIR2DL4 could be seen in vesicular structures in the presence of wild-type dynamin, dynamin K44A hindered the transport of KIR2DL4 into vesicles and caused a striking redistribution of the receptor at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>To visualize endocytic compartments containing KIR2DL4 at higher resolution, the NK cell line NKL and the NK cell line YTS stably transfected with KIR2DL4-gfp (YTS-2DL4-gfp) were loaded with mAb 33 for 120 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. Cells were fixed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies, and reacted with 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine substrate. Electron micrographs revealed HRP reaction product mainly in vesicles that ranged between 250 and 500 nm in size in both NKL and YTS-2DL4-gfp cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The majority of HRP-reactive vesicles contained a rim of HRP reaction product and an electron-lucent central region characteristic of early endosomes. Some of the vesicles also had more electron-dense content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). There was negligible vesicular staining of cells not loaded with mAb 33 (unpublished data). Staining of a few tubular structures and multivesicular bodies was also observed, consistent with localization in a subset of recycling endosomes and lysosomes, respectively (unpublished data). Thus, electron microscopy confirmed the vesicular localization of endocytosed KIR2DL4.</p><p>Confocal microscopy was performed with YTS-2DL4-gfp cells to test how KIR2DL4-containing vesicles relate to perforin-containing cytotoxic granules. Anti-perforin antibodies decorated vesicles in YTS-2DL4-gfp cells that were distinct from KIR2DL4-containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). The lack of overlap was confirmed by Z-stack/three-dimensional reconstruction studies (unpublished data). Resting NK cells co-stained with mAb 33 and anti-perforin antibodies also revealed no overlap of KIR2DL4 with perforin (unpublished data). Lack of overlap was also seen with antibodies to granzyme A (unpublished data). The chemokine RANTES resides in specialized storage vesicles in T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Confocal experiments revealed that RANTES was also in vesicular compartments in NK cells but that those compartments were distinct from vesicular compartments containing KIR2DL4 (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>KIR2DL4 Resides in Rab5<sup>+</sup> Early Endosomes</title><p>Co-localization of KIR2DL4 with a number of markers for endocytic and lysosomal compartments was tested in resting NK cells and in 293T-2DL4-gfp cells. Rab5 and its effector EEA-1 are markers for early endosomes; mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) is a marker for late endosomes; and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) is a marker for lysosomes. Resting NK cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-KIR2DL4 mAb 33 and with Alexa-488&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by staining with antibodies against Rab5, EEA-1, or M6PR and with Alexa-568&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g005">Figure 5</xref> and unpublished data). The 293T-2DL4-gfp cells were stained for the same endocytic markers and KIR2DL4 was visualized by gfp fluorescence. In both resting NK cells and 293T-2DL4-gfp cells, significant overlap of staining was obtained only in the case of Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Even though Rab5 and EEA-1 identify early endosomes, the overlap of staining of KIR2DL4 with EEA-1 was more limited. This was confirmed by three-color confocal analysis to detect KIR2DL4, Rab5, and EEA-1 in the same cells (unpublished data). Likewise, there was limited overlap of KIR2DL4 staining with M6PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and LAMP-1 (unpublished data).</p><p>Members of the Rab GTPase family, such as Rab4, Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11, occupy distinct yet overlapping membrane domains on early and recycling endosomes and serve as determinants of organelle identity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Rab5 is a key regulator of transport to early endosomes; Rab4 and Rab11 are implicated in recycling, from endosomes back to the plasma membrane; and Rab7 has a role in the late endocytic pathway and in lysosome biogenesis. To show unequivocally that KIR2DL4 co-localizes with Rab5 and to address the specificity of this co-localization, gfp-tagged versions Rab4, Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11 were co-expressed with HA-tagged KIR2DL4 in 293T cells. The cells were stained with anti-HA antibodies followed by Alexa-568&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibodies, and confocal images were obtained. As seen previously with endogenous Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g005">Figure 5</xref>), all KIR2DL4-containing vesicles corresponded to Rab5-positive compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, overlap with compartments containing other Rab proteins was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

In contrast, the enhanced binding of KIR2DL4-Ig to transfected 721.221 cells expressing membrane-bound HLA-G (221-G) was blocked by mAb DX17, a pan&#x02013;class I antibody known to block KIR&#x02013;HLA class I interactions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, by the HLA-G&#x02013;specific mAb G233, and by the KIR2DL4-specific mAb 33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

Staining of 721.221 cells expressing HLA-Cw3 with F4/326 is also included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g008">Figure 8</xref>A) to show that the mAb can detect HLA-Cw3 in fixed and permeabilized samples. Resting NK cells were loaded with either refolded HLA-G or refolded HLA-Cw3 for 2 h. Internalized soluble HLA-G, but not HLA-Cw3, was detected in intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). It was difficult to show unambiguous co-localization of KIR2DL4 and HLA-G in resting NK cells, possibly because HLA-G bound to KIR2DL4 interfered with the staining of KIR2DL4 by mAb 33. Therefore, co-localization experiments were done with the NK cell line YTS that was stably transfected with gfp-tagged KIR2DL4. Endocytosed HLA-G was detected in intracellular vesicles that contained gfp-tagged KIR2DL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Extensive co-localization of refolded HLA-G and KIR2DL4-gfp was also seen after incubation for 2 h with 293T-2DL4-gfp cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g008">Figure 8</xref>C).

After 48 h of co-culture, cells were gently washed and the adherent 293T-2DL4-gfp cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the HLA-G&#x02013;specific mAb G233. No internalization of HLA-G occurred after co-culture with 221 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). In contrast, co-culture with either 221-G or 221-sG resulted in internalization of HLA-G in KIR2DL4-containing vesicles. Note the vesicular staining of endocytosed HLA-G in 293T-2DL4-gfp cells in contrast to the cell surface staining of HLA-G on the 221-G cells included for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g008">Figure 8</xref>A, middle row, left panel). No HLA-G was detected in untransfected 293T cells co-cultured with 221-G and 221-sG cells (unpublished data). Therefore, soluble HLA-G produced by shedding from the cell surface or by secretion of an alternatively spliced form is internalized by KIR2DL4 into endosomes.</p><p>To further quantify the interaction of KIR2DL4 with soluble HLA-G, a recombinant, single-chain HLA-G (sHLA-G) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was used. This single-chain HLA-G contains an HLA-G&#x02013;binding peptide (RLPKDFVDL), the extracellular domains (&#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3) of HLA-G, and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin all connected via linkers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. 293T-2DL4-gfp cells were incubated for 2 h with sHLA-G at 37 &#x000b0;C. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with mAb G233. Vesicular staining of sHLA-G, which co-localized with gfp-tagged KIR2DL4, was visible, similar to that seen after incubation with soluble anti-2DL4 mAb 33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g009">Figure 9</xref>A). The fluorescence intensity of endocytosed sHLA-G was quantified and compared to that of KIR2DL4-gfp in 293T cells. The expectation was that sHLA-G uptake should increase with higher expression levels of KIR2DL4-gfp. Red fluorescence in vesicles was compared to the green fluorescence of KIR2DL4-gfp in 38 individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g009">Figure 9</xref>B).

Internalization of sHLA-G was blocked in the presence of mAb 33, whereas mAb 33 was still internalized in the presence of sHLA-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g009">Figure 9</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g009">9</xref>C). Similar results were obtained in YTS-2DL4-gfp cells (unpublished data). To test whether sHLA-G interacts directly with KIR2DL4, sHLA-G was loaded in the presence of soluble KIR2DL4-Ig fusion protein. Soluble KIR2DL1-Ig fusion protein with specificity for a subset of HLA-C alleles was used as a control. Soluble KIR2DL4-Ig prevented the uptake of sHLA-G into 293T-2DL4-gfp cells, whereas soluble KIR2DL1-Ig had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g009">Figure 9</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g009">9</xref>C).

To get further information on the transcriptional response activated by this receptor, exploratory DNA microarray experiments were performed. Freshly isolated resting NK cells were stimulated either with control, isotype-matched, soluble antibodies or with KIR2DL4&#x02013;specific soluble IgM mAbs for 5 h. Among the approximately 14,000 genes examined, all the genes that were up-regulated greater than 2-fold in resting NK cells from at least two of three independent donors are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g010">Figure 10</xref>A. Interestingly, only a small subset of genes showed up-regulation. They include an array of proinflammatory/proangiogenic cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-23 (comprised of the IL-23&#x003b1; and IL-12&#x003b2; subunits), and chemokines, such as IL-8, MIP-3&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b4;, MIP-1&#x003b1;, and MIP-2&#x003b2;.</p><p>The KIR2DL4-induced expression of the majority of these genes was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated at different timepoints after stimulation of resting NK cells by either control or anti-KIR2DL4 mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g010">Figure 10</xref>B). Such a time course analysis highlighted differences in the kinetics of responses. Transcription of the GRO3 and COX-2 genes was up-regulated transiently, whereas all of the other genes examined showed sustained expression up to the 16 h timepoint. Responses detectable within the first two hours included TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8, MIP-3&#x003b1;, and GRO-3. In contrast, transcription of IL-6, IL-12&#x003b2;(p40), IL-23&#x003b1;(p19), COX-2, and MARCKS increased only after 2 h. Previous work &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g001">Figure 1</xref>B show that stimulation by KIR2DL4 induces IFN-&#x003b3; production. However, <italic>IFNG</italic> gene transcription was up-regulated only approximately 1.5-fold in the microarray studies and therefore did not score as positive. RT-PCR analysis reconciled this apparent discrepancy, as induction of <italic>IFNG</italic> transcription occurred only 8 h after stimulation. The time course of IFN-&#x003b3; protein secretion supported the transcriptional data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g010">Figure 10</xref>C). There is delayed secretion of IFN-&#x003b3; compared to other cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;. <italic>IFNG</italic> gene transcription is a late response, which requires de novo protein synthesis, as it was inhibited by cycloheximide (Y. T. Bryceson, unpublished observation). Thus, exploratory microarray analysis using anti-KIR2DL4 mAbs to stimulate resting NK cells revealed the up-regulation of a select number of proinflammatory/proangiogenic cytokine and chemokine genes. However, it is possible that stimulation of KIR2DL4 by a natural ligand, such as soluble HLA-G, induces a different response.</p><p>To test whether a natural ligand of KIR2DL4 could confirm the observed transcriptional responses induced by anti-KIR2DL4 mAbs, protein expression was tested after incubation of resting NK cells with soluble HLA-G. Resting NK cells were incubated with sHLA-G produced in mammalian cells and tested for secretion of a number of cytokines and chemokines. As specificity control for activation by soluble HLA-G, mAb G233, which blocks the interaction between HLA-G and KIR2DL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g007">Figure 7</xref>), was used. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g011">Figure 11</xref>, soluble KIR2DL4-specific mAb and sHLA-G activated the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, for which transcriptional activation had been observed in DNA microarrays. Responses induced by sHLA-G were inhibited by anti&#x02013;HLA-G mAb G233 but not by an isotype-matched control IgG. Among the three donors tested, quantitative variation in protein secretion was observed. To take such variability into account, the amount of cytokine/chemokine induced by sHLA-G was compared to that induced by anti-KIR2DL4 mAb for each donor separately. For six of eight cytokines/chemokines tested, sHLA-G induced at least 50&#x00025; of the amount induced by anti-KIR2DL4 mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g011">Figure 11</xref>). To further evaluate the specificity of responses, secretion of IL-5, IL-12 (which shares the IL-12&#x003b2; p40 subunit with IL-23), and IL-13 was also determined. NK cells can produce IL-5 and IL-13 under certain conditions but have not been reported to produce IL-12. No secretion of any of these three cytokines was induced by anti-KIR2DL4 and by sHLA-G (unpublished data). Therefore, soluble HLA-G activates a qualitatively and quantitatively similar cytokine/chemokine response as KIR2DL4-specific mAb.</p><p>To test whether the KIR2DL4-induced response was unique, responses elicited by CD16 cross-linking were evaluated in parallel. Anti-CD16 mAb attached to beads induced secretion of only a subset of the cytokines/chemokines induced by KIR2DL4 engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g011">Figure 11</xref>). Very little or no secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-23 was induced by CD16 cross-linking. Therefore, activation of KIR2DL4 by soluble ligand induces secretion of a unique profile of proinflammatory/proangiogenic mediators, which may be relevant to functional interaction between KIR2DL4 on uterine NK cells and HLA-G produced by trophoblast cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>KIR2DL4 Induces IL-8 Secretion in 293T Cells</title><p>The 293T cells are capable of producing IL-8, as TLR-4 agonists induced IL-8 secretion in TLR-4&#x02013;transfected 293T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. As KIR2DL4 engagement in resting NK cells resulted in secretion of IL-8, the ability of KIR2DL4 to induce IL-8 secretion in 293T cells was tested. Transfected 293T cells expressing receptors 2B4 and gp49B were used for comparison. Expression of KIR2DL4, but not 2B4 or gp49B, in 293T cells induced IL-8 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g012">Figure 12</xref>A). As 293T cells did not stain with anti-HLA-G mAb G233 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g008">Figure 8</xref>D and unpublished data), IL-8 secretion may be induced by KIR2DL4 expression alone, independent of ligand binding. IL-8 expression in KIR2DL4-transfected 293T cells was used as a convenient assay to test mutants of KIR2DL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g012">Figure 12</xref>B) for their ability to signal in 293T cells. A KIR2DL4 molecule lacking the arginine residue in the transmembrane region &#x0005b;2DL4(RY-GT)&#x0005d; was tested. This arginine may contribute to KIR2DL4 pairing with the FcRI &#x003b3; chain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, similar to other activating receptors that carry a charge in the transmembrane region. Second, a truncated KIR2DL4 (2DL4-TR), lacking its cytoplasmic tail, was tested. Confocal microscopy showed that both of these mutants were targeted to endocytic vesicles in 293T cells, similar to wild-type KIR2DL4 (unpublished data), showing that the cytoplasmic tail of KIR2DL4 is not required for endosomal targeting. Secretion of IL-8 was obtained with the 2DL4(RY-GT) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g012">Figure 12</xref>C), showing that the charged amino acid in the transmembrane region is not required for signaling. In contrast, the 2DL4-TR mutant did not signal for IL-8 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g012">Figure 12</xref>C), despite its localization in endosomes, pointing to a role for the transmembrane region and/or cytoplasmic tail in signaling. These results suggested that the natural <italic>9A</italic> allele of KIR2DL4, which encodes a receptor with a truncated cytoplasmic tail, would not signal for IL-8 secretion. A frameshift mutation was introduced in wild-type KIR2DL4 cDNA in order to produce a molecule identical to the KIR2DL4 9A allotype: consistent with the truncated mutant, expression of the 9A mutant in 293T cells did not induce IL-8 secretion (unpublished data).</p><p>Another mutant was informative with respect to the signaling function of KIR2DL4. A chimeric, HA-tagged receptor containing the extracellular regions of gp49B fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of KIR2DL4 was expressed at the surface of 293T cells and did not traffic to endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g012">Figure 12</xref>B), indicating that the luminal domain of KIR2DL4 is required for proper targeting. No IL-8 secretion was induced by this chimeric gp49B/2DL4, even after stimulation for 12 h with beads coated with anti-HA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040009-g012">Figure 12</xref>D). Cross-linking HA-tagged 2B4 with the same beads on 2B4-transfected 293T cells resulted in a very modest increase in IL-8 secretion. These results suggest that endosomal localization of KIR2DL4 is required for its signaling function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The NK cell receptor KIR2DL4 emerges as an activation receptor specific for soluble HLA-G. Constitutive endocytosis of KIR2DL4 occurs in freshly isolated, resting NK cells, in IL-2&#x02013;activated NK cells, in NK cell lines, and in 293T cells transfected with KIR2DL4. At steady state, most of KIR2DL4 is intracellular, which explains the difficulty in detecting cell surface receptor by flow cytometry. Endocytosis explains also the unusual property of KIR2DL4 to induce cytokine and chemokine secretion in response to soluble mAbs and to soluble HLA-G, in the absence of further cross-linking, but not in response to solid-phase mAbs (either plate-coated or bead-bound). Therefore, lack of detectable KIR2DL4 at the cell surface should not be taken as evidence for a lack of function. Endocytosed KIR2DL4 showed extensive co-localization with Rab5, a GTPase that marks a subset of early endosomes.</p><p>Endosomes have emerged recently as a specialized signaling compartment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Some endocytosed receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and Toll-like receptor 9, signal from endosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b045">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. It is thought that endocytic vesicles carry signaling platforms where endocytosed receptors link with downstream signaling molecules and provide sustained signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data strongly support signal transduction by KIR2DL4 in endosomes. First, KIR2DL4 is actively internalized into endosomes, where most of KIR2DL4 resides at steady state. Second, solid-phase Abs to KIR2DL4 did not induce IFN-&#x003b3; secretion, indicating that cross-linking KIR2DL4 at the cell surface does not result in signaling. Third, expression of KIR2DL4 and of KIR2DL4 mutants in 293T cells resulted in secretion of IL-8 only for those receptors that were targeted to endosomes. A chimeric receptor with the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail of KIR2DL4 that remained at the cell surface did not activate IL-8 secretion, even after cross-linking at the cell surface. Extensive co-localization of endocytosed KIR2DL4 with a subset of early endosomes that carry the small GTPase Rab5 is interesting, as Rab5 was recently assigned a role in endosomal signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor and by Toll-like receptor 9 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. The signaling pathway triggered by KIR2DL4 requires further study. Ligand-bound KIR2DL4 must somehow be distinguished from free, endogenous KIR2DL4 in NK cells, as resting NK cells do not respond to KIR2DL4 until soluble ligand is added. This distinction may not be made in transfected 293T cells, which appear to respond to KIR2DL4 in the absence of a ligand. Thus, KIR2DL4 signaling is subject to tight regulation in NK cells.</p><p>Signaling by KIR2DL4 in 293T cells also implies that immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing subunits, such as the FcRI &#x003b3; chain, are unlikely to be necessary. This conclusion is further supported by the lack of requirement for the arginine residue in the transmembrane region of KIR2DL4 for signaling in 293T cells. Unlike other NK cell activation receptors with charged residues in the transmembrane region, such as NKG2D and NKp46, which require a partner chain for transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum, KIR2DL4 is readily transported to the cell surface and to endosomes, even in the absence of a known adapter. The position of the arginine at the fourth amino acid position from the N-terminus of the transmembrane region, rather than deeper into the lipid bilayer, suggests that membrane insertion may not be compromised &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. However, induction of cytotoxicity by IL-2&#x02013;activated NK cells through KIR2DL4 in a redirected lysis assay had been dependent on the arginine-tyrosine motif in the transmembrane region of KIR2DL4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. It is therefore likely that KIR2DL4 can signal in different ways, for cytokine secretion independent of an arginine-mediated association (this study), and for cytotoxicity through an arginine-mediated association with the FcRI &#x003b3; chain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. The biological context in which KIR2DL4-mediated cytotoxicity would occur is not clear. On the other hand, stimulation of a proinflammatory or proangiogenic response by soluble HLA-G could be a useful property in various physiological contexts. In particular, our study supports a new model for the role of NK cells in early pregnancy.</p><p>A ligand of KIR2DL4 is the nonclassical MHC class I molecule HLA-G, which is produced naturally in soluble form by alternative splicing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d; and by proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound HLA-G &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.

In this study, four different soluble forms of HLA-G have been internalized into KIR2DL4-containing endosomes. HLA-G shed from the cell membrane and the naturally secreted form of HLA-G, each produced in transfected 721.221 cells, were endocytosed into KIR2DL4-containing compartments of co-cultured cells. In addition, recombinant HLA-G, produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> and refolded with &#x003b2;2-microglobulin and peptide, was also internalized, as was an sHLA-G produced in transfected CHO cells. Competition for HLA-G uptake with a soluble, recombinant KIR2DL4-Ig fusion protein established, for the first time, a direct interaction between KIR2DL4 and HLA-G. So far, evidence for KIR2DL4 binding to HLA-G had been indirect. Binding of soluble KIR2DL4-Ig fusion proteins to cells expressing high levels of HLA-G &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; had been detected, but binding of soluble HLA-G tetramers to NK cells or soluble HLA-G to KIR2DL4 in surface plasmon resonance studies had not been detected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. The detection of KIR2DL4&#x02013;HLA-G interaction may have been possible here due to accumulation of soluble HLA-G into KIR2DL4-containing endosomes.</p><p>In pregnancy, tolerance of the semiallogeneic fetus by the maternal immune system has long presented an immunological paradox &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. To avoid rejection of the fetus, several factors must regulate maternal responsiveness to fetal alloantigens. Regulatory mechanisms may include inhibitory receptors on lymphocytes that bind ligands on fetal cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d; and suppression of T lymphocytes by tryptophan catabolism via indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. An alternate and nonexclusive view is that interactions of fetal cells with immune cells at the maternal&#x02013;fetal interface play a role in proper implantation by shaping vascular adaptations of the surrounding maternal tissue via cytokine secretion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Uterine tissue in early human pregnancy is characterized by extensive vascular remodeling, by invasion of HLA-G&#x02013;expressing trophoblast cells, and by an abundance of maternal NK cells. Engagement of KIR2DL4 by soluble ligand induced a profile of gene transcription and protein secretion that is consistent with a proangiogenic response. The controversial role of HLA-G expression on extravillous cytotrophoblast cells&#x02014;be it for inhibition or activation of maternal NK cells&#x02014;may be settled in favor of activation of NK cells through soluble HLA-G for the purpose of vascular remodeling. Successful implantation and placentation require vascular endothelial growth factor, an angiogenic growth factor that is secreted by trophoblast cells throughout gestation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;. The products of several genes up-regulated on NK cells by KIR2DL4 engagement, including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IFN-&#x003b3;, induce vascular endothelial growth factor production in trophoblast cells, thereby influencing uterine angiogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;.

In summary, the spectrum of proangiogenic mediators that are induced in resting NK cells by soluble HLA-G and by anti-KIR2DL4 mAb supports a role for KIR2DL4 in facilitating implantation and neovascularization during pregnancy. Our data, together with evidence that secretion of soluble HLA-G by in vitro fertilized human embryos is associated with a higher pregnancy rate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d; and that reduced levels of soluble HLA-G during early pregnancy correlate with a higher incidence of preeclampsia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;, suggest that KIR2DL4 has a positive role in reproductive success.</p><p>The description of soluble HLA-G expression in other cell types and tissues, such as erythroblasts during erythropoiesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040009-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;, suggests the interesting possibility that a KIR2DL4-mediated signal in NK cells could serve a proinflammatory or proangiogenic function in other contexts as well. In this study, we show that constitutive internalization of KIR2DL4 results in uptake of soluble HLA-G and accumulation into endocytic compartments where the bulk of KIR2DL4 resides. Binding of soluble agonist by KIR2DL4 has the potential advantage of promoting specific NK cell responses without the complicating contribution of multiple receptor&#x02013;ligand interactions that occur during cell&#x02013;cell contacts, which engage a wide array of activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>The 293T cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, United States); YTS cells expressing an ecotropic receptor were a gift from G.
