Normal platelet activation is dependent on tetraspanins, a superfamily of glycoproteins that function as &#x02018;organisers&#x02019; of cell membranes by recruiting other receptors and signalling proteins into tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. However, our understanding of how tetraspanin microdomains regulate platelets is hindered by the fact that only four of the 33 mammalian tetraspanins have been identified in platelets. This is because of a lack of antibodies to most tetraspanins and difficulties in measuring mRNA, due to low levels in this anucleate cell. To identify potentially platelet-expressed tetraspanins, mRNA was measured in their nucleated progenitor cell, the megakaryocyte, using serial analysis of gene expression and DNA microarrays. Amongst 19 tetraspanins identified in megakaryocytes, Tspan9, a previously uncharacterized tetraspanin, was relatively specific to these cells. Through generating the first Tspan9 antibodies, Tspan9 expression was found to be tightly regulated in platelets. The relative levels of CD9, CD151, Tspan9 and CD63 were 100, 14, 6 and 2 respectively. Since CD9 was expressed at 49000 cell surface copies per platelet, this suggested a copy number of 2800 Tspan9 molecules. Finally, Tspan9 was shown to be a component of tetraspanin microdomains that included the collagen receptor GPVI (glycoprotein VI) and integrin &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1, but not the von Willebrand receptor GPIb&#x003b1; or the integrins &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 or &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1. These findings suggest a role for Tspan9 in regulating platelet function in concert with other platelet tetraspanins and their associated proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>glycoprotein VI (GPVI)</kwd><kwd>megakaryocyte</kwd><kwd>membrane microdomain</kwd><kwd>platelet</kwd><kwd>tetraspanin</kwd><kwd>Tspan9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>DIC, differential interference contrast</kwd><kwd>ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence</kwd><kwd>GP, glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>HEK-293T cells, HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells expressing the large T-antigen of SV40 (simian virus 40)</kwd><kwd>PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F</kwd><kwd>RT&#x02013;PCR, reverse transcription&#x02013;PCR</kwd><kwd>SAGE, serial analysis of gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Platelets play an essential role in preventing excessive blood loss at sites of vascular injury by plugging holes in damaged blood vessels and promoting the clotting cascade. Platelets are also important in inflammation through recruitment of leukocytes, and in blood vessel repair through the release of growth factors. However, platelets also play a deleterious role in causing heart attack and stroke when activated in diseased vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Critical to these events are a variety of well-characterized surface receptor proteins which combine to induce powerful platelet activation when they encounter exposed sub-endothelial matrix proteins in the damaged vessel wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is becoming increasingly clear that such cell surface proteins and their associated signalling proteins are not randomly distributed in the plasma membrane, but are instead compartmentalized into membrane microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The tetraspanins are a large family of four-transmembrane glycoproteins that are thought to function as &#x02018;molecular organizers&#x02019; by forming a type of membrane microdomain that is distinct from lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This is achieved through tetraspanin&#x02013;tetraspanin associations and specific tetraspanin interactions with so-called partner proteins, which include integrins, immunoglobulin superfamily proteins and G-protein-coupled receptors. Such a fundamental organizing role is consistent with tetraspanin expression throughout the fungi, plant and animal kingdoms and their essential roles in processes such as cell adhesion, motility and signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>An essential role for tetraspanins in platelets was demonstrated by mild bleeding phenotypes in mice deficient for either of the tetraspanins CD151 or Tspan32 (previously named TSSC6 or PHEMX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These similar phenotypes appear to be due to impaired signalling by the major platelet integrin &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, but their weak nature suggests functional redundancy between tetraspanins. However, only two other tetraspanins, CD9 and CD63, have been identified on platelets using antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Identification of other platelet tetraspanins is impaired by a lack of antibodies to most of the 33 mammalian tetraspanins. Additionally, the anucleate platelet has minimal mRNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which makes RT&#x02013;PCR (reverse transcription&#x02013;PCR) challenging due to the issue of contamination with mRNA from other blood cells.</p><p>The present study aimed to identify a novel platelet tetraspanin through genomic analyses of megakaryocytes, the platelet progenitors, and subsequent antibody generation to confirm expression on platelets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Genomics</title><p>The SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) library from primary mouse megakaryocytes was generated using the I-SAGE Long Kit (Invitrogen) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Specific FLAG-tetraspanin reference samples and human platelet lysates, lysed as for the HEK-293T cells, were then Western blotted under non-reducing conditions using tetraspanin-specific antibodies (C9-BB for CD9, 6H1 for CD63, 11B1 for CD151 and rabbit anti-Tspan9), and the bands were quantified using the GeneGnome.

This is primarily due to a lack of antibodies and to the technical difficulties in performing genomics in the platelet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. To identify tetraspanins that are potentially expressed in platelets, we examined mRNA expression in their nucleated precursor cell, the megakaryocyte, through re-analysis of our previously reported SAGE library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. SAGE provides a quantitative measure of relative mRNA levels by essentially converting each mRNA into a short piece of DNA, termed a SAGE tag, which can be ligated with other tags and readily sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. SAGE identified 16 tetraspanins in primary mouse megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The expression of each was confirmed by RT&#x02013;PCR, which also identified an additional three tetraspanins (CD82, Tspan5 and Tspan18) that fell below the threshold of detection in our SAGE library (results not shown). The most abundant tetraspanin was CD63, followed by CD9 and CD151, each of which is known to be expressed in platelets. The other platelet tetraspanin, Tspan32, was also relatively highly expressed in megakaryocytes. Of the other 15 tetraspanins identified, most have not been reported as megakaryocyte-expressed and remain unstudied at the protein level.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Tetraspanin expression in primary mouse megakaryocytes</title><p>A LongSAGE library was generated from mouse megakaryocytes grown <italic>in vitro</italic> from bone marrow precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

We have previously performed such comparisons to show that the most megakaryocyte-specific genes tend to be important for platelet function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Similar analyses of tetraspanins, however, revealed that none were specific to megakaryocytes (results not shown), although the fact that nine of the tetraspanins had only five tags or less made it difficult to determine statistically whether any of these were over-represented in megakaryocytes compared with other cell types. To address this issue, we used our blood cell expression atlas data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] to compare tetraspanin mRNA expression in megakaryocytes with seven other haematopoietic cell types. The Illumina HumanWG-6 v2 Expression BeadChips, used in this study, is a recently developed bead-based DNA microarray that largely overcomes the problems of intra- and inter-array reproducibility associated with earlier microarray types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, the tetraspanins that were more highly expressed in megakaryocytes than other cell types were the known platelet tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD151 and Tspan32, as well as Tspan4 and Tspan9 (Supplementary Figure 1, at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170391add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170391add.htm</ext-link>). The most megakaryocyte-specific of these was Tspan9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), a functionally unstudied tetraspanin that was originally named NET-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and which we and others had identified as a candidate platelet tetraspanin using proteomic analyses of the human platelet surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and DNA microarray analyses of human megakaryocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Moreover, Tspan9 is remarkably highly conserved during evolution, with amino acid identities of 97% for human compared with mouse and 91% for human compared with frog, suggesting that this tetraspanin may be functionally important in megakaryocyte and platelet biology.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Tspan9 is relatively specific to human megakaryocytes when compared with other haematopoietic cell types</title><p>Whole genome expression data was obtained for eight different human blood cells using Illumina HumanWG-6 v2 Expression BeadChips.

The antisera were peptide-purified and their efficacy confirmed by Western blotting lysates of HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with mouse Tspan9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The multiple bands detected in the Western blot of transfected Tspan9 are likely to represent immature glycoforms that may be relatively abundant in an over-expression system. Indeed, Tspan9 has a single predicted N-linked glycosylation site, and treatment of Tspan9 immunoprecipitates with an N-glycosidase reduced the banding pattern to a single species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Moreover, N-glycosidase treatment of Tspan9 immunoprecipitates from human platelet lysates confirmed that Tspan9 is a glycoprotein that is expressed in this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Confocal microscopy analysis of Tspan9-transfected cells, in which not all of the cells were positive due to the transient nature of the transfection, suggested a predominantly plasma membrane localization for Tspan9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Generation of a new antibody identifies the Tspan9 glycoprotein as a novel megakaryocyte/platelet tetraspanin</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (&#x02212;) or FLAG-tagged mouse Tspan9 (+) and whole cell lysates were Western blotted with the peptide-purified rabbit anti-Tspan9 antibody.

Tspan9 was similarly detected in mouse platelet lysates, as well as in lung, with relatively weak expression in brain, kidney, liver and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). Bone marrow, a major site for megakaryocytopoiesis, was positive upon longer exposure (results not shown), but its weak signal was probably due to the relatively low numbers of megakaryocytes in this tissue. Indeed, expression of Tspan9 protein in primary mouse megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F), and the proplatelet structures that they form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>G), was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, a technique that was used because of difficulties in obtaining enough mature megakaryocytes for Western blotting. Tspan9 staining throughout the megakaryocyte suggests localization to the demarcation membrane system, which is an extensive network of membrane channels that is connected to, and is thought to originate from, the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of tetraspanins in human platelets</title><p>Quantification of Tspan9 expression levels on platelets may provide clues as to potential binding partners, which may be expressed at similar levels. The human platelet cell surface is relatively well characterized with respect to copy numbers of the major glycoproteins, but amongst tetraspanins only CD9 has been quantified. Three different groups, using iodinated CD9 antibodies, reported 65000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], 46000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and 38000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] copies per platelet. To determine whether these discrepancies were due to donor variation, we quantified CD9 levels on the platelets of six donors, of diverse ethnic backgrounds, using a flow cytometry-based method that we have previously used to quantify other platelet glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. CD9 levels were similar between individuals, with a mean of 49000 copies per platelet, with a S.D. of 3560 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

The platelet lysates were made in a lysis buffer that included dodecylmaltoside to fully solubilize lipid rafts, although Tspan9 and other platelet tetraspanins appear to be largely excluded from lipid rafts (results not shown and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]). Using the same six donors as for the previous CD9 quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), we found Tspan9 to be expressed at 6% of the level of CD9, with similar expression between donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In comparison, CD151 was expressed at a 2.3-fold greater level than Tspan9, whereas CD63 was 3-fold lower than Tspan9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that the Tspan9 expression level, similar to that of other tetraspanins, is tightly regulated in human platelets, and can be estimated at approximately 2800 surface copies, with a S.D. of 600, assuming the same cell surface to intracellular localization ratio for CD9 and Tspan9.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Quantification of Tspan9, CD63 and CD151, relative to CD9, in human platelets</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with empty vector control, FLAG-tagged human CD9, CD63, CD151 or mouse Tspan9 (note that the Tspan9 antibody epitope is identical in protein sequence between human and mouse).

These findings suggest that the epitope for the Tspan9 antibody, which is 12 amino acids long, C-terminal and membrane-proximal, is less accessible to an immunoprecipitating antibody in the context of intact tetraspanin microdomains in Brij 97, perhaps due to steric hindrance by other tetraspanins or associated proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Tetraspanin microdomains on human platelets contain GPVI but not GPIb&#x003b1; or &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3</title><p>The identities of most of the tetraspanin-associated platelet proteins, observed in tetraspanin immunoprecipitations from Brij 97 lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, left panel), are not known, but their molecular weights suggest as candidates the major platelet glycoproteins GPIb&#x003b1; (the von Willebrand receptor), &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (the major platelet integrin) and GPVI (the main signalling receptor for collagen). However, GPIb&#x003b1; and &#x003b1;IIb were not detected in Western blots of tetraspanin immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, middle and lower panels), suggesting that these proteins are not tetraspanin-associated. A similar experiment proved difficult for GPVI because in Western blots this protein was obscured by the immunoglobulin heavy chain from the immunoprecipitating antibodies (results not shown). To overcome this problem, GPVI immunoprecipitates were analysed for tetraspanin-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C) and tetraspanins themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). GPVI immunoprecipitation from Brij 97 lysates of biotinylated platelets yielded a strikingly similar pattern of biotinylated proteins to CD151 immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). In Triton X-100, most of these interactions were lost, leaving a major 62&#x000a0;kDa band in GPVI immunoprecipitates and a major 27&#x000a0;kDa band in CD151 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C), corresponding to the molecular weights of GPVI and CD151, respectively. To confirm that GPVI was associated with tetraspanins in these immunoprecipitation experiments, specific CD9 and CD151 blots were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). In Brij 97 lysates, both tetraspanins were detected in GPVI immunoprecipitates, but not in those for control or &#x003b1;2 antibodies. These interactions were lost in Triton X-100 lysates.

Tspan9 protein expression was relatively specific to platelets when compared to other blood cell types. Moreover, biochemical analyses demonstrated that Tspan9 was a novel component of tetraspanin microdomains on the platelet surface.</p><p>This is the first characterization of the tetraspanin Tspan9 at the protein level through the generation of antibodies. Of the 33 tetraspanins in the human genome, antibodies have been reported for less than half. As such, we do not know the full complement of tetraspanins that are expressed in a given cell type and which other proteins are recruited to tetraspanin microdomains. The probable reasons for the lack of antibody reagents are firstly the relatively small size of tetraspanins and their association with larger proteins in tetraspanin microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This may render them virtually inaccessible to antibody recognition in the context of intact cells, which are the predominant immunogens used to date for the generation of tetraspanin monoclonal antibodies. Secondly, tetraspanin protein sequences are highly conserved during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], so the number of tetraspanin non-self epitopes is very low. However, we managed to overcome these problems by raising antibodies in rabbit and chicken to the intracellular C-terminal tail of human Tspan9. Although this approach was successful for Tspan9, it is not applicable to all tetraspanins, since some have cytoplasmic tails that are predicted to contain as few as four amino acids and are therefore too short to be used as immunogens. Moreover, we have failed to raise good antibodies to Tspan3, Tspan15, Tspan17, Tspan32 and Tspan33 using this method, although an antibody that recognized both Tspan13 and Tspan31 was successfully generated (M.B.P. and M.G.T., unpublished work).</p><p>In order to identify platelet tetraspanins in the absence of antibodies, we measured mRNA levels in megakaryocytes, the platelet progenitor cells, since platelets have extremely low levels of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. To do this, we took advantage of a mouse megakaryocyte SAGE library that we had generated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and more recent DNA microarray analyses of human megakaryocytes and seven other haematopoietic cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. SAGE, which detects essentially all expressed genes in a quantitative manner, identified the four platelet tetraspanins, CD63, CD9, CD151 and Tspan32, amongst the six most highly expressed mouse megakaryocyte tetraspanins. We identified an additional 15 tetraspanins, at generally lower expression levels, most of which have not been reported on megakaryocytes or platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but which nevertheless may have important roles in, for example, the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors that are expressed at relatively low levels. A total of 19 tetraspanins in megakaryocytes may be typical for other cell types. For example, a figure of 20 tetraspanins has been estimated for leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and we have found 22 for endothelial cells upon analyses of 11 publicly-available SAGE libraries (J.M.J.H., R.B. and M.G.T., unpublished data). Unlike SAGE, the microarray data is not a reliable indicator of relative tetraspanin expression in megakaryocytes, due to the potential for differential hybridization efficiencies for different genes. However, the microarrays do enable a comparison of the expression levels of individual tetraspanins between different cell types. Those tetraspanins that have been reported to be expressed in human platelets using antibodies (CD9, CD63, CD151 and Tspan32) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], or by mass spectrometry peptide sequencing (Tspan9, Tspan15 and Tspan33) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], were relatively highly represented in human megakaryocytes. In contrast, a number of tetraspanins were not detected by either SAGE or DNA microarray, for example the CD9-related Tspan2 and the CD151-related Tspan11, suggesting that they are not expressed by the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage and thus do not compensate for CD9 and CD151 when these genes are knocked out in platelets. Finally, CD37, CD81 and Tspan4 were identified at the mRNA level in megakaryocytes but are absent at the protein level from human platelets (results not shown). It is possible that these tetraspanins are also not expressed at the protein level in megakaryocytes. Alternatively they may be megakaryocyte-expressed but actively excluded from platelets during platelet formation.</p><p>Genomic approaches, such as SAGE and DNA microarrays, do not prove expression at the protein level. However, using our new antibodies to Tspan9, we confirmed its expression on megakaryocytes and platelets by immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting and immunoprecipitation from surface-biotinylated cells. Consistent with its relative mRNA specificity for megakaryocytes within the haematopoietic lineage, Tspan9 was not readily detected in human B- and T-cell lines, or mouse thymus, and only weakly in spleen. Tspan9 was only detected in primary megakaryocytes and proplatelets, and not human megakaryocyte-like cell lines, highlighting that these cells are not good models for primary cells. Tspan9 is not entirely restricted to megakaryocytes and platelets, though, since expression was also detected in mouse lung, brain and kidney. In human platelets, we found that Tspan9 expression was tightly regulated between donors at a level of 6% of CD9, 43% of CD151 and three times the level of CD63 (this relatively low protein expression level for the latter in platelets contrasts with its high mRNA expression in megakaryocytes, for reasons that are currently unknown). Since we also showed that CD9 is the major platelet tetraspanin at 49000 cell surface copies per cell, we can estimate a Tspan9 copy number of approximately 2800 on the platelet surface, assuming that the plasma membrane to intracellular ratio is the same for each protein. Therefore it seems unlikely that the major platelet glycoproteins, such as integrin &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (80000 copies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] or GPIb-IX-V (25000 copies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], would be direct binding partners for Tspan9. We did detect 43 and 60&#x000a0;kDa proteins in relatively stringent co-immunoprecipitations with Tspan9, and we are working to identify these proteins using proteomics.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation of tetraspanins CD9, CD151 and Tspan9, and the CD151-associated integrin, &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1, from surface biotinylated platelets revealed a distinct pattern of proteins in the relatively weak detergent Brij 97, in which tetraspanin microdomains are thought to remain largely intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These proteins are likely to represent the major components of tetraspanin microdomains on the platelet cell surface. Using specific antibodies, we found that these tetraspanin-associated proteins do not include three of the major platelet glycoproteins, namely GPIb-IX-V, &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 or &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3. The latter result was somewhat surprising, since &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 was reported to co-immunoprecipitate with CD151 in HEL cells lysed in the mild detergent CHAPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and with CD151 and Tspan32 in mouse platelets lysed in Triton X-100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, we did identify GPVI as a novel component of tetraspanin microdomains using co-immunoprecipitation experiments with CD9 and CD151 in Brij 97. GPVI interaction with CD9 and CD151 was lost in more stringent Triton X-100 detergent, which does not preserve tetraspanin&#x02013;tetraspanin interactions and hence microdomain integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This suggests that either the GPVI-tetraspanin interaction is relatively weak or that GPVI interacts more strongly with an unidentified tetraspanin. If the latter is true, Tspan9 is unlikely to be the direct binding partner for GPVI because we could not detect Tspan9 in GPVI immunoprecipitates (results not shown). The functional consequences of GPVI-tetraspanin association are currently unknown. Interestingly, the antigen receptors on B- and T-lymphocytes, which signal via an ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif)-based mechanism in common with the GPVI/FcR&#x003b3; complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], are dependent on tetraspanins for their normal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Particularly well characterized is the role of the tetraspanin CD81 on B-cells, where it interacts with the CD19 glycoprotein. CD19 is a signalling molecule which forms a complex with the complement receptor CD21, and is recruited to the B-cell receptor complex upon its engagement by complement-opsonized antigen. In the absence of CD81, the activated B-cell receptor fails to localize correctly to lipid raft microdomains and fails to induce sustained signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Moreover, CD19 biosynthetic maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane are impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Our future studies will aim to determine whether a specific platelet tetraspanin can similarly regulate GPVI maturation, trafficking and/or signal transduction.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that Tspan9 is relatively highly expressed in the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage and is a component of tetraspanin microdomains on the platelet surface. Tspan9 is remarkably highly conserved during evolution, even relative to most other tetraspanins. A feature of conserved amino acids is their involvement in intra-molecular or inter-molecular interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. This raises the possibility that almost the entire surface of Tspan9 is engaged in protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Indeed, we hypothesize that Tspan9 has multiple simultaneous interacting partners and functions as an interaction &#x02018;hub&#x02019; within tetraspanin microdomains. Tspan9 may therefore be essential for microdomain organization and for the function of microdomain-associated proteins on the platelet surface. The generation of Tspan9-deficient mice is in progress to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Online data</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bj4170391add.pdf" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to members of the Watson Lab for their advice and comments.
