We previously reported that the cysteine protease cathepsin K (ctsk) is overexpressed in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese individuals. We herein characterized the WAT and the metabolic phenotype of ctsk deficient animals (ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212;). When the growth rate of ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; was compared to that of the wild type animals (WT), we could establish a time window (5&#x02013;8 weeks of age) within which ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212;display significantly lower body weight and WAT size as compared to WT. Such a difference was not observable in older mice. Upon treatment with high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; gained significantly less weight than WT and showed reduced brown adipose tissue, liver mass and a lower percentage of body fat. Plasma triglycerides, cholesterol and leptin were significantly lower in HFD-fed-ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; as compared to HFD-fed WT animals. Adipocyte lipolysis rates were increased in both young and HFD-fed-ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212;, as compared to WT. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 activity, was higher in mitochondria isolated from the WAT of HFD treated ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; as compared to WT. Together, these data indicate that ctsk ablation in mice results in reduced body fat content under conditions requiring a rapid accumulation of fat stores. This observation could be partly explained by an increased release and/or utilization of FFA and by an augmented ratio of lipolysis/lipogenesis. These results also demonstrate that under a HFD, ctsk deficiency confers a partial resistance to the development of dyslipidemia.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cathepsin K (ctsk) is a member of the papain-like cysteine protease family. Members of this family are generally lysosomal enzymes although some, including ctsk are also found secreted from the cell. Ctsk has potent proteolytic activities against several extracellular matrix components such as collagen I and II, elastase, osteonectin and osteopontin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Lecaille1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Yasuda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Ctsk is most highly expressed in osteoclasts and its major recognized function is in the process of bone remodelling. However, broader potential roles for ctsk have been revealed by the identification of ctsk in a number of other cell and tissue types, including activated macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Buhling1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, thyroid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Friedrichs1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, lung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Buhling2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, atheroma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Sukhova1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Lutgens1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Runger1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Ctsk mRNA and protein were localized in samples of primary breast carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Castiglioni1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Brubaker1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>and it was suggested that this protease, like metalloproteases, may contribute to the invasive potential of certain cancer cells through the digestion of the extracellular matrix.</p><p>Several recent reports link cysteine cathepsins with metabolic function. Taleb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Taleb1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> found that cathepsin S (ctss) gene expression is augmented in adipose tissue of obese humans and defined it as a novel marker of adiposity. Given the involvement of this enzyme in the development of atherosclerotic lesions Rodgers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Rodgers1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, propose that ctss is a molecular link between obesity and atherosclerosis. Inactivation of cathepsin B (ctsb) protects against diet-induced fatty liver disease, as ctsb&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice placed on a high carbohydrate diet developed marked obesity, but not the severe hepatomegaly, steatosis and associated dysmetabolic syndrome observed in the wild type (WT) controls placed on the same diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Feldstein1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An even larger body of results indicate that metalloproteases (MMP) also play an important role in obesity and that their activities are important for the early events leading to adipogenesis. Chavey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Chavey1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> found that MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-12, MMP-14, MMP-19, and TIMP-1, the endogenous MMP inhibitor, are strongly induced in obese adipose tissues compared with lean tissues. In addition, they and others found that pharmacological inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 decreased adipose conversion <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Lijnen1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Bouloumie1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Maquoi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. We have recently reported that ctsk is relatively highly expressed in the white adipose tissue (WAT) and that it is a marker of adiposity as its transcript is induced in murine and human obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Chiellini1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we found that ctsk is a novel marker of adipogenesis, since its expression is progressively induced as 3T3-L1 preadipocytes progress to adipose conversion. This may partly account for the increase of ctsk observed in obesity in which <italic>de novo</italic> differentiation takes place. We also demonstrated that the microphthalmia transcription factors (mitf and TFE3), which are known to induce ctsk expression in osteoclasts, are induced in the WAT of obese animals. Interestingly, these transcription factors are activated by macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF), which is also induced in the adipose tissue of obese animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Levine1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, MCSF is able to induce the expression of ctsk in some cell types such as monocytic osteoclast precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Corisdeo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Ctsk induction therefore appears as a mechanism where different pathways converge, raising the question of the specific role and biological significance this protease may play in adipose tissue and in obesity.</p><p>To address this issue, we have employed a loss of function approach and have characterized ctsk null mice from a metabolic perspective. These mice, first described by Saftig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Saftig1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and Lazner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Lazner1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> show impaired resorption of bone matrix and develop osteopetrosis. However, no specific analysis of their metabolism or energy homeostasis had been carried out so far. The results of the present <italic>in vivo</italic> study indicate that ctsk ablation in mice results in an altered body fat content in the young animals and a lowered susceptibility to gain weight on a high fat diet in adult animals. These data, therefore, provides new experimental evidence for the involvement of ctsk in the regulation of fat storage and utilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Young ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice show reduced fat mass</title><p>In previous descriptions of the ctsk null mice (ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Saftig1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Li1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> no body weight differences compared to WT mice were presented.

We therefore measured the growth rate of the animals starting from postnatal day (P) 10 to P120: curves for males and females are respectively shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000683-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>. 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant (P&#x0003c;0.01) overall effect of genotype on the body weight during the time window analyzed (F&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9.81, df&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1, F&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8.15 for males and females respectively).

The glucose stimulated rise in circulating insulin was substantially similar in the two groups. These results indicate that glucose tolerance is improved and insulin sensitivity is well preserved in ctsk-deficient animals. 2-way ANOVA indicates that ctsk deficiency results in a significant overall reduction of plasma leptin (F&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9.08, df&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1, P&#x0003c;0.01). A trend toward reduction of plasma leptin was observed in young male ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000683-t001">table 1</xref>), and plasma leptin levels were significantly lower in adult male ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000683-t001">table 1</xref>), as compared with relative controls (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.02, df&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14, P&#x0003c;0.05). Since circulating leptin is a sensitive marker of adiposity, this decrease is consistent with the observed reduction of the fat mass in young ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; animals and suggests a latent alteration in adiposity in the adult animals. Together these data suggest that the metabolic profile of ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice is somewhat altered in adult animals, where an apparent decrease of adiposity is not observable.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0000683-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000683.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Metabolic parameters of young and adult C57Bl6 ctsk &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; male mice.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0000683-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0000683.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0000683-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Young wt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Young ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adult wt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adult ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212;</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non fasting glucose (mM)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.70&#x000b1;0.59 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.70&#x000b1;0.86 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.91&#x000b1;0.33 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;16)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.43&#x000b1;0.30 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non fasting FFA (&#x003bc;Eq/l)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">620.9&#x000b1;85.3 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">515.9&#x000b1;114.2 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">326.9&#x000b1;19.1 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">383.1&#x000b1;22.2 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non fasting triglycerides (mM)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.26&#x000b1;0.15 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.02&#x000b1;0.16 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.1&#x000b1;0.07 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;16)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9&#x000b1;0.05 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non fasting insulin (ng/ml)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9&#x000b1;0.11 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.65&#x000b1;0.12 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.65&#x000b1;0.06 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.29&#x000b1;0.018 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8) <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt103">&#x0002a;&#x0002a;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non fasting leptin (ng/ml)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.58&#x000b1;0.31 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.06&#x000b1;0.18 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.89&#x000b1;0.34(n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.53&#x000b1;0.36 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8) <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">&#x0002a;</xref></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Bonferroni post-test</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><label>&#x0002a;</label><p>P&#x0003c;0.05</p></fn><fn id="nt103"><label>&#x0002a;&#x0002a;</label><p>P&#x0003c;0.001</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice are partially resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity</title><p>Since an altered metabolic phenotype in ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice on a regular diet was clearly observed only in young animals, we challenged adult mice with a high fat diet (HFD) containing 35&#x00025; fat and 35&#x00025; carbohydrate (by weight) for 12 (sv129Bl6) or 13 (C57Bl6) weeks to stimulate weight gain. This experiment was performed in the colony of C57Bl6 (ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; and &#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) mice where the characterization of the adult and young mice so far described had been performed, and in an independent colony bred on the mixed genetic background sv129/C57Bl6 (males and females ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; and &#x0002b;/&#x0002b;). Results were qualitatively overlapping and the data sets for both groups are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000683-t002">table 2</xref>. Due to the important effect exerted by strain on the different variables, data were analyzed only within the separate groups (e.g C57 Bl6 male ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; versus WT). In the case of sv129/Bl6 mice, males and females were investigated in independent experiments, making any statistical comparison unlikely. For all groups, the intake of the HFD was not significantly different (assessed by 2-way ANOVA) in WT and in ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; animals. The representative graph shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000683-g002">figure 2A</xref> is relative to weekly measurements of food intake in HFD treated C57Bl6 male mice: the average consumption calculated for these animals is 2.79&#x000b1;0.05 g/mouse/day for WT and 2.69&#x000b1;0.04 g/mouse for ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice). Sv129/C57Bl6 animals (males and females) were started on the HFD at 8&#x02013;9 weeks of age.

In young mice, where the adipose tissue is very small and more enriched in undifferentiated cells and stromal vascular fraction (compared to adult animals), we isolated the adipocyte fraction (AF) and pooled samples from 20 animals. In these young mice, gene expression of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), which regulates systemic glucose and lipid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Boord1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, was reduced by 43&#x00025; in the AF of the ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice as compared to WT animals.

Conversely, in adult ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4) fed a HFD for 12 weeks, we observed a higher expression of aP2 gene (50&#x00025;) and a lower content of leptin mRNA (&#x02212;36&#x00025;) as compared to WT mice. The latter observation is consistent with the lower adipose mass and serum levels of leptin described in HFD fed C57Bl6 ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000683-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and storage present a consistent picture, in that glycerol phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), diacyglycerol acetyl transferase (DGAT) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were all increased in the AF of young ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (19&#x00025;, 90&#x00025; and 45&#x00025; for GPAT, DGAT and FAS respectively), as well as in adult male ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice fed a HFD for 12 weeks (29&#x00025;, 18&#x00025; and 296&#x00025; for GPAT, DGAT and FAS respectively) compared to WT controls. These data suggest that a pattern of gene activation for lipid synthesis and storage occurs in the WAT of ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212;mice.

Young ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice showed reduced fat mass, as compared to age-matched WT controls. Adult ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, which do not display overt phenotypic alterations when fed a normal diet, displayed a partial resistance to weight gain and to development of dyslipidemia when challenged with a HFD. The lower body weight was reflected in a diminished fat mass and, consistently, in lower serum leptin concentrations. Variability in weight gain among various colonies of wild-type or ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice may depend on differences in genetic background.</p><p>Adipose tissue is an organ with significant plasticity since it is able to undergo rapid dynamic changes. These changes take place during the rapid enlargement of adipose mass in mice soon after weaning and upon metabolic challenge represented, for instance, by the HFD, which forces the animal to store an abnormal excess of energy. In rodents, body fat content at birth is low and WAT is barely detectable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Herrera1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Two major morphologic changes take place and contribute to the development and enlargement of the fat depot in mice. Until the age of 40 days (P40) an intense period of cell adipocyte hyperplasia is observed, whereas the period between P40 and P80 is characterized by hypertrophy. Maximal lipogenic activity, by which adipocytes are filled with triglycerides, peaks at P40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Herrera1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the most prominent effect on fat mass that we have noticed in ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; male animals falls between P32 and P56, suggesting that lipogenesis and cell hypertrophy are affected by ctsk deficiency. In females this effect appears earlier, at P21. Further, data obtained on mouse embryonic fibroblasts indicate that ctsk deficiency results in a reduced capacity to undergo adipogenesis, and this further strengthens the concept that this protease is likely involved in the development of adipose tissue, in line with what reported by Xiao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Xiao1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Two different, but not necessarily alternative hypotheses can be formulated to explain the involvement of ctsk in adipogenesis and in situations requiring increased adipose tissue plasticity, such as the postnatal period or feeding with HFD. The first derives from the high capacity of ctsk to digest important components of the extracellular matrix, such as type I collagen and elastin. Because of this activity, ctsk has been implicated in diseases involving bone and cartilage destruction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Hummel1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Grabowskal1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Ctsk has also been detected in breast and prostate cancer where its role seems to be associated with the invasive potential of these tumours, in addition to matrix degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-LittlewoodEvans1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Lipton1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Enlargement of the adipose mass, such as that seen in the post-weaning period and upon HFD feeding, involves massive remodelling caused by increased cell size and number and by new vessel formation. Thus, the activity of ctsk could facilitate this process to which other proteases also participate. Therefore, in the long term and in a static situation (such as in the adult mouse) an effect of ctsk deficiency may not be observed since its function may be compensated by the upregulation of other proteases. Metalloproteases (MMP-2 and MMP 9) are present in WAT, where they play a role in adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Chavey1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and recent work by Taleb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Taleb1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> shows that the cysteine protease cathepsin S is expressed in WAT where it promotes adipogenesis potentially via the degradation of fibronectin.</p><p>The second, more speculative, hypothesis figures a role for ctsk not only in the environment surrounding the adipocyte, but also in the activation of pathways affecting adipocyte physiology and metabolism. It is difficult to explain such effects for a lysosomal and secreted protein, known to act on the extracellular matrix. Unfortunately, antibodies directed against ctsk which are reported to work well in other tissues, give a very poor and often non-specific signal in the WAT, and for this reason, our attempts to better define the localization of ctsk within adipose tissue have so far been unsuccessful. However, recent findings indicate that other cathepsins can change their localization depending on cellular conditions. For instance, cathepsin L (ctsl) isoforms devoid of the signal peptide, can localize to the nucleus and process the transcription factor CDP/Cux involved in the G1/S transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Goulet1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Such isoforms are translated from ATGs located downstream of the methionine codon 1. Although the amino acid sequences of ctsk and ctsl present only 45&#x00025; homology, the internal translation start sites present in ctsl (Met 77 and Met 83) are perfectly conserved in ctsk. Indeed, Goulet and coworkers report that ctsk is capable of cleaving CDP/Cux, although to a lesser extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Goulet1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these observations it is possible that ctsk is able to localize in subcellular compartments other than the lysosome and participate in the activation of metabolic pathways.</p><p>The reduced capacity of ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice to accumulate fat mass in spite of an equal caloric intake suggests that the absence of ctsk is associated with increased energy expenditure, which might be due to increased BAT activation. Yet, we could not demonstrate a significant increase of UCP1 content in BAT from ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice as compared with controls. This does not rule out an involvement of BAT in increased thermogenesis of ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice but other, possibly additional, mechanisms acting in other tissues should be considered. Indeed, we found that the reduced capacity of ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice to accumulate fat mass is not due to decreased expression of lipogenic enzymes but to an increased turn-over of free fatty acids. Indeed, on one hand our gene expression studies in WAT point toward a pattern of induction in a number of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (increased FAS) and esterification (moderately increased GPAT and DGAT), which should favour and not hinder TG storage. On the other hand, a highly enhanced rate of lipolysis and increased CPT-1 activity were detected in the WAT of young and HFD-fed adult ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, respectively. Such metabolic features suggest that adipocytes of ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice have an increased capacity to release and/or oxidize fatty acids, which makes them less prone to TG storage during early post-natal development or upon increased lipid availability, despite enhanced expression of lipogenic enzymes. It is likely that in ctsk-deficient animals, the turnover of FFA is accelerated because of enhanced lipolysis and an increased rate of the futile TG-FFA cycle (particularly in young mice), as well as an enhanced FFA utilization for beta-oxidation (particularly in HFD-fed adult mice). These changes ultimately result in the less efficient storage of triglycerides. The increased rate of FFA recycling, which in fasting rodents and humans accounts for 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; of WAT FFA disposal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Reshef1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, is reminiscent of a hyperthyroid phenotype, which however can be ruled out based on the slight hypothyroidism of the ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Friedrichs1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The similar, if not higher, degree of BAT activation observed in HFD-fed ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, despite their lower body fat content, suggests that energy expenditure is also probably slightly increased in this model. An hypothetical model of how cathepsin k deficiency impacts on accumulation of fat mass is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000683-g005">figure 5</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0000683-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000683.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Hypothetical scheme representing how ctsk ablation in mice may result in partial resistance to increase adipose mass in conditions requiring rapid accumulation of fat stores.</title><p>In wt mice (intact genome, left side of the panel) ctsk participates to WAT extra-cellular matrix remodelling, thus facilitating the enlargement of the adipose mass, which implies adipocyte size increase and de novo differentiation of pre-adipocytes. Mechanisms involving an intracellular action of ctsk are also hypothesized. In ctsk deficient animals (right side of the panel) stimuli directed to increase the adipose mass are partially blunted and the extra caloric intake is partly utilized in a futile cycle, consisting of increased synthesis of triglycerides, increased triglycerides hydrolysis and increased &#x003b2;-oxidation of FFA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000683.g005"/></fig><p>Overall our data indicate that ctsk ablation in mice results in a reduced body fat content under conditions requiring a fast accumulation of fat stores, namely, the post weaning period and the exposure to a high fat diet. This observation emphasizes the similarity of these two conditions and indicates ctsk as a permissive factor for WAT &#x0201c;plasticity&#x0201d;, intended as capacity to rapidly accumulate energy stores. This may have important implications to understand the onset of obesity in the very young and the relationship between childhood and adulthood obesity.</p><p>The reduced body fat content observed in ctsk&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice can be partly explained by an increased release and/or utilization of free fatty acids and potentially by an augmented ratio of lipolysis/lipogenesis. Further, our results demonstrate that under a HFD, ctsk deficiency confers a partial resistance to the development of dyslipidemia. Unfortunately current human ctsk K inhibitors are neither potent, nor selective against the rodent enzymes, therefore precluding the testing of this hypothesis pharmacologically in mice or rats. However, ctsk inhibitors are presently under evaluation in clinical trials for the treatment of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and metastatic bone disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000683-Turk2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.
