The mechanism by which proteins are sorted, specifically to this subdomain of the plasma membrane, is almost completely unknown. Previously, we showed that the IFT20 subunit of the intraflagellar transport particle is localized to the Golgi complex, in addition to the cilium and centrosome, and hypothesized that the Golgi pool of IFT20 plays a role in sorting proteins to the ciliary membrane. Here, we show that IFT20 is anchored to the Golgi complex by the golgin protein GMAP210/Trip11. Mice lacking GMAP210 die at birth with a pleiotropic phenotype that includes growth restriction, ventricular septal defects of the heart, omphalocele, and lung hypoplasia. Cells lacking GMAP210 have normal Golgi structure, but IFT20 is no longer localized to this organelle. GMAP210 is not absolutely required for ciliary assembly, but cilia on GMAP210 mutant cells are shorter than normal and have reduced amounts of the membrane protein polycystin-2 localized to them. This work suggests that GMAP210 and IFT20 function together at the Golgi in the sorting or transport of proteins destined for the ciliary membrane.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The primary cilium is a sensory organelle used by cells to monitor the extracellular environment. In mouse, severe defects in primary cilia lead to embryonic lethality while less severe defects cause a pleiotrophic phenotype that includes cystic kidney disease, retinal degeneration, obesity, and hydrocephaly, among others. The sensory functions of cilia rely on proteins localized to the ciliary membrane, which is continuous with the plasma membrane of the cell. Cells have the ability to specifically localize proteins to the ciliary membrane to the exclusion of the rest of the plasma membrane. Little is known about how this is accomplished. In prior work, we showed that the ciliary assembly protein IFT20 is localized to the Golgi complex, in addition to the cilium, and we proposed that it is involved in sorting or transport of membrane proteins to the cilium. In this work, we show that IFT20 is anchored to the Golgi complex by the golgin GMAP210. Mice defective in GMAP210 die at birth with lung and heart defects. Cells from these animals have ciliary defects, suggesting that IFT20 and GMAP210 function together at the Golgi complex in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most vertebrate cells have a non-motile primary cilium projecting from their surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Wheatley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Satir1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

We hypothesized that IFT20 plays a role in the sorting or transport of membrane proteins processed through the Golgi complex and destined for the ciliary membrane. This idea was based on the observation that IFT20 moved between the Golgi and ciliary compartments and the demonstration that partial reduction of IFT20 by RNAi reduced the level of the membrane protein polycystin-2 in cilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Follit1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In this work we sought to further our understanding of the function of the Golgi-associated pool of IFT20 by identifying proteins that interact with IFT20 at the Golgi complex. To do this, we immunoprecipitated an IFT20-containing complex from mouse kidney cells and used mass spectrometry (MS) to identify one of the subunits as a golgin known as GMAP210 or TRIP11. This peripheral membrane protein was previously shown to be localized to the Golgi complex by a number of groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Barr1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Beyond localization to the Golgi complex, there is little agreement in the literature about the function of this protein in mammals and it has been proposed to play roles ranging from regulating gene expression, controlling Golgi structure, and polarized secretion. To understand the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of GMAP210, we generated a GMAP210 mutant mouse. The mutant mice are viable until birth, when they die from a pleiotrophic phenotype that includes growth retardation and lung and heart defects. Cells derived from these animals do not have structural defects in their Golgi complexes indicating that this protein is not required for Golgi organization. However, IFT20 is displaced from the Golgi complex in mutant cells indicating that GMAP210 anchors IFT20 to the Golgi membrane. In addition, the mutant cells have slightly shorter cilia and have significantly less polycystin-2 in these cilia. This suggests that GMAP210 functions with IFT20 in the trafficking of proteins to the ciliary membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of IFT20 Interacting Proteins</title><p>IFT20 is the only IFT particle protein known to be associated with the Golgi complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Follit1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The identification of proteins that interact with IFT20 at the Golgi membrane is likely to yield new information about the function of IFT20. To this end, we generated stable mouse kidney cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged IFT20 and as controls, FLAG-tagged IFT25 and FLAG-tagged GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). IFT25 is a small IFT complex B subunit that is not Golgi associated (Follit et al., in preparation). FLAG-IFT20 localizes predominantly to the Golgi complex, whereas FLAG-IFT25 localizes to the cilium and basal body region as well as the cell body. FLAG-GFP is found in the cell body and is not enriched at either the cilium or Golgi complex. To identify candidate proteins that potentially interact with FLAG-tagged proteins, FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated (IPed) from cell lysates using FLAG antibody coupled to agarose, fractionated by SDS-PAGE and the gels silver stained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Proteins found in all three lanes are background proteins that non-specifically bound to the resin whereas proteins found in the IFT20 and IFT25 extracts are likely to be IFT complex B proteins. This appears to be the case since the &#x0223c;200 kD band found in both the IFT20 and IFT25 lanes was identified by mass spectrometry (MS) as IFT172. Two bands were identified in the IFT20 extract but not in either of the controls suggesting that these are IFT20 interacting proteins that are not part of complex B. We were not able to identify the larger band (indicated by an asterisk), but MS identified the smaller band as a golgin protein known in mammals as Thyroid Hormone Receptor Interacting Protein 11 (TRIP11) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Chen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, Golgi Microtubule Associated Protein 210 (GMAP210) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Rios1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, and Clonal Evolution Related Protein (CEV14) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Abe1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

This antibody recognizes a single protein in extracts made from human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, starting material) but does not recognize the mouse orthologue. Extracts of human retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells were IPed using the GMAP210 monoclonal Ab and a GFP monoclonal Ab (JL-8, Clontech) as a negative control. The GMAP210 Ab but not the GFP Ab precipitated IFT20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

Even though all of these proteins were present in the extract, only IFT20 was precipitated by the GMAP210 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This corroborates the identification of GMAP210 as an IFT20-binding protein and indicates that IFT20 and GMAP210 interact independently of IFT complex B. Furthermore, IFT20 and GMAP210 extensively co-localize at the Golgi complex as would be expected for interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of the IFT20 Binding Site on GMAP210</title><p>To map the IFT20 binding site on GMAP210, we tested whether IPing FLAG-tagged fragments of GMAP210 also brought down IFT20 and whether these FLAG-GMAP210 fragments could displace IFT20 from the Golgi apparatus by competing with native GMAP210 for binding to IFT20.

Initially, we expressed GMAP210 as two fragments split at the junction between the coiled-coil and Grab domains (JAF157 and JAF172, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Both fragments localized to the Golgi-complex, although the N-terminal fragment (JAF172) also was found in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000315.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The C-terminal fragment (JAF157) did not affect the localization of native IFT20 or bring down IFT20 in an IP. The N-terminal fragment (JAF172) precipitated IFT20 and partially displaced IFT20 from the Golgi complex indicating that it contains an IFT20 binding site. We then split the JAF172 fragment into two smaller fragments. The N-terminal JAF175 fragment partially localized to the Golgi complex indicating that there are Golgi-targeting domains at both the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000315.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).

The JAF174 fragment displaced IFT20 from the Golgi and was able to IP IFT20 indicating that it contained the IFT20 binding site. Expression of these GMAP210 fragments did not alter Golgi structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000315.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). We progressively split the JAF174 fragment into smaller pieces and tested their ability to IP IFT20 and displace IFT20 from the Golgi complex. The smallest fragment of GMAP210 that IPed IFT20 and displaced IFT20 from the Golgi contained residues 1180 to 1319 (JAF203). However, this peptide was not as effective as the slightly larger 1157 to 1319 fragment (JAF192). In all cases, the ability to IP IFT20 correlated with the ability to displace IFT20 from the Golgi complex. In contrast, the ability of the GMAP210 fragment to localize to the Golgi complex was not correlated with the presence of the IFT20 binding site. This suggests that GMAP210 localization to the Golgi complex is not dependent on IFT20. This appears to be the case as cells lacking IFT20 still localize GMAP210 to the Golgi complex (data not shown).</p><fig id="pgen-1000315-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000315.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Identification of the IFT20 binding site on GMAP210.</title><p>A.

At e18.5 mouse lungs are normally in the terminal sac stage of development. During this stage, which lasts from e17.5 to p5, the lung mesenchyme thins to bring the capillaries next to the prospective alveoli and the alveolar type I and II cells differentiate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Bridges1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. During their differentiation, the Type I cells flatten to reduce the distance between the capillaries and the air exchange surface of the saccule and the Type II cells produce surfactant for secretion into the saccules. Staining control and mutant lungs with markers for the Type I and II epithelial indicates that both types of cells are present. However in the mutant lungs, the Type II surfactant secreting cells are not as clearly interdigitated between the Type I cells and the SP-C staining is more punctate and distributed throughout the cell rather than being located at the apical end as it is in the control lungs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000315.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).

Quantitative PCR was used to examine the expression levels of a number of lung development genes. Genes examined included sonic hedgehog (SHH), which is critical for branching morphogenesis, VEGF-A, which is a regulator of vascular development, Hif1a and its binding partner ARNT, which regulate transcription of VEGF-A and other genes, SP-C, which encodes a surfactant molecule critical for lung function at birth, and the selenium binding protein, SelenBP1, which is up regulated just before birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Bonner1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

All three genotypes (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, &#x0002b;/&#x02212;, &#x02212;/&#x02212;) grew at similar rates and outwardly appeared indistinguishable. Since GMAP210 was identified as an IFT20 binding partner, we sought to understand how the lack of GMAP210 affected IFT20 and cilia formation. Wild-type MEKs and MEFs (not shown) localize IFT20 to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, Wild Type) as we described earlier for other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Follit1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. However, IFT20 is completely dispersed from the Golgi complex in cells lacking GMAP210 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g005">Figure 5A</xref> Mutant). This is not simply an indirect result caused by dispersal of the Golgi as the cis-medial and trans compartments of the Golgi complex appear normal in the GMAP210 mutant cells by <italic>Helix pomatia</italic> agglutinin (HPA), golgin97, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), giantin, and GM130 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The dispersal of IFT20 from the Golgi complex is caused by the lack of GMAP210 because re-expression of FLAG-tagged GMAP210 restores IFT20 to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g005">Figure 5A</xref> Rescue). IFT20 protein levels are slightly reduced in the mutant cells (data not shown) suggesting that some IFT20 is degraded when GMAP210 is absent with the rest being distributed throughout the cell.

As such, it is in a unique position to coordinate the sorting or transport of ciliary membrane proteins. In prior work, we showed that an RNAi-mediated reduction of IFT20 that depleted the Golgi pool but did not greatly affect the basal body pool was sufficient to block ciliary assembly suggesting that the Golgi pool of IFT20 played an important role in ciliary assembly. We also showed that cells with a moderate reduction of IFT20 could still assemble cilia, but these cilia had less polycystin-2 in them supporting a role for IFT20 in the sorting or transport of ciliary membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Follit1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present work, we sought to further our understanding of the function of the Golgi-associated pool of IFT20 by identifying proteins that interact with IFT20 at the Golgi complex. This analysis identified a protein called GMAP210 that binds to IFT20. Cells lacking GMAP210 fail to localize IFT20 to the Golgi complex, indicating that this protein is the linker that holds IFT20 to the Golgi. These cells can still form cilia, but they are shorter than normal and have reduced amounts of polycystin-2. Mice lacking GMAP210 die at birth likely from heart and lung defects.</p><p>As discussed below, previously published <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have implicated GMAP210 in a wide variety of processes ranging from Golgi structure to regulating gene expression, so the ability of GMAP210 mutant embryos to progress through embryonic development was unexpected. When examined just prior to birth, the major organs, with the exception of the lungs and heart, appear fairly normal and do not show signs of cystic disease. Our finding that ciliary levels of polycystin-2 are reduced in cells derived from the GMAP210 mutant animals would suggest that these animals should develop kidney cysts. However, in other work, we found that mice lacking cilia due to a mutation in IFT20 do not show signs of cystic disease until five to ten days after birth. When the IFT20 mutant kidneys are examined at e18.5, cilia are absent but there is no sign of cysts or even dilation of the kidney tubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Jonassen1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is likely that if the GMAP210 mutant animals were to live for a few weeks longer they would develop cystic kidney disease, but instead, animals die at birth before cysts have time to develop within the kidneys.</p><p>GMAP210 mutants exhibit serious congenital heart defects (VSD and Tetralogy of Fallot) that are a likely cause of the neonatal lethality observed in these animals. These disorders are common in humans, where it is estimated that as many as 1&#x00025; of live births have congenital heart defects with VSDs being the most common form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Hoffman1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Tetralogy of Fallot accounts for 10&#x00025; of human congenital heart disease and is the leading cause of cyanotic congenital heart disease in newborns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Shinebourne1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. VSDs and malalignment of the great arteries also are observed in mice with mutations in <italic>Vangl2</italic>, <italic>Dvl2</italic>, and <italic>Scrib</italic>. These genes are members of the planar cell polarity pathway (PCP), which regulates cell polarity and polarized cell movement via non canonical Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Hamblet1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Phillips2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Henderson1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. It is thought that formation of the ventricular septum is mediated by compaction of the trabeculae, with growth of the muscular septum generated by addition of sheets of trabeculae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-BenShachar1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Cre mediated cell lineage tracing indicates the ventricular septum is derived from cells originating from the ventral aspect of the primitive ventricle, with closure of the ventricular foramen mediated by dorsal migration of this precursor cell population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Stadtfeld1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. These cell migration events could be regulated by PCP signaling and thus VSDs might arise in animals with defects in PCP components. Similarly, the outflow tract alignment defects in the <italic>Vangl2</italic> mutant hearts may involve inhibition of polarized cell migration associated with myocardialization of the outflow tract. In the <italic>Scrib</italic> mutants, PCP defects are suggested to cause abnormalities of cardiomyocyte organization, which may result in abnormal trabeculation and ventricular noncompaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Phillips2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Cilia mutants often show defects in PCP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Ross1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Jonassen1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, the deletion of IFT20 in the kidney collecting duct disrupts PCP by randomizing the orientation of the cell division plane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Jonassen1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations suggest cardiac defects in the GMAP210 mutants could arise from dysregulated PCP signaling due to defects in the cilia. Cilia are present in the developing mouse heart from e9.5 onward and defects in ciliary assembly cause severe heart development defects including malformation of the trabeculae that normally contribute to the formation of the ventricular septum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Slough1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. In the GMAP210 mouse, the cilia are not absent but are likely missing key sensory receptors, analogous to the reduction of polycystin-2 in the kidney cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000315-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The lung phenotype of the GMAP210 mutant mouse is similar to several mouse models of infantile respiratory distress syndrome caused by defects in signaling between cells of the developing lungs such as the Wnt5a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Li1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref> and the nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Han1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. The Wnt5a mutant mouse is neonatal lethal and shares a number of features with the GMAP210 mutant mouse, including the thickened mesenchyme, reduced saccule space and a failure to organize its capillaries under the saccule epithelium. Wnt5a is a secreted ligand thought to be produced by both the mesenchyme and epithelial cells of the lung to regulate lung development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Li1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. It is of significance to note that Wnt5a mediates non canonical Wnt signaling in the PCP pathway. Thus the observed disorganization of the alveoli may reflect a disturbance of PCP signaling related to ciliary dysfunction. Similarly, the eNOS mouse is neonatal lethal and has reduced saccule space with thickened mesenchyme. In this case, it is thought that signaling between the endothelial and epithelial cells via eNOS influences development of the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Han1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies suggest NO production in endothelial cells is regulated by shear stress transduced through the cilia, with polycystin-1 cleavage associated with loss of responsiveness to high shear stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Nauli1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus it is also possible that abnormal regulation of NO production due to ciliary abnormalities in the GMAP210 mutant may play a role in the lung defects. Based on the reduced amount of polycystin-2 in the kidney cilia, we speculate that the cilia present in the developing lung may be deficient in membrane-localized receptors and hence unable to respond to cues from the environment.</p><p>GMAP210 is a member of the golgin family of proteins. Golgins are thought to function in the formation of the Golgi matrix, which organizes the Golgi membranes and regulates membrane trafficking. Members of this family typically have large coiled-coil regions and GRIP and GRAB domains that bind to small GTPases in the ARF and ARL subfamilies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Short1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, GMAP210 contains an ALPS domain, which is an amphipathic helix that binds preferentially to curved membranes. In GMAP210 the ALPS domain is at the N-terminus and is separated from the GRIP and GRAB domains at the C-terminus by a long stretch of coiled-coil suggesting that it may be able to hold small vesicles on the end of a long tether <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Drin1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Clear homologues of GMAP210 are found throughout the vertebrates and in organisms as distantly related as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>. The yeast orthologue is reported to be Rud3p as this protein shares the same domain structure being largely coiled-coil with Grab and Grab-associated domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Gillingham1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. However sequence identity between the yeast and mouse proteins is low (20&#x02013;24&#x00025;, BLAST E&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1e-9). BLAST analysis does not identify a <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> homologue, but XP_001702340 is a coiled-coil protein containing Grab and Grab-associated domains and thus may be the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> orthologue. The IFT20 binding domain localizes within a 163 amino acid region of the GMAP210 coiled-coil domain. This sequence is well conserved throughout the vertebrate kingdom but is not present in the yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> or <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> proteins nor is it found in the putative <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> GMAP210 homologue. At this point, it is not known if IFT20 associates with the Golgi complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> or <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> but if it does, it is likely to use a different mechanism. It is possible that the sorting mechanism of ciliary membrane proteins is fundamentally different in vertebrate cells as compared to <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> or <italic>Drosophila</italic> since the cilia assembled by IFT in these invertebrates are found on dendrites and so ciliary trafficking requires sorting to dendrites before sorting to cilia. In vertebrates, this arrangement is found in olfactory sensory neurons but the majority of cells assemble their cilia directly from the cell body and do not require sorting to dendrites first. Dendritic sorting shares features with sorting to the basal-lateral domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Dotti1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref> whereas most vertebrate cilia project from the apical surface if the cell is polarized.</p><p>The proposed functions of GMAP210 in the literature fall into disparate categories of organizing the microtubule cytoskeleton, organizing the Golgi complex, regulating gene expression, and playing roles in vesicular transport. Many of these studies have either not been repeated independently or are controversial. For example, Barr and Egerer called into question the role of GMAP210 as a microtubule associated protein involved in Golgi organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Barr1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and our data indicating that cells lacking GMAP210 still form normal Golgi structures further brings this result into question. The strongest data on the role of GMAP210 suggests that it plays roles in vesicular trafficking within the endomembrane system. In yeast, Rud3p, the GMAP210 homologue (with the caveats described above), was identified as a suppressor of mutations causing defective ER to Golgi transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-Kim1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

Erv14 in yeast and its orthologue Cnih in <italic>Drosophila</italic> appear to play critical roles in polarized secretion.

Mammals have four Erv14/Cnih homologues but very little is known about their function. It will be interesting to learn if any of the Erv14/Cnih homologues are required for localization of mouse GMAP210 and IFT20 to the Golgi complex. In mammalian cells, overexpression of GMAP210 blocked the secretion of alkaline phosphatase into the medium and inhibited the retrograde transport of a KDEL-containing substrate from the Golgi to the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000315-PernetGallay1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The proposed function of GMAP210 in polarized secretion of proteins is interesting in the context of GMAP210 anchoring IFT20 to the Golgi complex and in being required for localization of polycystin-2 to cilia.
