When two amino acids in the ClfA molecule, P<sub>336</sub> and Y<sub>338</sub>, were changed to serine and alanine, respectively, the fibrinogen binding property was lost. ClfAP<sub>336</sub>Y<sub>338</sub> mutants have been constructed in two virulent <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains Newman and LS-1. The aim of this study was to analyze if these two amino acids which are vital for the fibrinogen binding of ClfA are of importance for the ability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to generate disease. Septic arthritis or sepsis were induced in mice by intravenous inoculation of bacteria. The <italic>clfA</italic>P<sub>336</sub>Y<sub>338</sub> mutant induced significantly less arthritis than the wild type strain, both with respect to severity and frequency. The mutant infected mice developed also a much milder systemic inflammation, measured as lower mortality, weight loss, bacterial growth in kidneys and lower IL-6 levels. The data were verified with a second mutant where <italic>clfA</italic>P<sub>336</sub> and Y<sub>338</sub> were changed to alanine and serine respectively. When sepsis was induced by a larger bacterial inoculum, the <italic>clfA</italic>P<sub>336</sub>Y<sub>338</sub> mutants induced significantly less septic death. Importantly, immunization with the recombinant A domain of ClfAP<sub>336</sub>SY<sub>338</sub>A mutant but not with recombinant ClfA, protected against septic death. Our data strongly suggest that the fibrinogen binding activity of ClfA is crucial for the ability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to provoke disease manifestations, and that the vaccine potential of recombinant ClfA is improved by removing its ability to bind fibrinogen.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clumping factor A (ClfA) is a surface located protein of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. ClfA contains a 519 amino acid N-terminal A domain, which comprises three separately folded subdomains N1, N2 and N3.

Our data strongly suggest that the ClfA-fibrinogen interaction is crucial for the bacterial virulence and thus disease outcome. The ability of ClfA to bind fibrinogen was associated with enhanced virulence in terms of the ability to cause septic death. In both staphylococcal strains tested, a <italic>clfA</italic>PY mutant induced less septic death than the wild-type. Also, the severity of arthritis was strongly reduced in mice infected with the non-fibrinogen binding <italic>clfA</italic>PY mutant.</p><p>A likely mechanism for the promotion of virulence by the fibrinogen-bacterial cell surface interaction is inhibition of neutrophil phagocytosis. Opsonophagocytosis experiments with human neutrophils show clearly that ClfA inhibits phagocytosis of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and that this in part is dependent on fibrinogen binding because the ClfAPY mutant is only partially inhibiting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002206-Higgins1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Neutrophils are crucial for the host defence in the early phase of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002206-Verdrengh1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Without neutrophils, bacterial growth is strongly augmented in blood and kidneys, and the frequency of arthritis and mortality increases. Fibrinogen mediated inhibition of neutrophil phagocytosis by ClfA could explain at least in part the more pronounced virulence of wildtype <italic>S. aureus</italic> compared to the <italic>clfA</italic>PY mutants. Binding of fibrinogen to ClfA could decrease opsonophagocytosis by neutrophils by reducing opsonin deposition or access to opsonins by neutrophil receptors. ClfA could also specifically block phagocytosis, for example by interfering with the fibrinogen binding phagocyte integrin Mac-1. The streptococcal M5 protein has been shown to block phagocytosis by neutrophils by interfering with Mac-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002206-Weineisen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and the fibrinogen binding region of the M5 protein is essential for resistance to phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002206-Sandin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, bound fibrinogen might block the binding of an unknown protective host factor to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Another option is that the fibrinogen-ClfA interaction promotes bacterial passage from blood vessel into the tissue or promotes colonization in tissues.</p><p>Unexpectedly, our data also show the ClfA null mutant was more virulent than the <italic>clfA</italic>PY mutant strains. Possibly the ClfA protein has functions in vivo other than interacting with fibrinogen. This interaction is clearly disadvantageous for the host as shown in this study. Other functions of ClfA are presently not well mapped but non-fibrinogen dependent platelet aggregation exerted by ClfA might result in trapping of big amounts of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in circulation with subsequent elimination of the bacterial&#x02013;platelet complexes through the reticuloendothelial system. Such platelet aggregation mediated elimination of staphylococci would readily occur in the wild-type and <italic>clfA</italic>PY mutated strains but not in the <italic>clfA</italic> knockout. Whereas in the wild-type strain the fibrinogen interaction would overshadow the other events, in the <italic>clfA</italic>PY mutants such bacterial eliminiation might be highly beneficial to the host.</p><p>The <italic>clfA</italic> knockout mutant protected against septic death to the same degree as the <italic>clfA</italic>PY mutation in <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain LS-1, but protected less, if at all, in strain Newman. The overall impact of ClfA expression on bacterial virulence could differ between different <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains depending on the level of expression and the presence of other virulence factors.</p><p>The issue whether the <italic>clfA</italic>PY mutant displays equal or lower virulence once in the joint cavity is of certain importance having in mind that in inflamed synovial fluid fibrinogen and fibrin are abundant. Our data suggest that the <italic>clfA</italic>PY mutant is less destructive for cartilage and bone.</p><p>The protective effect of recombinant ClfA A domain non-fibrinogen binding P<sub>336</sub>Y<sub>338</sub> mutant was greater than for wild-type rClfA. Immunization with ClfAPY enhanced the serum levels of specific antibodies that recognized both the immunogen and the wild-type ClfA protein. More importantly, it induced a greater protective immune response against septic death than wild-type ClfA. In contrast, we did not see a similar significant correlation in case of septic arthritis. We interpret the differences between the two infection models to accessibility of antibodies to different body compartments which is excellent in the blood stream (sepsis) and lower in the joint cavity during septic arthritis.</p><p>We hypothesize that binding of fibrinogen by wild-type ClfA protein during the immunization phase decreases antigen presentation due to hiding of important epitopes on the ClfA molecule and hence decreases specific antibody production. This finding implies that PY mutant ClfA might be a considerably better vaccine candidate than wild type recombinant ClfA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>NMRI mice were obtained from Scanbur BK (Sollentuna, Sweden) and were maintained in the animal facility of the Department of Rheumatology, University of G&#x000f6;teborg, Sweden.

Bacterial growth in kidneys was assessed in the septic arthritis experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Clinical evaluation of infected mice</title><p>The clinical evaluation was performed in a blinded manner. Each limb was inspected visually. The inspection yielded a score of 0 to 3 (0, no swelling and erythema; 1, mild swelling and/or erythema; 2, moderate swelling and/or erythema; 3 marked swelling and/or erythema). The arthritic index of an animal was constructed by adding the scores from all four limbs. The presented arthritic index is thus the severity of arthritis, measured as the sum of scores, of all mice in a group. The overall condition of each mouse was also examined by assessing signs of systemic inflammation, i.e., weight decrease, reduced alertness, and ruffled coat. In cases of severe systemic infection, when a mouse was judged too ill to survive another 24 h, it was killed by cervical dislocation and considered dead due to sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Histological examination</title><p>Histological examination of joints was performed using a modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002206-Josefsson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> of a previously described method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002206-Sakiniene2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, microscopic inspection yielded a score for each joint for severity of synovitis and cartilage/bone destruction. Synovitis was scored as 0&#x02013;3 and cartilage and/or bone destruction was scored as 0&#x02013;2. Totally 12 joints per animal were examined. The histologic index, for severity of synovitis and cartilage/bone destruction respectively, was calculated by adding the scores for the 12 joints of an animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Bacteriologic examination of infected kidneys</title><p>Kidneys were aseptically dissected, kept on ice, homogenised, serially diluted in PBS and spread on blood agar plates. After 24 h of incubation in 37&#x000b0;C the number of cfu per kidney pair was determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Measurement of serum IgG</title><p>Levels in serum of total IgG were measured by the radial immunodiffusion technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002206-Mancini1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

The serum levels of specific antibodies against rClfA and rClfAPY was measured by ELISA. Microplates (96-well; Nunc) were coated with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml of recombinant protein in PBS. Blocking agent, serum samples, biotinylated antibodies, and ExtrAvidin-proxidase were all diluted in PBS. The assay was run according to a previous description <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002206-Josefsson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.
