We previously reported a significant amount of TGFBIp in plasma by immunoblotting using the only TGFBIp antiserum (anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup>) available at that time (anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup> was generated against residues Val<sub>210</sub>-His<sub>683</sub> of TGFBIp). This observation raised the possibility that a fraction of corneal TGFBIp may originate from the plasma. However, recent experiments in our laboratory indicated that the anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup> antiserum cross-reacts with an environmental protein contaminant. Therefore, we investigated the specificity of the originally utilized anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup> antiserum and re-evaluated the amount of TGFBIp in human plasma by immunoblotting using a new specific antiserum.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The observed cross-reactivity of the previously utilized anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup> antiserum was tested by immunoblotting and the antigen identity was determined by mass spectrometry. A part of human <italic>TGFBI</italic> encoding an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 11.4 kDa fragment of TGFBIp (residues Gly<sub>134</sub>-Ile<sub>236</sub>) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The TGFBIp fragment was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography, and used to immunize rabbits to produce a specific antiserum (anti-TGFBIp<sup>134-236</sup>). To enhance the detection of possible TGFBIp in plasma by allowing a higher sample load, albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were specifically depleted from normal human plasma by affinity chromatography. The presence of TGFBIp in plasma was investigated by immunoblotting using the anti-TGFBIp<sup>134-236</sup> antiserum. Purified TGFBIp from porcine corneas was used for estimation of the TGFBIp detection limit.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The previously utilized TGFBIp antiserum, anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup>, cross-reacted with human keratin-1, a common environmental protein contaminant. Thus, the anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup> antiserum recognizes both TGFBIp and keratin-1. In contrast, the anti-TGFBIp<sup>134-236</sup> antiserum reacted with TGFBIp but showed no indication of reactivity with other proteins in plasma. Using this antiserum, TGFBIp was not detected in crude or albumin/IgG-depleted human plasma and the detection limit of TGFBIp using immunoblotting was estimated to be 10 ng.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our failure to detect TGFBIp in human plasma using a highly specific antiserum suggests that TGFBIp is not present in a physiologically relevant concentration in human plasma. The previous impression that normal human plasma contains a significant amount of TGFBIp by immunoblotting was due to the utilization of a less specific antiserum that recognizes both TGFBIp and human keratin-1. Together with other results, our observation makes it unlikely that TGFBIp is imported into the cornea from the circulation as reported for other abundant extracellular corneal proteins and suggests corneal origin of TGFBIp deposits in individuals with inherited corneal diseases caused by mutations in the <italic>TGFBI</italic> gene.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transforming growth factor beta induced protein (TGFBIp; also known as kerato-epithelin, beta ig-h3, &#x003b2;ig-h3, RGD-containing collagen-associated protein [RGD-CAP], and MP78/70) is an extracellular matrix protein encoded by the transforming growth factor beta induced gene (<italic>TGFBI</italic>; formerly designated <italic>BIGH3</italic>), which was first discovered in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line exposed to transforming growth factor beta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. The protein is composed of 683 residues including a 23-amino acid signal peptide. TGFBIp is highly conserved and the full-length human and porcine TGFBIp sequences are 93% identical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. TGFBIp contains an RGD motif (residues Arg<sub>619</sub>-Gly<sub>620</sub>-Asp<sub>621</sub> in mature TGFBIp) and has been shown to interact with different integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], collagen types I, II, IV, and VI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>] and to stimulate cell migration. Thus, the interaction of TGFBIp with these ligands suggests that TGFBIp plays a role in cell adhesion but its specific physiological role remains unclear.</p><p>The <italic>TGFBI</italic> gene is expressed in many tissues but TGFBIp is especially abundant in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], tendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. We discovered TGFBIp in the normal human cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>] and have recently purified and characterized the protein from human and porcine corneas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Most of the corneal TGFBIp has a mature molecular mass of 68 kDa and migrates as an about 65 kDa protein in reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The corneal TGFBIp is truncated in the COOH-terminus immediately after the putative integrin-binding sequence (RDG) and most likely lacks posttranslational modifications. In addition, about 60% of the corneal TGFBIp is covalently associated with insoluble components.</p><p>Mutations in the <italic>TGFBI</italic> gene are associated with an accumulation of TGFBIp in several inherited corneal disorders that lead to impaired vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Some mutations result in an accumulation of amyloid within the corneal stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] while others generate fuschinophilic crystalloid deposits in the cornea that are characteristics of the granular corneal dystrophies. Furthermore, the Arg124His mutation gives rise to a combination of granular and amyloid deposits while mutation Arg555Gln causes curly fibers characteristic of Thiel-Behnke dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. In a recent systemic investigation of TGFBIp deposits in a patient with lattice corneal dystrophy type I, deposits were not detected in any tissue except the cornea, suggesting a cornea-specific mechanism for the TGFBIp accumulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>TGFBI</italic> gene is highly expressed in the corneal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] and stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], suggesting that wild-type and mutant TGFBIp are synthesized locally in normal and diseased corneas. However, significant amounts of TGFBIp have been reported in plasma from a healthy person and an individual with granular corneal dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] using the only antiserum against TGFBIp available at the time (anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. This suggested that at least some corneal TGFBIp may originate from plasma. That some corneal proteins are derived from the plasma is well established. Thus, bioinformatic comparison of the cornea proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] with high quality gene expression data from the cornea strongly indicates that most plasma proteins are not synthesized in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>] but probably enter this tissue from neighboring blood vessels. The possibility that TGFBIp deposition in the <italic>TGFBI</italic> corneal disorders might be plasma derived was supported by the somewhat comparable human disease hypergammaglobulinemia. Immunoglobulin normally enters the cornea from plasma and in hypergammaglobulinemia, this protein sometimes aggregates and deposits in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>].</p><p>However, recently we have noticed that the anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup> utilized to immunodetect TGFBIp in plasma reacted with another protein, raising doubt on the conclusion that human plasma contains significant amounts of TGFBIp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. We hence examined the specificity of the previously utilized antiserum, anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup>. Here, we report that it is not only specific against TGFBIp but also reacts with human keratin-1, a common environmental protein contaminant having approximately the same molecular mass as TGFBIp. Using a new and highly specific antiserum (anti-TGFBIp<sup>134-236</sup>) for immunodetection of TGFBIp, we conclude that the previous strong detection of TGFBIp in normal human plasma was in error and that TGFBIp is not detectable in normal human plasma under the conditions tested. Thus, our results suggest that corneal TGFBIp is not imported into the cornea from plasma but originates from local synthesis in the cornea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning and purification of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal transforming growth factor beta induced protein fragment</title><p>A human NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 11.4 kDa TGFBIp-fragment covering residues Gly<sub>134</sub>-Ile<sub>236</sub> of the full-length precursor protein (Gly<sub>111</sub>-Ile<sub>213</sub> of the mature protein) was cloned by PCR using forward primer 5'- CAC CGG GCC CGG CAG CTT CAC CAT CTT CG-3', reverse primer 5'-TCA GAT GAC CTT ATC GAT CGA TGA GGT G-3', and human full-length <italic>TGFBI</italic> cDNA as template.

Thus, depletion of albumin and IgG from plasma should remove 65-80% of the total protein content allowing larger volumes of plasma to be analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Consequently, this will enhance the detection of TGFBIp if present in plasma. The immunoblotting was repeated using increasing amounts of the albumin/IgG-depleted plasma preparation equaling 1-20 &#x003bc;l of crude plasma.

The detection limit of TGFBIp using the present immunoblotting method was about 10 ng. Since no TGFBIp was detected in an albumin/IgG-depleted sample equaling 20 &#x003bc;l of crude plasma, the present results show that the concentration of TGFBIp in plasma is less than 0.5 mg/l. This estimation is based on the assumption that the antiserum reacts equally with human and porcine TGFBIp, which seems reasonable owing to the 98% identity of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragments of TGFBIp.</p><fig id="f6" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Detection limit of TGFBIp using purified porcine TGFBIp from corneas.

However, the specificity of this antiserum, anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup>, is now questioned as it reacts not only against TGFBIp but also with an environmental protein contaminant that is present even in blank samples only containing SDS sample buffer and DTT. In this study, we have shown that the anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup> antiserum is not specific for TGFBIp because it reacts strongly with human keratin-1 under reducing conditions. Unfortunately, keratin-1 migrates at the same position (about 65 kDa) as TGFBIp under reducing conditions indicating that the previous interpretation of finding a significant amount of TGFBIp in human plasma was in error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Human keratins such as keratin-10 (59.8 kDa), keratin-9 (62.1 kDa), epidermal keratin-2 (65.9 kDa), and keratin-1 (66.1 kDa) are known to be common laboratory contaminants and an analysis by use of normal dust verified that human keratin-1 and -10 are indeed abundant in dust. Therefore, the trace amount of the keratin-10/1 pair in blank control samples probably originated from dust. Keratins are intermediate filament proteins forming approximately 10 nm cytoskeletal filaments that stabilize the structure of the cell. The keratin-10/1 pair is tissue-specific and mainly expressed in suprabasal differentiating keratinocytes within epidermis. Thus, keratin-1 and keratin-10 together with epidermal keratin-2 are characteristic of the post-mitotic upper layer of epidermis and therefore likely to end up in dust as the cornified and dead keratinocytes desquamate from the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. Since keratin-1 and the recombinant TGFBIp-fragment (Val<sub>210</sub>-His<sub>683</sub> of TGFBIp) show no significant sequence similarity, it is very unlikely that antibodies will recognize both proteins through reactivity with shared epitopes. However, contamination of an antigen preparation with small amounts of dust prior to immunizations could lead to reactivity of the antiserum against keratin-1 in addition to TGFBIp. Since both mature TGFBIp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>] and keratin-1 migrate with molecular masses of about 65 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE, reactivity against contaminating keratin-1 in immunoblotting is easily misinterpreted as detection of TGFBIp. The fact that we observe reactivity of the anti-p68<sup>&#x003b2;ig-h3</sup> antiserum against keratin-1 only under reducing conditions is probably because all keratins of the cornified layer of epidermis are cross-linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds forming high molecular weight structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>], which prevent the protein from entering the gel under non-reducing conditions. Thus, we conclude that the previous strong detection of TGFBIp in plasma by immunoblotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] was incorrect, demonstrating the importance of using direct protein identification methods such as mass spectrometry or NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal sequencing. Because of this we have produced a new antiserum against TGFBIp and reinvestigated the presence of TGFBIp in normal human plasma with the aim of determining its concentration. With this anti-TGFBIp<sup>134-236</sup> antiserum, which showed no indications of reactivity with other proteins, we could not detect TGFBIp in normal crude plasma or in plasma depleted of albumin and IgG under the conditions tested. Based on the detection limit, which was estimated using purified TGFBIp from porcine corneas, we conclude that the concentration of TGFBIp in plasma is below 0.5 mg/l, which is in the range of so-called tissue leakage proteins caused, for example, by tissue turnover and thus with no physiological function in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Thus, our observation is consistent with another study reporting the detection of TGFBIp in the &#x003bc;g/ml range in serum from healthy individuals and patients with colorectal cancer using an ELISA assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>].</p><p>The present evidence against a plasma derived origin for corneal TGFBIp has implications for the pathogenesis of inherited corneal disorders caused by mutations in the <italic>TGFBI</italic> gene. It suggests that corneal TGFBIp deposits in individuals with mutations in the <italic>TGFBI</italic> gene originate from local synthesis in the cornea rather than from the plasma as in hypergammaglobulinemia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported in part by grants from The Carlsberg Foundation (H.K.), NIH RO1-EY12712, The Danish
