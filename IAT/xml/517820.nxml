This process is regulated by TGF-&#x003b2; and insulin-signalling pathways and is connected with the control of life span through the insulin pathway components DAF-2 and DAF-16. We found that replacing cholesterol with its methylated metabolite lophenol induced worms to form dauer larvae in the presence of food and low population density. Our data indicate that methylated sterols do not actively induce the dauer formation but rather that the reproductive growth requires a cholesterol-derived hormone that cannot be produced from methylated sterols. Using the effect of lophenol on growth, we have partially purified activity, named gamravali, which promotes the reproduction. In addition, the effect of lophenol allowed us to determine the role of sterols during dauer larva formation and longevity. In the absence of gamravali, the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12 is activated and thereby initiates the dauer formation program. Active DAF-12 triggers in neurons the nuclear import of DAF-16, a forkhead domain transcription factor that contributes to dauer differentiation. This hormonal control of DAF-16 activation is, however, independent of insulin signalling and has no influence on life span.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A sterol-derived activity is partially purified and shown to support reproductive growth under sterol-free conditions that normally induce dauer larva formation in nematodes</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sterols are essential in most eukaryotic cells and play a structural role in the architecture of their membranes. They influence the physicochemical properties of membranes, including fluidity and permeability for ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Haines1">Haines 2001</xref>). Cholesterol, together with glycosphingolipids, is also proposed to organise membrane microdomains (also called &#x0201c;rafts&#x0201d;), which provide platforms for protein sorting or signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Simons1">Simons and Toomre 2000</xref>). In addition to this structural role in the membrane, cholesterol is essential for a variety of signalling processes. It is a precursor of important classes of physiologically active compounds such as steroid hormones in mammals or ecdysones in insects. The nematode <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> provides a valuable model system to study the orchestration of cholesterol metabolism and function at the level of a whole organism. <italic>C. elegans,</italic> like other nematodes, cannot synthesise sterols de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Hieb1">Hieb and Rothstein 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Chitwood1">Chitwood 1999</xref>). Thus, it requires an exogenous source of sterols, which enables (i) analysis of sterol metabolism using labelled precursors and (ii) analysis of sterol functions by feeding normal and mutant worms with cholesterol derivatives and related sterols.</p><p>Although worms require exogenous cholesterol for survival, the effects of its depletion are still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Kurzchalia1">Kurzchalia and Ward 2003</xref>). Worms are routinely grown in the laboratory on agar plates seeded with bacteria and supplemented with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml of cholesterol (Brenner conditions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Brenner1">Brenner 1974</xref>). Omitting sterols from agar has a weak effect on development and growth: Worms can still propagate for many generations, although some larvae fail to shed the old cuticles properly during molting, gonad development is aberrant, and movement is uncoordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Yochem1">Yochem et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Shim1">Shim et al. 2002</xref>). Under these conditions, the amounts of sterols in both the agar and the bacteria grown on yeast extracts seem to be sufficient to support growth. A stronger phenotype is obtained by using bacteria grown on defined or sterol-extracted media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Crowder1">Crowder et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Merris1">Merris et al. 2003</xref>). Results of depletion experiments indicate that although absolutely necessary, sterols are required only in very low amounts. This makes it less likely that they are structural components in worm membranes, and thus the primary role in worms should reside in signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Kurzchalia1">Kurzchalia and Ward 2003</xref>). However, no specific signalling molecules derived from cholesterol, steroid hormones, or ecdysones have been identified yet.</p><p>It has been suggested that in worms cholesterol plays a role in the processes of molting and dauer formation. Involvement in molting is based on the roles of the worm homologues of mammalian megalin and insect DHR3. A worm mutant of <italic>lrp-1,</italic> a homologue of mammalian gp330/megalin protein, had a phenotype of defect in shedding of the cuticle, and this phenotype became more apparent upon partial cholesterol depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Yochem1">Yochem et al. 1999</xref>). Among other functions, megalin in mammals is involved in the uptake of a cholesterol derivative, vitamin D, by kidney absorptive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Willnow1">Willnow et al. 1999</xref>). Molting in insects is regulated by ecdysones, polyhydroxylated sterols derived from cholesterol, which act via nuclear hormone receptors. The analysis of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genome did not reveal a homologue of the ecdysone receptor itself. However, disruption by RNAi of CHR3 <italic>(nhr-23),</italic> a <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> homologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> orphan nuclear receptor (DHR3) that is induced by ecdysone, leads to defective shedding of the old cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Kostrouchova1">Kostrouchova et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Kostrouchova2">2001</xref>).</p><p>Another process that might involve cholesterol or its derivatives is dauer larva formation. Many genes can mutate to cause constitutive formation of dauer larvae (Daf-c mutants) or to prevent their formation (Daf-d mutants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Riddle1">Riddle and Albert 1997</xref>). Genetic studies have revealed that three pathways (TGF-&#x003b2;, cyclic GMP, and insulin-like IGF-1) control the formation of dauer larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Riddle1">Riddle and Albert 1997</xref>). DAF-2 (insulin-like receptor, IGF-1) signals to inhibit the activity of DAF-16, a forkhead domain (FOXO) transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Kenyon1">Kenyon et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Morris1">Morris et al. 1996</xref>) that also influences the prolongation of adult life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Lin1">Lin et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Ogg1">Ogg et al. 1997</xref>). Under dauer formation conditions, DAF-16 is activated and translocated into the nucleus, where it may integrate insulin-like and TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Henderson1">Henderson and Johnson 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Lee1">Lee et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Lin2">Lin et al. 2001</xref>). Genetic epistasis analysis suggests that <italic>daf-16</italic> acts upstream of two other <italic>daf</italic> genes, <italic>daf-9</italic> and <italic>daf-12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Gerisch2">Gerisch et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Jia1">Jia et al. 2002</xref>). It was proposed that DAF-16 inhibits the activity of DAF-9 when the dauer formation process is initiated. The integration of all three pathways downstream from <italic>daf-9</italic> occurs at the level of DAF-12, a putative nuclear hormone receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Antebi1">Antebi et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Antebi2">2000</xref>), suggesting a possible hormonal regulation of dauer larva formation. In addition, <italic>daf-9</italic> has a strong homology to several cytochrome P450s that are involved in steroid metabolism in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Gerisch2">Gerisch et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Jia1">Jia et al. 2002</xref>). The <italic>daf-9</italic> null mutation leads to constitutive dauer formation, consistent with the scenario where DAF-9 is an enzyme that produces a steroid hormone regulating DAF-12, which in turn ultimately triggers dauer formation.</p><p>As a starting point for our investigations on the role of sterols in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> we developed a protocol for strict elimination of sterols in the medium and food. Under sterol-free conditions, the first generation of worms developed from eggs to adults without external cholesterol. In the second generation they become dauer-like larvae but molting was incomplete. We found that replacing cholesterol with its natural metabolite lophenol, a methylated sterol, induced all worms to form regular dauer larvae. Using the effect of lophenol on growth, we could partially purify activity supporting the reproduction and determine the role of sterols during dauer larva formation and longevity. In the absence of this hormone, the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12 is derepressed and thereby activates the dauer formation program. Active DAF-12 triggers in neurons the nuclear import of DAF-16 that contributes to dauer differentiation. Thus, the effect of lophenol allowed us to reveal a novel function of DAF-16 downstream of DAF-12 that is required for the execution of the dauer program but has no effect on life span.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Worms Grown without Cholesterol for Two Generations Become Dauer-Like Larvae with Incomplete Molting</title><p>In order to establish sterol-free growth conditions, we extracted traces of sterols from agarose and used defined medium for propagation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> to be fed to worms (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). When eggs derived from mothers grown on normal plates (5 &#x003bc;g/ml of cholesterol; approximately 13 &#x003bc;M) hatched at low population densities on sterol-free plates seeded with bacteria, the first generation of worms developed from eggs to adults without external cholesterol. These adults, however, laid only about 60&#x00025; as many eggs as normal, and 17&#x00025; of the total eggs laid did not hatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The second-generation larvae completed their L1-to-L2 molt but then all arrested their development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, no cholesterol).

The arrested larvae are similar in size and appearance to L2 larvae grown on cholesterol. The number of cells in their gonads varied between five and 25 with an average of ten, similar to normally grown L2 larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Kimble1">Kimble and Hirsh 1979</xref>). These larvae stopped pharyngeal pumping after 3&#x02013;5 d and became immobile after 7 d. If they were transferred to cholesterol-containing plates within the first 2&#x02013;3 d, larvae reversed their arrest and matured to fertile adults. The reversal required as low as 20 nM cholesterol.</p><p>The arrested larvae had a double cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The outer cuticle looks like a normal L2 cuticle and the inner cuticle has the characteristics of the normal dauer larva cuticle, including partially developed alae (for comparison, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) and the distinctive striated layer found only in dauer larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Cassada1">Cassada and Russell 1975</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Other dauer-like features of these arrested larvae include constriction of the gut and unstained gut granules (unpublished data). Occasionally, animals were found with partially shed cuticles (&#x0003c;5&#x00025;; unpublished data). In contrast to normal dauer larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Swanson1">Swanson and Riddle 1981</xref>), these arrested larvae were sensitive to treatment with 1&#x00025; sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), perhaps because this shedding defect prevents complete dauer cuticle maturation.</p><p>We then asked whether the dauer features of the arrested larvae depend on <italic>daf-12.</italic> In the absence of cholesterol the second generation of <italic>daf-12</italic> worms arrested with only one cuticle similar to that of normal L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g001">1</xref>E). These results show that on noncrowded plates with ample food, the absence of cholesterol causes L2 larvae to enter the normal dauer pathway utilising DAF-12.</p><p>In summary, our results imply that cholesterol, or cholesterol derivatives, are essential either for the development of reproductive adults or for the prevention of dauer larva formation. In addition, cholesterol derivatives are needed to shed the L2 cuticle.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cholesterol Depletion Leads to Reduced Levels of Nonmethylated Sterols and Accumulation of Methylated Sterols</title><p>We investigated the metabolism of cholesterol in worms under conditions of cholesterol depletion. Eggs derived from mothers fed with radioactive cholesterol were put on cholesterol-depleted plates, where they grew for another generation to finally produce arrested L2/dauer larvae. The metabolism of sterols was followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). It has been previously established that <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> metabolises exogenously added cholesterol by methylating the A-ring at the fourth position and rearranging the double bond to form lophenol as the major product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Chitwood2">Chitwood et al. 1983</xref>). In eggs and L1 larvae of the first generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2, respectively) or under conditions where cholesterol is present in the food permanently (unpublished data), methylated sterols (ms; lophenol and 4&#x003b1;-methyl-&#x00394;8,14-cholestenol) are found in much lower amounts than nonmethylated sterols (nms; cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, and lathosterol). Quantification of radiographs revealed that under these conditions ms represent only 1&#x00025;&#x02013;3&#x00025; of the total radioactivity. Cholesterol is also metabolised to a number of more hydrophilic derivatives (indicated by a vertical line), the identities of which are still unknown. In eggs derived from the second generation we observed two major changes: (i) The total radioactivity decreased and (ii) the fraction of nms showed a stronger decrease than that of ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The proportion between ms and nms changed even more dramatically in the L1 larvae of the second generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;6). Here, about 95&#x00025; of radioactivity was found as ms (lane 6). Note that the total radioactivity is on the limit of detection. Thus, upon cholesterol depletion the relationship between amounts of nms versus ms is altered.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Substitution of Cholesterol by a Methylated Sterol, Lophenol, Leads to Dauer Larva Formation in the Second Generation</title><p>To test how nms influence dauer larva formation, we grew worms on plates with all cholesterol replaced by the methylated sterol lophenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). When eggs from normally grown hermaphrodites were placed on lophenol plates, the first generation of worms was indistinguishable from that grown on cholesterol. They had normal brood size and normal morphology. In the second generation, however, the entire population completed two molts and became dauer larvae despite sufficient food and low population density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g003">3</xref>B). Even on plates with a single worm, the individual developed into a dauer larva. These dauer larvae formed on lophenol plates had the distinct skinny shape, their pharynx was constricted, and they had very rare pharyngeal contractions, as detected earlier for dauer larvae formed by starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Keane1">Keane and Avery 2003</xref>). Electron microscopy showed that they had the characteristic alae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) and striations of the normal dauer cuticle (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g003">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g003">3</xref>E). They were also resistant to SDS treatment like normal dauer larvae. These results show that, like cholesterol starvation, growth on lophenol leads to dauer larva formation. Unlike cholesterol starvation, however, lophenol allows shedding of the L2 cuticle to form normal dauer larvae.</p><p>The formation of dauer larvae by growth on 13 &#x003bc;M lophenol was prevented completely by adding cholesterol or its immediate precursor, lathosterol (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), in amounts as low as 20 nM. Under these conditions all the worms matured to fertile adults. The presence of contaminating nms in plates could be the reason why others did not find dauer larvae when worms were grown on lophenol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Merris1">Merris et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>The dauer larvae formed on lophenol plates resumed normal growth when transferred to cholesterol plates, although it required 3&#x02013;4 d for them to reinitiate development, in contrast to the typical 15 h for normal dauer larvae.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Methylation of the Fourth Position of Sterols Is Not Obligatory for Dauer Larva Formation</title><p>The observation that small amounts of nms can prevent dauer larva formation on lophenol suggests that the lack of a cholesterol derivative which cannot be produced from lophenol is causing dauer larva formation. However, it is possible that lophenol itself actively induces dauer larva formation and methylation of sterols in the 4&#x003b1; position is necessary for this process. In order to distinguish between these alternatives we synthesised 5&#x003b1;-cholestan-3&#x003b2;-ols with a methyl group or fluorine substituted in 4&#x003b1; position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and fed them to worms. We decided to use saturated sterols because they are much more easily accessible for chemical synthesis (for details of synthesis, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). Cholestanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) and lophanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) have similar effects on growth as their homologues cholesterol and lophenol, respectively. The former supports reproductive growth, whereas the latter induces dauer formation. Remarkably, when fed with 4&#x003b1;F-cholestanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), worms in the second generation produced dauer larvae. Fluorinated compounds, except in very rare cases, are not susceptible to chemical modifications by living organisms and therefore 4&#x003b1;F-cholestanol cannot be methylated. The fluorine atom is less bulky than the methyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g004">Figure 4</xref>, space-filling models) and differs from the latter in its chemical properties. Thus, it is not the methylation of a sterol in the fourth position per se that is required for the formation of a dauer larva, but rather its accessibility is necessary to prevent this process. We suggest that cholesterol is normally metabolised in two distinct pathways: a pathway forming lophenol, and a pathway forming a steroid hormone. This hormone is required for maintaining reproductive growth and cannot be produced from ms.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Partial Purification of Gamravali, an Activity That Promotes Reproduction</title><p>The effect of lophenol on growth gave us a unique opportunity to purify the hormone (activity) required for reproductive growth. The rationale of our approach was to rescue the formation of dauer larvae induced in the presence of lophenol by a substance derived from a lipidic extract of worms. Obviously, this substance should differ from cholesterol and its direct metabolites such as 7-dehydrocholesterol and lathosterol. The lipidic extract of worms (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) was fractionated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reverse-phase C<sub>18</sub> column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), and fractions mixed with lophenol were fed to L1 larvae of the second generation that were grown on lophenol. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, two major peaks of activity rescuing dauer larva formation were detected. The major peak, according to retention times (23&#x02013;30 min), should contain cholesterol, lathosterol, and 7-dehydrocholesterol. Another peak at the beginning of the gradient, however, is much more hydrophilic than major metabolic sterols. Two observations argue that this fraction is not contaminated by dietary cholesterol: (i) This region of the gradient never displayed activity even if the column was overloaded with cholesterol, and (ii) in contrast to cholesterol, active fraction #2 did not support reproductive growth alone, and instead many worms engulfed by the old cuticle were observed. This may be because another cholesterol-derived substance responsible for molting was missing.</p><p>We name this activity gamravali (from gamravleba, which means &#x0201c;reproduction&#x0201d; in Georgian; gamravali means &#x0201c;something supporting the reproduction&#x0201d;) because it is required for reproduction in worms. Currently we are attempting to determine the molecular formula of gamravali using mass spectroscopy. This task, however, is very demanding because of the tiny amounts of the substance in worms. Even more demanding will be the final identification of the structure by nuclear magnetic resonance or X-ray analysis. We estimated that the latter might require scaling of the preparation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) up to more than two orders of magnitude.</p><p>Our data indicate that gamravali is much more hydrophilic than sterols. Remarkably, retention times on the column of many mammalian steroids tested (pregnenolone, &#x003b2;-estradiol, testosterone, etc.) and the insect molting hormone ecdysone are very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Thus, gamravali could be a polyhydroxylated sterol such as ecdysone, lack the hydrophobic side chain as in mammalian steroid hormones, or even contain a charged group. However, none of the compounds mentioned above or other commercially available steroids could rescue dauer formation in the presence of lophenol (see a list of tested compounds in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>A Mutant of <italic>daf-12</italic> Can Grow and Reproduce Normally on Lophenol for Many Generations, Whereas Several Daf-d Mutants Produce Dauer Larvae</title><p>The effect of lophenol on growth also made it possible to identify steps of the dauer formation pathway at which gamravali is required.

Moreover, it has been proposed that DAF-16 inhibits DAF-9, a cytochrome P450 that could be involved in the synthesis and/or degradation of a gamravali-like ligand for DAF-12. Consequently, gamravali should be required downstream of DAF-16 function. However, our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g006">Figure 6</xref>) imply that, in addition to the regulation of sterol biosynthesis, DAF-16 acts downstream of DAF-12 and is involved in the differentiation of dauer larvae.</p><p>Under reproductive conditions, DAF-16 is found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas upon activation by the IGF-1 or the TGF-&#x003b2; pathways the protein is accumulated in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Henderson1">Henderson and Johnson 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Lee1">Lee et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Lin2">Lin et al. 2001</xref>).

This effect is attributed to the activation of DAF-16 in a <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant, since a double <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> mutant suppresses this phenotype. Does the nuclear accumulation of DAF-16 in neurons when grown on lophenol have a similar effect on life span and thermotolerance? In wild-type worms of the first generation grown on cholesterol or lophenol we could not detect significant differences in the mean life span (21.0 &#x000b1; 1.8 d and 20.3 &#x000b1; 1.6 d for cholesterol and lophenol, respectively). It must be noted, however, that worms grown in the absence of cholesterol and the presence of lophenol do not have a developmental phenotype in the first generation and therefore may have some maternal rescue of adult life span. Because the second generation does not grow to adulthood (forms dauer larvae), the definitive experiment cannot be performed. Growth on lophenol also had no influence on the intrinsic thermotolerance of worms at 39 &#x000b0;C. Thus, the activation of DAF-16 induced by the absence of gamravali might have different physiological consequences than its activation by diminished IGF-1 signalling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Worms Need Tiny Amounts of Sterols for Survival</title><p>In our attempts to understand the role of cholesterol in nematodes we developed strict sterol-free conditions for growth by combination of the extraction of agarose with organic solvents and the growing of bacteria on defined media. Under these conditions, the first generation of worms grew relatively normally and only the second generation arrested as dauer-like larvae. Thus, the amount of sterols deployed by mothers into embryos is sufficient not only for the survival of the first generation but even for the embryonic development of about 130 embryos that reach the L2 stage in the second generation. This makes cholesterol unlikely to be an indispensable structural component in most worm membranes, although it could play a structural role in cell types where it is concentrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020280-Matyash1">Matyash et al. 2001</xref>).

We propose the following model to explain these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020280-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Gamravali derived from cholesterol acts to promote reproduction and prevent dauer larva formation by inhibiting the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12. The effect of external signals that induce dauer formation, starvation, and overcrowding is to prevent gamravali production, thus preventing reproduction and promoting entry into diapause. According to this model, growth on lophenol resembles the absence of gamravali. Although it is formally possible that lophenol or ms derived from it could induce dauer formation, this is unlikely for three reasons: (i) Dauer larvae are not induced in the first generation on lophenol, (ii) cholesterol and gamravali at concentrations less than 1/600 that of lophenol prevent dauer larva formation, and (iii) the 4&#x003b1;-fluoro derivative can substitute for lophenol. It is much more likely that lophenol supports all the functions of cholesterol, structural and hormonal, except promoting reproductive growth, since <italic>daf-12</italic> null mutants grow and reproduce normally on lophenol.
