CML is a myeloproliferative syndrome characterized by an indolent chronic phase (CP) with an overgrowing mature myeloid cell population, which is, if not treated, inevitably followed by an acute phase, the so-called blast crisis (BC). Clinically, BC resembles acute leukemia, with a poor prognosis and resistance to therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007661-Faderl1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007661-Radich1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, Ph<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ALL is an acute disease from onset and is characterized by blasts that are blocked, in the majority of cases, at the pre-lymphatic stage of differentiation.

The factors that determine the evolution of CML, as well as the biological differences between CML and Ph<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ALL, are almost completely unknown.</p><p>t(9;22) is usually a reciprocal translocation. A portion of chromosome 9 fuses to chromosome 22 (der22), thereby replacing a fragment of chromosome 22, which in turn fuses to chromosome 9 (der9). The cytogenetic correlate of der22 is the so-called Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). On chromosome 22, t(9;22) involves the <italic>bcr</italic> (breakpoint cluster region) gene locus. Two principal breaks occur: the (major) M-bcr, between exons 12 and 16, and the (minor) m-bcr, in the first intron of <italic>bcr</italic>. The breakpoint on chromosome 9 is consistently located in intron 1 of the <italic>abl</italic> gene locus. On der22, M-bcr leads to the creation of p210<italic><sup>BCR/ABL</sup></italic>, which is the hallmark of CML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007661-Faderl1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The Ph<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ALL-related p185<italic><sup>BCR/ABL</sup></italic> transcript is constant because the m-bcr breakpoint maps within an intron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007661-Faderl1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Although m-BCR (p185<italic><sup>BCR/ABL</sup></italic>-positive) is sporadically found in CML, it is considered to be specific for Ph<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ALL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007661-Barnes1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>abl/bcr</italic> fusion genes on der9 mainly differ in the specific breakpoint on chromosome 22. M-bcr results in the &#x0201c;small&#x0201d; <italic>abl/bcr</italic>, which encodes a &#x0201c;small&#x0201d; ABL/BCR transcript that is detectable in 65&#x00025; of patients suffering from CML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007661-Melo2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The resulting ABL/BCR fusion protein has a theoretical molecular mass of 40 kDa - p40<italic><sup>ABL/BCR</sup></italic>. The fusion between m-bcr and abl leads to a &#x0201c;large&#x0201d; transcript, which is present in 100&#x00025; of examined patients with m-BCR Ph&#x0002b; ALL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007661-Melo3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

In normal cells, ABL kinase activity is finely regulated in response to growth factors and other stimuli. Through fusion to BCR, ABL becomes constitutively activated.

The lack of increased replating efficiency can be explained by the fact that, in contrast to p40<italic><sup>ABL/BCR</sup></italic> and p96<italic><sup>ABL/BCR</sup></italic>, p185<italic><sup>BCR/ABL</sup></italic> up-regulated Cdkn1a expression and did not up-regulate Wnt-signaling or HoxB4 expression. The up-regulation of Cdkn1a together with the down-regulation of c-Myc likely contributes to the maintenance of stem cell capacity by p185<italic><sup>BCR/ABL</sup></italic>.

From our data, p96<italic><sup>ABL/BCR</sup></italic>seems to be the stronger oncogene as compared to p40<italic><sup>ABL/BCR</sup></italic> because of its capacity to increase the replating efficiency and stem cell capacity of primitive HSC.

This attribute may be the basis for the clinical relevance of the reciprocal t(9;22) fusion proteins, as they could maintain key signaling pathways, such as Rac signaling, upon effective inhibition of BCR/ABL kinase activity. In this way, the ABL/BCRs could play an important role in the grade of response to kinase inhibitors that target BCR/ABL. The capacity of ABL/BCR to autonomously induce leukemia suggests that the presence of p40<italic><sup>ABL/BCR</sup></italic> or p96<italic><sup>ABL/BCR</sup></italic> contributes to the maintenance of a leukemic subpopulation upon inhibition of BCR/ABL by ATP-analogues such as Imatinib, Dasatinib or Nilotinib, a scenario of particular importance in Ph&#x0002b; ALL.

Expression of both PAX5 and E2A is essential for B cell lineage commitment. The critical contribution of PAX5 to lineage selection is illustrated by loss-of-function studies. In its absence, pro-B cells assume a multipotential phenotype and differentiate (under appropriate growth factor conditions) to T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils or erythroid precursors. Conditional PAX5 deletion results in the retrodifferentiation of B cells to an uncommitted progenitor cell stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007661-Cobaleda1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, E2A expression is essential for B cell lineage commitment. Similar to B cell progenitors that lack Pax5, E2A-deficient cells reconstitute T cell, natural killer cell, myeloid, dendritic and erythroid lineages, but not B cells, following transfer into lethally irradiated mice. Interestingly, similar to the reported multipotency of B cell progenitors that lack Pax5, E2A-deficient cells possess stem-cell-like properties, including the expression of genes that are normally associated with non-B cell lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007661-Hagman1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

The mechanism by which BCR/ABL down-regulates PAX5 and E2A is most likely related to up-regulation of ID2. ID2 likely has other effects in addition to its ability to down-regulate PAX5.
