Here, we approached the problem in non-transgenic models by intracerebral injection of adeno-associated viral vectors to express protein tau or amyloid precursor protein in the hippocampus in vivo. AAV-APP mutant caused neuronal accumulation of amyloid peptides, and eventually amyloid plaques at 6 months post-injection, but with only marginal hippocampal cell-death. In contrast, AAV-Tau, either wild-type or mutant P301L, provoked dramatic degeneration of pyramidal neurons in CA1/2 and cortex within weeks. Tau-mediated neurodegeneration proceeded without formation of large fibrillar tau-aggregates or tangles, but with increased expression of cell-cycle markers.</p><p>We present novel AAV-based models, which demonstrate that protein tau mediates pyramidal neurodegeneration in vivo.

Post-translational, dynamic regulation of microtubule-binding is thought to occur by phosphorylation of tau at various serine/threonine residues by various kinases, including GSK3, cdk5, and MARK, among others.

With ageing, amyloid peptides accumulate and aggregate, eventually becoming deposited in parenchym and vasculature, even in cognitive normal individuals as is emerging from clinical imaging studies. How and why accumulating amyloid peptides cause tauopathy, and thereby AD in some individuals and not in others, remains to be explained by genetic and environmental factors acting at the cellular, i.e. neuronal level. The relation between the two defining pathologies in AD, and their relative contribution to cognitive defects, clinical symptoms, neurodegeneration, brain atrophy and dementia remains subject to academic debate, obscures early diagnosis and hinders development of effective therapy.</p><p>Transgenic mice have been invaluable for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying amyloid peptide generation, but amyloid mice lack two major pathological features of AD, i.e. tauopathy and neuro-degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-VanLeuven1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Roberson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

This is not unexpected, and in line with many studies on human brain and in experimental models, supporting the conviction that variable combinations of phosphorylations of protein tau underlie its neurotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Lee1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Terwel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Gtz1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Morrissette1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Andorfer1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. By logical extension, not a single kinase but combined actions of several kinases are to be hold responsible for phosphorylating tau to make it eventually harmful to neurons. Moreover, the sets of phospho-epitopes and of kinases most likely will vary pending the affected brain region, i.e. the disorder. Because tauopathies vary widely in their clinical, pathological and biochemical characteristics, the molecular identification of a unique, unifying neurotoxic tau-species becomes more and more unlikely.</p><p>We first and foremost consider important the only known physiological function of protein tau, i.e. binding to microtubules. If phosphorylated protein tau fails to stabilize microtubules, or affects microtubule dynamics, a dysfunctional cytoskeleton with axonal, dendritic and synaptic defects as results. The observed changes in cytoarchitecture in degenerating neurons, support the hypothesis that they contribute to the overall process. The experimental data obtained with truncated Tau255 most strongly imply that microtubule binding of protein tau is essential in inflicting neurodegeneration and involve the microtubular network as a structural and transport scaffold. The alternative explanation, i.e. that wild-type and mutant full-length Tau but not truncated Tau255 interact with cellular proteins other than microtubuli, remains open for experimental verification.</p><p>We went on to define the underlying mechanism of tau-mediated neurodegeneration by analysis of a large and wide panel of molecular targets and pathways, conform the hypothesis that neurons do not die by a single mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Melino1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cyclins D1, D2, D3 with cdk4 and cdk6, regulate G1/S transition by releasing E2F transcription factors via increased phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. The latter is here also demonstrated in degenerating pyramidal neurons expressing protein Tau. Upregulation of cyclinB1 also points to the G2/M checkpoint, which depends on cdk2/cyclinB1 activity. Both cyclinD2 and cyclinB1 have been shown to mark cell-cycle events in AD brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Hoozemans1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

Rather, or alternatively, the contribution of the cell-cycle to neurodegeneration would be by multi-point or by fragmented reentry attempts, whereby cyclinD2 is not the decisive factor, or is made redundant by cyclins D1 and D3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Kowalczyk1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Among candidate factors that could force post-mitotic neurons to re-enter the cell-cycle are mitogenic factors from the MAPK family, e.g. p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2), p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK. While JNK/SAPK was not detected and p44/42 MAPK was observed in glial cells, only p38 MAPK was markedly increased in degenerating neurons in AAV-tau mice. Similarly, whereas Akt/PKB is a central regulator of metabolism, apoptosis, transcription and cell-cycle, this kinase appeared not activated in the AAV-Tau model.</p><p>From the many markers analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007280.s009">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007280.s010">S2</xref>) we conclude that the strongest indications support the hypothesis that neurons degenerate because of their attempts to re-enter the cell-cycle. Nevertheless, other markers are observed and proposed to contribute, not in the least microgliosis, as discussed below. Activated microglia are spatially and temporally closely associated with degenerating neurons in the AAV-tau models, strongly resembling the pathological characteristics of mice with hippocampal and cortical sclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Muyllaert1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The relevance for human disease: tauopathies and AD</title><p>The rapid and dramatic neurodegeneration inflicted by protein tau contrasts with the minimal neurotoxic effects sorted by the mutant APP.SLA under the same experimental conditions. Only marginal neuro-degeneration resulted despite important accumulation of amyloid peptides that led even at 6 months p.i. to amyloid plaques in hippocampus and cortex. This marked dissociation in outcome by the same experimental approach, corroborates the growing awareness that neurodegeneration in AD is not mediated primarily or directly by amyloid. The essential contribution of protein tau to pyramidal cell-death is thereby joined seamlessly to the primary tauopathies. Consequently, tau pathology is essential and decisive, together with amyloid, in the overall pathogenesis of AD, notwithstanding its pathological classification as a &#x02018;secondary tauopathy&#x02019;.</p><p>We adhere the hypothesis that in AD the accumulation of amyloid is the trigger, but that protein tau executes specified neurons. The transgenic models for amyloid and tau pathology have not, however, substantiated this hypothesis to the fullest, although they have been invaluable for understanding molecular mechanisms of amyloid peptide generation, amyloid pathology, repercussions on cognition and behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Dewachter1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Morrissette1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Both are sinks for mis-folded, aggregated, indigestible peptides or proteins. Whereas such detoxification by aggregation and deposition can be effective as a short-term strategy, it eventually becomes futile and then aggravates the pathology, particularly in humans with their long life-span. Of note, the view on tauopathy is evolving very analogous as that on amyloid pathology in AD: the emphasis shifts from large visible deposits, i.e. amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, to smaller molecular entities, i.e. amyloid- and tau-oligomers. A similar evolution is evident in other neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p>The combined transgenic and AAV-models allow us to propose confidently that the link between amyloid, tau pathology and neurodegeneration does not involve directly the formation or repercussions of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Rather, these are the products of dead-end escape-routes whereby cells, in the case of AD pyramidal neurons in limbic brain regions, attempt to limit the negative impact of accumulating misfolded and aggregated proteins that cannot be properly handled by normal cellular proteolytic degradation mechanisms, i.e. endosomal, lysosomal, auto-phagosomal, proteasomal, &#x02026; It is then not surprising to see many of these involved in, or attained by, the amyloid or tau pathology.</p><p>Although tauopathy with tangles is and remains the post-mortem pathological hallmark that is co-diagnostic for AD, the genetic evidence of <italic>Tau</italic> mutations in familial primary tauopathies has promoted tauopathy to be mechanistically relevant and important. Experimental evidence in vivo that was largely lacking is convincingly provided by the current AAV-models.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>AAV versus transgenic models</title><p>A final important point concerns the question why AAV-based models are more powerful in producing neuro-degeneration than transgenic models expressing the same wild-type Tau4R isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Spittaels1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> or Tau.P301L mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Terwel2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> at similar near-physiological levels. These transgenic models suffer axonopathy and tauopathy, respectively, but without appreciable neurodegeneration.</p><p>Although data to answer this problem do not abound, we consider as major difference the observed microgliosis that is much more intense in the AAV-Tau model than in the AAV-APP mice. Microgliosis is spatially and temporally most closely associated with degenerating neurons in the AAV-tau models. This is strongly reminiscent of our observations in inducible p25 mice that suffer a profound hippocampal and cortical sclerosis with pathological characteristics very similar to the AAV-Tau mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Muyllaert1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therein, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of aged rats was also directly associated with microgliosis, lending support to our assumption that microgliosis contributes essentially to neurodegeneration. Whereas also the viral vectors used as delivery tool, can be of some importance, they are evidently not decisive because neurodegeneration is specific for AAV-tau, wild-type and mutant, and was lacking in AAV-APP and AAV-EGFP mice, observed here and as observed in other models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Shevtsova1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Klein1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Aspects that are important to explain the apparently contradictory outcome in different models, relate to differences in time-scale and/or kinetics whereby neurons either degenerate or whereby tau aggregates and &#x02018;sinks&#x02019; into tangles. It is evident that various post-translational modifications, e.g. phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, glycation, O-glucosylation, &#x02026; can and will contribute to either mechanism. The overall process is complex and implies enzymes, i.e. proteinases, kinases, phosphatases, &#x02026; but also cellular factors like chaperones and heat-shock proteins. Their structural features and dynamic actions will tilt the balance to either slow death by progressive accumulation of aggregated, undigested or undigestible amyloid and/or protein tau, or to faster death by cell-cycle re-entry, accelerated by microglia derived pro-inflammatory neurotoxic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Arnaud1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, the tau-species that are responsible for aggregation and neurotoxicity are proposed to differ at the molecular level.

Those findings are relevant for the possible cell-to-cell spreading of tauopathy in brain and imply an extracellular route, which is to be defined for the cytoplasmic protein tau. Nevertheless, the time-scale of spreading was very slow and resulted in typical tauopathy with aggregates and tangles, while neuro-degeneration was minimal or absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Clavaguera1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Thereby, that model conforms to the tauopathy as observed in the parental tau.P301S transgenic mice that have no neurodegeneration in limbic regions.</p><p>In conclusion, we present in vivo experimental evidence for a major problem in tauopathies: effective modeling of pyramidal neurodegeneration that is mediated by protein tau.4R, which is responsible for the majority of human tauopathies, including all Alzheimer patients. We further delineate two major mechanisms that contribute to the rapid neurodegeneration mediated by AAV-Tau: attempted cell-cycle re-entry by the post-mitotic neurons, and microgliosis. We are confident that these innovative models will contribute considerably to unravel the molecular factors and mechanistic details. Importantly, the ease whereby the AAV-vectors and the models can be implemented widely in research-projects on neurodegeneration is a further strong point of this report. The wider distribution of the model, and its application for analysis of mechanisms that will untangle tau-mediated neurodegeneration, is hoped to help meet the needs of patients suffering from primary tauopathies or Alzheimer's disease.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of AAV-vectors</title><p>Human cDNA of wild-type and mutant P301L in the longest tau isoform (Tau4R/2N) was used as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Terwel2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Terwel3">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Spittaels1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007280-Spittaels2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.
