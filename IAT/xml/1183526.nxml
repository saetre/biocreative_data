As a consequence of intracellular lipid trafficking defects, patients with Niemann-Pick type C, and mice with the same disease, lose an important class of cerebellar neurons called Purkinje cells (PCs). Npc1 (the protein coded by <italic>npc1</italic>) might be needed in other cell types to produce substances that nourish PCs or within the PCs themselves. To see which is true, the researchers constructed genetically mosaic mice in which some cells have mutant Npc1 and some have normal Npc1 function. In the cerebella of these mosaic mice, PCs lacking Npc1 continued to die even while surrounded by normal cells, while normal PCs appeared unaffected by their partially mutant surroundings. From these findings, the researchers concluded that the neurodegeneration is due to a problem within PCs and not due to a lack of supporting factors provided by other cells or an extrinsic toxic or inflammatory insult. Npc1 probably functions within PCs to allow critical transport processes necessary for cell survival. The researchers also found that the degenerating PCs undergo a complex process called autophagy in which the cells sense a lack of key nutrients and start to break down their own structures to feed themselves. By identifying exactly which cells require Npc1 function, the researchers set the stage for investigating the exact molecular roles of Npc1 protein in the cells where it is most needed.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Ko DC, Milenkovic L, Beier SM, Manuel H, Buchanan J, et al.

The clinical presentation typically includes progressive ataxia, dystonia, and dementia, first presenting in early childhood and ultimately leading to death in the early teens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;. NPC is one of over 40 known lysosomal storage disorders (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;), which collectively have an incidence of one in 8,000 live births &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The specific molecules that accumulate in each disease vary, but most of the disorders share the feature of prominent neurological symptoms. Though great progress has been made in characterizing the biochemical and genetic defects in these diseases, the pathways that lead from these defects to cell and tissue dysfunction are inadequately understood.</p><p>The decline in neurological function in NPC patients is caused by mutations in either the <italic>npc1</italic> or <italic>npc2</italic> gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b05">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

The Npc1 protein has a sequence related to the &#x0201c;sterol sensing domain&#x0201d; of known regulators of cholesterol metabolism (SCAP and HMG-CoA reductase) and Patched, a receptor for the secreted developmental signaling protein Hedgehog. The exact role of Npc1 in regulating lipid homeostasis and in maintaining neurological function is far from clear.

The most striking and well-documented histological change in <italic>npc1</italic> mice is the progressive loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Stereotactic cell counting confirmed that the PC is the type that exhibits the greatest percentage loss in <italic>npc1</italic> mice (&#x0003c;10&#x00025; remaining at 10 wk) but surprisingly revealed that glia in the corpus callosum have a greater early reduction in number (48&#x00025; for glia versus 13&#x00025; for PCs, at 3 wk) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, it is unclear which cells in the brain require Npc1 protein and why PCs degenerate in mice lacking Npc1.</p><p>Four broad categories of possible explanations for the PC degeneration have emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010007-g001">Figure 1</xref>). (1) Npc1 is required within PCs and loss of the protein results in degeneration as a consequence of the toxic accumulation of lipids. High concentrations of unesterified cholesterol can cause cell death by altering membrane rigidity, forming intracellular crystals that may interfere with organelle function, or triggering apoptotic signaling events &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. (2) Npc1 is required within PCs and loss of the protein causes a deficiency at specific subcellular locations. In this model, the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids is not harmful per se, but the diminished capacity to transport these or other molecules to the correct places within the cell leads to degeneration. (3) Npc1 is required within glia or another cell type within the cerebellum, or in a distant organ such as a secretory gland, and loss of the protein results in degeneration of PCs through a deficiency in a secreted molecule. This could be a trophic factor or possibly even cholesterol itself, as studies have shown that glia-derived cholesterol is required for synaptogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;. (4) Loss of Npc1 function results in the release of toxic/pro-inflammatory compounds into the local environment or systemic circulation, causing PC degeneration.</p><fig id="pgen-0010007-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Models of PC Degeneration in <italic>npc1</italic> Mice</title><p>Four basic mechanisms are depicted. (1) The accumulation of cholesterol, sphingolipids, or other molecules within PCs lacking Npc1 could be toxic. (2) Loss of Npc1 function could cause a block in trafficking that leads to a localized subcellular deficiency in lipids and/or proteins. (3) Other cells, most likely glia, could produce a secreted factor, such as apoE-cholesterol or a trophic factor required for PC survival, whose export is reduced or blocked without Npc1 function. (4) Any cell type in the <italic>npc1</italic> mouse could produce toxic metabolites, such as released lysosomal hydrolases or beta amyloid, that could kill surrounding cells or particularly susceptible cell types regardless of genotype.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0010007.g001"/></fig><p>In this study, we employed chimeric mice to help resolve the fundamental mystery of why neurons degenerate in NPC disease.

Bergmann glia appose the PC soma and extend processes into the molecular layer that sheaths the PC dendritic trees (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b25">25</xref>&#x0005d;). Loss or dysfunction of these glia could precede and precipitate the PC loss. In contrast to the degeneration and loss of PCs, Bergmann glia stained with anti-S100&#x003b2; maintain their density and their characteristic radial morphology, even at 70 d, in all lobules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010007-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Oligodendrocytes, the glia that myelinate axons, were normal in distribution and cell body morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010007-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Staining of myelin revealed axonal spheroids as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010007-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Granule cells, the most abundant neurons in the cerebellum, were also grossly normal based on anti-GABA&#x003b1;6 staining (data not shown). This indicates that loss of PCs in <italic>npc1</italic> mice is not due secondarily to a loss or other obvious morphological derangement of these other cell types. However, these observations do not rule out the possibility that a more subtle dysfunction in these cells contributes to the degeneration of PCs in <italic>npc1</italic>mice.</p><p>The anterior-to-posterior gradient of PC loss provides the opportunity to determine how cholesterol accumulation changes in relation to the PCs. If intracellular cholesterol accumulation is toxic to PCs, a correlation is expected between the amount of cholesterol and the rate or severity of degeneration. Instead, we find that at 30 d, intracellular cholesterol accumulation is noted even in lobule X PCs (which do not degenerate during the normal <italic>npc1</italic> mouse life span). We did not find any consistent difference in filipin staining of cholesterol among the different cerebellar lobules in <italic>npc1</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010007-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Therefore, lysosomal cholesterol accumulation per se is not sufficient to explain the pattern of PC death.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>PC Degeneration in <italic>npc1</italic> Mice Is Cell-Autonomous</title><p>To determine whether PC loss is due to dysfunction within the PCs, alterations in the surrounding glia and microenvironment, or a combination of both, we generated mice containing a mixture of <italic>npc1</italic> mutant and wild-type cells. Morulas derived from mating <italic>npc1</italic> heterozygotes (BALB/c <italic>npc<sup>nih</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic>) and from matings of wild-type mice homozygous for a ubiquitously expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (FVB.Cg-Tg(GFPU)5Nagy/J; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d;) were aggregated to form chimeric embryos.

Although fluctuation in how small numbers of wild-type cells are distributed and consequent variability among analyzed sections provide a likely explanation, another interpretation is that when very few wild-type cells are present, the entire cerebellum begins to break down during the late stages of cerebellar degeneration. Toxins released by dying cells could contribute to PC loss but are clearly not the main cause of neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Other Histologic Features of <italic>npc1</italic> Chimeric Mice</title><p>Examination of the relationships of other cell types to the PCs in the chimeras provides further evidence for the cell-autonomous nature of PC degeneration.

Microglia are the phagocytic cells of the central nervous system, and their presence is indicative of an inflammatory process. The appearance of microglia within the cerebellum follows the anterior&#x02013;posterior pattern of PC death. In wild-type mice or <italic>npc1</italic> mutant mice at 30 d, almost no microglia are observed (data not shown). In 50-d-old <italic>npc1</italic> mutant mice, very few microglia are present in lobule X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010007-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The other cerebellar lobules have numerous microglia in the white matter tract and granule cell layer prior to the loss of PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010007-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). After more extensive PC loss (lobules I&#x02013;IV at 50 d and I&#x02013;IX at 70 d), microglia also appear in the molecular and PC layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010007-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Thus, the arrival of microglia coincides with PC loss. However, the infiltration of numerous microglia is not sufficient to trigger PC degeneration. Microglia were present in all the chimeric mice (though to a lesser extent in mice sacrificed at a later age) and were in close proximity to wild-type PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010007-g004">Figure 4</xref>D, white arrows). Despite this close association, there was no decrease in wild-type PC density in the chimeras except the two noted above. Furthermore, if nonspecific microglial killing of PCs were the main mechanism of PC loss, then wild-type and mutant PCs should demonstrate comparable decline percentages. This is not the case in any of the chimeras.</p><fig id="pgen-0010007-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Other Histological Characteristics in the <italic>npc1</italic> Mutant and Chimeric Mice</title><p>(A&#x02013;C) Microglia characteristics.

For most neurodegenerative diseases, how much neuronal loss can be attributed to cell-autonomous versus non-cell-autonomous factors is unknown. We examined this crucial question in the neurodegenerative disorder NPC.</p><p>People born with NPC disease undergo a progressive decline in neurological function that can include ataxia, tremor, dystonia, dementia, and seizures. As the prominent ataxia would suggest, cerebellar involvement, including PC degeneration, has been well documented &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b49">49</xref>&#x0005d;. The mouse model of NPC faithfully recapitulates many of the human symptoms, and PC loss serves as an easily quantifiable measure of neurodegeneration. The involvement of circulating molecules such as steroids and sterols, and the ubiquitous expression of both NPC genes, make determining when and where the NPC genes are required a key first step in understanding neurodegeneration. A previous study highlighted the importance of events within the central nervous system, as expression of Npc1 driven by the prion promoter could prevent neurodegeneration even without complete rescue of the liver phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study we have found that the most prominent neurodegenerative event, the death of the PCs, is due to lost Npc1 function within those cells and to a distinctive programmed cellular response, autophagy.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Cell-Autonomous PC Death in NPC Disease</title><p>We have demonstrated that the loss of PCs in the mouse model of NPC, which has a mutant <italic>npc1</italic> gene, is primarily a cell-autonomous defect. This finding places constraints on possible mechanisms of PC degeneration in NPC disease, and allows future investigations to focus on the cell type that matters. As is described in the introduction, several lines of evidence hinted that neurodegeneration in NPC disease could be a non-cell-autonomous process. However, the inability of a wild-type milieu, including surrounding wild-type glia, to prevent <italic>npc1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> PC loss indicates that the degeneration of PCs is not due to the loss of a secreted factor such as glia-derived sterols, neurotrophins, or Npc2 protein. Consistent with this, two very recent studies failed to detect a difference in levels of secretion of cholesterol from wild-type versus <italic>npc1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> glia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b51">51</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition to surrounding glial cells, the health of PCs could be affected by their axonal targets in the cerebellar deep nuclei. Expression of GFP is very low in neurons of the cerebellar deep nuclei in the GFP mice (data not shown), so we were unable to assess the genotype of these cells in the chimeras. During the migration of PCs, their axons do not remain attached to their future post-synaptic targets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b52">52</xref>&#x0005d;. If PC death in <italic>npc1</italic> mice was caused by loss of a target-derived factor, then the absence of a genotypic match between target neurons and PCs would mean that wild-type and <italic>npc1</italic> PCs should be equally affected. This is not what we observe. In addition, completely depriving PCs of their axonal targets by axotomy does not cause PC degeneration even up to a year following axotomy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b54">54</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, derangement of cerebellar deep nuclei is unlikely to be causing PC degeneration in NPC.</p><p>Secreted or released toxic molecules are also not responsible for PC death.

A robust inflammatory response may play a role in the progressive neurodegeneration seen in NPC but is not the primary factor in causing neuronal loss: in the chimeric mice most wild-type PCs do not degenerate even while in the midst of numerous microglia. Our experiments do not exclude a more cell-specific role for microglia in PC death. Microglia could help trigger cell death by specific molecular interactions with susceptible PCs, as is proposed to occur during PC death normally seen at postnatal day 3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b58">58</xref>&#x0005d;. A microglia-based mechanism would require a cell-autonomous component&#x02014;PCs expressing the proper membrane receptors&#x02014;and a non-cell-autonomous component&#x02014;microglia to carry out the directed engulfment of only those cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Internal Factors in Neurodegeneration</title><p>PCs may degenerate either (1) because the buildup of sterols and other lipids, or other unknown substances, poisons the PCs or (2) because trafficking defects resulting from Npc1 loss affect cell survival. Although excess cholesterol can have toxic effects &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;, intracellular cholesterol levels within PCs do not correlate with the loss of these cells: lobule X PCs accumulate cholesterol and do not degenerate during the 70 d that normally constitute the <italic>npc1</italic> mouse life span. More subtle differences among lobules, in sterol mass or subcellular localization of cholesterol, are unlikely to be detected with filipin staining. In any case, blocking lipid accumulation is insufficient to slow neuronal loss, again arguing against the idea that cell death occurs because of accumulated lipid. Crossing the <italic>npc1</italic> mouse to a GalNAcT-knockout mouse unable to synthesize complex gangliosides decreases levels of sphingolipids and cholesterol without any effect on neurodegeneration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b59">59</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although both of these experiments have their weaknesses&#x02014;possible buildup of less complex sphingolipids in the GalNAcT experiment and possible redundancy in lipoprotein receptors in the low density lipoprotein receptor knockout&#x02014;the findings at least suggest that intracellular toxicity due to lipid accumulation is not the primary mechanism of PC death.</p><p>Defects in lipid trafficking are likely to have particularly detrimental effects on synthetic processes that rely on lipids as substrates. A recent study demonstrates that neurosteroid synthesis is reduced in <italic>npc1</italic> mice and administration of allopregnanolone increases life span and neuronal survival &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b61">61</xref>&#x0005d;. PC loss involving interference with production of neurosteroids acting in a paracrine or endocrine manner is untenable in light of our findings. An autocrine mechanism of action, with PCs making substances that act in the producing cell, is still plausible and needs to be explored further. PCs synthesize several different neurosteroids and express progesterone receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b62">62</xref>&#x0005d;. PCs are unique in having an extensive smooth ER, the &#x0201c;hypolemmal cisternae,&#x0201d; that is &#x0201c;so well developed in PCs that it may be considered a specific characteristic&#x02026;since it extends under the plasmalemma of the entire cell body, the dendritic tree, and the axon&#x0201d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b63">63</xref>&#x0005d;.

Apoptosis may also be involved in the death of neurons from NPC disease; both processes are likely at work in the degenerating NPC brain. In contrast to apoptosis, which has been demonstrated in many instances of neurodegeneration (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b31">31</xref>&#x0005d;), activated autophagy has been demonstrated in only a few cases, but notably including death of PCs in <italic>Lurcher</italic> mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b64">64</xref>&#x0005d;.

These neurodegenerative diseases differ from NPC in that they are disorders of protein aggregation. Formation of insoluble aggregates of Huntingtin or alpha-synuclein is an early event in disease progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b68">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b71">71</xref>&#x0005d;. Autophagy may be activated by cells in order to dispose of the aggregates. Deliberately enhancing degradation of protein aggregates by triggering autophagy in animal models of Huntington disease can ameliorate the affects of the disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b67">67</xref>&#x0005d;. No protein aggregation has been reported in NPC, but an analogous mechanism could be at work: during the first several weeks of life, cells may activate autophagy to degrade the abnormal lipid-laden lysosomes and allow the survival of PCs. If this is true, then cells with lipid-laden lysosomes should have high autophagic activity. This prediction is clearly contradicted by our data: activation of autophagy is seen only in older, degenerating PCs, and <italic>npc1</italic> cells not undergoing cell death do not exhibit increased levels of the autophagic marker LC3-II.</p><p>Why then is autophagy induced in degenerating PCs? Autophagy is a normal, cellular process that is regulated by nutritional status and by hormones. Loss of <italic>npc1</italic> leads to trapping of lipids within aberrant membrane compartments, and this may induce a &#x0201c;lipid-starvation response&#x0201d; analogous to the well-characterized autophagic response to amino acid deprivation. In fact, there is already evidence that such a response occurs in <italic>npc1</italic> homozygotes: despite the seeming overabundance of cholesterol in <italic>npc1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, the SREBP signaling pathway is activated. This results in increased cholesterol synthesis and low density lipoprotein receptor activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b72">72</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, NPC cells act as though they are &#x0201c;cholesterol starved.&#x0201d; NPC cells therefore may have three ways to adjust to a shortage of sterols and other lipids: increased lipid synthesis, increased lipid uptake, and autophagy. Microarray analysis of SREBP targets in liver &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b73">73</xref>&#x0005d; did not reveal increased transcription of autophagy genes, but the targets may differ between tissues, or regulation may occur at the post-transcriptional level. In NPC cells, the autophagic response would be futile since transport systems are damaged. Instead of rescuing the cell, autophagy would hasten cell death by further sequestering and reducing available lipids.</p><p>Destructive autophagy in NPC mutant PCs may also, or instead, be stimulated hormonally. In mammals, autophagy is inhibited by insulin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b74">74</xref>&#x0005d;, and in insects, steroids regulate autophagy of neurons by a cell-autonomous mechanism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b76">76</xref>&#x0005d;. In <italic>Manduca</italic> (tobacco hawkmoth) motor neurons and in salivary glands and fat body of <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the steroid ecdysone triggers autophagy at specific developmental time points. We would infer a different regulatory relationship in mammalian NPC. Neurosteroids might inhibit autophagy in PCs and when their synthesis is severely decreased, as in NPC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b61">61</xref>&#x0005d;, autophagic cell death might ensue.

The minimal ataxia phenotype, manifested as occasional falls off the balance beam while turning, stopped progressing by approximately 140 d. By this age, nearly all mutant PCs, including those in lobule X, had died. Presumably ataxia worsens until all mutant PCs die, at which point the phenotype stabilizes.</p><p>With so many PCs lost, other regions of the brain, other cerebellar cells, or the remaining PCs may compensate.

Of four possible mechanisms of PC loss (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010007-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the chimeric mice demonstrate that the two strictly non-cell-autonomous models are invalid.

We envision that in response to the proposed intracellular deficiency, cells compensate by increasing endogenous synthesis of cholesterol, by endocytosis, and/or by autophagy. In cells with a high lipid demand and insufficient supply, autophagy increases and cell death ensues. It may be that a similar series of events&#x02014;defective trafficking leading to subcellular deficiency and autophagic cell death&#x02014;occurs in many other lysosomal storage diseases. To our knowledge, Danon disease, caused by deficiency in the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-2, is the only other lysosomal storage disease that has a demonstrated increase in AVs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010007-b89">89</xref>&#x0005d;. The pattern of degeneration erupting in each disease would be determined by the cell-specific response to being deprived of a particular molecule or class of molecules.

The length of the PC layer was measured using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Downington, Pennsylvania, United States), and the density was determined by dividing the number of PCs by this length. Expected densities if no degeneration has occurred were calculated by multiplying the percentage of chimerism by the density of PCs observed in <italic>npc1</italic> mice at 30 d. PC densities in the three chimeric mice sacrificed at 70 d were also compared to expected densities with degeneration (calculated from the percentage of chimerism and the density of PCs observed in <italic>npc1</italic> mice at 70 d). <italic>p</italic>-Values were calculated with the unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, United States).</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>LC3 immunoblotting.</title><p>Cell extracts were obtained by solubilization with 2&#x00025; IGEPAL-CA630, 0.2&#x00025; SDS, and mini complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States) in PBS, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 min. Extracts were kept on ice and resolved with 15&#x00025; SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States), blocking was accomplished with 5&#x00025; milk in PBS plus 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100. Primary incubation with anti-LC3 (rabbit, 1:1,000 in 1&#x00025; milk PBST) was carried out overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. Following three washes, the membrane was incubated with anti-rabbit-HRP (1:10,000), washed three times, and developed with WestPico reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Illinois, United States).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Electron microscopy.</title><p>Mice were anesthetized using avertin and were perfused with PBS followed by a solution of 2.5&#x00025; glutaraldehyde and 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 15 min using gravity flow. For microwave processing, a Pelco laboratory microwave equipped with variable wattage, Cold Spot water recirculator, and vacuum chamber was used (Ted Pella, Mountain Lakes, California, United States). Brains were removed, immersed in the same fixative, and microwaved at 100 W for 1 min on, 1 min off, 1 min on, with the Cold Spot set at 15 &#x000b0;C. A vacuum chamber was applied and the brains microwaved at 450 W for 20 s on, 20 s off, 20 s on, three times. After an additional 15 min at room temperature, the cerebellum was dissected away and sliced into anterior and posterior samples. Post-fixation was carried out using 2&#x00025; osmium tetroxide containing 0.8&#x00025; potassium ferricyanide and 5&#x00025; sucrose in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) using the same microwave parameters as for primary fixation and followed by an additional 45 min at room temperature. After rinsing in distilled water, the tissue was dehydrated in an ascending alcohol (50&#x00025;&#x02013;95&#x00025;) series at 350 W for 45 s, then switched to 100&#x00025; ethanol under vacuum for 1 min on, 1 min off, 1 min on, three times. The tissue was microwaved in 100&#x00025; acetone for 1 min on, 1 min off, 1 min on, at power level 3 using the vacuum chamber. The tissue was then infiltrated in Epon-Araldite-acetone mixture in the microwave for 4 min on, 4 min off, 4 min on, at 350 W for each resin mixture (1:2, 1:1, 2:1) under vacuum. For the final infiltration, the samples were placed in 100&#x00025; resin and microwaved at 350 W under vacuum for 10 min on, 10 min off, 10 min on. The samples were embedded in fresh Epon-Araldite and hardened at 65 &#x000b0;C for 1&#x02013;2 d. Semi-thin sections (1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;m) were cut using a Histoknife (Diatome, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, United States) and stained with toludine blue. Thin sections (70 nm) were cut and mounted on formvar-coated multi-slot grids. Sections were post-stained with 5&#x00025; aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined at 80 kV in a JEOL (Tokyo, Japan) 1230 electron microscope. Digital images were captured with a Gatan (Pleasanton, California, United States) 967 slow-scan, cooled CCD camera. Images were analyzed with ImageJ Software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The OMIM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db&#x0003d;OMIM</ext-link>) accession number for NPC is 257220.
