We have previously reported that HIV-1 Tat can induce mitochondrial hyperpolarization in cortical neurons, thus compromising the ability of the neuron to buffer calcium and sustain energy production for normal synaptic communication. In this report, we demonstrate that Tat induces rapid loss of ER calcium mediated by the ryanodine receptor (RyR), followed by the unfolded protein response (UPR) and pathologic dilatation of the ER in cortical neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. RyR antagonism attenuated both Tat-mediated mitochondrial hyperpolarization and UPR induction. Delivery of Tat to murine CNS <italic>in vivo</italic> also leads to long-lasting pathologic ER dilatation and mitochondrial morphologic abnormalities. Finally, we performed ultrastructural studies that demonstrated mitochondria with abnormal morphology and dilated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in brain tissue of patients with HIV-1 inflammation and neurodegeneration. Collectively, these data suggest that abnormal RyR signaling mediates the neuronal UPR with failure of mitochondrial energy metabolism, and is a critical locus for the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 in the CNS.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) occurs rapidly after primary infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Davis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The phenotype of HIV associated dementia (HAD) after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed considerably with a more indolent time course, frequently characterized by waxing and waning neurologic deficits, suggesting a change in nomenclature to HIV-1 associated neurologic deficits (HAND) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Ellis1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus HAND continues to be a problem of pandemic proportions.</p><p>Since HIV-1 only infects CNS cell types that express the chemokine receptors CD3, CCR5 and/or CXCR4 (i.e. microglia, perivascular macrophages, and a restricted population of astrocytes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-vandeBovenkamp1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, structural damage with accompanying neurologic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Ozdener1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> occurs because of pathway activation that leads to release of inflammatory molecules such as nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), and platelet activating factor (PAF); changes in ambient recycling of glutamate by astrocytes; and the release of viral regulatory proteins, such as the trans activator of transcription protein (Tat) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Porcheray1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Perry1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and the envelope protein gp120 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Kaul1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. At the light microscopic level, the neuropathology of HIV-1 infection is notable for changes in the dendritic arbor with varicosities (&#x0201c;beading&#x0201d;&#x02013;13); accumulation of beta amyloid precursor protein (&#x003b2;-APP) in axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-An1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>; neuronal apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Gelbard1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-AdleBiassette1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>; and reactive astrocytosis, microgliosis, and multinucleated giant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Gendelman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, ultrastructural analyses of brain tissue from patients with HIV-1 infection have focused on changes in endothelial architecture, including thinning and vacuolization of the basal lamina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Weis1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, but no study has focused on changes in intracellular organelles or synaptic architecture of neurons.</p><p>Of the many HIV-induced neurotoxins, Tat is remarkable because it is actively released into the extracellular space by infected microglia, macrophages and astrocytes &#x0005b;10; 19&#x02013;21&#x0005d;. Unbound Tat has been detected in the sera of HIV<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> patients, reaching concentrations as high as 40 ng/mL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Xiao1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. It should be noted that this measurement is probably a gross underestimate of Tat's local concentration; Tat <italic>in vivo</italic> can be sequestered by endogenous glycosaminoglycans and heparin sulfates effectively lowering the detectable amounts of Tat circulating unbound. This observation lends credence to the notion that infiltrating microglia/macrophage adjacent to a synapse would have greatly increased local concentrations of Tat. However, once released from a cell Tat can enter virtually all neural cell types via its arginine-rich basic domain, termed the protein transduction domain (PTD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Frankel1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-DelGaizo1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Tat can modulate intracellular calcium concentrations through activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways in vulnerable neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-DelGaizo1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Haughey2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Protein folding in the ER relies on foldases, chaperones, and lectins that require high concentrations of calcium and an oxidized environment in order to perform properly (Schroder 2005, Wetmore 1996). This in turn raises the question of whether Tat can overwhelm the protein folding capacity of the ER and induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Murakami1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Induction of the UPR pathway is designed to reduce net protein translation and results in the up-regulation of a specific set of genes that function to relieve this stress. Phosphorylation of the transmembrane protein kinase&#x02013;like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is one of the initial events in the UPR pathway and is responsible for the downstream phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2&#x003b1; (eIF2&#x003b1;) that prevents 80S ribosome assembly, inhibiting protein translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Forman1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) can dimerize in conjunction with PERK phosphorylation and cleave the mRNA of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) to produce an active 54-kDa transcription factor that is responsible for maintaining the UPR pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Gass1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Zhang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. If the offending ER toxicant is eliminated, the UPR pathway shuts down and normal protein translation and folding resumes. Conversely, if the UPR pathway remains functionally active, the pro-apoptotic protein CHOP (CCAAT/enhance binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein) is up-regulated and the cell undergoes apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Williams1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our laboratory and others have previously described the phenomenon of mitochondrial hyperpolarization in cortical neurons after exposure to Tat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Perry2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and other stressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Matarrese1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Perl1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Previously, we demonstrated that application of Tat to cortical neurons induced a rapid decrease of mitochondrial calcium leading us to speculate that it was loss of the free calcium cation from mitochondria that resulted in hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Norman1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Due to the importance of the ER in both calcium signaling and mitochondrial function, we investigated the effect of HIV-1 Tat on sequestration of calcium in the ER and demonstrate that HIV-1 Tat induces the rapid loss in ER calcium through the activation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) with initiation of the UPR. We further show that antagonism of the RyR reversed Tat-induced hyperpolarization of &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub>. <italic>In vivo</italic> delivery of HIV-1 Tat to murine CNS also results in pathologic dilation of ER and changes in mitochondrial morphology. Furthermore, these ultrastructural changes also occur in neurons of the frontal cortex from patients with HIV-1 encephalitis and dementia. These results suggest a common mechanism via RyR signaling that rapidly initiates endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial calcium release as part of a generalized neuronal stress response that appears to have enduring consequences for the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Acute exposure to Tat induces calcium loss from the ER via the ryanodine receptor</title><p>In our previous studies of cortical neurons exposed to HIV-1 Tat, we concluded that neuronal mitochondria suffered a loss of energy metabolism reflected by decreased NAD(P)H, as well as &#x0005b;Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>&#x0005d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Norman1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of the changes in mitochondrial &#x0005b;Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>&#x0005d;, we investigated the ER as a potential locus for these effects. The ER is responsible for the storage of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and has the ability to induce rapid efflux of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in response to a variety of cellular signals, including inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptors and ryanodine receptors (RyR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Bardo1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

FRET imaging has an advantage over traditional calcium sensitive dyes in that the ratio between the two fluorophores acts as an internal control and is less susceptible to fluctuations and photo-bleaching that commonly plague single wavelength dyes. Exposure to 8 nM Tat elicited an initial loss of &#x0223c;6&#x00025; of the fluorescent signal with a continued decrement to &#x0223c;80&#x00025; of control fluorescence over a 10 minute period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003731-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the mechanism responsible for the release of ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, we pre-treated cortical neurons for 30 min with 20 &#x000b5;M ryanodine (Ry), a concentration which inhibits RyR channel opening (Bardo 2006).

To ensure that the loss in fluorescence was not due to overexposure, a photo-bleaching control, Control (no Tat), was performed to demonstrate the stability of the fluorescent signal.

The data suggests one of two possible mechanisms: either Tat is activating the RyR through a direct interaction, or it is sensitizing the receptor to cytosolic calcium; a similar effect can be observed with caffeine application <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Bardo1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We next investigated what sort of response associated with the UPR may occur in our experimental paradigm. As unprocessed proteins accumulate in the ER a repertoire of cellular defense pathways are activated to restore proper function. An early event in UPR induction is the phosphorylation of one or more, transmembrane proteins that relay cytosolic information to the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Forman1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Another parallel pathway that is metabolically active during the UPR involves PERK phosphorylation (p-PERK). p-PERK perpetuates the UPR by phosphorylating the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2&#x003b1; (p-eIF2&#x003b1;). Because the immediate consequence of increased expression of p-eIF2&#x003b1; is a whole scale shutdown of protein translation in the ER, we investigated the phosphorylation of these protein species.</p><p>We demonstrate that IRE&#x003b1; and PERK phosphorylation occurred in our paradigm because of the increase in abundance for p-PERK and phosphorylated eIF2&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003731-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>) while simultaneously, p-IRE&#x003b1; up-regulated the gene XBP1 that splices a 26nt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Iwawaki1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> from the mRNA to produce the transcription factor product, XBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003731-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Interestingly, the Tat induced upregulation of p-PERK, XBP<sub>u</sub>, and XBP1<sub>s</sub> was significantly attenuated (to 90&#x00025; of Tat expression) by the pretreatment of ryanodine &#x0005b;20 &#x000b5;M&#x0005d; for 30 min before treatment at the 1-hour time point (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003731.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Up-regulation of XBPs, a crucial transcription factor, can increase the capacity of the ER to fold proteins during the UPR that could be attributed to the activation of this portion of UPR pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Murakami1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003731-Cox1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The discrepancy between the small magnitude of the protein changes relative to the striking ultrastructural changes observed after 8 nM Tat treatment in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003731-g003">Figure 3E&#x02013;H</xref>) suggests that there may be some type of amplification process via post-translational modification of cytoskeletal proteins that control shape of ER cisternae. Additionally, the lack of changes in mitochondrial morphology (i.e. cristae) during acute exposure to Tat in our in vitro model, suggests that this phenomenon is dependent on pathways that subserve an inflammatory response only present in an <italic>in vivo</italic> milieu. While the ability of antagonist doses of ryanodine to inhibit Tat-induced phosphorylation of UPR gene products confirms that the rapid decrease in ER &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d; is the initiating step for ER dysfunction, further studies beyond the scope of this report are required to delineate the mechanism(s) responsible for these morphologic changes and resolve the kinetic differences between our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models.</p><p>Regardless, the most striking feature of the Tat-induced UPR is the morphological changes that are apparent in the EM photomicrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003731-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In untreated neurons, the ER is barely visible, as rows of ribosomes that line the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003731-g004">Figure 4A, C, D</xref>). This normal ER morphology is disrupted when Tat induces the UPR and as a result, the ER becomes dilated, with detached ribosomes no longer in apposition to the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003731-g003">Figure 3B, G, H</xref>). There is also a structural abnormality that we were unable to identify and appears to be a filament running &#x0201c;through&#x0201d; the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003731-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Downstream Consequences of UPR Induction</title><p>The observed ER dysfunction and induction of the UPR pathway in cortical neurons may have additional ramifications.
