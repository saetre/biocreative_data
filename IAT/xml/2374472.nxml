A close association of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 allele with the disease suggests that genetic predisposition contributes to susceptibility to BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, infections with agents such as herpes simplex virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and <italic>Streptococcus sanguis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] has been implicated in the development of BD, although no specific infectious agent has been identified as its cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Rather, several reports have suggested that ubiquitous antigens presented by micro-organisms, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), trigger crossreactive autoimmune responses through molecular mimicry machinery, which results in BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Not just acquired but also innate immune systems are activated in BD, because hyperfunction of neutrophils is a hallmark of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the immunopathological mechanisms remain uncertain. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are expressed on phagocytes and other cells, recognize 'pathogen-associated molecular patterns' in microbes and mediate inflammatory signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. TLR2 and TLR4 recognize lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. Furthermore, both receptors also bind to the endogenous 60 kDa HSP (HSP60), leading to cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is becoming clear that TLRs are involved in systemic autoimmune disorders, because it was recently demonstrated TLR2 and TLR4 are involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and TLR9 in systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These findings have led to the hypothesis that microbial antigens not only trigger autoimmune responses through specific T-cell receptors but they also activate the innate immune system through the TLRs, leading to the inflammation that is characteristic of BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Few studies have been conducted to investigate the role played by the regulatory systems in inflammatory diseases of humans, including BD. We are interested in heme oxygenase (HO)-1, because accumulating evidence suggests that HO-1 protects the host in a variety of pathologic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our laboratory has demonstrated the beneficial role of HO-1 in inflammatory lung disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and lupus nephritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. On the other hand, a deficiency in HO-1 expression is associated with severe chronic inflammation, as demonstrated by studies conducted in HO-1 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and observations in a patient with HO-1 deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These findings are consistent with the notion that HO-1 plays a physiologic role in protecting against inflammation. Furthermore, our recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] have demonstrated substantial pathologic roles of HO-1 in rheumatic diseases. Abundant expression of HO-1 was identified in synovial tissues of patients with RA, in the absence of elevated serum HO-1 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Further analysis using RA synovial cell lines suggests that HO-1 plays a regulatory role in RA inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] showed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) suppresses HO-1 expression in human monocytes, leading to augmentation of inflammatory responses, and that clinical efficacy of anti-TNF therapy is associated with restoration of HO-1 expression in circulating monocytes from patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], HO-1 gene therapy successfully ameliorated lung injury induced by LPS, which stimulates the innate immune system through TLR4. It is thus of interest to study the relationship between TLRs, as activating factors, and HO-1, as a regulatory factor of inflammatory responses in inflammatory disorders.</p><p>In the present study, mRNA expression levels of HO-1, TLR2, and TLR4 in circulating leukocytes from BD patients were determined. The data suggest that activation signals through essentially over-expressed TLR4 cause reduction in HO-1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), resulting in an augmentation of inflammatory responses in BD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and healthy donors</title><p>Thirty-three patients with BD, who met the International Study Group criteria for diagnosis of BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], were enrolled in the study.

The primers and probes for human HO-1, TLR2, TLR4, CD14, TNF-&#x003b1;, MD-2 (Myeloid differentiation factor-2), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) used in the real-time PCR were purchased from PE Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time PCR was performed using a BD Qtaq DNA polymerase (BD Bioscience), and the data were analyzed by the ABI prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Briefly, 1/50 of cDNA derived from 1 &#x003bc;g total RNA, 200 nmol/l probe, and 800 nmol/l primers were incubated in 25 &#x003bc;l at 50&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes and 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 minute. The analysis system determined the number of cycles at which the amplified DNA in the sample exceeded the threshold during the PCR. Gene expression levels of the individual samples were calculated on standard curves of each cDNA generated by serial dilutions of the PCR amplified products. The data on HO-1, TLR2, TLR4, and TNF-&#x003b1; were standardized to the expression of GAPDH in the same samples, using multiplex PCR technique.

Briefly, cells were treated with lysis buffer (137 mmol/l NaCl, 20 mmol/l Tris-HCl, 50 mmol/l NaF, 1 mmol/l EDTA, and Triton-X), supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes on ice, and the supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 minutes. For TLR2 and TLR4 immunoblotting, after addition of lysis buffer, cells were homogenized for 15 minutes by ultrasonifier (Branson Japan, Kanagawa, Japan). The samples were resolved electrophoretically on a 4% to 20% gradient of polyacrylamide gel (Daiichi Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan) and transferred onto a polyvinyldene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% skimmed milk/Tris-buffered saline overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, the membrane was incubated with optimally diluted anti-HO-1 monoclonal antibody (Stressgen), anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 (Imgenex, San Diego, CA, USA) monoclonal antibody, or anti-actin goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and subsequently for 45 minutes with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) or rabbit anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA, USA).

A good correlation between HO-1 mRNA and protein levels has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we found no significant difference in HO-1 mRNA expression in PBMCs between BD patients (including both patients with active and those with inactive disease) and healthy control individuals (data not shown).

Because HO-1 is preferentially expressed by monocytes among PBMCs, amounts of HO-1 mRNA may depend on the proportion of monocytes detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. CD14 mRNA levels determined by real-time PCR were comparable between BD and healthy control individuals, indicating that there was no difference between groups in the proportion of monocytes among circulating leukocytes (data not shown).

Because LPS (a TLR4 ligand) has been shown to suppress interleukin-10-dependent HO-1 expression in human PBMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], it is plausible that excessively expressed TLR4 contributes to defective HO-1 expression in PBMCs from BD patients. As expected, the immunoblotting study revealed that stimulation with LPS reduced HO-1 expression in PBMCs from patients with BD, irrespective of the presence or absence of interleukin-10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). The suppressive effect on HO-1 expression was completely abrogated by a LPS neutrizer, namely polymyxin B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>).

Dysregulation of HO-1 expression is associated with some rheumatic diseases. Our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have demonstrated elevated serum HO-1 levels in patients with adult onset Still's disease and hemophagocytic syndrome, and aberrant expression of HO-1 in synoviocytes from patients with RA. However, reduced HO-1 levels in leukocytes have not been demonstrated in other rheumatic diseases. Evidence suggests that increased expression of HO-1 can benefit the host in a variety of pathologic conditions, including inflammatory changes, whereas a deficiency in HO-1 expression is associated with vigorous inflammation, as demonstrated by studies of HO-1 knockout mice and observed in a patient with HO-1 deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In RA, HO-1-expressing cells were located in the lining and sublining layers, but not in the cartilage-pannus junction, where bone and cartilage are actively destroyed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] demonstrated that selective knockdown of HO-1 expression by using specific small interfering RNA resulted in upregulation of synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and TNF, which have been shown to be elevated in sera from BD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This suggests that leukocyte function is regulated by HO-1 expressed in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, defective expression of HO-1 may be involved in the inflammation characteristic of BD, especially in patients with active disease.</p><p>Although a pathogenic role of anti-HSP60 specific autoimmune responses has been suggested in BD, abnormal activation of the innate immune system has also been identified in the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, involvement of TLRs has been shown in other systemic autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the present study, expression levels of TLR2 and TLR4 were examined because both TLRs recognize HSP60 as ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Actually, HSP60 was reported to be expressed in PBMCs, and in intestinal and mucocutaneous lesions from BD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our findings demonstrated that levels of TLR4 mRNA, but not of TLR2 mRNA, are constitutively increased in PBMCs from patients with BD, regardless of disease activity. The data suggest possible involvement of TLR4 in BD, although TLR4 has been also implicated in other rheumatic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Abnormal expression of TLR4 can predispose to defective HO-1 expression in BD PBMCs, because TLR4 may be a putative HO-1 repressor in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Indeed, HO-1 expression was suppressed in PBMCs stimulated with LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Moreover, elevated soluble CD14 in plasma of BD patients may further facilitate LPS binding to TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Interestingly, LPS-induced lung injury in a mouse model was rescued by administration of an HO-1 adenovirus vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; this suggests that HO-1 supplementation may have utility as a strategy for countering TLR4-related inflammation. Such a strategy may also be applicable to BD.</p><p>TNF plays a critical role in the development of BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Several studies, including ours, have demonstrated that TNF is excessively produced in patients with active BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Indeed, anti-TNF therapy is effective in the disease, especially for management of ocular lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] we showed that TNF suppresses HO-1 expression levels in human peripheral monocytes, thereby accelerating inflammatory responses; this suggests that excessive TNF levels contribute to defective HO-1 expression. However, no association was found between HO-1 and TNF mRNA levels in circulating PBMCs from patients with BD. In addition, the suppressive effect of LPS on HO-1 was not abrogated by anti-TNF antibody, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, although significant synthesis of TNF in response to LPS was confirmed in the experiments (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). These data, rather, suggest that the effect of LPS is mainly mediated by a pathway distinct from TNF. However, TNF may also contribute to defective HO-1 expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, because other types of cells also produce TNF in BD. Taken together, our findings suggest that highly expressed TLR4 might contribute to reduced HO-1 expression, leading to an activation of the innate immune system in BD, although other factors including TNF may be involved in the defective HO-1. Because TLRs other than TLR4 are also likely to be involved in the pathogenesis BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], further investigation of molecular mechanisms, including interactions between TLRs and HO-1, are required, especially those that distinguish BD from other inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the data presented, we hypothesize that HSP60 stimulates not only antigen-specific autoimmune responses but also the innate immune system through constitutively over-expressed TLR4, which mediates HO-1 reduction in PBMCs, leading to inflammation in BD. Restoration of HO-1 expression might be a promising therapeutic strategy in the disease. Alternatively, specific intervention in TLR4-mediated signals that lead to HO-1 reduction may also be of benefit in BD.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BD = Beh&#x000e7;et's disease; GAPDH = glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HLA = human leukocyte antigen; HO = heme oxygenase; HSP = heat shock protein; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; PBMC = peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PMN = polymorphonuclear leukocyte; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; TLR = Toll-like receptor; TNF = tumor necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have received no financial support or other benefits from commercial sources for the work reported here, and the authors have no other financial interests that could create a potential conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest with regard to the present study.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YI designed and organized the study.
