Earlier we managed to demonstrate that female BALB/c mice immunized against the second extracellular loop (SEL) of the 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor gave birth to pups with heart block. To explain this phenomenon we investigated the expression of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptors during mouse embryogenesis. At the same time we looked whether the consequence of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor immunomodulation observed earlier is in relation to receptor expression.</p><p>We studied the expression of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor at the mRNA level and its two isoforms 5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>and 5-HT<sub>4(d) </sub>at the protein level in embryos from BALB/c mice, at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 18<sup>th </sup>gestation days (GD) and 1 day post natal (DPN). Simultaneously the receptor activity was inhibited by rising antibodies, in female mice against SEL of the receptor. The mice were mated and embryos were collected at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 18<sup>th </sup>GD and 1 DPN.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor mRNA increased in brain from 12<sup>th </sup>GD to 1 DPN. Its expression gradually decreased in heart and disappeared at birth. This was consistent with expression of the receptor isoforms 5-HT<sub>4(a) and (d)</sub>. Abnormalities like decreased number of embryos, growth delay, spina bifida and sinus arrhythmia from 12<sup>th </sup>GD were documented in pups of mice showing anti-5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>serotoninergic 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor plays an important role in mouse foetal development.

Until now 10 different human isoforms have been cloned and sequenced (h5-HT<sub>4(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (hb), (i) and (n)</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] They are all coded by a complex gene (700 Kb, 38 exons), which generates 9 carboxy-terminal variants issued from alternative splicing. They have identical sequences up to Leu<sup>358</sup>, with the exception of h5-HT<sub>4(hb)</sub>, which is characterized by a 14 amino acid residues insertion within the receptor second extracellular loop (SEL) of h5-HT<sub>4(b) </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The presence of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor has been reported in different tissues. Receptor mRNA has been detected in brain, bladder, gastrointestinal tract, heart, kidney, pancreas and testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In postmortem human brain studies the receptor, ignoring its different isoforms, was detected in the basal ganglion (caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus and substantia nigra), in cortex and hippocampus (CA1 and subiculum) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In heart, mRNA for different h5-HT<sub>4 </sub>isoforms is mainly detected in atrium (5-HT<sub>4(a), (b), (c), (g), (i)</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The presence of four isoforms, mainly m5-HT<sub>4(a), (b), (e), (f) </sub>has been described in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although many studies have been performed to highlight the tissue distribution and functional activity of different isoforms of the receptor in adult human, rat and mouse, little is known about their expression and function during embryogenesis. Previously we have reported the involvement of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor in congenital heart block (CHB) associated to a systemic autoimmune response in the mother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE), autoantibodies against ribonucleoproteins 48-kDa SSB/La, 52-kDa SSA/Ro (Ro52) and 60-kDa SSA/Ro (Ro60) have received more attention, since they have been shown to be strongly associated with autoimmune responses involved in symptoms like CHB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has been postulated that the transfer of maternal anti-Ro52 antibodies from mother to the fetus is responsible for the symptoms of NLE. In a previous study, we managed to induce NLE symptoms in a mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This has prompted us to further explore the expression of different 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor isoforms in BALB/c mice during embryogenesis. Meanwhile, we searched for the period when anti-receptor antibodies could induce the observed abnormalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>1. Production of anti-peptide antibodies</title><p>Peptides derived from C-terminal ends of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor isoforms (Y23F and carrier- C7F) were highly immunogenic. The anti-5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>and 5-HT<sub>4(d) </sub>antibodies were able to recognize both their homologue peptide in ELISA. The specificity of the recognition was tested by inhibition immunoassay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). No cross-reactivity between the different anti-isoforms antibodies was detected in ELISA (data not shown). The antibodies recognized their corresponding receptor isoforms in immunocytofluorescence performed on transfected CHO cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). On transfected CHO cells, anti- 5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>antibodies were specific for their corresponding isoform while anti-5-HT<sub>4(d) </sub>ones recognized 5-HT<sub>4(a), (b), (c) and (d) </sub>isoforms.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Inhibition enzyme immunoassay showing the specificity of anti-Y23F (&#x025c6;) and anti-C7F (&#x025a0;) antibodies for their corresponding peptides.

Expression of receptor isoforms</title><p>Embryos from 8 pregnant BALB/c mice gestation days (GD) 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 18<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th </sup>and one day postnatal (DPN) were collected. These were used to explore the expression of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor isoforms both at the mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein levels. RT-PCR experiments revealed the increased expression of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor isoforms from day 12 of gestation to day 1 postnatal in brain. Receptor mRNA expression in the heart decreased gradually and disappeared at birth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). The latter was confirmed at the protein level where the expression of both isoforms matched the expressed 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). In adult mouse brain we detected both anti-5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>and anti-5-HT<sub>4(d)</sub>. Interestingly, the 5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>receptor is absent in dentate gyrus of adult mouse hippocampus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>A) Expression analysis of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor transcripts in embryonic and post-natal mouse tissues.

Pregnant mice at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 18<sup>th </sup>GD and one DPN were sacrificed and the embryos were counted and collected for morphological studies.</p><p>All female mice immunized with G21V developed high-titre anti-peptide antibodies. Serum from the mouse having a fetus with spina bifida, recognized the 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor by flow cytometry analyses performed on CHO cells transfected with 5-HT<sub>4(g) </sub>receptor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The same antibodies did not recognize any expression protein on CH0 cells transfected with M<sub>2 </sub>muscarinic receptor. Although immunized mice were all pregnant between 4 to 8 days post-mating, no pups were delivered at 21<sup>st </sup>day post-fertility. Mice had to be mated more than three times over a period of 2 months for a successful pregnancy. This was probably due to the presence of anti-5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor antibodies. The fact that the female BALB/c mice had circulating anti-peptide antibodies did not alter their fertility but jeopardized the normal development of embryos. The latter was confirmed by the abnormal number of embryos collected at different periods of gestation. In addition we have also observed and documented different symptoms such as growth delay, spina bifida, arrhythmia and ataxia, which all started from the 12<sup>th </sup>gestation day to 1 day PN (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a, b</xref>). Control mice (n = 5) gave birth to normal number of pups 21 days after the first mating (14 pups in total). The number of fetus in different embryonic periods was also normal i.e. 7 embryo in average (20 fetus in total).

The fact that there are at least 10 different 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor isoforms and mRNA expression in both central and peripheral organs, point to the importance of this family of receptors in the maintenance of normal cellular activity. Although 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor has been reported to be involved in memory and learning as well as gastrointestinal function, less or almost nothing is known about its role in embryogenesis.</p><p>The importance of the embryonic serotoninergic system in central nervous and cardiovascular functions has been largely described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In early mouse embryogenesis, maternal serotonin (5-HT) activates different 5-HT receptors to control gene expression, migration and proliferation of neuronal crest and neuronal-crest derived cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although there is enough evidence fortifying the 5-HT hypothesis in embryogenesis, no major abnormalities were found in 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor knockout mice. One has just observed an attenuated response to stress and novelty as well as hypersensitivity to seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. There are many knockout and transgenic mouse models with such phenotypes. For instance null mutation of &#x003b1;4 subunit nicotinic cholinergic receptor increases the susceptibility to proconvulsant-induced seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This is also the case for 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptor, prion protein, superoxide dismutase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and many others. Blocking the expression</p><p>of 5-HT receptors using traditional knockout method gives rise to compensatory mechanism that occur during the constitutive deletion of the receptor throughout the lifespan of the animal. Furthermore, the inherent complexity in the pattern of expression and in the function of some genes and gene products contributes more to compensation and hidden developmental roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. On the contrary by using alternative methods like blocking the expression of the receptor in restricted periods of time one circumvents the compensations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The latter is also possible by modulating the protein activity at the cell membrane rather than blocking the function of the gene. Given the pathophysiological complexity of these conditions and involvement of many other factors one cannot explain these abnormal conditions with the lack of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptors. One plausible explanation to the latter is the expanded variety of the 5-HT receptor family. Loosing one receptor subtype or isoform probably leads to a compensation mechanism conducted by other members of the family here probably 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>serotoninergic receptor. The only 5-HT receptor knockout with pathophysiological consequences is the 5-HT<sub>2(b) </sub>receptor. 5-HT<sub>2(b) </sub>receptor knockout mice embryos developed cardiac hypoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The receptor's importance in regulating cardiac activity was reported two years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Our group has shown in pups of BALB/c mice that maternal anti-5-HT<sub>4 </sub>antibodies caused fetal cardiac hyperplasia and arrhythmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the central nervous system, 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor isoform mRNAs were found in almost all brain structures. However, up to now neither the receptor expression nor its function during the fetal period was studied.</p><p>In the first part of this study, we demonstrated the specificity of the anti-peptide antibodies for their corresponding peptide. Anti-5HT<sub>4(a) </sub>was specific for its isoform as it did not cross react with any of the other receptor isoforms tested, i.e. 5-HT<sub>4(b), (c) and (d)</sub>. On the contrary, 5-HT<sub>4(d) </sub>antibodies, besides binding its corresponding peptide could also recognize all the other isoforms including 5-HT<sub>4(a)</sub>. This was not due to a cross reactivity but to their specificity, since the C- terminal end of 5-HT<sub>4(d) </sub>is common between 5-HT<sub>4(a), (b), (c) and (d)</sub>. We report here the presence of cardiac isoforms 5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>in embryos from BALB/c mice at GD 8<sup>th </sup>(data not shown), 12<sup>th</sup>, 18<sup>th </sup>and one day postnatal. Since the anti-5-HT<sub>4(d) </sub>antibodies are able to recognize other already mentioned isoforms, we can only be sure about the expression of 5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>in the heart and brain. Whether there are other isoforms expressed during embryogenesis remains elusive. However 5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>receptor was found both in fetal brain and heart. Both 5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>and 5-HT<sub>4(d) </sub>receptor isoforms were expressed in brain, at 1 DP, but we could not detect any signal in the pups' heart for the two explored isoforms. One remains, however, puzzled of the receptor's disappearance at 1 DP. This could be explained by the progressive appearance of adrenergic receptors. Indeed, both &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors are already detected at 12<sup>th </sup>GD, and, contrary to 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor, activity of &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor in mouse heart increases significantly until birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In the second part of our study, we observed that all female BALB/c mice immunized with peptide derived from the second extracellular loop of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor developed anti-peptide antibodies that could recognize membranes from 5-HT<sub>4(g) </sub>transfected CHO cells. Although the mice were all fertile, they had to be mated several times before developing a successful pregnancy. All mice in the control group gave birth 21 days post mating. In immunized mice, the number of pups for the first pregnancy was between 5 and 7, which was similar to the control group. However, the number of fetuses of immunized mice decreased from 12<sup>th </sup>to 18<sup>th </sup>GD (7 to 2, respectively). This was in accordance with the titer of circulating antibodies in the mothers. The latter was also observed in two littermates, where one mouse gave birth to 2 and the other to 6 pups. Here we observed again that the titer of circulating antibodies for the mother with just two pups was 7 times higher than the mouse with 6 pups.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptors are expressed already at the 8<sup>th </sup>GD (in ectoderm), at least for the 5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>isoform. We also provided evidence for the functionality of the anti-receptor antibodies, since 1) they decreased fertility as shown by the increased number of mating for a successful litter, 2) they decreased the number of fetuses and pups in relation with the titer of circulating antibodies, 3) they induced morphological and functional abnormalities both in peripheral and central organs. In our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] we demonstrated that anti-5-HT<sub>4 </sub>antibodies passively transferred from mother to the pups could induce atrioventricular block type I and II (AVB), tremor and skin lesions. Here we confirmed the presence of malformation in some cases and could correlate its incidence with the expression of the receptor and titre of the anti-receptor antibodies. This means that at high concentration of transferred anti-receptor antibodies the chance of malformation is considerably higher, since 21-days post mating either the number of pups decreased or no labour was issued. The effect of anti-5-HT<sub>4 </sub>antibodies could be through their binding to at least 5-HT<sub>4(a) </sub>receptor isoform, since it is already expressed from 8<sup>th </sup>GD. It has been shown that antibodies against the second extracellular loop of the receptor block the effect of serotonin in human cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In embryonic heart muscle expression of vascular &#x003b1;-actin has been demonstrated. Alpha-actin acts as a precursor in immature contractile structures, when the embryonic heart just starts to beat, and might only gradually be replaced by the mature cardiac isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. For this reason we used &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin as a marker for heart development. Our observation that myocardium of mouse fetus with circulating maternal anti-5-HT<sub>4 </sub>antibodies has less or no immunoreactivity for &#x003b1;-actin smooth muscle could be due to delayed maturation of fetal myocardium in immunized animals. However although the presences of anti-Ro52 autoantibodies cross reacting with SEL of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptors shows a good correlation with the prevalence for neonatal lupus their pathogenic role cannot be generalized. We have shown this in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This could be due to at one hand that the tested sera were from pretreated pregnant women with lupus. In no studies yet published the blood samples are collected following the same period of pregnancy. Beside the important fluctuation of circulating autoantibodies makes the exploration even harder. On the other hand we don't have any idea about the expression of the 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor during human embryogenesis. Therefore we cannot draw any general conclusion. In mice (BALB/c) with no known autoimmune genetic background, therefore requiring no treatment, only the presence of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor antibodies induced anomalies in fetus, which coincide with the receptor expression. Here we could postulate that the SEL of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor could be a pathogenic target for autoantibodies</p><p>Although the effect of the antibodies seems to be through the inhibition of the serotonin signal we however have no evidence for its cellular mechanism.</p><p>Finally, we also show that immunomodulation of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor activity, during embryogenesis, is an honorable alternative to the gene knockout technique. Since the receptor is already expressed and functional, modulating or inhibiting its activity will not activate any genetically compensatory mechanism. Therefore, its activity and physiological role can be explored independently.</p><p>Taken together, our results demonstrate that 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptors are crucial for embryonic development of the cardiovascular and central nervous systems in BALB/c mice. Coincidence of anti-receptor antibodies and expression of 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor results in anatomical abnormalities. Further studies are needed to highlight the function of different receptor isoforms during embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>1.

Induction of anti-peptide antibodies</title><p>Eight female adult rabbits (2.5&#x02013;2.7 kg) were immunized with either Y23F or C7F peptides. Four female rabbits were immunized with 200 &#x003bc;g of peptide Y23F with 1 mg of mBSA. Prime injections were given in CFA. The peptide C7F was conjugated to BSA using SBA prior to administration to other four rabbits. The peptide was coupled according to the following procedure. All sulphydryl groups on BSA (4 mg) were blocked with 0.5 M iodoacetamide in a coupling buffer (pH = 7) composed of K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>(100 mM), EDTA (1 mM) and sodium azide (0.02%). The mixture was dialyzed 3 times 1 liter, against the coupling buffer without sodium azide. Thereafter 30 mg (0.13 mmol) of SBA was added to 4 mg of saturated BSA in the presence of 0.25 ml of dimethylformamide and diluted with coupling buffer to the final volume of 3 ml. SBA conjugated BSA was separated from the unconjugated ones on a G-25 Sephadex column (2.2 &#x000d7; 27 cm) and dialyzed against coupling buffer (3 times 1 liter). Finally 3.4 mg/ml of activated BSA molecule was mixed with 1.6 mg of C7F peptide. It was then dialyzed against the coupling buffer and stored at -20&#x000b0;C. Rabbits were immunized with an equivalent of 200 &#x003bc;g of BSA conjugated C7F in presence of CFA. Thereafter rabbits received 3 booster injections with three weeks interval where CFA was replaced with Incomplete Freund Adjuvant (IFA).

Reverse Transcription &#x02013; Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and southern blot</title><p>Balb/c mice (n = 8) were mated and the fetuses were collected at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th </sup>18<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th </sup>GD and 1 DPN. From the same litter, half of fetus was used for RT-PCR and the other half was frozen down for immunohistochemistry (see below). Total RNA was prepared from mouse tissues using the Trizol RNA purification system (Life Technologies Inc.). After purification, RNA was treated with DNase I (Life Technologies Inc.) and 5 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was then hybridized with oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase II (Life Technologies Inc.). The resulting single strand cDNAs were used as templates in PCR reactions using a specific primer pair for the m5-HT<sub>4</sub>R (5'-CCTGTGCTGTATTTCCCTGG-3'; 5'-GAATGGGGGGTCTTTTGTAG-3'). This primer couple selective of the common part of mouse 5-HT<sub>4 </sub>receptor isoform allows the amplification of a single DNA band migrating at 688 bp (base pair). The sequence of &#x003b2;-actin primers has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.01% ethidium bromide and photographed under U.V. irradiation. For Southern blot, PCR products were transferred to Zetaprobe membrane (Biorad). The following primer 5'-AGGATGATGAGGAAGGCACG-3' was labeled with <sup>32</sup>P using the random primer DNA labeling kit (Life Technologies Inc.), and used as an internal probe for hybridization. Hybridization was performed at 57&#x000b0;C for 12 h in a Church buffer (0.5 M NaHPO<sub>4 </sub>pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 7% SDS) containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA.

The tissue was saturated with blocking buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1%Tween) for 1 h at room temperature. Affinity purified anti-peptide antibodies corresponding to each isoform were incubated for 2 h (1/200). After three washes in PBS, the tissues were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1/500) and visualized under a Leica epifluorescence microscope and photographed.</p><p>Fetuses at 12<sup>th </sup>GD were collected and fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde/PBS solution.
