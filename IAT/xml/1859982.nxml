Two core haplotypes were identified (carried by 76-96.6% of each population's sample), the sequences of which are clearly separated from each other. As fertility most directly affects an organism's fitness, the carriers of these haplotypes have apparently had more success in human history to contribute to the next generation. There is a preliminary observation suggesting that the second most frequent <italic>FSHB</italic> haplotype may be associated with rapid conception success in females.

In females FSH is responsible for the proliferation and survival of follicular somatic cells, and the cyclic recruitment of ovarian follicles into development from early antral stage through maturation to ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">McGee &#x00026; Hsueh, 2000</xref>). In males FSH is found to be essential for Sertoli cell proliferation and maintenance of sperm quality in testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Plant &#x00026; Marshall, 2001</xref>). Transgenic models have accentuated the essential function of FSH in female reproduction. FSH-deficient female mice are infertile and demonstrate small ovaries resulting from a block in folliculogenesis at the preantral stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). FSH-overexpressing female mice mimic the features of human ovarian hyperstimulation and polycystic ovary syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). FSH is widely used for the treatment of human infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baccetti <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Howles, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Rose <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>), and the fact that recombinant FSH was developed as the first recombinant product for this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Recombinant Human FSH Product Development Group, 1998</xref>) underscores its importance in reproductive medicine.</p><p>All glycoprotein hormones (FSH, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, Luteinizing Hormone and Chorionic Gonadotropin) consist of a common alpha subunit, synthesized from the evolutionarily conserved <italic>CGA</italic> gene at 6q12-21, and a hormone-specific beta subunit. The interactions between the glycoprotein hormones and their corresponding receptors are highly selective, with very few cases of cross activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Themmen &#x00026; Huhtaniemi, 2000</xref>). Although both FSH subunits contribute to binding to the FSH receptor (FSHR), the &#x003b2;-subunit dictates binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fan &#x00026; Hendrickson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Fox <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). In addition to the requirement for a suitable binding surface, it appears that receptor binding and activation by the hormone is accompanied by a concerted conformational change in FSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fan &#x00026; Hendrickson, 2005</xref>). The <italic>FSHB</italic> gene (MIM 136530; 11p13; genomic sequence 4.2 kb) coding for the FSH &#x003b2;-subunit consists of one non-coding exon plus two translated exons that encode the 129-aminoacid preprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1a</xref>). Consistent with its essential function in reproduction only eight subjects (both men and women) with inactivating <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations have been described, all exhibiting impaired fertility and severely decreased production of mature gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Berger <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Huhtaniemi, 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A,B Schematic representation of the re-sequenced human <italic>FSHB</italic> region. a Gene structure drawn to an approximate scale.

Polymorphisms were identified using the polyphred program, version 4.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Nickerson <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>) and confirmed by manual checking. A genetic variant was verified only if it was observed in both the forward and the reverse orientations.

For haplotype reconstruction the model allowing recombination was used. Running parameters were: number of iterations = 1000, thinning interval = 1, burn-in = 100; for increasing the number of iterations of the final run of the algorithm the &#x02013;X10 parameter, making the final run 10 times longer than other runs, was used. We ran the algorithm 10 times, resulting in identical outputs of the parallel analysis; thus we used the median of the values obtained from one of the runs. Relationships between inferred haplotypes were investigated using the Median-Joining (MJ) network algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bandelt <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>) within NETWORK 4.0 software.</p><p>Sequence diversity parameters were calculated with DnaSP 4.10.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Rozas &#x00026; Rozas, 1999</xref>). The direct estimate of per-site heterozygosity (&#x003c0;) was derived from the average pairwise sequence difference, and Watterson's &#x003b8; represents an estimate of the expected per-site heterozygosity based on the number of segregating sites (S). Tajima's D (D<sup>T</sup>), Fu and Li's D<sup>FL</sup>, and Fu and Li's F<sup>FL</sup> statistics were calculated to determine if the observed patterns of intraspecies diversity are consistent with the standard neutral model. Significant positive D<sup>T</sup>, D<sup>FL</sup> and F<sup>FL</sup> values may indicate an excess of high-frequency SNPs, referring to either balancing selection or population bottlenecks. Conversely, significant negative D<sup>T</sup>, D<sup>FL</sup> and F<sup>FL</sup> values may reflect an excess of rare polymorphisms in a population, indicating either positive selection or an increase in population size.</p><p>The relative amount of within-species polymorphism should reflect the amount of between-species fixation under neutrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kimura, 1983</xref>).

The resulting <italic>FSHB</italic> genomic sequence collection contained seven common SNPs (MAF &#x0003e; 10%) seen in all populations and only five singleton variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1b</xref>; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Tables S2</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3</xref>; ss49785048 &#x02013; ss49785060). To test whether patterns of DNA sequence variation in <italic>FSHB</italic> fit the expectations under the hypothesis of neutrality we analyzed the data with a number of neutrality tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The direction of D<sup>T</sup>, D<sup>FL</sup> and F<sup>FL</sup> statistics is potentially informative about the evolutionary and demographic forces that a population has experienced. The estimated positive D<sup>T</sup>, D<sup>FL</sup> and F<sup>FL</sup> values for the <italic>FSHB</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) fell into the upper range of the distribution determined in a recent study for 132 different human genes in European- and African-Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Akey <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), where only a few of the analyzed genes (e.g. <italic>ABO, ACE2, IL10RB, IL1A</italic>) resulted in estimates as high as that determined for <italic>FSHB</italic>. This indicates an enrichment of intermediate-frequency alleles for <italic>FSHB</italic> polymorphisms, consistent with either balancing selection or population demography characterized by subdivision or reduction in size (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bamshad &#x00026; Wooding, 2003</xref>). For Estonians and Mandenkalu significant positive values in two tests (D<sup>T</sup>; F<sup>FL</sup>) rejected the hypothesis of neutrality.

Divergence of primate <italic>FSHB</italic> from the human (H) sequence falls into the range of previous estimates: for H/C 1.28%, for H/G 1.92% and for H/O 3.38% compared to a report for 53 intergenic regions 1.24 &#x000b1; 0.07%, 1.62 &#x000b1; 0.08% and 3.08 &#x000b1; 0.11%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chen &#x00026; Li, 2001</xref>). We identified three amino acid differences in great apes relative to human <italic>FSHB</italic>: a change in the signal peptide (amino acid no. 4) from Leu to Val between human and orangutan, and changes in the mature protein from Tyr to His (exon 2, amino acid no. 49) between human and chimpanzee, and Lys to Asn (exon 3, amino acid no. 64) between human and all of the other studied species (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). None of the differences are located within the region of the hormone adjacent to the receptor in the recently described FSH-FSHR co-crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fan &#x00026; Hendrickson, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Primate haplotypes formed from the positions of common human SNPs were identical among chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan, except for a single basepair deletion in the orangutan gene for SNP rs611246 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). When compared to human <italic>FSHB</italic> the conserved great apes' haplotype is seen to be most similar to human HAP13, as opposed to HAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>).

In order to explore the hypothesis that the identified <italic>FSHB</italic> core haplotypes might have functional consequences for human reproduction, we analyzed Estonian women (n = 48) who had conceived within three months after stopping contraception (STP = short time to pregnancy) and compared them with an unselected population sample of Estonian women (n = 47) collected in the same University Clinic. In different circumstances short intervals between births, greatly regulated by the female's ability to conceive, may be either advantageous or disadvantageous and thus subjected to balancing selection. We are aware that comparison with a population sample might weaken the power of the analysis, as it could also include potential STP-women. However, in this case the usage of a traditional matched control group of women with a longer conceiving period is inappropriate, and may also be a source of bias as the time to pregnancy is influenced by several factors: hormonal status and gamete quality of both partners, anatomy of genital tract, infections, sexual behaviour, etc.</p><p>The frequency of the worldwide variant (HAP1) was 38.5% in STP-women and 53.2% in the random population sample, whereas the prevalence of HAP13 was 52.1% in the STP group and 39.4% in the random sample (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 3.982; p &#x0003c; 0.05). Notably, the difference in distributions of the homozygotes for these haplotypes was even more pronounced (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 10.471, p &#x0003c; 0.002; Fisher's exact test p &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).

The latter remained significant (p &#x0003c; 0.01) after correcting for multiple comparisons.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The distribution of homo- and heterozygous individuals for <italic>FSHB</italic> haplotypes in a random Estonian sample, and in Estonian women who conceived within three months after stopping contraception (STP = short time to pregnancy).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ahg0071-0018-f3"/></fig><p>Interestingly, the HAP13 carriers were not only enriched among Estonian STP-women, but also in unrelated CEPH individuals. In the CEPH sample the frequency of HAP13 was 68.3% and HAP13 homozygotes 37%, whereas no homozygotes for HAP1 were detected. It may be noteworthy that CEPH individuals stem from the Utah pedigrees originally selected for study on the basis of having a high number (minimum 8 sibs) of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dausset <italic>et al</italic>. 1990</xref>).</p><p>Based on these observations we postulate a hypothesis that in females the <italic>FSHB</italic> core haplotypes may have been subjected to balancing selection due to an effect on intervals between births. However, this preliminary, although significant, finding based on a modest number of individuals needs to be confirmed with an expanded sample set involving several populations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Is the <italic>FSHB</italic> Gene Subject to Balancing Selection?</title><p>Despite its essential and non-redundant role in human reproduction, the genetic variation across <italic>FSHB</italic> and its possible effect on gene function has not been previously studied. Possible selection on the maintenance of <italic>FSHB</italic> gene function is revealed by its evolutionarily conserved sequence in mammals and teleost fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Li &#x00026; Ford, 1998</xref>) as well as by the very small number of non-synonymous mutations (n = 4, cases = 8, all leading to infertility) identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Berger <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Consistent with this evidence for conservation our re-sequencing study of 96 individuals, representing populations from 3 continents, did not uncover any non-synonymous changes. The majority of the <italic>FSHB</italic> SNPs were represented as common polymorphisms with worldwide occurrence. Two of the variants overlapped with previous studies: (i) a common synonymous change Tyr-Tyr (rs6169) in exon 3 present in Asia (Han Chinese, Malays Indians, Koreans), Europe (Finns, Danes, Estonians, Czech, CEPH/Utah) and Africa (Mandenka) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Lamminen <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Liao <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>); and (ii) rs609896 also found in Asia (Han Chinese, Japanese, Koreans), Europe (Estonians, Czechs, CEPH/Utah, Finns, Danes) and Africa (Mandenkalu, Yoruba) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">The International HapMap Consortium, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Lamminen <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).</p><p>We identified two worldwide <italic>FSHB</italic> core haplotypes (HAP1, HAP13 carried by 76 to 96.6% of each population's individuals), the sequences of which are clearly separated from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Although the &#x02018;yin-yang&#x02019; haplotypes with mismatching alleles at every SNP sites can also be explained by neutral evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), we have provided evidence that this is probably not the case for <italic>FSHB</italic>. Statistical tests suggest significant deviations for <italic>FSHB</italic> from neutrality. Three neutrality tests (D<sup>T</sup>, D<sup>FL</sup> and F<sup>FL</sup>) indicated an enrichment of SNPs with intermediate minor allele frequencies. The significantly positive Tajima's D<sup>T</sup> values for <italic>FSHB</italic> stand out when compared to the distribution of D<sup>T</sup> values for 313 other human genes, 281 of which showed a negative D<sup>T</sup> value interpreted as a strong evidence for a recent expansion of the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Stephens <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). The results are consistent with the scenario of balancing selection acting on the <italic>FSHB</italic> gene (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bamshad &#x00026; Wooding, 2003</xref>). Although similar results can be caused by population subdivision, in which haplotypes are restricted to specific subpopulations or reduction in population size, this scenario is less supported by the <italic>FSHB</italic> data as all the studied populations share the two major haplotypes, as well as having similar results for the neutrality tests. However, in Europe the possible effect of past continent-specific demographic events contributing to the observed <italic>FSHB</italic> haplotype distributions cannot be ruled out. The observed enrichment of the HAP13 in Europe compared to the other continents may have roots in its demographic history, characterized by founder effect(s) and population expansion(s) through climate changes, demic movements (migration and expansion), wars, crusades and epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Ammerman &#x00026; Sforza, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gamble <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Barbujani &#x00026; Goldstein, 2004</xref>). Interestingly the same haplotype, not the dominant HAP1, is the human gene variant most closely related to the ancestral <italic>FSHB</italic> inferred from the sequences present in all the extant great apes.</p><p>As fertility most directly affects an organism's fitness, the carriers of <italic>FSHB</italic> HAP1 and HAP13 have apparently been successful in human history at contributing to the next generation. Balancing selection has favoured the maintenance of the two human <italic>FSHB</italic> haplotypes potentially having a different effect on the mechanism of dominant follicle development, thus guaranteeing successful reproductive ability for a population in different climatic, social and economic situations. However, the functional consequences of these alternative haplotypes are still to be discovered. Based on an observation from a pilot study, we have postulated a hypothesis that <italic>FSHB</italic> gene variants may have an effect on female conception efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>What Might be the Functional Consequence of the Selected <italic>FSHB</italic> Haplotypes?</title><p>None of the polymorphisms defining the two major <italic>FSHB</italic> haplotypes, apparently enriched in human evolution due to selective advantage in reproduction, are non-synonymous mutations that would directly affect the structure of the FSHB protein. However, the analyzed SNPs may represent regulatory polymorphisms, or alternatively may be associated with polymorphisms up- or downstream of the studied region, potentially influencing transcription levels, transcript stability or alternative splicing of the mRNA. Several recent studies have highlighted the functional importance of regulatory polymorphisms, such as those that influence gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Boffelli <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Morley <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Pastinen &#x00026; Hudson, 2004</xref>) or alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Pagani &#x00026; Baralle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Sorek <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>).</p><p>The rate of transcription of <italic>FSHB</italic> is a limiting factor in the production and eventual secretion of pituitary FSH. The transcription and subsequent changes in serum FSH levels are largely controlled by the production of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) by neurons of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Culler &#x00026; Negro-Vilar, 1987</xref>). Although the human <italic>FSHB</italic> promoter has not been characterized in detail, GnRH induction of FSH production is partially dependent on AP-1&#x02013;like enhancers, known to exist in sheep and rat <italic>FSHB</italic> promoters (&#x02212;4741 to +759 relative to mRNA transcription site) that are also conserved among other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Strahl <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). Due to strong linkage disequilibrium the identified <italic>FSHB</italic> core haplotypes could have been driven to high frequency by hitchhiking with one or more unstudied upstream regulatory variants affecting gene transcription. Alternatively, the <italic>FSHB</italic> variants may be associated with alternative splicing. At least four distinct species of mRNA transcripts, all encoding identical peptides, are processed from the <italic>FSHB</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Jameson <italic>et al.</italic> 1988</xref>). Although all the <italic>FSHB</italic> mRNAs share the same transcriptional initiation site from a single promoter, alternative splicing of non-coding exon 1 provides two variants of the 5'UTR differing by 30 bp. Two different polyadenylation signals are also used: one coinciding with the stop codon and the other (used in &#x0003e;80% of transcripts) located about 1kb downstream. The functional significance of these regulatory regions and alternative mRNA products of the human <italic>FSHB</italic> gene remains a subject for future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified the presence of two core haplotypes for the human <italic>FSHB</italic> gene, and shown that the spread of these gene variants is consistent with balancing selection. Interestingly, a pilot study suggests that the second most frequent human haplotype may be associated with rapid conception. The determination of the functional consequence of the <italic>FSHB</italic> variants may have implications for understanding and regulating human fertility, as well as in assisting infertility treatments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Margus Punab for fruitful discussions on human male and female fertility issues; Dr. Robert K.
