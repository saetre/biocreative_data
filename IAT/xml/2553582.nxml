The X-ray crystal structure of the enzyme covalently joined to DNA and bound to the CPT analog Topotecan suggests that there are two classes of mutations that can produce a CPT-resistant enzyme. The first class includes changes in residues that directly interact with the drug, whereas a second class alters interactions with the DNA and thereby destabilizes the drug binding site. The Thr729Ala, that is part of a hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme C-terminal domain, belongs to a third group of mutations that confer CPT resistance, but do not interact directly with the drug or the DNA. To understand the contribution of this residue in drug resistance, we have studied the effect on hTop1p catalysis and CPT sensitivity of four different substitutions in the Thr729 position (Thr729Ala, Thr729Glu, Thr729Lys and Thr729Pro). Tht729Glu and Thr729Lys mutants show severe CPT resistance and furthermore, Thr729Glu shows a remarkable defect in DNA binding. We postulate that the maintenance of the hydrophobic pocket integrity, where Thr729 is positioned, is crucial for drug sensitivity and DNA binding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human DNA topoisomerase I is a monomeric highly conserved enzyme composed by 765 amino acids organized in four mains domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1&#x02013;214), highly disorganized, contains the nuclear localization signals and is the only region of the protein not yet crystallized; the core domain (residues 215&#x02013;635) that can be divided in three subdomains, subdomain I (residues 215&#x02013;232 and 320&#x02013;433), II (residues 233&#x02013;319) and III (residues 434&#x02013;635); the linker domain (residues 636&#x02013;712) composed by two protruding coiled coil &#x003b1;-helices, one of them engages direct contact with the DNA molecule; the C-terminal domain (residues 713&#x02013;765) contains the Tyr723 that performs a nucleophilic attack to the 3&#x02032;phosphate of the DNA, forming a transient covalent protein&#x02013;DNA complex that is resolved by a second transesterification mediated by the 5&#x02032;-OH of the scissile DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). The topoisomerase I is a bi-lobed protein that clamps completely around duplex DNA through protein&#x02013;DNA phosphate interaction. One lobe is constituted by the C-terminal catalytic domain and core subdomain III, the other one (called &#x02018;cap&#x02019;) by core subdomains I and II. Human DNA topoisomerase I has a medical relevance because it is the natural target of plant alkaloid camptothecin (CPT) whose derivatives are frequently used as anticancer drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7">4&#x02013;7</xref>). CPT interacts reversibly with the enzyme blocking the DNA&#x02013;protein complex after the cleavage, slowing the religation and causing severs damages to the DNA. Furthermore, replication forks progression can generate double-strand breaks inducing apoptotic response. A number of mutations that renders the enzyme resistant to the CPT have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Some of them are located near to the active site and in any case around the CPT binding site or contacting directly the DNA molecule, few other mutations are located far from the active site (Ala653Pro, Glu418Lys) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), influencing the dynamic of the protein&#x02013;drug interaction and modifying the intradomain interactions.</p><p>The X-ray crystal structure of human topoisomerase I covalently joined to double-stranded DNA and bound to the CPT analog Topotecan (TPT) does not explain all mutations that affect CPT sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The Thr729Ala mutation has been firstly identified to impart drug resistance on human topoisomerase I in the CPT-11 (Irinotecan, a CPT analog) resistant human lung cancer cell line, PC-7/CPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) but our data reveal that the equivalent effect with CPT can not be observed if the enzyme, harboring the same mutation, is expressed in the yeast <italic>Saccaromyces cerevisiae</italic>. Interestingly, looking at the protein structure, Thr729 seems to be too distant to contact the drug directly and it is not clear how the structure or stability of the intercalation drug-binding pocket is affected by the mutation. The Thr729 resides in the hydrophobic core of the C-terminal domain 12.4 &#x000c5; from the catalytic tyrosine and 13.1 &#x000c5; from Asn722 that establishes a water-mediated contact directly to the drug. Changing the Asn722 to Ser, shortening the side chain, is sufficient to impart CPT resistance to the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). According to these data, Redinbo and co-authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) assumed that the basis of the Thr729 mutants CPT resistance come from the destabilization of the C-terminal region that could lead to the specific shift in position of Asn722, consequentially inducing the breakage of the water-mediated contact with the drug.</p><p>In order to confirm these hypotheses, we analyzed the effect of Thr729 substitutions to Lys, Pro and Glu on the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> catalytic activity and drug sensitivity of the human DNA topoisomerase I. These three substitutions were chosen for their positive or negative charge, Lys and Glu, respectively, and for their capability in distorting the &#x003b1;-helix as in the case of Pro. Our results show that the 729 position is a key point in maintaining the correct geometry of the hydrophobic pocket of the C-terminal domain. In fact, even if the enzyme keeps on its catalytic properties and its sensitivity to CPT in the presence of a Thr729Ala mutation, a dramatic CPT resistance effect could be observed when the Thr729 was mutated to Lys or Glu, and a minor consequence could be seen in the presence of a Pro. Furthermore, the Thr729Glu mutant shows a remarkable defect in the DNA binding indicating that the integrity of the C-terminal geometry is essential for the preservation of the correct interactions between the enzyme and its substrate during the progression of the catalytic cycle. Dynamic simulation experiments described in the accompanying paper, propose a structural and dynamical interpretation for the role played by residue 729 in these long-range protein&#x02013;DNA communications (Chillemi <italic>et al</italic>.)</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Camptothecin (Sigma-Aldrich, Europe) was dissolved in Me<sub>2</sub>SO to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C.

Serial dilutions of equal protein concentrations were incubated with negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA and the reaction products resolved in agarose gels. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, at optimum salt condition for the wild-type enzyme (i.e. 150 mM), the specific activity of htopIThr729Glu was significantly reduced, while htop1Thr729Ala, htop1Thr729Pro and htop1Thr729Lys show an overall activity quite comparable to that of hTop1p. The observed reduction of htop1Thr729Glu specific activity could result from several alterations in enzyme catalytic cycle, including DNA association, cleavage, strand rotation and ligation. To discriminate between these possibilities, we analyzed step by step the catalytic cycle of the mutants and compared it to that of the wild-type enzyme. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Thr729 mutants are catalytically active <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Deviations from this value have previously been shown to correspond to increased or decreased DNA binding, for salt optimum more or less than 150 mM, respectively. Limiting amounts of hTop1p or htop1 mutants were incubated in plasmid relaxation assays containing increasing concentrations of KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The percentage of relaxed plasmid DNA topoisomers produced ([relaxed DNA topoisomers]/[relaxed + supercoiled DNA topoisomers]) following incubation with the enzymes was quantified and plotted as a function of salt concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Thr729 mutants display significant differences in their requirements for optimum of KCl concentration. In fact, while htopIThr729Ala shows a maximum in the catalytic activity comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme (150 mM KCl), DNA relaxation catalyzed by htop1Thr729Pro and htop1Thr729Lys was enhanced at lower salt concentrations (100 mM KCl). The minimum KCl concentration is shown by the Thr729Glu mutant where the optimum is reached at 25 mM KCl.

For example, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, hTop1p cleavage of a high affinity site within a suicide DNA substrate liberates a dinucleotide and traps the covalent hTop1p&#x02013;DNA complexes. In the presence of hTop1p, religate DNA molecules accumulate very rapidly in the absence of CPT, whereas the rate of DNA religation is dramatically reduced in the presence of CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). In contrast, the rate of DNA religation was substantially enhanced in the case of the htop1Thr729Pro or htop1Thr729Lys. We also tested the htop1Thr729Glu kinetic of religation using the described suicide DNA substrate and other substrates that differ for length and nucleotide sequence. We were unable to detect any cleavage of suicide DNA substrates in the absence and in the presence of an annealed religation strand. These data are consistent with a decrease in mutant enzyme binding to DNA. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Analysis of the religation rate using a suicide substrate.

To address this point, we analyzed the kinetics of DNA relaxation of the three CPT-resistant mutants htop1Thr729Pro, htop1Thr729Lys and htop1Thr729Glu, compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. The experiments were conducted in the presence of 150 mM KCl, using equal protein amounts with an excess or a deficit of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA compared to the enzyme (DNA/enzyme ratio 3 : 1 or 1 : 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). In the presence of excess DNA, all the enzyme molecules are assumed to interact with the substrate. In these conditions, the speed of the relaxation activity can be expressed as a function of the enzyme <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, both the htop1Thr729Lys and htop1Thr729Glu enzymes relax the DNA more slowly than wild-type accomplishing the same final relaxation level. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Time course of plasmid DNA relaxation catalyzed by hTop1p, htop1Thr729Pro, htop1Thr729Lys and htop1Thr729Glu.

The reaction mixtures were applied to a nitrocellulose filter and the amount of DNA retained was counted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B shows the percent of bound DNA as a function of the enzyme concentration. As it can be appreciated, the amount of DNA bound by the three mutant proteins was significantly reduced relative to the wild-type. Coherently with the reduced catalytic activity observed in the relaxation assays and in the DNA cleavage assay, the DNA binding profile obtained with the single mutant htop1Thr729Lys and htop1Thr729Glu proves that changes in the hydrophobic properties of the C-terminal region of the enzyme radically affect the DNA binding/DNA dissociation equilibrium by hTop1p. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>DNA-binding assay.

Few of them involve residues making direct contacts with the drug, many others cluster in the Lips region between the CAP (subdomain I and II) and CAT (subdomain III and C-terminal domain) regions. Some others are located in the CAT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Some of these mutations alter the enzyme catalytic cycle giving important clues on enzyme activity.</p><p>The Thr729 to Ala substitution that has been isolated in a CPT11 resistant tumor cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) is located in the C-terminal domain and its side chain forms a 2.6-&#x000c5; hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr619. This interaction stabilize the contacts between the C-terminal and core subdomain III regions of the CAT, that extends from the top half of the molecule downward by a couple of long helices (8 and 9) functioning as an hinge that opens and closes the enzyme around DNA. Thr729 and Tyr619 are positioned respectively in &#x003b1;-helix 21 and &#x003b1;-helix 17 that together with helix 16 constitute a hydrophobic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). This three-helix structure bridges the linker, the active site region and the hinge. In addition, as discussed by Chrencik <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), the Thr729 residue could have an important role in the geometry of the enzyme C-terminal region. In the X-ray structure, in fact, Thr729 forms a water-mediated contact with the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of Asp725 and is positioned on the same &#x003b1;-helix of the Asn 722 residue, which interacts with the CPT through a water-mediated bond.</p><p>Our analyses of Thr729 mutations in human Top1p, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, support this model but suggest that the charge and geometry of amino acid side chains at this position, directly impact the active site architecture and the sensitivity of hTop1p to CPT.</p><p>Surprisingly the substitution Thr729Ala, when tested in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> yeast system, did not show any level of drug resistance as in the tumor cell line.</p><p>Our results clearly indicate that the introduction of a basic or an acidic side chain (Thr729Lys or Thr729Glu) changes the quality of DNA binding, rendering in this case the enzyme CPT resistant. In fact, the Thr729Glu mutation completely abolish DNA binding, while the Thr729Lys substitution can still bind to DNA but with a reduced affinity if compared to the wild-type enzyme.</p><p>In contrast, when the Thr729 was substituted by a hydrophobic residue as Ala or Pro, the same effect was not observed. The Thr729Ala mutation shows CPT sensitivity comparable to that of the wild-type without any observable alterations in the specific catalytic activity, both in the plasmid DNA relaxation and in cleavage/religation assays.</p><p>The replacement of Thr729 by Pro, a residue that could distort the &#x003b1;-helix, reduces the enzyme sensitivity to CPT with a less extent than the two polar substitutions Thr729Lys and Thr729Glu. Taken together, our data support the idea that changing the hydrophobic interactions between helices 16, 17 and 21, by the addition of a charged residue, must have a dramatic effect in enzyme stability. It has been previously demonstrated that topo58, a C-terminal deletion of topo70, but comprising the core subdomain III, is still able to bind DNA with the same affinity than the topo70 enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). It is quite surprising that a single hydrophilic substitution in the C-terminal may have such a dramatic effect on DNA binding.</p><p>The results reported in the accompanying paper reinforce our data showing a different dynamic behavior for the Thr729Pro and the Thr729Lys mutants, if compared to the wild-type protein. In fact, while in the presence of the Thr729Lys mutation some high fluctuations in the region comprising helices 16 and 17 has been observed, the same region shows a reduction of mobility in the Thr729Pro mutant.</p><p>Moreover, the evidence that CPT has little effect on the rate of DNA religation by Thr729Pro and Thr729Lys mutants, suggests that their alterations in protein&#x02013;DNA interaction can also affect drug binding to the covalent complex.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, panel C2, in the wild-type protein a direct hydrogen bond between helix 21 and helix 17 is formed by the Thr729 and Tyr619. The results obtained by the dynamic simulation described in the accompanying paper have shown that in the case of the Thr729Pro mutant the direct hydrogen bond became lost without altering the relative positions of the two helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, panel D2). On the contrary, the Thr729Lys mutation provokes a more dramatic effect. As it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, panel B2, the loss of the direct hydrogen bond is followed by the moving away of helix 21 from helix 17 with a direct effect on the drug-binding pocket. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Structure modifications induced by the Thr729 mutations.

In fact, while htopIThr729Lys shows an increase in the rate of DNA religation in the absence of CPT, the activity of htopIThr729Pro is comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme in the same conditions. The addition of CPT dramatically reduces the religation rate for the wild-type protein, but does not show any effect in the case of htopIThr729Lys and a mild reduction for the htop1Thr729Pro.</p><p>In addition, topIThr729Glu was unable to cleave any suicide substrate used in our assays supporting the hypothesis that the drug resistance is due to the reduced DNA binding.</p><p>The kinetics of DNA relaxation in the presence of an excess of substrate, displays a distributive mode of action both for htopIThr729Lys and htopIThr729Glu. The same results cannot be observed in the presence of an excess of protein. In these conditions, only htopIThr729Glu relaxed DNA distributively while htopIThr729Lys restored its processivity. This data are strongly supported by the binding assay, where htop1Thr729Glu was unable to bind the given substrate independently by the protein concentration.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that the flexibility of the linker domain affects the geometry of the active site influencing the DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium of the enzyme and the CPT sensitivity through long-range conformational contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>In addition, a dynamic coupling between the linker domain flexibility and the active site of hTop1p may also be inferred from X-ray structures of Topo70 in the presence and the absence of the CPT analog TPT, where the flexibility of the linker domain prevents its structural determination. However, in the ternary Topo70&#x02013;DNA&#x02013;TPT complex, the structure of the linker domain could be resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>A detailed comparison of the ternary structure of the Topo70&#x02013;DNA covalent complex in the presence and absence of TPT shows that helix 16 is half a turn shorter in the absence of the drug. In the presence of TPT Thr606 and Trp732, sited on the helices 16 and 21, respectively, forms an hydrogen bond between Trp732 and Thr606 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B) that is lost in the absence of the drug, where Thr606 is positioned in the misfolded part of the helix 16. The data described in the accompanying paper show that this interaction is similarly lost in the htop1Thr729Lys dynamic simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, panels B1, C1 and D1) where a partial destructuration of the helix 16, has been observed.</p><p>It is interesting to observe that the linker domain is directly connected to the hydrophobic pocket formed by helices 16, 17 and 21 by two long flexible loops that extend from the two coiled-coil towards helix 17 directly and helix 21 via the catalytic Tyr region. This coordinated structure could be strongly influenced by the radical change imposed by the introduction of charged residues. The dynamic cross-correlation map of the htop1Thr729Pro and htop1Thr729Lys mutants compared to that of the wild-type, described in the accompanying paper, show a dramatic change in the protein dynamics. In fact, while in the wild-type protein the linker and the C-terminal domains move in an anticorrelated way, the Thr729Lys mutation abolishes this motions and the Thr729Pro provokes an increased rigidity in the same domains.</p><p>Taken together, the experimental and the simulation data indicate that a single change in a crucial residue may alter dramatically the behavior of DNA topoisomerase IB, giving important clues on its dynamic mode of action.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn557/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Ministero dell&#x02019;Istruzione, dell&#x02019;Universit&#x000e0; e della Ricerca, Cofinanziamento 2005&#x02013;2007; Ministero della Salute.
