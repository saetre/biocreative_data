Given that we are analysing a population of parasites expressing a range of <italic>var</italic> genes it was not possible to conclude from our initial analysis whether the absence of PfSir2A and B function results in a greater frequency of switching or a breakdown in the mutually exclusive program by the derepression of multiple <italic>var</italic> genes in a single parasite. To discern between these possibilities parasites were selected for adherence to CSA, which is mediated by a PfEMP1 protein encoded by the <italic>var2csa</italic> gene (3D7 genome: PFL0030c) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, and determined the transcriptional levels of the <italic>var</italic> gene repertoire. Selection of &#x00394;PfSir2A and &#x00394;PfSir2B parasites on CSA allowed us to determine the integrity of <italic>var</italic> gene mutual exclusion in a &#x00394;PfSir2A and &#x00394;PfSir2B genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-1000084-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Disruption of PfSir2 Paralogues Destroys Mutual Exclusive Expression of <italic>var</italic> Genes</title><p>In wildtype parasites selection on CSA enriches for parasites exclusively expressing <italic>var2CSA</italic>.

R1945 percentage positivity and negativity are separated on the basis of fluorescence levels of uninfected erythrocytes. Selection on CSA of 3D7 (3D7&#x0005f;CSA) greatly enhances the reactivity to R1945 serum and is comparable to the CS2 parasite line that stably expresses <italic>var2CSA</italic>. Given that &#x00394;PfSir2A already expresses <italic>var2CSA</italic> in the absence of selection it is not surprising that CSA selection of this parasite line (&#x00394;PfSir2A&#x0005f;CSA) does nothing (if anything a negative effect) to the binding of R1945 serum. &#x00394;PfSir2A parasites show an intermediate binding of R1945 reactivity suggesting that they have lower levels of VAR2CSA on their surface. Selection of &#x00394;PfSir2B parasites on CSA (&#x00394;PfSir2B&#x0005f;CSA) also greatly enhanced R1945 binding to infected erythrocytes suggesting the &#x00394;PfSir2B parasites are a heterogenous pool and are not confined to expressing only UpsB-driven <italic>var</italic> genes.</p><p>(B) As expected qPCR of <italic>var2CSA</italic> (PFL0030c) transcript levels shows a dramatic increase upon CSA selection on 3D7 and &#x00394;PfSir2B parasites, but not &#x00394;PfSir2A.</p><p>(C) Mutual exclusive expression of <italic>var</italic> genes is broken down in the absence of both PfSir2A and PfSir2B. As expected, 3D7&#x0005f;CSA mainly expresses <italic>var2CSA</italic> and while other <italic>var</italic> genes are only at a very low levels (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000084-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). However, when compared to 3D7&#x0005f;CSA, PfSir2-disrupted parasites, not only express <italic>var2CSA</italic> but also express many other <italic>var</italic> genes at much higher level than 3D7&#x0005f;CSA does (silenced state). This finding strongly suggests that mutual exclusive expression has broken down in these parasites. Interestingly, expression of <italic>var</italic> genes in the Sir2-disrupted lines selected on CSA also shows a bias towards <italic>var</italic> genes with certain promoter types thus confirming by another method our earlier findings.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000084.g005"/></fig><p>3D7, &#x00394;PfSir2A, and &#x00394;PfSir2B were selected for high levels of CSA adherence to produce the lines 3D7&#x0005f;CSA, &#x00394;PfSir2A&#x0005f;CSA, and &#x00394;PfSir2B&#x0005f;CSA.

The level of VAR2CSA expression for 3D7&#x0005f;CSA was comparable to CS2, a parasite line that more stably expresses this PfEMP1 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The &#x00394;PfSir2A parasites transcribe elevated levels of <italic>var2csa</italic> along with other <italic>var</italic> genes controlled by UpsA and E promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, consequently it was not surprising that &#x00394;PfSir2A&#x0005f;CSA parasites expressed similar levels of VAR2CSA on the surface of infected erythrocytes compared to &#x00394;PfSir2A&#x0005f;CSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). It should be noted that by scatter plot PfSir2A-disrupted parasites do not bind as much anti-VAR2CSA antibody suggesting that they have less VAR2CSA on their surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). In contrast, &#x00394;PfSir2B parasites do not express VAR2CSA as anti-VAR2CSA binding to the parasite-infected erythrocyte was low. However, upon CSA selection &#x00394;PfSir2B&#x0005f;CSA-infected erythrocytes had high levels of anti-VAR2CSA (R1945) reactivity, suggesting these parasites retain the capacity to activate expression of other PfEMP1 antigenic types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>To address the role of PfSir2A and B on <italic>var</italic> gene switching and monoallelic exclusion at the transcriptional level qPCR was performed with cDNA from 3D7, &#x00394;PfSir2A, and &#x00394;PfSir2B parasites before and after CSA selection to determine alterations in transcription of this gene family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">5</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000084-st001">Table S1</xref>). As expected the <italic>var2csa</italic> gene in 3D7 was dramatically increased in transcription after selection in 3D7&#x0005f;CSA, which correlated with increased reactivity to VAR2CSA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. All other <italic>var</italic> genes were down regulated to apparently basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figures 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000084-sg005">S5</xref>) consistent with an intact mutually exclusive <italic>var</italic> expression program. Given that &#x00394;PfSir2A already expresses <italic>var2csa</italic> at high levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, selection on CSA did not substantially affect its level of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Interestingly, and in concordance with the anti-VAR2CSA antibody binding, selection of &#x00394;PfSir2B parasites on CSA dramatically increases <italic>var2csa</italic> transcription in these parasites 5&#x02013;10-fold compared to 3D7&#x0005f;CSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). These results suggest that loss of PfSir2B function has not disrupted the ability of these parasites to activate specific silenced <italic>var</italic> genes.</p><p>To determine if the PfSir2 paralogues play a role in control of mutually exclusive expression, the transcription of <italic>var</italic> genes was analysed before and after selection for adherence to CSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Given that all <italic>var</italic> genes except <italic>var2csa</italic> are silenced in 3D7 parasites selected on CSA, this analysis was used as a benchmark for the <italic>var</italic> gene silenced state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figures 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000084-sg005">S5</xref>). Comparing the expression of <italic>var</italic> genes in &#x00394;PfSir2-disrupted parasites selected on CSA with 3D7&#x0005f;CSA parasites it can be seen that in both &#x00394;PfSir2A&#x0005f;CSA and &#x00394;PfSir2B&#x0005f;CSA express multiple <italic>var</italic> genes at higher levels than 3D7&#x0005f;CSA. Indeed, some <italic>var</italic> genes in &#x00394;PfSir2A and &#x00394;PfSir2B are expressed higher than in 3D7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000084-st001">Table S1</xref>). These data suggest that mutually exclusive expression of <italic>var</italic> genes has broken down in the absence of PfSir2 paralogues and thus both these molecules play a critical role in the control of mutually exclusive expression of <italic>var</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). It is also worth noting that &#x00394;PfSir2A&#x0005f;CSA and &#x00394;PfSir2B&#x0005f;CSA infected erythrocytes can bind to CSA and CD36 and this together with anti-VAR2CSA antibody reactivity is consistent with expression of multiple PfEMP1 variants on individual infected erythrocytes and the breakdown of mutual exclusion (unpublished data). Both before and after selection of &#x00394;PfSir2A and &#x00394;PfSir2B for CSA adherence a similar pattern of <italic>var</italic> gene transcription was observed consistent with an important role for PfSir2A and PfSir2B in silencing of specific <italic>var</italic> gene subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000084-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Using this type of analysis it also looks as though PfSir2A and PfSir2B can have an effect on the transcription of the same <italic>var</italic> gene suggesting that they are acting cooperatively rather than exclusively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). For example, UpsB-driven <italic>var</italic> genes are largely regulated by PfSir2B, however, using qPCR and CSA selection PfSir2A clearly has an effect on UpsB controlled gene transcription (greater log<sub>2</sub> value) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). The reciprocal is true for UpsA and UpsC <italic>var</italic> genes where parasites lacking PfSir2B function transcribe greater levels of UpsA <italic>var</italic> genes compared to the same genes silenced in 3D7 parasites. This result suggests that PfSir2 paralogues act cooperatively to control the transcription of individual <italic>var</italic> genes and warranted further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>PfSir2 Paralogues Have a Direct Effect on the Silencing of <italic>var</italic> Gene Promoters</title><p>Previously, we showed that the default state of a <italic>var</italic> promoter is silenced and stochastic activation occurs at low frequency &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.

Plasmids also contained the blasticidin-S deaminase (<italic>bsd</italic>) gene driven by the constitutive <italic>hsp86</italic> promoter for selection of transfected parasites (pUpsB/hDHFR and pUpsC/hDHFR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).</p><fig id="pbio-1000084-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>PfSir2 Paralogues Directly Regulate <italic>var</italic> Gene Promoters and Contribute to Spreading of Transcriptional Silencing into Neighbouring Regions</title><p>(A) Plasmids bearing two expression cassettes were introduced into 3D7, &#x00394;PfSir2A, and &#x00394;PfSir2B parasites. The <italic>bsd</italic> cassette is driven by the housekeeping <italic>hsp86</italic> promoter, which provides a selection mechanism for parasites stably maintaining episomes. UpsB and UpsC <italic>var</italic> promoters were placed in front of the selectable marker <italic>hdhfr</italic> and therefore <italic>var</italic> promoter activity can be monitored.

Both PfSir2 paralogues can directly affect the activity of a <italic>var</italic> promoter strongly suggesting that PfSir2 paralogues do not function independently of one another on different <italic>var</italic> promoters but rather cooperate to regulate expression. In both subtelomeric and internally derived <italic>var</italic> promoters isolated from their natural context PfSir2B has a larger effect on the suppression of <italic>var</italic> promoter activity.</p><p>(C) PfSir2A and PfSir2B control the spreading of silencing from <italic>var</italic> promoters. Upon activation of the downstream <italic>var</italic> promoter activity of <italic>bsd</italic> expression cassette increases suggesting that factors that normally silence <italic>var</italic> gene promoters can spread in <italic>cis</italic> to modulate expression of neighbouring regions. In the absence of both PfSir2A and PfSir2B spreading of silencing is reduced suggesting that both paralogues mediate the spreading of silencing from both internal and subtelomerically derived <italic>var</italic> gene promoters. In both cases PfSir2B has a greater influence on spreading of silencing to within the <italic>bsd</italic> cassette. qPCR was performed on three biological replicates harvested from ring-stage parasites. 95&#x00025; confidence error bars derived from a calculated standard error are also displayed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000084.g006"/></fig><p>In 3D7-pUpsB/hDHFR and 3D7-pUpsC/hDHFR, selection with the antifolate WR99210 provided a parasite population expressing activated versions of the UpsB and UpsC promoters respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.

These results demonstrate that PfSir2-mediated silencing can act directly on <italic>var</italic> promoters and does not require <italic>cis-</italic>spreading of silenced chromatin from neighbouring telomeres as is observed in Sir2-mediated subtelomeric silencing in yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, this analysis shows that both Sir2 paralogues play a role in the silencing of individual <italic>var</italic> promoters, as first observed earlier in qPCR of <italic>var</italic> genes in PfSir2-disrupted lines selected on CSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Interestingly, loss of either PfSir2A or B function causes only partial derepression compared to a fully activated <italic>var</italic> gene promoter, strengthening the idea that both molecules cooperate in silencing these <italic>var</italic> promoters. The absence of PfSir2B shows greater activation of the isolated UpsB <italic>var</italic> promoter (PFL0005w), strongly supporting the evidence that PfSir2B plays a greater role in the regulation of UpsB <italic>var</italic> genes than does PfSir2A. In the case of the UpsC <italic>var</italic> promoter (PFL1960w) there is a greater derepression of this promoter in the absence of PfSir2B, which is somewhat contradictory to the <italic>var</italic> qPCR and microarray analysis of the endogenous PFL1960w gene in all the cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). One possible explanation for this is slight differences in the complex regulatory network of <italic>var</italic> genes when they are located in different chromosomal contexts (i.e., internal chromosome location versus extrachromosomal episome). <italic>Var</italic> gene promotors are key to the control of mutual exclusive expression of <italic>var</italic> genes, and our results strongly implicate PfSir2 paralogues as major <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors influencing the control of these highly conserved elements.

As observed with the activation of <italic>var</italic> promoter in Sir2-disrupted lines, the effect on the upstream <italic>bsd</italic> cassette differed depending on which PfSir2 paralogue was not functional. In the case of UpsB-based plasmid we found an almost complete abrogation of silencing in the PfSir2B-disrupted line and a more mild alleviation of silencing in parasites lacking PfSir2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g006">Figure 6</xref>C).

Thus, it has been speculated that these factors are involved in telomere end protection. We reasoned that PfSir2 paralogues might be involved in this process. To assay the effect of PfSir2 paralogues on maintenance of telomere length we performed telomere restriction fragment (TRF) analysis as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

In a population of wildtype (3D7) parasites telomere repeat length varies from &#x0223c;1 kb to &#x0223c;2 kb over all chromosomes with a mean length of approximately 1.5 kb. In parasites lacking PfSir2A, but not PfSir2B an increase in telomere length is evident with an increase in mean length of 3 kb in length, approximately double the length of telomeric repeats in wildtype (3D7) and &#x00394;PfSir2B parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000084-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

At this stage it is uncertain what these bands represent in the chromosomal context. Given the fuzzy nature of chromosome ends due to variable number of telomere repeats, a likely explanation is that significant blocks of repeats have been moved to internal chromosome regions, leading to defined bands after TRF analysis.

UpsA promoters control <italic>var</italic> genes that contain unusual cytoadherance-binding phenotypes, and studies suggest that their expression is associated with disease, whereas other <italic>var</italic> genes are associated with asymptomatic infections &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000084-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;. If these findings are confirmed, then perhaps PfSir2A has a role in suppressing the exposure of this limited repertoire of unusual cytoadherance phenotypes, and PfSir2B acts more as a general mediator of silencing and protection of the mutually exclusive program. Whatever the reason, given the clear importance of PfEMP1 in antigenic variation and cytoadherance, PfSir2 paralogues and other unidentified epigenetic factors are key determinants of pathogenicity in malaria infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Phylogenetic analysis.</title><p>Sequences were aligned using ClustalX v1.83 and alignments were manually adjusted using BioEdit Alignment editor.

The genes were clustered by measuring similarity of shapes using Pearson coefficients. The unsupervised clustering program enabled us to discriminate biological clusters (ArrayMiner, OptimalDesign). ArrayMiner software searches for solutions of minimal total variance in a given number of clusters. However, unlike most other currently available methods, ArrayMiner does not rely on k-means in its search for high quality clusters as it uses a GGA optimisation process (the total variance of the clusters being minimized). To draw heatmaps, the expression values for each gene were slid vertically so that their average was zero (zero mean normalisation) then multiplied so that the length of the associated vector (square root of the sum of squares of all values) be equal to 1 (unit-norm normalisation of length 1).
