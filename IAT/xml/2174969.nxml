One of these enhancers, named N2, is responsible for the initial expression (stage 4&#x02013;4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and is activated in a large domain corresponding to the entire forebrain/midbrain and most of the hindbrain. The other, N1, drives expression in the future caudal hindbrain and spinal cord and is activated a little later (around stage 5) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060002-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060002-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

To confirm that the two proteins can interact physically, we used BiFCo assays, which further revealed that BERT, Geminin, and ERNI all bind to each other through their coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060002-g011">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060002-t001">Table 1</xref>).

It is therefore of particular interest to understand the mechanisms that regulate the location and timing of expression of this gene in the neural plate, as this process is critical for normal nervous system development.

To allow this to happen, it may be necessary for cells to retain a &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; that they have received FGF signals yet be prevented from being allocated prematurely to inappropriate fates. ERNI appears to fulfill such a role: while it is expressed, cells are multipotent, as its early domain of expression encompasses the prospective neural and mesendodermal domains as well as some nonneural ectoderm.

First, to assess the effects on endogenous expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> in the normal neural plate, constructs were introduced into the prospective neural plate at mid-primitive streak stage (stage 3&#x02013;3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and the embryos incubated about 6&#x02013;9 h so that the embryo had reached stages 4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;7, just beyond the stages at which <italic>Sox2</italic> expression begins (4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and also because at these stages the neural plate is still open, allowing easier visualization of expanded expression. Please note that stages 4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;7 are particularly short, this entire period lasting only about 3 &#x000b1; 1.5 h at 38 &#x000b0;C. To determine whether a construct can induce ectopic expression of <italic>Sox2</italic>, two different locations were chosen. In one set of assays, the construct is introduced as a continuous line between the prospective neural plate of the embryo and the inner aspect of the extraembryonic epiblast, covering most of the prospective epidermis. In the other assay, the construct is introduced as a discrete domain within the inner third of the extraembryonic (area opaca) epiblast and the embryos incubated 12&#x02013;15 h (by which time they have reached stages 6&#x02013;9).</p><p>The reasons for choosing both of the latter two assays for induction is that extensive embryological studies have revealed differences in their reactivity to neural inducing stimuli. For example, inhibition of BMP signaling is sufficient to expand the endogenous neural plate laterally (and BMP misexpression to narrow it), but only when the territory is continuous with the embryo's own neural plate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060002-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060002-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060002-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that induction of neural markers by certain stimuli in this region requires cellular continuity with the neural plate and/or its border. On the other hand, a graft of the organizer (Hensen's node) is able to induce a complete, patterned ectopic nervous system from the extraembryonic epiblast of the inner area opaca &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060002-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060002-b029">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060002-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. A period of 9&#x02013;13-h contact is required to induce <italic>Sox2</italic> after a graft of the organizer, which is why 12&#x02013;15 h was chosen in this assay. To date, no single factor or any combination thereof has been found to mimic this activity of the organizer. It is therefore particularly important, to assess the full inducing properties of a treatment, to test its ability to induce <italic>Sox2</italic> in the area opaca.

Antibody against human SCOCO was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Kahn. This was used in whole mounts by indirect immunoperoxidase with anti-rabbit-HRP using the same method as described for GFP (see above).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Two-hybrid screens.</title><p>For two-hybrid screens with embryonic cDNA, poly-A RNA was isolated from 600 chick embryos (stage 3&#x02013;6) using the Ambion Poly(A)Pure Kit. The mRNA was used to synthesize a cDNA library which was cloned into the <italic>pMyr</italic> vector using the CytoTrap XR Library Construction Kit (Stratagene). The library was transformed into XL10-Gold Ultracompetent Cells (Stratagene). Full-length <italic>ERNI</italic> was cloned into the <italic>pSOS</italic> vector and used as bait in the CytoTrap two-hybrid screen, which was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene).</p><p>For two-hybrid screens on chick ES cells, poly-A RNA was isolated from ES cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060002-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. cDNA was synthesized using Stratagene's cDNA synthesis kit and introduced into <italic>pGAD424</italic> vector (Clontech), and this was transformed into XL1-blue MRF' bacteria by electroporation. All plasmids, yeast strains, and media used were purchased from Clontech. The bait <italic>ENS-1/ERNI</italic> coding sequence was cloned in NdeI/SalI sites of <italic>pGBKT7</italic>, introduced into AH109 yeast, and checked for lack of self-activation of the reporter. Screening was performed according to the Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech). <italic>pGAD424</italic> recombinant plasmids from 18 candidates were purified, of which seven encoded the CHCB2 protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060002-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; and all included the chromoshadow domain. The smallest one, encoding the 87 carboxy-terminal amino acids, was used in further experiments. The full <italic>ENS-1/ERNI</italic> coding sequence was cloned into <italic>pGADT7</italic> and various truncated forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060002-g005">Figure 5</xref>) subcloned into <italic>pGBKT7</italic>. Point mutations were introduced into <italic>pGBKT7:ENS-1</italic> using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and checked by sequencing. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed by rapid cotransformation of strain AH109.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Cloning of chick Geminin.</title><p>The <italic>Xenopus</italic> Geminin amino acid sequence was used to BLAST the GenBank EST database.

Briefly, 20 E7.5 mouse embryos were fixed in 4&#x00025; formaldehyde, homogenized in lysis buffer, and sonicated. Cell extracts were harvested by centrifugation, incubated overnight with an antibody against mouse Geminin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology FL-209, 5 &#x003bc;g), and then immunoprecipitated with Protein-A-Sepharose. Precipitates were heated to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. The DNA fragments in the precipitates were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and EtOH precipitation and used as a template for a PCR, using the following mouse N2-specific primers: forward: AACTCTCATAGCCCTAACTGTC, reverse: CCCTCCTCTCCTAATCTCCTTATGG. After 20 cycles of amplification, one-tenth of the reaction product was used as a template for a second round of a further 20 cycles. The final PCR products were run on a 1&#x00025; agarose gel.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession
