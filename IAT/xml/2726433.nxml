Using the results obtained from the mass-spectrometric analysis as a basis to locate putative Furin cleavage sites, we identified two regions containing basic amino acids that conform to a Furin-target consensus sequence and, if cleaved, would produce a fragment of approximately 120 kDa: RLKK (amino acids 1637&#x02013;1640) and RKNK (amino acids 1667&#x02013;1670). We note, however, that neither of these sites form a perfect match to the Furin consensus sequence (Molloy et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1994). These amino acids were mutated to alanines to generate F2 Notch and F1 Notch, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006728-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We also generated two deletion constructs, F1(&#x00394;1) and F1(&#x00394;2), that remove the F1 cleavage site (RKNK) and surrounding residues. Western blot analysis of S2 cells transiently expressing these constructs demonstrated a large reduction in levels of the NTM fragment in cells expressing the F2 protein but not in cells expressing Notch proteins mutant for the F1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006728-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

These studies confirmed our observation that trafficking of the full-length F2 receptor to the cell surface was impaired, as shown by significantly reduced levels of biotinylated F2 Notch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006728-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, streptavidin blot), even though the F2 receptor was expressed to relatively high levels as assessed by probing the Western blot with the 2H antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006728-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006728-g002">2H</xref>). For technical reasons, the presence of the heterodimeric form of the wild-type Notch receptor at the cell surface could not be confirmed in this biotinylation experiment. Therefore, although a biotinylated fragment of the appropriate size for NEC is observed in the streptavidin blot (data not shown), its absence in the 2H blot prevents confirmation that it is a Notch fragment. In order to assess the integrity of the cell membrane in these experiments and, thus, exclude the possibility of labeling cytoplasmic proteins, the biotinylation status of the intracellular heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) was monitored. Hsp70 was not biotinylated, confirming that the plasma membrane remained intact during the biotinylation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006728-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These results demonstrate that mutating the RLKK site, which has been shown to prevent S1 cleavage, reduces the accumulation of Notch at the cell surface. They also offer an explanation for the absence of F2 Notch activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as its inability to reach the plasma membrane would prevent it from binding ligand on a neighboring cell.</p><fig id="pone-0006728-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006728.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Localization of mutant receptors by biotinylation.</title><p>S2 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type, F1 or F2 receptors.

The model of Notch cleavage that has developed from the accumulated evidence of many different laboratories has Notch being cleaved in its extracellular domain by Furin (S1) as it traffics to the cell surface. Upon ligand interaction, Notch is again cleaved in its extracellular domain by a metalloprotease (S2). This proteolytic event facilitates a final presenilin-dependent cleavage (S3) in the intramembrane region that is critical for nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain and signaling. The functional analysis of these events has been complicated by many factors, given that the critical quantities of the signaling fragments <italic>in vivo</italic> are, as a rule, below detectable levels, and their existence has to be inferred indirectly. It is also possible that the current model excludes other functionally relevant cleavages, as Western blot analyses of the Notch protein invariably reveal a complex cleavage pattern.</p><p>It is also important to note that some of the proteases and substrates in the Notch signaling pathway are also implicated in mutual interactions and lack stringent cleavage sites, making a genetic analysis of these processes difficult. For example, Kuzbanian is an ADAM metalloprotease that was shown to be involved in cleavage of both the Notch receptor and its ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006728-Fortini1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006728-Qi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006728-Ikeuchi1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Kuzbanian is, itself, thought to be processed and activated by the proprotein convertase Furin (Wang Yale Ph.D. thesis). Presenilin, which is well documented to cleave the Notch receptor, has been shown to cleave the receptor's ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006728-Ikeuchi1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore difficult to interpret the genetic interactions between such elements that display these complex relationships.</p><p>Given these difficulties, we reasoned that an <italic>in vivo</italic> functional analysis of S1 cleavage of the Notch receptor was required. A similar, cell culture-based approach was used in an S1 cleavage study of the human Notch1 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006728-Logeat1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This study showed that loss of S1 cleavage was accompanied by a reduction in Notch signaling and transport to the cell surface, consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> functional data. The mass-spectrometric analysis we carried out revealing the existence of NTM fragments both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and in cultured cells, and the functional analysis we performed are not in agreement with the conclusions of a study claiming that S1 cleavage is neither essential for function nor even present in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006728-Kidd1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, a region of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch including and surrounding the RLKK (F2) and RKNK (F1) sites was deleted (termed N<sup>BCLexA</sup>) and found to impair receptor trafficking to the cell surface, which is in agreement with our results for the F2 receptor. However, in the rescue experiments of the neurogenic phenotype in N null embryos, N<sup>BCLexA</sup> did display activity similar to wild-type Notch, in that it was able to suppress, although incompletely, the neurogenic phenotype, implying that some mutant receptor may actually be functional on the cell surface. In our rescue studies in which we examined two developmental contexts, the wing and the embryo, the F2 mutant receptor did not rescue the loss-of-function phenotypes. In an accompanying manuscript, Gordon et al. show that mutation of the S1 cleavage site of the human Notch 1 receptor interfered with the transport of this protein to the cell surface and its function, consistent with our observations. In contrast, mutation of the Notch 2 S1 cleavage site had no effect on transport or function.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch is closest to the mammalian Notch 1 receptor, but in the absence of structural data we cannot directly compare the <italic>Drosophila</italic> receptor with its mammalian counterpart. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the results of Gordon et al regarding Notch 1 are at face value consistent with our observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which establish, <italic>in vivo</italic>, a correlation between Notch cleavage and activity. In the absence of structural data, however, any structure/function approach, such as the one we adopted here, suffers from the possibility that the functional changes we observe in the mutant receptor (F2) are the result of incorrect protein folding rather than inhibition of the S1 cleavage <italic>per se</italic>. This caveat remains even though a similar group of mutations at the F1 site, just a few amino acids away from the F2 site, did not disrupt activity of the Notch protein in vivo. It is noted, however, that structural data obtained from an X-ray crystallographic analysis of a small region of the human Notch 2 extracellular domain suggests that amino acids within the F2 site are important for structural contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006728-Gordon1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Given that the quantity of competent receptors on the cell surface is a crucial parameter for the developmental outcome of Notch signals, the existence of processing events such as the S1 cleavage provide cells with an important layer of Notch signal control. Whether this cleavage, however, is used to modulate Notch activity in all cells remains to be determined, but given all available evidence, it seems likely that the functional significance of the S1 cleavage may vary and dependent on the developmental context.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Stephen C.
