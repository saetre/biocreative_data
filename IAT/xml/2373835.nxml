Homeostasis of T cells is regulated by two distinct modes of cell proliferation: MHC/antigen-driven rapid spontaneous proliferation (SP) and IL-7/IL-15&#x02013;dependent slow homeostatic proliferation (HP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). The definition of SP in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell homeostasis was first proposed by Min et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). In this report, we initially propose a crucial role for IL-6 in SP of naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells for inducing flora-specific colitogenic IL-17&#x02013;producing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T (Tc17) cells.</p><p>It has been reported that the disruption of the Th1/Th2 immune balance causes various immune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). However, recent discoveries suggested that a new subset of IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T (Th17) cells, rather than Th1/Th2 cells, might contribute to autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Indeed, Th17 cells have been demonstrated to be crucial for inducing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>Idiopathic IBDs, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are autoimmune diseases with symptoms including abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, and rectal bleeding. Now, these diseases are thought to be a cytokine-driven inflammation&#x02212;triggered by excess IL-12/IL-23 and IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-17 production for Crohn's disease, and excess type 2 cytokine production, chiefly IL-13, for ulcerative colitis&#x02212;that affects the large intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>Although studies have addressed the involvement of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in animal models of IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), there is little information about the possible contribution of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to the pathogenesis. In this report, we established a novel Tc17 cell&#x02013;dependent IBD model and initially demonstrated that IL-6&#x02013;dependent SP of naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells was essential for the expansion of colitogenic Tc17 cells. Thus, we propose that the control of SP of naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by anti&#x02013;IL-6R mAb will become a novel strategy for developing the therapy for autoimmune diseases.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Adoptive transfer of naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells causes severe autoimmune colitis</title><p>Severe colitis was induced by a single adoptive transfer of CD44<sup>low</sup>CD62L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells into syngeneic RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Transfer of naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells or CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells caused severe weight loss and thickening of the large intestinal wall compared with untreated control mice within 6 wk (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of colon tissue sections revealed large numbers of infiltrating cells, in addition to hemorrhagic necrosis, neoangiogenesis, and depletion of goblet cells, in the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell&#x02013;transferred mice, which were also assigned histological scores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In addition, elevation of quantitative markers for enteropathy such as serum KC, serum amyloid A (SAA), and ICAM-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> and not depicted) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) suggested that some inflammatory responses would be induced in the colon. However, it still remained unclear whether the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell&#x02013;induced pathogenesis was specific to the large intestine. To make this point clear, we examined the induction of pathogenic inflammatory responses in various organs. The pathogenic responses were observed only in the large intestine, and not in other organs such as the liver, kidney, lung, heart, and brain (unpublished data). These pathological events strongly indicated that naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells could be a critical population for the induction of autoimmune colitis under lymphopenic conditions.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Adoptive transfer of naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells into RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice causes severe autoimmune colitis.</bold> 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CD44<sup>low</sup>CD62L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from C57BL/6 mice were intravenously injected into RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

Thus, it appeared that the rapid expansion of naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to generate cytokine-producing effector CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells would be closely related with the pathogenesis of autoimmune colitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetics of SP essential for inducing pathogenic effector memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in mLNs</title><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that adoptive transfer of naive T cells into immunodeficient mice resulted in two distinct types of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). HP is driven by low-affinity self-MHC/peptide ligands and homeostatic cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), whereas SP exhibits rapid and massive proliferation induced by antigen recognition via the TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). After transfer of CFSE-labeled naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells into RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, dilution of the cellular fluorescence intensity was analyzed as an index of the cell proliferation at early stages. From a kinetics study (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), we found that SP of naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells occurred preferentially in the mLNs rather than in the pLNs within 5 d after the adoptive transfer. This rapid SP was detected neither in pLNs or mLNs at day 3. SP was not detectable in pLNs even at 7 d after CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell transfer. At day 7, the numbers of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells collected from the mLNs were much larger than those from the pLNs (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071133/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071133/DC1</ext-link>). CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells expanded by SP in mLNs but not pLNs, and rapidly acquired more characteristics of a &#x0201c;memory-type&#x0201d; phenotype, such as CD44 markers and a cytokine-producing ability, in the early stages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> and not depicted). Therefore, these cytokine-producing effector memory cells might be critical for the initiation of colitis. SP in mLNs was not detectable in the following two cases: (a) when CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells derived from OT-1&#x02013;TCR transgenic mice were transferred into RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), and (b) when RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were treated with antibiotics to deplete intestinal flora (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Moreover, it was demonstrated that SP was different from HP of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells judging from the evidence that naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells transferred into OT-1/RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited SP in mLNs, whereas HP was completely blocked in both pLNs and mLNs by endogenously existing OT-1 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Thus, these data clarified that SP, which was triggered with antibiotic-sensitive flora in mLNs via TCR, was distinct from HP induced under the influence of IL-7 and/or IL-15. Alternatively, SP was not an HP-related end stage of T cell proliferation. A previous report had indicated that adoptive transfer of naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells into lymphopenic hosts elicited no pathology, including colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). This might be because of the strain differences between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, which have genetically different predispositions in controlling their susceptibility to immune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), including our established colitis model (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Kinetics of SP essential for inducing pathogenic effector memory T cells in mLNs.</bold> 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells naive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from C57BL/6 mice were labeled with CFSE and intravenously injected into RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

We found that mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2; were significantly higher in the mLNs compared with pLNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). To evaluate the role for IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2;, as well as the homeostatic cytokines IL-7 and IL-15, in SP and HP, we performed the following experiments: (a) CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were transferred into RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice treated with anti&#x02013;IL-7R mAb; (b) IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse-derived CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were transferred into IL-15/RAG2 double-knockout mice; (c) IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were transferred into IL-15/RAG2 double-knockout mice treated with anti&#x02013;IL-7R mAb; (d) CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were transferred into RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice treated with anti&#x02013;IL-6R mAb; and (e) CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were transferred into RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice treated with anti-TGF-&#x003b2; mAb. Neither IL-7, IL-15, nor TGF-&#x003b2; contributed to SP, whereas IL-7 and/or IL-15 were involved in HP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). It was also demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2; had no effect on HP (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071133/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071133/DC1</ext-link>). Unexpectedly, however, SP was completely blocked by the administration of anti&#x02013;IL-6R mAb (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In contrast, HP was not affected by the anti&#x02013;IL-6R mAb at all (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

Deficiency of IL-17 in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells caused a remarkable suppression of pathology, including severe weight loss, thickening of the large intestinal wall, and colitogenic responses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Thus, we propose that Tc17 cells would be critical effectors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. The generation of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by SP was observed in mLNs even when IL-17<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were transferred into RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>), whereas the infiltration of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells into the colon tissues was greatly inhibited by the IL-17&#x02013;deficient condition (unpublished data). In addition, we have evidence that this colitis model was not induced when IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were transferred into RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, whereas SP of Tc17 cells was generated in mLNs (unpublished data). Therefore, IL-17 was required for the development of the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell&#x02013;dependent colitis, but IL-17 might synergistically act with IFN-&#x003b3; to induce the final colitogenic responses, including migration of effector CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and other inflammatory cells into the colon tissues. We are now investigating the critical role of both IL-17 and IFN-&#x003b3; in colitis. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>, IL-17 and IFN-&#x003b3; double-positive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are rapidly proliferated in mLNs.
