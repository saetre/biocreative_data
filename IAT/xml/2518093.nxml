To better understand the role of sequence, organization, and level of p53 on transactivation at target response elements (REs) by wild type (WT) and mutant p53, we deconstructed the functional p53 <italic>canonical</italic> consensus sequence using budding yeast and human cell systems. Contrary to early reports on binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, small increases in distance between decamer half-sites greatly reduces p53 transactivation, as demonstrated for the natural TIGER RE. This was confirmed with human cell extracts using a newly developed, semi&#x02013;<italic>in vitro</italic> microsphere binding assay. These results contrast with the synergistic increase in transactivation from a pair of weak, full-site REs in the MDM2 promoter that are separated by an evolutionary conserved 17 bp spacer. Surprisingly, there can be substantial transactivation at noncanonical &#x000bd;-(a single decamer) and &#x000be;-sites, some of which were originally classified as biologically relevant canonical consensus sequences including PIDD and Apaf-1. p53 family members p63 and p73 yielded similar results. Efficient transactivation from noncanonical elements requires tetrameric p53, and the presence of the carboxy terminal, non-specific DNA binding domain enhanced transactivation from noncanonical sequences. Our findings demonstrate that RE sequence, organization, and level of p53 can strongly impact p53-mediated transactivation, thereby changing the view of what constitutes a functional p53 target. Importantly, inclusion of &#x000bd;- and &#x000be;-site REs greatly expands the p53 master regulatory network.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Within human cells, the tumor suppressor p53 is the central node of regulation required to elicit multiple biological responses that include cell cycle arrest and death in response to stress or DNA damage, where mutations in p53 are a hallmark of cancer. As a master regulatory gene, p53 controls the action of target genes within its network by directly interacting with a widely accepted consensus DNA binding sequence, composed of two decamer &#x000bd;-sites that can be separated by up to 13 bases. While mismatches from consensus sequence are frequent, the canonical consensus sequence places a limitation upon the organization and number of target genes within the p53 transcriptional network. Using yeast and human cell systems, our goal was to further understand how the DNA sequence, DNA organization, and level of p53 expression might influence the inclusion of genes within the p53 regulatory network. We found that increases in spacer beyond a few bases greatly reduce responsiveness to p53. Importantly, we established that p53 can function from noncanonical sequences comprising only a decamer &#x000bd;-site or a &#x000be;-site. These findings further define and expand the universe of potential downstream target genes which may be regulated by p53 and bring further diversity into the p53 regulatory network.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tumor suppressor p53 (OMIM no. 191170) is a sequence-specific <italic>master regulatory gene</italic> that controls an extensive transcriptional network providing for genome integrity in response to cellular and environmental stresses or damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-Ko1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-Menendez1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. p53 differentially regulates the expression of target genes, as well as microRNAs associated with cell cycle control, apoptosis, DNA repair, angiogenesis, senescence and carbon metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-Chang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-RaverShapira1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the findings may be skewed towards stronger p53 interacting sequences or influenced by the agent used to induce p53 protein, as well as the human cell lines examined.

While such algorithms may guide the identification of p53 binding sites in the genome, they cannot assess the strength of p53 binding to these sequences. The ability of p53 to bind (and presumably transactivate from) a sequence is often related to compliance with the canonical consensus sequence where each position in the motif is assumed to be equivalent and mutually exclusive in terms of affecting p53 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-Li1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

For these noncanonical REs the surrounding sequence does not resemble a p53 binding sequence and the motif itself would not be recognized within standard descriptions of a p53 canonical consensus sequence. Within the yeast system, we have addressed not only the ability of p53 to function from specific target sequences (<italic>i.e.</italic>, on/off), but also the extent of transactivation from these sites at variable levels of expression. These studies have been extended to transactivation capacity and p53 promoter occupancy in a human cell system, and the <italic>in vivo</italic> functionality evaluations were compared with results obtained in a recently developed semi-<italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay using human cell nuclear extracts.

The ability of WT p53 to transactivate was measured with the diploid yeast luciferase assay 24 hours post inoculation into the galactose-supplemented media. Induction from each RE was compared relative to the ability of p53 to transactivate from the p21-5&#x02032; RE at 0.024&#x00025; galactose and is depicted as the mean and SEM of 6 independent experiments. The average light units/&#x000b5;g protein from p21-5&#x02032; at 0.024&#x00025; galactose was 2.1 million. Solid arrows indicate a &#x000bc;-binding site. (B) p53 functions from a &#x000be;-site RE in the PIDD RE. Removal of the natural 8 bp spacer increased transactivation as expected; however, p53 was also able to transactivate from the natural PIDD RE containing the spacer. To determine the true functional p53 binding element, the canonical PIDD RE was broken into two noncanonical sites, &#x000be; PIDD-A and &#x000be; PIDD-B, which incorporated the spacer sequence into the RE and assessed for transactivation capacity with the luciferase assay.

As expected, removal of the 8 nt spacer between the decamer half-sites increased the levels of p53 transactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000104-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Examination of the PIDD RE sequence suggested that rather than functioning from a canonical full-site RE, p53 might transactivate from a noncanonical &#x000be;-site RE. The canonical PIDD element was first separated into two noncanonical &#x000be;-site REs (designated PIDD &#x000be; A and PIDD &#x000be; B), both of which utilized the &#x0201c;spacer&#x0201d; sequence as part of the binding element. The noncanonical REs were comprised of a &#x000bc;-site directly adjacent to a &#x000bd;-site, but differed in the central CWWG motif in the half-site and number of mismatches from the consensus binding sequence. Transactivation assays revealed p53 could function from the PIDD &#x000be; A sequence to levels equivalent to the canonical PIDD RE containing the 8 nt spacer at high expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000104-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, WT p53 could not transactivate from the PIDD &#x000be; B RE. These findings showed that the PIDD RE was neither a true canonical consensus RE nor an exception to the &#x0201c;spacer&#x0201d; rule, but rather a noncanonical &#x000be;-site RE which can support p53 transactivation.</p><p>The results of the PIDD RE sequence analysis suggested that other known p53 REs previously identified as canonical full-site REs are actually &#x000be;-site REs.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000104-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, the REs of p21-3&#x02032;, PCNA, 14-3-3&#x003c3; (site 2) and Apaf-1 REs were actually comprised of a genuine &#x000be;-site binding element (containing a &#x000bd;-site directly adjacent to a &#x000bc;-site) followed by an additional sequence that vastly deviated from a consensus &#x000bc;-site. Luciferase assays in the diploid yeast strains revealed that p53 transactivation from these sites was clearly reduced in comparison to transactivation of p21-5&#x02032; RE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000104-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), but comparable to the levels of transactivation from the consensus &#x000be;-site REs, Con J and Con K (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000104-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

Transactivation from the PIDD &#x000be; A RE, but not the PIDD &#x000be; B reinforces the requirement for a strong core element for functionality and that a functional RE cannot contain greater than 3 mismatches within a half-site. There are likely to be many functional &#x000be;-site REs in the genome, among which are sequences that were originally considered as canonical, full-site REs containing &#x0003e;2 nt spacers. Furthermore, as recently pointed out in our functional conservation analysis of p53 REs from several species, there are clear examples of weaker, apparently noncanonical &#x000be;-site REs, such as p21-3&#x02032; and APAF1 being conserved in evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-Jegga1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While this report is the first to systematically evaluate p53 function from noncanonical &#x000bd;- and &#x000be;-site REs, there are other reports of a transcription factor binding to noncanonical binding sites within the genome.

The organization and arrangement of binding motifs, as well as the level of p53 expression, have a large impact on the ability of p53 to transactivate from a RE sequence. It is interesting that p53 may not function from reported canonical consensus REs yet functions from noncanonical REs that are common to the human genome. Half-sites and spacers between full-sites may provide additional levels of regulation in p53 transcriptional network. Truly functional REs may be restricted to decamers separated by &#x0003c;3 nucleotides. When the spacer increases beyond 3 nucleotides, we suggest p53 recognizes the half-sites as separate binding entities.</p><p>The ability of p53 to function from noncanonical decamer half-sites introduces a new realm of target sequences and genes into the p53 transcriptional network and expands the universe of p53 regulated genes. Noncanonical sequences might provide p53 responsiveness at high levels of expression or in combination with other transcription factors, as for the case of the <italic>FLT-1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-Menendez4">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>.

Determining the relationship between expression levels and responsiveness at canonical and noncanonical target sequences is important in understanding how p53 implements cellular fate in response to stress, such as cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. It is also important for addressing the consequences of p53 alterations, particularly those mutations that retain transactivation capabilities, as well tailoring individual therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Construction of Isogenomic Diploid Yeast Strains Containing p53 Inducible Reporters</title><p>The site-directed mutagenesis system, <italic>delitto perfetto</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-Storici1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-Storici2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> was used to generate a panel of isogenic &#x0201c;p53-host&#x0201d; strains and a panel of response element (RE) reporter strains in the budding yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

(A) The ability of p53 to transactivate from the consensus 3/4-site REs, Con J and Con K were determined in the haploid yeast system, as described in Inga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-Inga2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability of WT p53 to transactivate from the 3/4-site REs was measured 24 hours post inoculation into the galactose-supplemented media by a luciferase assay. The ability of WT p53 to transactivate from each 3/4-site RE was compared to the ability of WT p53 to transactivate from the p21-5&#x02032; RE at 0.128&#x00025; galactose. Transactivation is depicted as the light units/&#x000b5;g protein and presented as the mean and standard deviation of 3 independent experiments. The average light units/&#x000b5;g protein from p21-5&#x02032; at 0.128&#x00025; galactose was 2.9 million. Solid arrows indicate a 1/4-binding site.

The plasmid-based haploid yeast system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000104-Inga2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> was utilized to determine the sequence requirements for transactivation from noncanonical 3/4-site REs at high expression levels (0.128&#x00025; galactose). The central core &#x0201c;CWWG&#x0201d; motif was altered from CATG to CTTG and flanking regions were changed as described.

To exclude the possibility that variation in transactivation capacity towards the canonical and noncanonical REs by mutant p53 was due to variable protein levels, the relative expression of p53 mutants was compared to WT p53. Western analysis was performed 24 hours following transient transfection of mock, WT p53 or mutant p53 pCMV plasmid vectors into SaOS2 cells. Thirty-five &#x000b5;g of total protein was run on 4&#x02013;12&#x00025; BisTris NuPAGE as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.
