To test p53 tumor suppressor functions in a novel experimental context, we somatically deleted both p53 alleles in multiple tissues of mice at various ages. Mice homozygously deleted for p53 at 3 months of age showed a longer tumor latency compared to mice deleted for p53 at 6 and 12 months of age. These results are consistent with a model in which tissues accumulate oncogenically activated cells with age and these are held in check by wildtype p53. We also deleted p53 before, concurrent with, and after treatment of mice with ionizing radiation (IR). The absence or presence of p53 during IR treatment had no effect on radiation-induced lymphoma latency, confirming that the immediate p53 damage response was irrelevant for cancer prevention. Even the presence of wildtype p53 for up to four weeks post-IR provided no protection against early lymphoma incidence, indicating that long term maintenance of functional p53 is critical for preventing the emergence of a cancer. These experiments indicate that sustained p53 anti-oncogenic function acts as a final or near final line of defense preventing progression of oncogenically activated cells to malignant tumors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic, epigenetic, or functional inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes is a hallmark of human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Kinzler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In response to mutagenic or oncogenic stress, p53 can induce a transient or permanent cell cycle arrest or it can induce apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Levine1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. These anti-proliferative responses of p53 prevent the emergence of a nascent cancer cell that has been activated through aberrant oncogene signaling. Oncogenic stress may activate p53 through ARF signaling or through DNA damage signaling pathways. In the traditional colorectal multi-step cancer progression model of Kinzler and Vogelstein, mutation and loss of p53 function often occurs in the transition from the adenoma stage to the malignant carcinoma stage, leading to the categorization of p53 as a &#x0201c;progression gatekeeper&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Kinzler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Macleod1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, mechanistic studies of tumor suppressor function have been facilitated by the development of genetically engineered mice with tumor suppressor gene alterations. We and others have shown that mouse cancer models with germline p53 deficiency develop many types of tumors much earlier in their lifespans compared to their p53 competent counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Donehower1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Purdie1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Numerous new mechanistic insights into p53 tumor suppressor functions have been obtained by exploiting these mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Attardi1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Lozano1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. More sophisticated methods of manipulating the mouse genome have led to models that allow spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-VanDyke1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Frese1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Some of the newer models allow somatic deletion or activation of p53 in specific tissues. Other models, discussed below, allow global activation or suppression of p53. The ability to inducibly turn p53 activity on or off provides a unique experimental flexibility in which p53 tumor suppressor function can be studied in short defined windows of time. An example is a recent paper by the Evan laboratory, which addressed the mechanisms of p53 tumor suppression function in an illuminating way. Christophorou <italic>et al</italic>. developed mice containing an inducible wildtype p53 allele on a p53 null background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Christophorou1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. When wildtype p53 was transiently induced concurrent with ionizing radiation treatment, lymphoid and intestinal tissues were observed to undergo massive p53-induced apoptosis. However, no protection from subsequent radiation-induced lymphomagenesis was observed when compared to irradiated, non-induced mice, indicating the DNA damage response was dispensable for long-term prevention of tumors due to acute stress. However, if wildtype p53 was transiently induced 8 days post-irradiation, circumventing the acute damage response and instead allowing mutations to develop, significant protection from radiation-associated lymphomas was noted as these mice survived 50&#x00025; longer. This protection was dependent on ARF, a protein that activates p53 in response to oncogenic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Kim1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the p53-mediated arrest response to oncogenic activation (even if short term) is critical for protection from cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Christophorou1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This study has been important in shifting our focus from the immediate DNA damage response mechanisms of p53 to the ARF-mediated oncogenic response of p53 when considering its primary cancer suppressive role.</p><p>In this paper, we attempted to address aspects of p53 tumor suppressor function through a novel approach. Instead of generating p53 germline mutations, we generated mice that allow global somatic deletion of one or both copies p53 at any chosen time. We homozygously deleted p53 at various time points before, concurrent with, and up to four weeks after ionizing radiation and monitored for radiation-induced lymphomas. Surprisingly, all groups of irradiated mice exhibited roughly the same median time to lymphoma formation after deletion of p53 (and much sooner than p53 deleted non-irradiated controls). Thus, even retention of p53 for up to 4 weeks post-damage may confer little or no protection from early lymphomagenesis. Instead, a sustained p53 anti-oncogenic response is required. We also examined the kinetics of spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice deleted for both p53 alleles at different ages and compared these to mice with germline deletions in both p53 alleles. As expected, we found that somatic p53 deletion delayed onset of tumors compared to those mice with germline p53 deletions, consistent with the age when p53 was deleted. However, when median tumor latencies were adjusted for time post-deletion, mice deleted for p53 at 3 months of age showed a delay in tumorigenesis relative to mice deleted for p53 at 6 and 12 months of age. We conclude that oncogenically activated cells accumulate rapidly with age in a p53-independent fashion and that wildtype p53 likely acts as a critical final or near final line of defense in suppressing these oncogenically activated clones.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Somatic deletion of p53 in mouse tissues</title><p>To examine the effects of global p53 gene deletion at specific ages in mouse tissues, we employed the strategy outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>.

To ascertain whether tamoxifen injection itself was mutagenic or carcinogenic in mice, we injected 3 month old Stratagene Big Blue transgenic mice with our standard tamoxifen injection regimen (five consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg tamoxifen in corn oil).

First, to show that p53 allele excision affects the p53-mediated apoptotic response to DNA damage, we performed TUNEL assays on tissue sections of irradiated spleens (5 hours after 5 Gy IR) from tamoxifen or vehicle-treated CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice. Tamoxifen-injected mice showed little evidence of apoptotic cells, consistent with the deletion of p53 in these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, spleen sections from vehicle-injected and irradiated CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice exhibited high levels of apoptosis, indicating that the p53-mediated response was intact in these mice.

Surprisingly, when adjusted for time post-tamoxifen injection, all four tamoxifen-treated CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> groups exhibited roughly the same median time to lymphoma formation and survival curves (p<sub>&#x02212;2:0</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.140, p<sub>&#x02212;2:&#x0002b;2</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.211, p<sub>&#x02212;2:&#x0002b;4</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.696), considerably earlier than the control mice in which wildtype p53 was deleted, but without IR treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g002">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). The steepness of the post-irradiation survival curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g002">Fig. 2D</xref> indicated very high mortality rates in tamoxifen treated and irradiated CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice compared to the tamoxifen-treated, non-irradiated CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice. Such high mortality rates were confirmed in Gompertz variable analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, where only modest mortality rate differences were observed between CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice deleted for p53 2 weeks prior to or 4 weeks after IR treatment (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.023). Both of these rates were dramatically higher than those for tamoxifen treated but non-irradiated CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0016 and p&#x0003c;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Thus, even if wildtype p53 is retained for up to four weeks after radiation, the time to lymphomagenesis is essentially the same as if p53 was absent during radiation. These results confirm the earlier data from Christophorou <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Christophorou1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> that an intact and immediate p53 DNA damage response is irrelevant to subsequent lymphoma susceptibility. However, our data indicate retention of p53 for even up to 4 weeks post-IR treatment may confer little or no protection from early lymphomagenesis. Thus, it seems that a sustained p53 anti-oncogenic response for months after the initial damage is required for full protection against early lymphomas.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice with homozygous p53 allele deletion at 3, 6, and 12 months of age</title><p>To determine the effects of losing both p53 alleles at various ages, we tamoxifen treated CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice at 3, 6, and 12 months of age.

Surprisingly, the survival curve of the 6 month tamoxifen treated CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice overlapped the 3 month cohort (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.598), and developed tumors at nearly the same mean age as the 3 month old floxed p53 mice (305 days for the 3 month cohort, 323 days for the 6 month group). The 12 month old tamoxifen-treated CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice developed tumors with a median incidence of 529 days. When we adjusted tumor-free survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) to the time of tamoxifen injection, it was clear that later excision of p53 (6 and 12 months) resulted in a reduced median tumor latency relative to excision of p53 at 3 months (p<sub>3:6</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.005, p<sub>3:12</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.014, p<sub>6:12</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.389). Moreover, the tumor-free survival curves increased in &#x0201c;steepness&#x0201d; in the later tamoxifen treated CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice, again suggesting an increase in mortality rates in the older treated mice.

Rather than examining the effects of p53 germline deletion, we chose to somatically delete p53 in multiple mouse tissues at varying ages and at varying times before, during, and after a carcinogenic insult. This approach more accurately mimics the late somatic p53 loss that often occurs in human sporadic tumors (though massive simultaneous deletion of p53 is admittedly artificial). The bi-allelic progeny of the CreERT2 Rosa26 knock-in and floxed p53 knock-in mice allowed a very precise temporal regulation of p53 deletion in most tissues of the mouse. We found that efficient deletion occurred within 24 hours of the first tamoxifen injection and that the age of injection had little effect on deletion efficiencies. While the p53 gene in tissues such as brain, heart, and eyes were inefficiently excised, the tissues most susceptible to tumors in p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (lymphoid and mesenchymal tissues) were generally quite susceptible to p53 allele excision. The tumor types observed in the somatically deleted p53 mice were very similar to those observed in p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The results presented here suggest that the incomplete p53 allele deletion in some tissues has only marginal, if any, effects on overall tumor incidence in this model.</p><p>The age-specific somatic p53 deletion experiments were designed to test whether the aging process affects p53 tumor suppressor functions. When p53 was homozygously deleted at 3, 6, and 12 months of age, median tumor latencies after p53 deletion were 171, 123, and 141 days, respectively, compared to germline deleted p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with a 128 day median tumor latency. The 6 and 12 month post deletion tumor incidence curves were significantly different from those of the mice deleted for p53 at 3 months (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.005 and 0.014, respectively). In addition to median tumor latencies being reduced in the older p53 deleted mice, mortality rates also accelerated with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). By these criteria, rates of tumor progression after p53 deletion appear to increase with age. As shown in the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, we hypothesize that these effects are the result of age-associated accumulation and progression of oncogenically activated cell clones in the mice. At three months of age, few such clones have accumulated or progressed to a stage where they can form an immediate cancer once p53 is deleted. Therefore, tumor development is delayed and mortality rates are low after p53 excision. However, by 12 months, increased numbers of oncogenically activated clones have progressed and await only the inactivation of p53 to become fully malignant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Based on the rapidity of post-deletion tumor latency in the older mice, it is likely that for some of these precancerous clones, oncogenic activation of wildtype p53 is the final or near-final barrier preventing conversion to a malignant tumor. When p53 is deleted, such clones transition to malignancy. Prior to p53 deletion oncogenic clones clearly accumulate and evolve in the presence of active wildtype p53, suggesting that the presence of p53 may have little or no effect on early neoplastic evolution, but its loss can certainly accelerate progression to malignancy.</p><fig id="pone-0006654-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006654.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>p53 acts as a gatekeeper by preventing progression of oncogenically activated cells to full malignancy.</title><p>From left to right 20 month old wildtype p53 mice, p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice with intact p53 until 3 and 12 months of age, and 6 week old irradiated p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice are shown. All of these mice accumulate oncogenically activated clones with age, though irradiation greatly enhances the numbers of such clones. Oncogenically activated clones are represented by yellow (early stage oncogenic clones that are not yet capable of tumor formation) and orange (later stage oncogenic clones capable of tumor formation upon loss of p53) circles. These clones are held in check by wildtype p53, which prevents their progression to full malignancy. However, after the age of 20 months in wildtype mice, p53 functional activities decline, which could lead to malignant progression of one or more oncogenic clones (cancers indicated by red circle). When p53 is deleted by tamoxifen injection at 3, 6, or 12 months or following IR treatment in CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice, some oncogenic clones will progress to form a malignant cancer. For the p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice, the median and maximal tumor latencies following p53 deletion decrease with age or with carcinogenic insult. The relative tumor latencies are indicated by the length of the red vertical arrows. For the wildtype mice, since p53 activity is merely reduced, malignant progression is more delayed. The small graphs below each of the tumor bearing mice shows the shape of the survival curves for each cohort, indicating that tumor latencies and mortality rates depend on p53 functional status, age, or the presence of carcinogenic insult. Thus, p53 acts as a final or near-final gatekeeper keeping these oncogenic clones from progressing to full malignancy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006654.g004"/></fig><p>One interesting result in these analyses was that the 3 month p53 deleted mice had a significant delay in median tumor incidence relative to germline p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.24&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), whereas the 6 and 12 month homozygous deletion incidence curves were not significantly different from germline p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.987 and 0.247, respectively). As one potential explanation for the tumor latency differences between the p53&#x02212;/&#x02212; and 3 month p53 deleted mice, we hypothesize that p53 has a significant protective effect on genomic integrity during embryogenesis and early postnatal development, when cell division rates are high and prone to potential chromosomal abnormalities. p53 has known roles in G2/M and mitotic spindle checkpoints and centrosome integrity and its absence would be expected to increase frequencies of chromosomal missegregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Fukasawa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Taylor1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Instead, activated wildtype p53 merely holds some of these oncogenic clones in stasis, suppressing their further malignant evolution only as long as p53 remains functional. Changes in p53 function may also explain in part why tumor incidence in wildtype mice rises dramatically with age. Levine and colleagues have recently demonstrated that p53 DNA damage responses, transcriptional activities and apoptotic functions decline significantly in older mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Feng1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, reduced p53 activity in older p53 wildtype mice could enhance progression of oncogenically activated clones to malignancy, but this progression would not be nearly as rapid as in the somatically deleted p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice, where p53 loss is immediate and complete. Moreover, the recently described cancer resistant transgenic and knock-in mice that express additional copies or more active versions of p53 could have more efficient suppression of oncogenically activated cell clones late into old age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-GarciaCao1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Maier1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Agents that induce acute DNA damage are often carcinogenic. The capacity for p53 to respond to both DNA damage and aberrant oncogenic signals suggested that both activities might be important in its tumor suppressor function following a carcinogenic insult such as ionizing radiation treatment. However, Christophorou <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Christophorou1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> showed in recent experiments on mice expressing an inducible wildtype p53 allele that the immediate p53 DNA damage response was irrelevant to prevention of radiation-induced lymphomas. Instead, the ARF-dependent p53 response to oncogenic activation was critical for delaying lymphomagenesis. Here, rather than activating p53 following treatment of mice with ionizing radiation, we deleted p53 at various time points before, concurrent with, and after irradiation. In many ways, our results confirm those of the Evan laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Christophorou1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether or not wildtype p53 was present at the time of radiation treatment had no effect on subsequent lymphoma incidence. Mice in which p53 was deleted before, during, or after IR treatment displayed the same lymphoma latency. Surprisingly, however, we found that retention of wildtype p53 for as long as four weeks post IR treatment conferred no additional protection from lymphoma than mice that were deleted for p53 two weeks prior to radiation. Mice in which p53 was deleted four weeks after IR treatment showed the same median lymphoma latency and mortality rate as did mice in which p53 was deleted two weeks before irradiation (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.696), relative to when p53 was deleted. This indicates that sustained wildtype p53 function is critical for suppressing tumorigenesis and that p53 may only keep some oncogenically activated cells in check rather than permanently disable or destroy them. This absence of wildtype p53 protective effect for up to four weeks post-IR that we observed differed from that observed by the Evan group, who showed that even a short six day activation of wildtype p53 eight days post-IR resulted in a significant delay in tumorigenesis. The reasons for the discrepancies are unclear, though they may be due to different features of the two models or that the Evan p53-ER fusion protein was a more robust tumor suppressor being activated in a cellular environment previously missing p53 entirely.</p><p>These studies support a model in which p53 acts as a &#x0201c;progression gatekeeper&#x0201d; preventing oncogenically activated cell clones from becoming fully malignant. Such cell clones progress and increase in numbers with age and p53 may act as a final or near final line of defense against cancer. It is only with old age that p53 anti-cancer function may decline and cancers may finally emerge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006654-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). We have also confirmed that the acute DNA damage response of p53 is likely to be unimportant and that a long term continuous p53 response to oncogenically activated cells is likely to be critical for cancer suppression. While p53 may prevent cancer progression by inducing apoptosis or senescence in some oncogenically activated cells, for other such clones it merely prevents further malignant evolution. The somatic p53 deletion model presented here has been a source of useful insights into p53 tumor suppressor function and it may provide additional insights through further experimental manipulations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for Baylor College of Medicine and Affiliates (Animal Protocol AN336) and by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), Guide for the Care and Use of laboratory Animals (NRC1996).</p><p>FVB.129 doubly floxed (p53<sup>F/F</sup>) mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium and were originally generated by Anton Berns as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Marino1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

The determination of mutation frequencies in the liver DNA of tamoxifen treated and non-treated Big Blue mice was performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines and the methods have previously been described in Hinkal <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-Hinkal1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4a6"><title>Lifespan analyses</title><p>All treated and non-treated mice were monitored on a daily basis for morbidity or death as previously described. Severely morbid mice were euthanized. Mice that died overnight and euthanized mice were subjected to gross necropsy and organs and tumor lesions were fixed in 10&#x00025; neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and hematoxylin and eosin slides prepared in the Veterinary Pathology Core at Baylor College of Medicine. Slides were examined and tumors were classified histopathologically as to type. Survival curve comparisons for each cohort of mice were performed using statistical software for Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis with Tarone-Ware statistics (SPSS Inc, Chicago). Mortality rates were calculated and compared as described by de Magalhaes <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006654-deMagalhaes1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, relative numbers of mouse deaths per tenth of each year were used to calculate the hazard of death with age. These data were compared to other cohort mortality rates on a natural log scale and slopes compared by t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4a7"><title>Irradiation-induced lymphomagenesis</title><p>To assess the effects of p53 allele status on radiation-induced lymphomagenesis, CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice were treated with tamoxifen for 5 consecutive days as described earlier. 5&#x02013;7 weeks old mice were subjected to 2.5 Grays whole body ionizing &#x003b3;-radiation using a Cesium-137 source (MDS Nordion GammaCell 40 Exactor) 2 weeks prior to, concurrent with, 2 weeks after, or 4 weeks after tamoxifen treatment. Mice were then regularly monitored for morbidity or death whence necropsies and tumor-free survival curves were performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4a8"><title>TUNEL assay</title><p>For assessing the effects of p53 allele status on IR-induced apoptosis, 3 month old CreERT2-p53<sup>F/F</sup> mice were injected with tamoxifen (1 mg/day) or vehicle (corn oil) for 5 consecutive days. Three weeks after the first injection, mice were either left untreated or were exposed to 5 Grays whole body &#x003b3;-irradiation. At 5 h post-irradiation, spleens were harvested and fixed in 10&#x00025; buffered formalin. Tissues were processed, paraffin embedded, and sections (5 &#x000b5;m) were cut at the Baylor College of Medicine Histology Core. Immunostaining for apoptosis was performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) as per manufacturer's instructions. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (1 &#x000b5;g/ml) and imaged at 40&#x000d7;magnification under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan2, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH) using appropriate filters. Fluorescein labeled cells were scored as positive for TUNEL staining. For each tissue section, at least 3 fields were counted and the average percentage of TUNEL positive cells from 3 spleens for every condition was plotted.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We
