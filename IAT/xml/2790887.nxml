To date, no SRS2 homologs have been described and analyzed in higher eukaryotes. Here, we report the first biochemical characterization of an SRS2 homolog from a multicellular eukaryote, the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. We studied the basic properties of AtSRS2 and were able to show that it is a functional 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-helicase. Furthermore, we characterized its biochemical function on recombinogenic intermediates and were able to show the unwinding of nicked Holliday junctions (HJs) and partial HJs (PX junctions). For the first time, we demonstrated strand annealing activity for an SRS2 homolog and characterized its strand pairing activity in detail. Our results indicate that AtSRS2 has properties that enable it to be involved in different steps during the processing of recombination intermediates. On the one hand, it could be involved in the unwinding of an elongating invading strand from a donor strand, while on the other hand, it could be involved in the annealing of the elongated strand at a later step.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Helicases are enzymes that modulate the structure of nucleic acids. To disrupt the hydrogen bonds of dsDNA, the helicases utilize the free energy of the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates. These motor proteins are known to play a role in almost every aspect of nucleic acid metabolism, including DNA replication, recombination, transcription and repair. Helicases consist of conserved helicase motifs, and they are classified by the homology and organization of those motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>).</p><p>We are interested in the mechanism of DNA repair and homologous recombination (HR) in plants, using the model organism <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In this study, we focus on the biology of the plant DNA helicase AtSRS2 and its possible role in DNA repair by HR. The yeast SRS2 helicase (<underline>S</underline>uppressor of <underline>R</underline>AD <underline>S</underline>ix-screen mutant <underline>2</underline>) belongs to the SF1 family of helicases and shows structural und functional similarities to the bacterial helicases UVRD, REP and PCRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p><italic>SRS2</italic> was first recognized as a mutant variant in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> that suppressed the repair defects of <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> mutants, which were defective in the postreplicative DNA repair (PRR) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Further studies showed a hyper-recombination phenotype of <italic>srs2</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Additionally, it was demonstrated that posttranslational modification of PCNA recruits SRS2 to stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In accordance with these data, genetic analyses also revealed that SRS2 regulates the RAD52-mediated HR in a negative way and that SRS2 removes toxic recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15 B16">12&#x02013;16</xref>). Taken together, these genetic data indicate that SRS2 can function on stalled replication forks, ensuring that recombination events do not occur or are repaired by the PRR pathway.</p><p>Several genetic studies indicate that SRS2 also plays a role in DSB repair by HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies support the hypothesis that SRS2 acts as an antirecombinase. It was shown that SRS2 prevents recombination by disrupting the RAD51 presynaptic filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Early <italic>in vitro</italic> studies focused on the analyses of the helicase activity of SRS2 on relatively simple DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Recently, the question of the biological function of the SRS2 displacement activity arose, and therefore Dupaigne <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) investigated the helicase activity on recombination intermediates that occur during HR. They found that SRS2 is indeed able to disrupt recombination intermediates and is even able to translocate along RPA coated ssDNA and that the helicase activity is stimulated by RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. These data strongly support the hypothesis that SRS2 promotes synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), thus preventing crossover events, and, moreover, they show that the strand displacement activity of SRS2 could play a role in disrupting the recombination intermediates emerging during SDSA.</p><p>The SRS2 helicase is conserved in other fungi like <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, but no other SRS2 homologs have been described in other eukaryotes until now (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28">25&#x02013;28</xref>). Although it is indicated that the human FBH1 helicase is functionally related to the yeast SRS2 protein, no sequence homolog has been found thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present the first biochemical study of an SRS2 homolog from a multicellular eukaryote, the AtSRS2 helicase from the model plant <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. We were able to demonstrate that the recombinant AtSRS2 protein is a functional DNA helicase with 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-directionality. AtSRS2 is also able to process branched structures that occur during SDSA, indicating that AtSRS2 might play a role in HR as predicted for ScSRS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Moreover, we were able to detect a new feature that has not yet been described for SRS2, namely, AtSRS2-dependent strand pairing. We conclude that the AtSRS2-dependent strand pairing activity could play a role in the re-annealing of the displaced elongated strand during SDSA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>RNA extraction, RT-PCR and RACE of AtSRS2</title><p>RNA from young Arabidopsis plantlets was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

Our RT-PCR and RACE analyses of this gene, named AtSRS2, demonstrated that it codes for a cDNA of 3664 nt. This full-length cDNA sequence includes a 56-nt 5&#x02032;-UTR and 164-nt 3&#x02032;-UTR. The protein encoded by this cDNA is 1147 amino acids long and differs from the predicted sequence of At4g25120 by three exons. The total gene consists of 29 exons, spanning a region of 7835 bp. Exon 5 is 19 amino acid longer in its 3&#x02032;-region, and exon 24 is 8 amino acid shorter in its 5&#x02032;-region, than predicted. Additionally, exon 3 was not at all depicted in the database prediction of At4g25120. In total, the suggested coding sequence is 25 amino acid shorter than the ORF encoded by the cDNA found in our analyses.</p><p>Using the full-length protein sequence of AtSRS2, we aligned it pairwise to the known yeast sequences of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Against both yeast protein sequences, AtSRS2 exhibits a sequence identity of 22 and 22.5%, respectively, ranging from amino acid 241&#x02013;1141 of the entire protein, which is 1147 amino acid long. The conserved UVRD/REP domain of the proteins could be clearly aligned and shows that At4g25120 is really homologous to SRS2. When comparing only the UVRD domain, the identity between AtSRS2 and SpSRS2 or ScSRS2 is 24.2 and 23.8%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). To strengthen the hypothesis that At4g25120 is a true and conserved SRS2 homolog, we analyzed the conservation of SRS2 throughout the plant kingdom, using already sequenced genomes of various plants at the JGI (Joint Genome Institute) server and the protein sequence of AtSRS2. In all investigated land plants, an unambiguous homolog of AtSRS2 is present. The identity between the different plants varies in the range of 40&#x02013;65%, depending on their phylogenetic distances (e.g. as highest distance from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> 40% and 65.9% between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Ricinus communis</italic>). Furthermore, we could also detect SRS2 homologs in other Viridiplantae like green- and microalgae (e.g. <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>Volvox carteri</italic>), the Prasinophyceae (e.g. <italic>Ostreococcus lucimarinus</italic>), and in the two Heterokonts, <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic> and <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic>. The SRS2 proteins found in these more ancient organisms are less conserved, but all range from 20% to 35% identity with AtSRS2. Expanding our bioinformatic analyses into the animal kingdom, for which no SRS2 homolog has been reported so far, we found segments of sequences showing a reasonable homology to all three UVRD/REP helicase domains of SRS2. In all organisms up to the amphibia, SRS2 homologs are present in the genome. For example we detected SRS2 genes in cnidaria (<italic>Hydra magnipapillata</italic>), nematodes (<italic>C. elegans</italic>), insects (<italic>Aedes aegyptii</italic>), lower chordata (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>) and amphibia (<italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>), but not in bony fishes (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>) or mammals (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>). In summary, a clearly definable SRS2 homolog exists as a single copy gene throughout all members of the Viridiplantae, Heterokonts and Metazoa except fish and mammals investigated thus far. Thus, SRS2 must have been lost only during the development of the taxa Teleostei and mammalia. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>ClustalW alignment of the SRS2 UVRD-domain from Arabidopsis and yeasts.The UVRD domain of AtSRS2 is shown in a ClustalW alignment to SRS2 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>.

We tested the strand displacement activity of the recombinant AtSRS2 on an M13mp18ssDNA-based DNA substrate providing both 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-flaps. The recombinant AtSRS2 is able to separate the oligonucleotide from the circular M13ssDNA in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Furthermore, the reaction is dependent on ATP, and no displacement is obtained without AtSRS2 in the reaction. No strand displacement activity is displayed by comparable preparations of AtSRS2-K273R, which is an ATPase-deficient variant of the AtSRS2 protein due to an amino acid substitution in the conserved Walker A motif. Thus, the recombinant AtSRS2 is a functional DNA helicase, and its preparation is suitable for the biochemical characterization. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Demonstration of the helicase activity and directionality of AtSRS2.

Under standard reaction conditions, AtSRS2 separated the 3&#x02032;-overhang DNA substrates, but not the 5&#x02032;-overhang or blunt-end substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). We addressed the question of whether the 5&#x02032;-overhang and blunt-end substrates were unwound under different reaction conditions. Thus, we modified the incubation temperature or the amount of DNA substrate and enzyme (data not shown). However, we did not observe separation of the 5&#x02032;-overhang and the blunt-end substrate in any case. We also tested three different DNA substrates with shorter duplex regions (15 bp), but AtSRS2 only displaced the oligonucleotide from the 3&#x02032;-overhang substrate (data not shown). Hence, we classify AtSRS2 as a 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-DNA helicase.</p><p>We further examined the strand displacement activity of AtSRS2 with different divalent cations.

We tested a variety of HJs that differed in their mobility (partially mobile HJ, static HJ, nicked static HJ) and in the length of the duplex region, and we also designed branched structures according to Dupaigne <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In order to assign the emerging intermediate structures, we performed gel analyses with the different annealed oligonucleotides and used them as references for the corresponding branched structures on the same gels (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp753/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp753/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates, AtSRS2 is able to process several branched DNA structures. Moreover, we found that there were significant differences in disrupting the branched DNA structures. AtSRS2 was able to disrupt the static nicked HJ (X0-nHJ), but we could not detect significant disruption of the static HJ (X0-HJ) without a nick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, compare panels A and B). AtSRS2 was also able to disrupt a partially mobile X12-HJ with 12 bp of homology in the center of the HJ (data not shown). But in comparison to the disruption of the X12-HJ, the nicked HJ is a better substrate for AtSRS2. Since the 25-bp duplex regions of each DNA arm of the X12-HJ are shorter when compared with the static X0-HJ (31 bp), one could assume that the better disruption of the X12-HJ is due to the shorter duplex region. Therefore, we tested the disruption of a static nHJ and HJ that consisted of a 24-bp long duplex region. AtSRS2 processed those branched structures in the order X0&#x02013;nHJ &#x0226b; X12&#x02013;HJ &#x0003e; X0&#x02013;HJ and concluded that the better disruption of the X12&#x02013;HJ compared with the 31-bp long X0&#x02013;HJ is not due to differences in the duplex lengths. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>AtSRS2 disrupts branched DNA structures.

Panel C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates that AtSRS2 disrupts the PX junction far better than the X0&#x02013;nHJ and X0&#x02013;HJ. To analyze the way of the disruption, we performed time course experiments of the X0&#x02013;nHJ, X0&#x02013;HJ and the PX junction, all consisting of a 31-bp long duplex region. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp753/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link> shows the time course experiments of AtSRS2 disrupting the PX junction with different labeled oligonucleotides. In the first 5 min of disruption of the PX junction, different products emerge. The first product that emerges is the X0&#x02013;1 oligonucleotide and the intermediate product consisting of the oligonucleotides X0&#x02013;2+3+4a. AtSRS2 processes this intermediate structure in such a way that it displaces the X0&#x02013;2 oligonucleotide and finally the short X0&#x02013;4a oligonucleotide.

We addressed the following question: could AtSRS2 also play a role in the re-annealing of the elongated ssDNA to the ssDNA on the other side of the break? To test if AtSRS2 is able to pair two molecules of ssDNA, we performed strand annealing assays. We tested whether annealing occurred under similar conditions as for strand displacement. To this end, we tested different MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations for optimal strand pairing and analyzed strand annealing over the course of time. We found that annealing of a 40-nt oligonucleotide with a 80-nt oligonucleotide occurs over a broad range of MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the reaction buffer. We also found that maximal annealing is obtained after 20 min at 30&#x000b0;C (data not shown). Therefore, we carried out further experiments under similar conditions to those used for the helicase assays, using 5.4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in the reaction buffer.</p><p>To verify that it is hybridization that is being measured and not protein binding, we performed control experiments. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp753/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link> shows that the products of the SRS2-dependent annealing reaction run on the same level as the annealed oligonucleotides on the gel. Additionally, we carried out reactions without the non-labeled complementary oligonucleotide, and we did not detect any band-shift after the gelelectrophoresis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp753/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>, lanes C1 and C2). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> illustrates that ssDNA annealing occurs with oligonucleotides that result in a blunt-end, 3&#x02032;- or 5&#x02032;-overhang DNA substrate with a 40-bp duplex region. The graph also demonstrates that the AtSRS2-dependent annealing of the 3&#x02032;-overhang oligonucleotide is reduced compared with the annealing reactions with the oligonucleotides that result in blunt-end or 5&#x02032;-overhang substrates, but is increased by AtSRS2-K273R and without ATP in the reaction buffer.

Homologs of SRS2 are the bacterial helicases UVRD, REP and PCRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that SRS2 can act as an antirecombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">17&#x02013;21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Aside from this function, SRS2 is supposed to function as an activator of the postreplicative DNA repair pathway, and it also plays a role in DNA damage checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Most studies of SRS2 have been done in yeast, but thus far, there are no data available for SRS2 from a multicellular eukaryote. In this study, we analyzed the enzymatic behavior of the plant SRS2 homolog from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p><p>For our biochemical characterization, we purified the recombinant AtSRS2 and a mutant form of AtSRS2, AtSRS2-K273R. AtSRS2-K273R features a substitution of lysine to arginine in the Walker A motif. Mutations in the Walker A motif result in loss of the ATPase- and helicase activity of DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and hence AtSRS2-K273R can serve as a negative control. We observed displacement activity with the purified AtSRS2 2protein, but we did not detect displacement without AtSRS2 or ATP in the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Additionally, no disruption occurred with the recombinant AtSRS2-K273R. The results demonstrate that the purified AtSRS2 is a functional helicase and that AtSRS2-K273R can be used as a negative control for further studies.</p><p>Next, we defined the reaction conditions in which optimal strand displacement occurred. Interestingly, we observed almost no difference in the strand displacement activity of AtSRS2 at different incubation temperatures, and even observed helicase activity at 4&#x000b0;C (data not shown). Therefore, we designate AtSRS2 as a temperature-tolerant helicase.</p><p>To begin the study of the basic properties of AtSRS2, we first analyzed the direction in which the helicase processes DNA substrates. Similar to most helicases, AtSRS2 features a specific directionality, and that is a 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). The REP helicase from <italic>E. coli</italic> can also be classified as a 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) as can ScSRS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It seems that AtSRS2 is a 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-helicase in a stricter sense than SRS2 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Van Komen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) were able to show that ScSRS2 is also able to act on substrates with 5&#x02032;-overhangs or on blunt-end substrates but prefers to unwind substrates with 3&#x02032;-overhangs. They therefore classified ScSRS2 as a 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-helicase, as was already shown by Rong and Klein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The SRS2 homologs, UVRD and PCRA, also demonstrate unwinding of 5&#x02032;-overhang substrates whereas UVRD preferentially unwinds 3&#x02032;-overhang substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). PCRA can act in both directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44 B45 B46">44&#x02013;46</xref>). To test whether AtSRS2 is also able to act on 5&#x02032;-overhang and blunt-end DNA substrates, we modified the reaction conditions, but AtSRS2 processed only the 3&#x02032;-overhang substrates and therefore has to be classified as a 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-helicase.</p><p>Next, we investigated the dependence of the helicase reaction of AtSRS2 on divalent metal cations. Like most helicases, the strand displacement activity of AtSRS2 is dependent on the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> which can be substituted by Mn<sup>2+</sup> whereas little unwinding occurred with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and no unwinding with Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). Similar results were obtained with ScSRS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), whereas MtUVRD from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> did not show DNA unwinding in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>Helicases have also been shown to prefer specific nucleotide co-substrates for their helicase activity. Therefore, we measured the strand displacement activity of AtSRS2 with different NTPs and dNTPs. Consistent with the SRS2 homolog ScSRS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and UVRD from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), we did observe strand displacement with ATP and dATP, whereas the other (d)NTPs did not support strand unwinding. In contrast, the replicative helicase REP also showed strand displacement with GTP, dGTP, and to a lesser extent with CTP, dCTP, UTP and dTTP, but preferred ATP and dATP for the helicase reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The helicase PCRA from <italic>B. stearothermophilus</italic> was also able to hydrolyze a wide range of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, we defined the minimal length of a 3&#x02032;-overhang that is necessary for unwinding of a 40-bp duplex region. We found that AtSRS2 needs at least a 16-nt long 3&#x02032;-overhang for productive unwinding of a 40-bp duplex region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). This is in contrast to ScSRS2, which promotes DNA unwinding with even a 2-nt 3&#x02032;-overhang with the same DNA substrates tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). UVRD from <italic>M. tubercolosis</italic> disrupts DNA substrates consisting of a 12-bp duplex region if the 3&#x02032;-overhangs are at least 12 nt long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and the bipolar PCRA helicase from <italic>S. aureus</italic> is able to promote unwinding of a DNA substrate that consisted of 4-nt long 5&#x02032;-overhangs on both ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>Since genetic and biochemical data indicate a role for SRS2 in suppressing crossovers during double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), we addressed whether the plant AtSRS2 helicase features a similar function. To this end, we designed different branched structures (X0&#x02013;HJ, X0&#x02013;nHJ, X12&#x02013;HJ and PX junction) that can evolve during the repair of DSBs by HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37">35&#x02013;37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). The analyzed X0&#x02013;nHJ is an intermediate structure that can evolve during the repair of DSBs according to the classical DSBR model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). The PX junction resembles the intermediate structure that is formed during DNA repair according to the SDSA model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53 B54 B55 B56">53&#x02013;56</xref>). Intact HJs also play a central role in HR. In synthetic partially mobile HJs, e.g. the X12&#x02013;HJ, the branch point can move. Therefore, those structures are often used to study branch migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>).</p><p>As we tested the helicase activity on the branched DNA substrates, we found that AtSRS2 was actually able to disrupt most branched structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, we were able to show that AtSRS2 prefers to unwind the PX junction compared with the X0&#x02013;nHJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and X12&#x02013;HJ (data not shown), whereas little to no unwinding was detected with the X0&#x02013;HJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Similar results were obtained with ScSRS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), but no further data that describe the disruption of HJs or PX junctions by SRS2 homologs are available. Since we observed that a nick or an homologous central region increases the disruption of the branched structures by AtSRS2, and that a PX junction containing a single stranded area is an even better substrate for AtSRS2, we concluded that a nick or temporary gap caused by movement of the homologous area in the center of the X12&#x02013;HJ yields small openings for AtSRS2 to bind and displace the oligonucleotides of the branched substrates. Inspired by these observations, we performed time course experiments with those substrates containing differently labeled oligonucleotides in order to follow the appearance of the different products, thus getting an indication of the way of HJ disruption by AtSRS2. As shown in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp753/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>, we observed that disruption of the PX junction resulted in different products that increased or decreased over the course of time. The order and the amount of products that emerged led us to the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>. First, AtSRS2 binds the accessible ssDNA providing a 3&#x02032;-tail (A), which is in accordance with the directionality of AtSRS2. After displacement of the first oligonucleotide, an intermediate structure emerges that is captured by AtSRS2, followed by displacement of the next oligonucleotide in the 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-direction (B). Finally, AtSRS2 disrupts the last intermediate structure starting from the 3&#x02032;-end (C). We observed similar results with the X0&#x02013;nHJ (data not shown), except that the first product was not ssDNA, but a partial duplex intermediate with a 5&#x02032;-overhang. We concluded that AtSRS2 could not disrupt this intermediate due to its directionality. The way by which AtSRS2 disrupts the PX junction and to a lesser extent the X0&#x02013;nHJ/X12&#x02013;HJ supports the assumption that the plant SRS2 homolog, AtSRS2, functions in HR. Moreover, our detailed analyses of the PX junction disassembly by the plant helicase AtSRS2 clearly support the model put forth by Dupaigne <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Disruption of the PX junction.

The first two steps of the PX junction disruption can be translated into the displacement of the invaded ssDNA by the SDSA model (lower part). Furthermore, AtSRS2 could play a role in the re-annealing of the displaced, elongated ssDNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp753f8"/></fig></p><p>Additionally, we were able to demonstrate that disruption of the HJ is not due to branch migration, as the resulting product of the X12&#x02013;HJ disruption is ssDNA and not splayed arm (data not shown). In contrast to SRS2, most RECQ helicases produce a splayed arm as the main product of HJ disruption, assuming the processing of HJs through branch migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58 B59 B60">58&#x02013;60</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we addressed the question of whether the AtSRS2 helicase is able to perform re-annealing. To date, no SRS2-dependent annealing has been demonstrated, but many studies of helicase-dependent annealing were done with RECQ helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61 B62 B63">61&#x02013;63</xref>). Moreover, Machwe et al. have shown that strand pairing is not present in all helicases, since the SRS2 homolog EcUVRD and the viral NS3 enzyme did not promote ssDNA annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). We were able to show that AtSRS2-dependent annealing occurred with overhang and blunt-end substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), and furthermore verified that we measured hybridization and not protein-binding causing a band-shift on the gel (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp753/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp753/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). Hybridization does not occur in the absence of AtSRS2 or AtSRS2-K273R probably due to low oligonucleotide concentration, since we observed a slightly increase of spontaneous hybridization with increasing oligonucleotide concentrations (data not shown). Noticeably less annealing occurred with oligonucleotides that led to a 3&#x02032;-overhang substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). We, therefore, concluded that this decreased single strand annealing is due to the antagonistic activities of the helicase and annealing reactions, since AtSRS2 is unable to disrupt substrates with a blunt-end or 5&#x02032;-end. Moreover, the annealing of ssDNA resulting in 3&#x02032;-overhang substrates increased without ATP in the reaction or with AtSRS2-K273R. The assumption that AtSRS2 combines its helicase activity with its ability to anneal ssDNA in a concerted action has also been predicted for the RECQ helicases HsWRN, HsBLM and DmRECQ5&#x003b2;, where this feature could be applied in the processing of a HJ through branch migration and for replication fork regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). The observation that AtSRS2 can promote ssDNA pairing without ATP or with AtSRS2-K273R demonstrates that the proteins are still able to interact with DNA. This assumption is supported by Krejci <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), who have shown that a mutated form of ScSRS2, consisting of a substitution in the Walker A motif, retained DNA binding, and also that DNA binding by SRS2 and the mutated srs2 proteins was not influenced by ATP.</p><p>Since the ATPase-deficient helicase AtSRS2-K273R also facilitates strand annealing, we assume that this reaction is independent of the hydrolysis of ATP but could depend on conformational changes of both proteins caused by the different binding status of NTPs.</p><p>We therefore studied the influence of ATP, ATP<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>S, ADP and AMP on the annealing reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Our observations that increasing amounts of ATP increased and ATP<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>S decreased the strand pairing reaction support our hypothesis mentioned above. The poorly hydrolyzable ATP analog ATP<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>S keeps the protein in the ATP-bound mode, probably leading to a conformation that impairs or prevents ssDNA pairing. However, after the hydrolysis of ATP, the binding mode changes, which is followed by a conformational change of the helicase promoting ssDNA pairing. The observations that ADP also promotes the annealing reaction and AMP inhibits the reaction support our assumption. Moreover, Sharma <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) have shown with hRECQ1 that ATP binding leads to a conformational change and suggested that a nucleotide-induced conformational change could be a trigger to switch from helicase to annealing activity. Hence, we conclude that a conformational change due to NTP binding could have a significant effect on AtSRS2-dependent ssDNA pairing.</p><p>Next we investigated whether the length of the duplex region influences the ssDNA pairing reaction. The melting temperatures of the emerging duplex regions of the different products were all above the incubation temperature (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp753/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>), and therefore decreasing annealing was not due to denaturation of the products. We observed that ssDNA pairing increased with increasing duplex length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the helicase HsBLM, where little annealing was observed with oligonucleotides that yielded a duplex length of 15 bp, and maximal annealing was observed with a duplex length of 50 bp. In accordance with Cheok <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>), we assume that the influence of the oligonucleotide length could be due to the stable binding of AtSRS2 on ssDNA.</p><p>In summary, we identified an AtSRS2 homolog in the plant model organism <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and our biochemical studies reveal a function in the disruption of recombination intermediates and in strand annealing. It is tempting to speculate that AtSRS2 might play a role in the re-annealing of displaced ssDNA by the SDSA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, it will be interesting to define the role of AtSRS2 <italic>in planta</italic> and to test whether the protein is involved in SDSA-like or other recombination reactions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBER</title><p>GQ148553.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp753/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant Pu137/10 and Center for Functional Nanostructures, CFN, project C 5.4).
