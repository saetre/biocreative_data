We have annotated &#x0223c;617 putative E3s and substrate-recognition subunits of E3 complexes encoded in the human genome. The limited knowledge of the function of members of the large E3 superfamily prompted us to generate genome-wide E3 cDNA and RNAi expression libraries designed for functional screening. An imaging-based screen using these libraries to identify E3s that regulate mitochondrial dynamics uncovered MULAN/FLJ12875, a RING finger protein whose ectopic expression and knockdown both interfered with mitochondrial trafficking and morphology. We found that MULAN is a mitochondrial protein &#x02013; two transmembrane domains mediate its localization to the organelle's outer membrane. MULAN is oriented such that its E3-active, C-terminal RING finger is exposed to the cytosol, where it has access to other components of the Ub system. Both an intact RING finger and the correct subcellular localization were required for regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, suggesting that MULAN's downstream effectors are proteins that are either integral to, or associated with, mitochondria and that become modified with Ub. Interestingly, MULAN had previously been identified as an activator of NF-&#x003ba;B, thus providing a link between mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling. These findings suggest the existence of a new, Ub-mediated mechanism responsible for integration of mitochondria into the cellular environment.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most known functions of ubiquitin (Ub) require its covalent attachment to target proteins (substrates), which is mediated by the sequential action of an E1 activating enzyme, an E2 conjugase and an E3 ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Pickart1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. E3s have the ability to bind both to an E2 (<italic>via</italic> a RING finger, U box, or HECT &#x0201c;catalytic&#x0201d; domain) and to the substrate &#x02013;in many E3s, those two binding sites reside in the same polypeptide. In addition, certain RING finger (RNF) proteins can also be part of complexes where substrate recognition is assigned to a separate subunit. In particular, the RNF proteins Rbx1/2 add great diversity to E3s by forming SCF and SCF-like complexes with alternative substrate-recognition subunits, often characterized by the additional presence of an F box, SOCS box, DDB1 or BTB domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Joazeiro1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Petroski1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although the Ub-proteasome system (UPS) is known to be involved in a number of cellular processes, the role of E3s in the regulation and degradation of mitochondrial proteins and in mitochondrial biology is only beginning to emerge. For one thing, until recently, studies of mitochondrial protein degradation had largely focused on the organelle's autonomous and highly conserved proteolytic system, including peptidases and ATP-dependent proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Koppen1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, the UPS is not present within mitochondria. However, Ub might conceivably target either proteins that are integral to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) or cytoplasmic regulators of mitochondrial functions. The regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by the UPS was first suggested by work showing that the E3 Rsp5p plays an essential role in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Fisk1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Based in particular on studies with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> we now know that mitochondrial fusion and fission factors can become modified with Ub or Ub-like proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Fisk1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Harder1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, the steady-state levels of the MOM fusion factor, Fzo1p, are set by ubiquitylation mediated by the E3 Mdm30p followed by proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Fritz1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>; the degradation of Fzo1p can also be accelerated by a yet-to-be identified E3 in response to mating pheromone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Neutzner1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Modification with the Ub-like protein SUMO promotes the association of the cytosolic fission factor Drp1 with mitochondria and increases its stability, presumably by competition with Ub <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Harder1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, a candidate E3 Ub ligase for Drp1, MarchV/MITOL, which acted as a negative regulator of mitochondrial fission, has been identified recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Yonashiro1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. MarchV, which until this work was the only transmembrane E3 known to reside in the MOM, binds to Drp1 and mediates its ubiquitylation and destabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Yonashiro1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, another recent report has proposed the opposite function for MarchV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Karbowski1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, i.e., as a factor <italic>required</italic> for mitochondrial fission. Thus, the picture clearly remains incomplete.</p><p>We reasoned that the discovery of new mechanisms of cellular regulation involving the UPS could benefit from the development of genome-wide tools to allow its specific manipulation, such as by interfering with E3 levels. Here we report the annotation of the E3s and substrate-recognition subunits of E3 complexes encoded in the human genome. Based on the annotation information, we generated genome-wide human and mouse cDNA and shDNA E3 collections ready for functional screening. In a cell-based imaging screen for regulators of mitochondrial dynamics using these collections, we identified an E3, FLJ12875, whose role in these processes was made evident both through its ectopic expression and through the knockdown of the endogenous gene. Since this E3 had been previously identified as an NF-&#x003ba;B activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Matsuda1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and we found it to localize to mitochondria, we named it MULAN, for <underline>M</underline>itochondrial <underline>U</underline>biquitin <underline>L</underline>igase <underline>A</underline>ctivator of <underline>N</underline>F-&#x003ba;B. MULAN is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane through two transmembrane domains, properly positioned such that its RNF can have access to other UPS components in the cytosol. Both an intact RNF and the E3's mitochondrial localization were required for interfering with mitochondrial dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genome-wide annotation of the human E3 superfamily</title><p>We set out to annotate the minimal complement of genes encoding putative human E3s, based on the presence of signature &#x0201c;catalytic&#x0201d; domains, as well as of domains characteristic of substrate-recognition subunits of multi-subunit RNF-dependent E3s. In addition, we annotated the genes encoding A20 finger proteins and MALT1/paracaspase, which have recently been found to act as E3s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Zhou1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Wertz1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

We also found that &#x0223c;95&#x00025; of all E3s are RNF-dependent, with RNF domain-encoding genes and multisubunit RNF-dependent E3s represented in similar numbers (309 and 270 genes, respectively). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, &#x0223c;80 genes were found to encode putative E3s &#x02013;of these, 13 are essential for viability in rich medium, which mirrors the proportion of all yeast genes estimated to be essential under these conditions (17&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001487-t001">Tables 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001487-t002"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001487-t003">3</xref>).

search databases. The 56 or more types of domains that we found associated with the remaining RNF E3s (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001487-t004">Table 4</xref>) could play a variety of roles, including mediating interactions with substrate degradation signals (degrons). This variety of domains is consistent both with the diversity of proteins targeted for ubiquitylation and with the diversity of mechanisms involved in their recognition. Domain composition and protein homology have been previously utilized to define subfamilies of RNF proteins. The largest subfamily, TRIM/RBCC, has &#x0223c;76 representatives in humans (but none in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) and is characterized by the presence of a B box and a coiled coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Meroni1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001487-t005">Table 5</xref>).

Interestingly, many RNF E3s are associated with other zinc-binding domains &#x02013;particularly zinc fingers of the C2H2, C3H1, UBR1 and RBZ types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001487-t004">Table 4</xref>).

D) MULAN's RNF has <italic>in vitro</italic> E3 activity. Reactions utilized GST fusions with the MULAN or c-Cbl RNFs as E3s. Activity was dependent on an intact RNF, since it was not detected in reactions using the MULAN C339A RNF mutant. c-Cbl's RNF was used as a positive control. Negative controls were reactions lacking an E3 (No E3) or reactions added to SDS sample buffer at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0 (unreacted). E) MULAN's RNF is required for the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with vector, wild type MULAN cDNA or RNF-mutant cDNAs, together with MT-RFP. Cells were fixed at 24 h post-transfection and the fraction of RFP-positive cells exhibiting perinuclear-clustered mitochondria was scored (&#x00025; trafficking defect).

Results are representative of several experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001487.g001"/></fig><p>Having validated a morphology-based imaging assay for mitochondrial dynamics, we next screened our E3 collections by transfecting HeLa cells together with a plasmid encoding a mitochondrial-targeted red-fluorescent protein (MT-RFP, consisting of RFP fused to the presequence of human cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII). This allowed visualization of mitochondria specifically in E3-transfected cells. Following hit-picking and reconfirmation of the results from the primary screens, we uncovered MULAN, a putative E3 whose ectopic expression led to defects in both mitochondrial morphology and subcellular distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The phenotype of HeLa cells ectopically expressing MULAN is characterized by the fragmentation of otherwise long, tubular-shaped mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g001">Figs. 1A and 1B</xref>). In addition, as in the KIF5B knockdown, mitochondria in MULAN-transfected cells clustered around the perinuclear region. These phenotypes were MULAN dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) and were observed with all cell lines examined: HeLa, 293, NIH3T3, COS7, H9c2 and HL1 (unpublished observations). Notably, the phenotypes resulting from MULAN ectopic expression were manifested rapidly, within 24 h of transfection.</p><p>The effects of MULAN on mitochondrial dynamics could be indirect, e.g., as a result of the disruption of the microtubule network. To examine this possibility, HeLa cells were co-transfected with MT-RFP and either MULAN or the vector control, and microtubules were visualized by staining with &#x003b1;-tubulin antibody. The results showed no obvious differences in the microtubule network between vector- and MULAN cDNA-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Thus, the altered mitochondrial distribution in cells ectopically expressing MULAN was apparently not due to microtubule disruption. However, these results do not rule out the possibility that the E3 exerts more subtle effects on microtubules that could not be detected with these analyses.</p><p>MULAN is a 40-kDa protein with orthologs identified from flies to vertebrates, and in plants. As MarchV, it does not have an obvious ortholog in yeast. Reciprocally, Mfb1p and Mdm30p, budding yeast F-box E3 subunits that are essential for mitochondrial dynamics, are apparently not conserved in higher eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Fritz1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. One possibility to explain the lack of conservation of such critical regulators of what is thought to be an essential process for both yeast and human cells is that there are important distinctions between the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dynamics in these organisms. Of relevance is the observation that mitochondrial trafficking in yeast largely relies on the actin cytoskeleton network, while in mammalian cells mitochondria are transported predominantly along microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Okamoto1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Hollenbeck1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, E3 regulators of mitochondrial dynamics could function as mediators of the response to organism-specific signaling, as is the case of organellar trafficking along long motor neuron axons, a process regulated both by synaptic activity and by secreted molecules such as NGF and TNF (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Hollenbeck1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>MULAN exhibits two predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs) as well as an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal RNF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s001">Fig. S1A, B</xref>). To determine whether MULAN is a <italic>bona fide</italic> E3, a GST fusion with its RNF was tested for the ability to mediate ubiquitylation in reactions utilizing the promiscuous E2, Ubc4. The RNF from MULAN, under these conditions, was nearly as potent for ubiquitylation as that of c-Cbl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). As is often the case in this type of assay, GST blots revealed that reaction products consisted of, at least in part, the auto-ubiquitylated GST-RING finger protein itself, and their formation required E1, E2, E3 and Ub (unpublished observations). We also examined whether the integrity of the MULAN RNF domain was required for E3 activity. C339, one of the Cys residues that are essential for maintaining the RNF structure through zinc coordination, was mutated to Ala, resulting in abolished E3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). This result led us to ask whether the mitochondrial morphology phenotypes associated with expression of MULAN were also dependent on an intact RNF. NIH3T3 cells transfected with MULAN wild-type or with RNF mutant constructs were analyzed for mitochondrial distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g001">Figs. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s001">S1D</xref>). While mitochondria in <italic>ca</italic>. 52&#x00025; of wild type MULAN-transfected cells presented a trafficking defect, this number was markedly reduced in cells expressing either the RNF-deleted E3 (1-301; 1&#x00025;), or the C339A mutant (3&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). These mutants were expressed at similar or higher levels than the wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s001">Figs. S1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s002">S2A</xref>) and their lack of effect on mitochondrial dynamics was even more evident when normalized to the wild-type expression level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s001">Fig. S1D</xref>). Thus, the simplest interpretation of these results is that regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by MULAN is dependent on its E3 activity. The results also suggest that the mitochondrial phenotype that we observe due to MULAN expression is not just a non-specific effect due to increased expression of <italic>any</italic> protein on the mitochondrial surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>Endogenous</italic> MULAN regulates mitochondrial dynamics</title><p>To confirm that <italic>endogenous</italic> MULAN plays a role in mitochondrial dynamics, we generated two different siRNA, siMULAN1 and siMULAN2, which led to greater than 70&#x00025; reduction of the endogenous mRNA level two days after transfection of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>; knockdown was also observed at the protein level, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>). The phenotype of MULAN knocked-down cells exhibited similarities to that of cells ectopically expressing the E3, which is not unprecedented (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Desagher1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Karbowski2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>) and could be due to a dominant negative effect of the ectopically expressed protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Mitochondria in 80&#x02013;90&#x00025; of MULAN siRNA-transfected cells were clustered around the nucleus, although clustering was less compact compared to that seen in response to ectopic MULAN expression; in contrast, only 5&#x02013;12&#x00025; of cells transfected with the control non-silencing siRNA exhibited this phenotype (siScrambled; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g002">Figs. 2A and 2C</xref>).

The fact that the knockdown phenotype was specific to siRNA against MULAN and that it was observed with two different siRNA sequences argues against an off-target effect and confirms a role for MULAN in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.</p><fig id="pone-0001487-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001487.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Knockdown of endogenous MULAN perturbs mitochondrial dynamics.</title><p>A) <italic>Blue bars</italic>: MULAN mRNA knockdown.

In the latter, mitochondrial clustering is accompanied by a high degree of fragmentation and by the collapse of the mitochondrial network, leaving little discernible tubular structure remaining; in MULAN-knockdown cells, tubular-shaped mitochondria remain visible and the increase in fragmentation relative to control cells is not as marked. These results suggest that the increased mitochondrial fragmentation in response to MULAN ectopic expression could represent either a gain-of-function phenotype or a secondary consequence of severely disrupted mitochondrial trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>MULAN is a MOM protein with a C-terminal cytosolic-facing RNF</title><p>To begin elucidating the mechanism by which MULAN affects mitochondrial dynamics, we determined its subcellular localization. Earlier results had already revealed that the protein's distribution was reminiscent of mitochondrial staining patterns. Several lines of evidence indeed indicate that MULAN is a mitochondrial protein: (<italic>i</italic>) the signal of C-terminal Flag-tagged MULAN <italic>completely</italic> overlapped with that of co-transfected MT-RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g003">Fig. 3A, upper panels</xref>).

Thus, both an untagged and the C-terminal tagged E3 co-localized with mitochondria. The specificity of MULAN localization is also revealed by the observation that neither protein colocalized with the Golgi marker lectin-Alexa 488 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s001">Fig. S1E</xref>); (<italic>ii</italic>) lysates of 293 cells overexpressing MULAN-Flag were subjected to centrifugation in sucrose gradient. Gradient fractions were run in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western-blot with different antibodies, revealing that MULAN's sedimentation was similar to that of the mitochondrial protein Tom20 but not of the Golgi marker, Golgin 97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g003">Fig. 3B, left panel</xref>); (<italic>iii</italic>) detergent-free lysates of untransfected 293F cells were first fractionated by differential centrifugation. Mitochondria in the heavy membrane (HM) fraction were further purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Samples of the whole cell extract, &#x0201c;mitochondrial&#x0201d; fraction, and cytosolic and light membrane (LM) fraction were normalized for protein amount and analyzed by western-blot using antibodies against cytochrome c, Golgin 97, calreticulin/Sec61, tubulin or EEA1 (markers for mitochondria, Golgi, ER, cytosol and endosomes, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g003">Fig. 3B, right panel</xref>). Consistently with the previous observations, the results show that <italic>endogenous</italic> MULAN was abundant in the fraction enriched for mitochondria, but was not detected in the fraction enriched for Golgi, ER, cytosol and endosomes. Although some Golgi material contaminated the &#x0201c;mitochondrial&#x0201d; fraction, immunocytochemistry analyses also revealed that MULAN-Flag did not detectably colocalize with lectin in intact cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s001">Fig. S1E</xref>).

The HM fraction was subjected to sucrose gradient to further purify mitochondria. Equal protein amounts (40 &#x000b5;g) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-MULAN antibody to detect endogenous MULAN. Cytochrome c, Golgin 97, EEA1 and tubulin were used as markers for mitochondria, Golgi, endosomes and cytosol, respectively. Calreticulin and Sec61 were both used as ER markers. C) Immuno-electron microscopy of MULAN.

Left panel: BSA only (no primary antibody) control; inset: mitochondrion from an untransfected cell. Right panel: mitochondria expressing MULAN-Flag. Scale bars are indicated. D) MULAN's predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs) mediate localization to mitochondria. NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged MULAN deletion mutants (green) and MT-RFP (red). Deletion of TMD1 (MULAN &#x00394;2-29; top row) or of TMD2 (MULAN &#x00394;242-259; middle row) led to partial mislocalization of MULAN. The combined deletion of both TMDs led to complete mislocalization of MULAN to the cytosol (MULAN &#x00394;2-29&#x0002b;&#x00394;242-259; bottom row). E) MULAN is a mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) protein. Mitochondria from 293 cells transfected with MULAN-Flag were purified by sucrose gradient. Intact mitochondria were treated with trypsin for the indicated time, in the presence or absence of Triton X-100. The MULAN C-terminus was readily susceptible to trypsin digestion in intact mitochondria, indicating that it sits in the MOM facing the cytosol. Controls are the MOM protein, Tom20, and the intermembrane space protein, Smac. Smac only becomes sensitive to trypsin upon lysis of mitochondria with 0.5&#x00025; Triton X-100 (lower panel).

To confirm that MULAN's predicted TM domains are functional, we generated MULAN-Flag mutants with deletions of sequences encompassing the TMD1 (amino acids 9-29), TMD2 (amino acids 242-259), or both. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g003">Fig. 3D</xref> shows that deletion of either TMD partially affected the co-localization of MULAN with MT-RFP, and that deletion of both TMDs completely mistargeted the protein. These results are consistent with the prediction that MULAN is a transmembrane protein, but do not distinguish whether it sits at the outer or the inner mitochondrial membranes. Access to other components of the Ub system would require MULAN to be localized to the MOM with the RNF domain facing the cytosolic side. To test this possibility, we performed a limited protease susceptibility experiment with purified mitochondria. 293 cells expressing MULAN-Flag were homogenized in isotonic sucrose buffer and intact mitochondria were isolated by sucrose gradient purification. Mitochondria were incubated with or without trypsin for various times and used for western blots to detect MULAN-Flag, the intermembrane space protein Smac, and the MOM protein Tom20. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>) revealed that MULAN's C-terminal Flag tag was readily susceptible to trypsin digestion, its signal disappearing within 5 min of treatment. Similar results were obtained with Tom20, while Smac remained trypsin-resistant unless mitochondria were permeabilized with 0.5&#x00025; Triton X-100 prior to addition of the protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g003">Fig. 3E, lower panel</xref>). Together, the results presented so far suggest that MULAN is MOM-anchored through two transmembrane domains, exposing a short N-terminus and the RNF-containing C-terminus to the cytosol.

For example, mutation of two positively charged residues C-terminal to TMD2 (R260A/K261A) led to MULAN's targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s004">Fig. S4C</xref>); MULAN's N-terminus also seemed to influence proper targeting, since an N-terminal Flag tag led to the protein's cytosolic localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s004">Fig. S4D</xref>). To determine whether modulation of mitochondrial dynamics by MULAN requires its proper localization to the organelle, the TMD2-deleted mutant, the R260A/K261A mutant, as well as N-terminal Flag tagged protein were evaluated for the ability to promote perinuclear clustering of mitochondria. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001487-g004">Fig. 4</xref> show that mistargeted MULAN mutants were defective in eliciting perinuclear clustering, despite that all were expressed at levels comparable or higher to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001487.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>). Likewise, MULAN's isolated cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 260-352) had no effect on mitochondrial distribution or morphology (unpublished observations). Interestingly, although the TMD2-deleted mutant (&#x00394;242-259) still remained partially localized to mitochondria, it was completely defective in promoting perinuclear clustering of the organelle, perhaps suggesting that an intact MULAN structure is required for interaction with other components of its pathway.

While there is no definitive proof that all those genes encode <italic>bona fide</italic> E3s or E3 subunits, we note that most of the annotated domains have a general or <italic>quasi</italic> general function in mediating ubiquitylation. This is certainly true for RNF-dependent E3s, which account for &#x0223c;95&#x00025; of all human E3s. To our knowledge, even in the case of RNF proteins whose E3 activity has not been directly demonstrated, there is evidence for an involvement in ubiquitylation. For example, the RNF protein Bard1 seems to be inactive for ubiquitylation alone but stimulates the E3 activity of its heterodimeric partner, BRCA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Xia1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Only a small fraction of all E3s has been functionally characterized. Despite that, E3s have already been directly implicated in many biological processes and diseases. Well known examples are deregulation of the E3s BRCA1, Mdm2, VHL and Skp2 in various cancers, and Parkin in Parkinson's disease. As a follow-up of a genomic annotation of the E3 superfamily, we have generated plate-arrayed, genome-wide cDNA and shDNA E3 collections that can serve as tools for the functional analysis of E3 function. Because of the reduced size of such &#x0201c;protein family&#x0201d; collections relative to complete genomic collections of tens of thousands of entities, the quality of screens can be improved by testing samples in replicates, for example. It also makes it more feasible to repeat screens and change variables, such as by using different cell lines (e.g., to knock-down regulators whose mRNA expression is cell type-specific). We expect that this tool will lead to the discovery of novel mechanisms of biological regulation by Ub as well as to new candidate drug targets. The cell-based imaging screen that we described in this work exemplifies how our collections could be utilized to discover novel E3s and to assign novel functions to known E3s. Other screen readouts are conceivable &#x02013;for example, it should be possible to uncover E3s that target a substrate of interest by using a substrate-reporter fusion protein. Furthermore, screening could be applied to a transcriptional reporter-based assay for a signaling pathway.</p><p>Mitochondrial dynamics is an essential aspect of the organelle's function. We reported above the identification of a novel regulator of this process, the MULAN E3 ligase. Three general lines of evidence strongly suggest that the role we uncovered for MULAN in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics is specific &#x02013;the protein's localization, as well as its ectopic expression and loss-of-function phenotypes. As a consequence of MULAN's knockdown, the marked phenotype was a profound effect on the distribution of mitochondria. This phenotype is thus distinct from the one resulting from knockdown of MarchV/MITOL, the only other mitochondrial E3 described so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Yonashiro1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In the latter case, increased mitochondrial fission and unaltered mitochondrial distribution were observed, suggesting that MULAN and MarchV play different roles in mitochondria (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Karbowski1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>How does MULAN work? Its effects on mitochondrial dynamics are likely to be direct, since MULAN localizes to mitochondria and those effects required MULAN's proper localization to the organelle. We presume that it is less likely that MULAN's primary role is on fusion or fission, since these processes were unaffected upon MULAN depletion. Moreover, co-expression of either an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission (the GTPase-defective, dominant negative Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Smirnova1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>) or the mitochondrial fusion factors Mfn1, Mfn2 or OPA1 failed to reduce the mitochondrial fragmentation induced by MULAN ectopic expression suggesting that MULAN's effects on mitochondrial morphology are unrelated to the canonical fusion or fission pathways (unpublished observations). Instead, the results presented are consistent with a role for MULAN at the level of trafficking regulation &#x02013;both its ectopic expression and knockdown led to altered mitochondrial distribution, without having apparent effects on the microtubule network. MULAN is an active E3, and its effects on mitochondrial dynamics also required an intact RNF domain. Clearly, the identification of MULAN's substrates, effectors or interacting proteins should help determine its primary function.</p><p>Besides being the primary organelle for energy production, mitochondria also play important roles in intracellular signaling &#x02013;most studied have been their roles in programmed cell death. Signaling responses can also be triggered by mitochondrial systems monitoring protein quality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Zhao1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, mitochondria signal stress to the nucleus through still poorly characterized pathways involving the transcription factors CHOP, C/EBP&#x003b2; or NF-&#x003ba;B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Zhao1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001487-Seth1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Anti-tubulin blot was used as a loading control. E) MULAN does not colocalize with the Golgi marker, Lectin-Alexa 488. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with MULAN-Flag or untagged MULAN 1-301, followed by immunostaining with antibody against Flag (top) or MULAN (bottom), together with Lectin-Alexa 488 (green, Molecular Probes). F) NIH3T3 cells were transfected with MULAN-Flag, followed by immunostaining with antibody against Flag (red) and the ER marker, calreticulin (green).

NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the indicated GFP-fusion proteins, Flag-tagged point mutants or deletion constructs of MULAN. Localization of the proteins was revealed by GFP fluorescence or Flag immunostaining (green). Mitochondria were visualized using MT-RFP (red). A) MULAN lacks an N-terminal mitochondrial signal peptide. Upper: the N-terminal 33 amino acids of MULAN were not sufficient to target GFP to mitochondria. Lower: MULAN's N-terminal 10 amino acids were not required for mitochondrial localization. B) Isolated TMDs of MULAN combined with their flanking sequences were sufficient to target GFP to mitochondria. Upper: TMD1 targeted GFP to mitochondria when combined with a C-terminal stretch of basic amino acids (1-60). Lower: TMD2 together with additional N- and C-terminal sequences (amino acids 158-279) targeted GFP to mitochondria. C) Mutation of the basic residues immediately following TMD2 in the context of full-length MULAN-Flag (MULAN R260A/K261A) led to mislocalization to the ER. Upper: MULAN R260A/K261A does not colocalize with MT-RFP. Lower: MULAN R260A/K261A colocalizes with the ER marker, calreticulin. D) N-terminal Flag-tagged MULAN localized to cytosol. E) Deletion of the entire C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (MULAN 1-263) or of the RING domain (MULAN 1-301) did not affect MULAN's mitochondrial localization.
