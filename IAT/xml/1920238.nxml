Although aprataxin has been suggested to be related to DNA single-strand break repair (SSBR), the physiological function of aprataxin remains to be elucidated. DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) continually produced by endogenous reactive oxygen species or exogenous genotoxic agents, typically possess damaged 3&#x02032;-ends including 3&#x02032;-phosphate, 3&#x02032;-phosphoglycolate, or 3&#x02032;-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-unsaturated aldehyde ends. These damaged 3&#x02032;-ends should be restored to 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl ends for subsequent repair processes. Here we demonstrate by <italic>in vitro</italic> assay that recombinant human aprataxin specifically removes 3&#x02032;-phosphoglycolate and 3&#x02032;-phosphate ends at DNA 3&#x02032;-ends, but not 3&#x02032;-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-unsaturated aldehyde ends, and can act with DNA polymerase &#x003b2; and DNA ligase III to repair SSBs with these damaged 3&#x02032;-ends. Furthermore, disease-associated mutant forms of aprataxin lack this removal activity. The findings indicate that aprataxin has an important role in SSBR, that is, it removes blocking molecules from 3&#x02032;-ends, and that the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs with damaged 3&#x02032;-ends underlies the pathogenesis of EAOH/AOA1. The findings will provide new insight into the mechanism underlying degeneration and DNA repair in neurons.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Aprataxin is the causative gene product for early-onset ataxia with ocular motor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia, also called ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (EAOH/AOA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), which is characterized by early-onset progressive ataxia, ocular motor apraxia, peripheral neuropathy and hypoalbuminemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>). Aprataxin interacts with the X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 protein (XRCC1) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), which are a scaffold protein and a molecular nick sensor in DNA single-strand break repair (SSBR), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>), suggesting that aprataxin is associated with SSBR. Consistent with these observations, the lymphoblastoid cells from patients with EAOH/AOA1 show a high sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and alkylating agents, which cause DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In addition, aprataxin has the histidine triad (HIT) motif, which functions as nucleotidyl hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15">12&#x02013;15</xref>), and the zinc finger motif, which is a DNA- or RNA-binding motif. These findings led to the hypothesis that aprataxin has catalytic activity in SSBR.</p><p>SSBs are discontinuities in the sugar&#x02013;phosphate backbone of one strand of a DNA duplex. In neurons, DNA is under continuous threat of damage by endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) or exogenous environmental genotoxins, and more than tens of thousands of SSBs arise in each cell per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). SSBs can arise directly from sugar damage, or indirectly from base damage via the enzymatic cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone as intermediate products of SSBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The formation of another type of SSB is mediated by topoisomerase I (TOP1), which cleaves one strand of a DNA duplex during transcription or DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). If SSBs are not repaired rapidly, they can cause transcription blockage or they are converted to lethal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), leading to cell dysfunction and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Most SSBs are accompanied by the loss of a single nucleotide; this loss must be filled by DNA polymerase and subsequently sealed by DNA ligase. DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol &#x003b2;) and DNA ligase III (Lig3) are most commonly employed for gap filling and ligation during SSBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). SSBs arising directly from sugar damage or indirectly from base damage typically possess damaged 3&#x02032;-ends: 3&#x02032;-phosphate, 3&#x02032;-phosphoglycolate (3&#x02032;-PG), or 3&#x02032;-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-unsaturated aldehyde ends. Because these damaged 3&#x02032;-ends are not suitable for DNA polymerase or DNA ligase, enzymatic processing is required in SSBR to restore the damaged 3&#x02032;-ends to suitable 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl ends. 5&#x02032;-Polynucleotide kinase 3&#x02032;-phosphatase (PNKP) removes damaged 3&#x02032;-phosphate ends, but not other damaged 3&#x02032;-ends. Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) can remove 3&#x02032;-phosphate, 3&#x02032;-PG and 3&#x02032;-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-unsaturated aldehyde ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, the 3&#x02032;-PG and 3&#x02032;-phosphate removal activities of APE1 are &#x0223c;70-fold lower than the AP endonuclease activity of APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>). Therefore, it is assumed that other enzymes can alternatively process these damaged 3&#x02032;-ends.</p><p>In the present study, we hypothesized that aprataxin removes damaged 3&#x02032;-ends and facilitates the repair of SSBs. Here we show that aprataxin has a novel removal activity with a unique substrate specificity toward damaged 3&#x02032;-ends including 3&#x02032;-PG and 3&#x02032;-phosphate ends, and that disease-associated mutant forms of aprataxin lack this activity. The results indicate that aprataxin has an important and direct role in SSBR, that is, it removes blocking molecules from DNA 3&#x02032;-ends, and that neurodegeneration in EAOH/AOA1 may be caused by the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs with damaged 3&#x02032;-ends.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of recombinant aprataxin</title><p>The long-form human aprataxin cDNA (GenBank accession number NM_175073) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers 5&#x02032;-CCGGATCCATGATGCGGGTGTGCTGGTTGG and 3&#x02032;-GGCTCGAGTCACTGTGTCCAGTGCTTCCTG and the cDNA library (Human Ovary Marathon-Ready cDNA: Clonetech) as the template.

Recombinant &#x02018;Bacmids&#x02019; were purified using the High Purity Plasmid Miniprep System (Marligen), and infected to insect cells with the Cellfectin reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendation. A high-titer viral stock was obtained, and Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for 72&#x02009;h. Then, the cells were harvested and lysed in insect cell lysis buffer (BD Pharmingen) with 1&#x000d7; Complete Mini (Roche Diagnostic Corporation) for 30&#x02009;min at 4&#x000b0;C. Recombinant human aprataxin was first purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (MagExtractor&#x000ae; His-tag protein purification kit, TOYOBO). The extracts were fractionated by gel filtration column chromatography (AKTA explorer 10S with HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75&#x02009;pg column, GE Healthcare) in 50&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100&#x02009;mM NaCl. These fractionated extracts were desalinized using Slide-A-Lyzer&#x000ae; dialysis cassettes (Pierce Biotechnology), separated by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB). Western blotting was performed using an anti-Tetra-His antibody (Quiagen) and an anti-aprataxin antibody (ab31841, Abcom).</p><p>Recombinant human Pol &#x003b2;, PNKP and Lig3 were expressed in silkworm <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (Katakura). The cDNA fragment of each protein was amplified by PCR using the cDNA library (Human Ovary Marathon-Ready cDNA: Clontech) as the template and then inserted into pYNGHis (Katakura). The purified plasmid vector was mixed with purified cysteine proteinase-deleted viral DNA and then cotransfected in BmN cells of silkworm <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> larvae. The obtained recombinant virus was used for the infection of silkworm <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> pupae. Infected pupae were incubated at 25&#x000b0;C, and then frozen for 144&#x02009;h postinoculation. Harvested pupae were lysed, and the His-tagged protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (MagExtractor&#x000ae; His-tag protein purification kit, TOYOBO).</p><p>Mutant aprataxin cDNAs were produced using the GeneTailer site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). Wild-type long-form aprataxin (LA) cDNA, the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of aprataxin (1&#x02013;114 amino acids; FHA), the splicing variant of aprataxin (175&#x02013;343 amino acids, GenBank accession number NP_7782411; SA) and the mutant forms of aprataxin cDNA fragments were inserted into the BamHI/XhoI site of pGEX-6P-3 (GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp.). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were overexpressed in Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) bacterial cells containing these plasmids. The bacterial cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C until they reached an <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> of 1.0 and then induced with 1&#x02009;mM isopropyl-1-thio-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside and grown for another 3&#x02009;h before harvesting. Cell pellets were lysed using BugBuster HT (Novagen) with EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The GST-tagged proteins were purified using a GST fusion protein purification kit (Bulk GST Purification Modules&#x000ae;, GE Healthcare).

Through this action, aprataxin might act with DNA polymerase and ligase to repair SSBs with these damaged 3&#x02032;-ends. In addition, the C-terminal region of aprataxin is responsible for the removal activity and the region of 1&#x02013;174 amino acids of aprataxin might enhance the removal activity. Furthermore, the disease-associated mutant forms of aprataxin P206L and V263G lack the removal activity, strongly suggesting that the loss of the removal activity of aprataxin is closely linked to the pathogenesis of EAOH/AOA1.</p><p>The removal of damaged 3&#x02032;-ends is important for repairing SSBs. SSBs arising directly from sugar damage usually possess 3&#x02032;-phosphate or 3&#x02032;-PG ends, whereas SSBs arising indirectly from base damage, via the enzymatic cleavage of the DNA backbone, possess 3&#x02032;-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-unsaturated aldehyde, or 3&#x02032;-phosphate ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The formation of another type of SSB is mediated by TOP1, which cleaves one strand of a ds DNA during transcription or DNA replication and covalently binds at the 3&#x02032;-ends with the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiester linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Several enzymes including a multiprotein complex with XRCC1 have been proposed as candidates for removing these damaged 3&#x02032;-ends. PNKP might restore damaged 3&#x02032;-phosphate ends, but not other damaged 3&#x02032;-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). APE1 is assumed to remove damaged 3&#x02032;-phosphate, 3&#x02032;-PG or 3&#x02032;-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-unsaturated aldehyde ends; however, its enzymatic activity for removing 3&#x02032;-phosphate or 3&#x02032;-PG is extremely lower than its AP endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>). The results using fusion proteins expressed in baculovirus and bacterial expression systems clearly showed that aprataxin restores the damaged 3&#x02032;-PG and 3&#x02032;-phosphate ends to 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl ends, but not 3&#x02032;-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-unsaturated aldehyde ends nor phosphotyrosine ends. Moreover, the 3&#x02032;-PG removal activity of aprataxin is higher than that of APE1 and prefers the gapped ds DNA as well as ss DNA, although the 3&#x02032;-phosphate removal activity of aprataxin is lower than that of PNKP and prefers the ss DNA, not ds DNA. The results suggest that aprataxin is associated with the removal of damaged 3&#x02032;-ends, particularly 3&#x02032;-PG ends, directly induced by sugar damage, whereas APE1 is associated with the removal of damaged 3&#x02032;-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-unsaturated aldehyde ends induced by base damage as well as the endonucleolytic cleavage of an AP site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A and B). By contrast, although both PNKP and aprataxin might restore damaged 3&#x02032;-phospohate ends, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B and C), these proteins are found in mutually exclusive complexes with XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>); therefore, they might function independently of each other in the repair of SSBs induced by sugar damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B and C). The precise physiological roles of PNKP and aprataxin in SSBR, however, await further investigations. <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Model of aprataxin-dependent SSBR pathway. Four SSBR pathways defined by the type of enzyme that removes damaged 3&#x02032;-ends are shown (a, b, c and d). SSBs can arise directly from sugar damage or TOP1 cleavage or indirectly from base damage. Red circles denote the damaged ends, the specific types of which are dependent on the source of the break. [1,2] PARP detects SSBs, thereby recruiting the XRCC1 and Lig3 complex. XRCC1 then replaces PARP. [<bold>3</bold>] The processing of damaged 3&#x02032;-ends is mediated by either APE1 (<bold>a</bold>), aprataxin (<bold>b</bold>), PNKP (<bold>c</bold>) or TDP1 (<bold>d</bold>), depending on the type of damaged 3&#x02032;-end. These damaged 3&#x02032;-ends should be converted to 3&#x02032;-OH ends for subsequent repair processes. In the pathway for repairing indirectly induced SSBs, damaged 3&#x02032;-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; unsaturated aldehyde ends are removed by APE1 (a). In the pathway for repairing directly induced SSBs, 3&#x02032;-PG ends might be removed by aprataxin (b) and 3&#x02032;-phosphate ends by aprataxin or PNKP (b,c). In the pathway for repairing TOP1-mediated SSBs, TOP1 covalent complexes at the 3&#x02032;-ends are restored to 3&#x02032;-phosphate ends by TDP1 (d). [<bold>4</bold>] After removing damaged 3&#x02032;-ends, Pol &#x003b2; fills the gap (red dot line). [<bold>5</bold>] Lig3 seals the single-strand nick (red line).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm158f9"/></fig></p><p>In DNA ligation, DNA ligase transfers AMP residues to 5&#x02032;-ends of the DNA breaks and catalyzes the displacement of the adenylate residues on 5&#x02032;-ends by attacking the adjacent 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl group. When 3&#x02032;-ends are damaged and non-ligated, the adenylate residues remain on 5&#x02032;-ends of SSBs as abortive DNA-ligation intermediates. Recently, Ahel <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that aprataxin removes the adenylate residues on 5&#x02032;-ends of SSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). As reported in their article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), aprataxin used in the present study also removed an adenylate residue from a 5&#x02032;-end of nicked ds DNA. These results indicate that aprataxin contributes to processing the &#x02018;dirty ends&#x02019;, both 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-ends, of the DNA breaks. Furthermore, the disease-associated mutant forms of aprataxin lost their 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-end processing activities, suggesting the importance of the activities for EAOH/AOA1 pathogenesis. To determine the main physiological role of aprataxin in SSBR, we have to show the accumulation of SSBs with these dirty ends in tissues from patients with EAOH/AOA1 in future studies.</p><p>The clinical phenotype of EAOH/AOA1 is specifically restricted to the nervous system, raising the possibility that the activity of aprataxin to remove 3&#x02032;-phosphate or 3&#x02032;-PG ends plays an important role in neurons. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), the causative gene product for spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy type 1 (SCAN1), removes the TOP1 peptide from 3&#x02032;-ends in SSBs induced by TOP1. In addition to its tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase activity, TDP1 has been also proposed to remove 3&#x02032;-PG ends and function in the repair of SSBs induced by oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The clinical phenotype of SCAN1 is similar to that of EAOH/AOA1, because they include cerebellar degeneration, posterior column involvement and peripheral axonal neuropathy without predisposition to malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). These similarities between EAOH/AOA1 and SCAN1 suggest that the removal of damaged 3&#x02032;-ends, particularly those induced by oxidative stress, is crucial for the viability and function of neurons, in particular Purkinje cells and dorsal root ganglion cells.</p><p>The unique properties of neurons including a high rate of ROS production and a high transcriptional activity may lead to the generation of more SSBs compared with non-neuronal cells. Furthermore, although mitotic cells can utilize a homologous recombination machinery to compensate for a defect in SSBR, postmitotic neurons are unable to repair damaged DNA molecules in a DNA-replication-dependent manner and they are highly dependent on SSBR for DNA integrity. Therefore, neurons might be vulnerable to a defect in SSBR. The reason why a specific neuronal subtype is vulnerable to impairment of the aprataxin-dependent or TDP1-dependent SSBR system remains to be elucidated. Further studies on the mechanism underlying neuronal death and dysfunction caused by a defect in SSBR should provide new insights into therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data is available at NAR online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm158_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="nar_gkm158_nar-02767-c-2006-File011.eps"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas &#x02018;Advanced Brain Science Project&#x02019; and &#x02018;Applied Genomics&#x02019;, a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) and (B) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, a grant for the Research for the Future Program from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, a grant for &#x02018;the Research Committee for Ataxic Diseases&#x02019; of the Research on Measures for Intractable Diseases from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, Japan, a grant from the Virtual Research Institute of Aging of Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim, a grant from the Naito Foundation, and grants from the Takeda Science Foundation, Suzuken Memorial Foundation, and Tsubaki Memorial Neuroscience Research Foundation. &#x02018;the Research Committee for Ataxic Diseases&#x02019; of the Research on Measures for Intractable Diseases from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour, Japan.
