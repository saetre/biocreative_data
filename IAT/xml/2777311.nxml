Chronically infected hosts are asymptomatic and transmit disease to na&#x000ef;ve hosts via fecal shedding of bacteria, thereby serving as a critical reservoir for disease. We show that the bacterial effector protein SseI (also called SrfH), which is translocated into host cells by the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system (T3SS), is required for <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. SseI inhibits normal cell migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) in vitro, and such inhibition requires the host factor IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), an important regulator of cell migration. SseI binds directly to IQGAP1 and co-localizes with this factor at the cell periphery. The C-terminal domain of SseI is similar to PMT/ToxA, a bacterial toxin that contains a cysteine residue (C1165) that is critical for activity. Mutation of the corresponding residue in SseI (C178A) eliminates SseI function in vitro and in vivo, but not binding to IQGAP1. In addition, infection with wild-type (WT) <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> suppressed DC migration to the spleen in vivo in an SseI-dependent manner. Correspondingly, examination of spleens from mice infected with WT <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> revealed fewer DC and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes compared to mice infected with <italic>&#x00394;sseI S. typhimurium</italic>. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SseI inhibits normal host cell migration, which ultimately counteracts the ability of the host to clear systemic bacteria.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Bacteria belonging to the genus <italic>Salmonella</italic> are capable of causing long-term chronic systemic infections, and bacteria primarily reside within macrophages in lymphoid tissues and sporadically are shed in the feces. These persistently infected individuals serve as a significant reservoir for disease transmission. Despite the importance of <italic>Salmonella</italic> as a human pathogen, relatively little is known about the host immune response or virulence mechanisms of long-term systemic infections. Host-adapted <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains invade and manipulate host cells by releasing specialized bacterial effector proteins into the host cell. We show that one of these bacterial effector proteins, SseI (SrfH), is required for <italic>Salmonella</italic> to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. SseI is able to block the migration of host immune cells and consequentially attenuate the host's ability to clear systemic bacteria. SseI accomplishes this inhibitory activity in part by associating with the host protein IQGAP1, an important regulator of cell migration. The amino acid sequence of SseI is similar to several other protein sequences of known bacterial pathogens, including PMT/ToxA, a toxin, indicating that these factors may function similarly to one another and may comprise a new family of bacterial effector proteins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> is a pathogenic bacterial species that is an important cause of disease in humans ranging from gastroenteritis to systemic infections.

However, SseI did not reduce the capacity of DC to stimulate T cell proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000671.s005">Fig. S5B, S5C, S5D</xref>).

Thus, a possible hypothesis is that SseI indirectly controls CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell numbers by suppressing DC migration and limiting their ability to effectively prime na&#x000ef;ve T cells.

Nevertheless, the effects of SseI on host cell migration, through its interactions with the host molecule IQGAP1, correlate with a reduced capacity of the host to clear <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> from systemic sites of infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance to NIH guidelines, the Animal Welfare Act, and US federal law.
