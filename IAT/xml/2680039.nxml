The temporal and spatial expression of these two genes is usually tightly and coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level. This ensures the obligate pairing of K5 and K14 proteins to generate an intermediate filament (IF) network that is essential for the structure and function of the proliferative keratinocytes. Our previous studies have shown that the basal-keratinocyte restricted transcription factor p63 is a direct regulator of K14 gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here we provide evidence that p63, specifically the &#x00394;N isoform also regulates the expression of the K5 gene by binding to a conserved enhancer within the 5&#x02032; upstream region. By using specific antibodies against &#x00394;Np63, we show a concordance in the expression between basal keratins and &#x00394;Np63 proteins but not the TAp63 isoforms during early embryonic skin development. We demonstrate, that contrary to a previous report, transgenic mice expressing &#x00394;Np63 in lung epithelium exhibit squamous metaplasia with de novo induction of K5 and K14 as well as transdifferentiation to the epidermal cell lineage. Interestingly, the in vivo epidermal inductive properties of &#x00394;Np63 do not require the C-terminal SAM domain. Finally, we show that &#x00394;Np63 alone can restore the expression of the basal keratins and reinitiate the failed epidermal differentiation program in the skin of p63 null animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>&#x00394;Np63 is a critical mediator of keratinocyte stratification program and directly regulates the basal keratin genes.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Keratin proteins belong to two distinct classes, type I acidic and type II basic and represent the bulk of IF genes expressed in epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Coulombe1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Type I and type II keratins are often co-expressed in specific pairs in both a tissue-specific and differentiation-specific fashion. For example, the pair formed by type I K14 and the type II K5 is characteristic of the mitotically active basal cells of the epithelium that line the stratified surface of the skin, digestive tract, genito-urinary tract and mammary glands among other tissues and organs. As the proliferating basal epithelial cells stop dividing and initiate a specialized program of differentiation, they down-regulate the expression of K5 and K14 and induce the expression of new sets of keratin genes depending upon the particular tissue in which they are located <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Moll1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The restricted expression pattern of the basal-specific keratin genes is established during embryonic development and is thought to be controlled primarily at the transcriptional level. Indeed, during early embryonic morphogenesis, a switch from expression of simple epithelial keratins K8 and K18 to the stratified epithelial markers K5 and K14 is a critical developmental event that marks the stage of commitment and stratification of the epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Koster1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Nagarajan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the transcriptional control of the basal keratin pair, K5 and K14, has increased over the last few years. By using DNAse I hypersensitive site mapping and reporter gene assays both in keratinocytes in culture and in transgenic animals in vivo, we and others have identified several cis-regulatory elements of the <italic>K5</italic> and <italic>K14</italic> genes, which are important for their cell-type specific expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Sinha1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Kaufman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Sinha2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Byrne1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Byrne2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Ramirez1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of these regulatory elements are scattered in the 5&#x02032; flanking regions of the <italic>K5</italic> and <italic>K14</italic> gene and are highly evolutionarily conserved. Biochemical studies of these DNA sequences have uncovered the role of several transcription factors such as AP-1, AP-2, Sp1 and Ets proteins in regulating K5 and K14 gene expression. Interestingly, many of these transcription factors are broadly expressed and not restricted to basal keratinocytes. This observation had led to the suggestion that combinatorial effects of ubiquitous transcription factors or restricted co-activators might regulate the basal-keratinocyte specific expression of K5 and K14. However, the identification of transcription factor p63, which is highly restricted to basal keratinocytes and directly regulates <italic>K14</italic> gene expression by interacting with an enhancer element has rekindled renewed interest in this field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Romano1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The transcription factor p63, a homolog of the tumor suppressor p53, plays an important role in maintaining the progenitor basal cell populations in stratified epithelium such as those in the epidermis of the skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Candi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, p63-null mice exhibit a striking block in skin development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Mills1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Yang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Kurita1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In the absence of p63, the embryo is encased in a primordial epithelial layer that fails to express the basal markers K5 and K14 and does not undergo proper stratification and differentiation. The skin phenotype observed in p63<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice has led to the formulation of two hypotheses concerning the biological role of p63 in epidermal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-McKeon1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Koster2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. According to one hypothesis, p63 may be important in maintaining the proliferative potential of the stem cell population in the epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Senoo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, studies from a different independently generated p63 null mouse model suggest that p63 may be required in the commitment step to the stratified epithelial lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Koster3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Notwithstanding these differences, it is clear that p63 is a critical transcriptional regulator required for keratinocyte development and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Truong1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. One quirk that has compounded a thorough and careful analysis of this transcription factor is the myriad naturally occurring isoforms of p63.</p><p>The <italic>Trp63</italic> gene encoding p63 gives rise to multiple functionally distinct protein isoforms, including TAp63, which encodes for an amino terminal transactivation domain (TA) and &#x00394;Np63, which lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain (&#x00394;N), and is synthesized from an internal promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Yang2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, both TA and &#x00394;N transcripts are differentially spliced at the 3&#x02032; end generating proteins with unique C-termini, which are designated as &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; isoforms. Unlike the shorter &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; isoforms, the p63&#x003b1; isoforms harbour a Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain, which is thought to mediate protein-protein interactions. One controversy regarding p63 has been fueled by the conflicting observations regarding the expression and function of the two major N-terminal variant isoforms, primarily during epidermal development. While it is unambiguous that &#x00394;Np63 is highly expressed in basal keratinocytes, the expression profile of TAp63 remains unclear. Earlier studies have suggested that TAp63 and not &#x00394;Np63 is the primary driver of the switch in expression of simple epithelial keratins K8 and K18 to the stratified epithelial markers K5 and K14 during early embryonic morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Koster3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the fact that undisputed identification of TAp63 mRNA and protein in mouse embryonic skin remains elusive and that the TAp63 isoform-specific knockout mice have no discernible skin phenotype warrants a re-evaluation of this observation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Suh1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the &#x00394;Np63 isoforms lack the amino-terminal sequences, it was originally proposed that these proteins might act primarily as dominant negative regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Yang2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However recent studies indicate that &#x00394;Np63 proteins have intrinsic biological activities and can transcriptionally activate or repress target gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Ortt1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Helton1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Birkaya1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-King1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Barbieri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Keyes1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these findings have now shifted the attention towards &#x00394;Np63 and its perceived role in actively dictating early epidermal development and governing keratinocyte cell fate and lineage choices.</p><p>To address the expression profile of the two major isoforms of p63, in the present study, we have utilized &#x00394;N and TA specific antibodies. Our studies confirm that in the early stages of skin development, &#x00394;Np63 proteins predominate and are hence likely to mediate the commitment of ectodermal cells to an epidermal cell fate. In support of this hypothesis we have identified a p63-response element present in a highly conserved enhancer corresponding to a DNAse I hypersensitive segment of the basal keratinocyte restricted <italic>K5</italic> gene. We provide biochemical evidence that &#x00394;Np63 can interact with and activate the K5 enhancer and that all &#x00394;Np63 isoforms are capable of inducing <italic>de novo</italic> expression of K5 in a cell line that does not express detectable levels of p63 or K5. Finally, we show that ectopic expression of various isoforms of &#x00394;Np63 in transgenic mouse lungs and in p63 null animals, leads to <italic>de novo</italic> induction and restoration respectively, of both K5 and K14 gene expression. Taken together, our data provide additional insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing K5 gene expression, and suggest that K5, like its partner K14, is regulated in a direct and similar fashion by &#x00394;Np63.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Development of p63 isoform specific antibodies</title><p>Prior to this study, the expression analysis of &#x00394;N and TA p63 isoforms during various stages of epidermal development has been performed using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Koster3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Laurikkala1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a systematic and careful analysis of the respective proteins has not been undertaken with isoform-specific antibodies. To address this shortcoming, we generated TA-specific antibodies against the N-terminal portion of mouse TAp63 (amino acids 1&#x02013;115), a domain that is not shared with &#x00394;Np63. We performed Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence studies to address specificity of the anti-TA antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, the anti-TAp63 antibodies detected the proteins at the expected sizes only in HA epitope-tagged TAp63&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, or &#x003b3; transfected cells but did not detect any band in the HA epitope-tagged &#x00394;Np63 &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, or &#x003b3; transfected cells, confirming the specificity of the newly generated polyclonal antibodies. Western blot with anti-&#x00394;Np63 (RR-14) antibodies demonstrated that the &#x00394;Np63 proteins were indeed expressed in the transfected cells and did not cross-react with TA proteins as previously demonstrated. The expression of all six isoforms of p63 proteins was verified by western blot with anti-HA antibodies. Immunofluorescence studies further validated these data, since anti-TA antibodies recognized TAp63 protein localized predominantly in nuclei of transiently transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Finally, to examine the affinity of the anti-TAp63 polyclonal antibodies to TAp63 proteins in vivo, we performed immunoflourescence on ovary sections where TAp63 has been shown to be highly expressed. The staining pattern observed in the ovarian follicles using our anti-TA antibodies matched exactly with published reports, further confirming the specificity of our newly developed antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Suh1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0005623-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005623.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Generation of TAp63-specific antibody.</title><p>A) Specificity of the TAp63 antibody.

At early embryonic day 10.5 and 11.5 (E10.5 and E11.5), the primitive epithelial lining encasing the embryo expressed &#x00394;Np63 as shown by a strong and uniform nuclear staining with anti-&#x00394;Np63 RR-14 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Similar staining was observed with H-129 antibodies, which recognize an epitope in the C-terminus of the longer p63&#x003b1; isoforms. We also performed immunofluorescence with anti-K5 and anti-K14 antibodies and observed similar overlapping expression profile to that of &#x00394;Np63 except the staining was cytoplasmic as expected. However, antibodies against TAp63 failed to show any staining suggesting that under similar experimental conditions, the TAp63 proteins are either not expressed or expressed at levels undetectable by our antibodies. To follow the developmental pattern of the expression of p63 isoforms and the basal keratins, we performed additional immunofluorescence studies at E14.5 and E16.5, two stages where the epidermal stratification and differentiation programs are distinctly matured as evident by histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g002">Figure 2</xref>, left panel). Similar to results obtained at E11.5, at these later stages both RR-14 and H-129 antibodies detected strong &#x00394;Np63 expression in the basal cells of the stratified epidermis, whereas TAp63 was undetectable. These results thus indicated that TAp63 proteins are virtually non-existent in the developing skin epidermis, whereas &#x00394;Np63 and the K5/K14 keratin pair show strong and overlapping expression in the basal keratinocytes at different stages of embryonic development.</p><fig id="pone-0005623-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005623.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>&#x00394;Np63 is expressed during early mouse embryonic skin development.</title><p>Isoform specific expression of p63 was analyzed during various stages of skin development using three antibodies recognizing different p63 variants.

The addition of an antibody that specifically recognizes the &#x00394;Np63 isoform of p63 (RR-14) results in a clear supershift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g003">Figure 3</xref>, compare lanes 10 to 11). We also used a second commercially available antibody (H-129), and observed a similar supershift of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lane 12). On the contrary, anti-TA antibodies did not effect the p63-DNA complex in agreement with the fact that these keratinocytes do not express any detectable TAp63.These results strongly suggest that the &#x00394;Np63 and not the TA isoform of p63 binds to the specific p63RE present in Hs II of the K5 gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Occupancy of K5 Hs II by &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; in keratinocytes</title><p>In light of the results obtained from our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, we next wanted to verify whether &#x00394;Np63 was able to interact with Hs II of the <italic>K5</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic>, by performing ChIP assays in human keratinocytes. Two separate antibodies against p63, one directed specifically against &#x00394;Np63 (RR-14) and one that recognizes the p63&#x003b1; isoforms (H-129), as well as a control antibody (IgG) were used for the ChIP experiments. To determine if &#x00394;Np63 is associated with this region, we used primers, which specifically amplify Hs II region. As a negative control, primers that amplify a genomic segment corresponding to gyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were chosen. Our PCR data clearly shows a specific amplification of the Hs II region in p63-immunoprecipitated genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We further quantified this result by real time PCR, which demonstrated a 6.6, and 5-fold enrichment of Hs II in samples immunoprecipitated with RR-14 and H-129 respectively, versus control antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast we did not observe any recruitment of &#x00394;Np63 to the control region corresponding to the GAPDH gene. Due to the high level of sequence conservation observed for Hs II between both human and mouse, we wondered whether &#x00394;Np63 similarly occupied this region in the mouse <italic>K5</italic> gene. We therefore repeated our ChIP experiments utilizing primary mouse keratinocytes. There was a specific localization of p63 to the mouse K5 5&#x02032; genomic segment as evident by both regular PCR as well as real time PCR results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

To determine the contribution of Hs II element to keratinocyte-specific expression of K5, we assayed for the ability of this element to activate transcription of a luciferase (<italic>luc</italic>) reporter gene in transient transfection assays. We therefore generated a construct in which the sequences corresponding to Hs II were cloned upstream of the K5 minimal promoter and luciferase reporter gene (HsIIK5Luc). In our transfection assays using primary mouse keratinocytes, we found that HsIIK5Luc is able to activate transcription 7-fold over the K5 minimal promoter alone (K5Luc) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005623.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). A CMVLacZ plasmid was co-transfected to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency. To test if the transcriptional activation of Hs II was also observed with a heterologous promoter, we generated an additional construct where Hs II was cloned upstream of the minimal promoter of thymidine kinase (TK) (HsIITKLuc). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005623.s002">Figure S2</xref>, HSIITKLuc showed a 3-fold activation over the TK minimal promoter alone (TKLuc). These data confirm the ability of HS II to act as an enhancer element, likely contributing to the keratinocyte-specific expression of K5.</p><p>Finally to test the ability of various p63 isoforms to activate the K5 enhancer element, we performed transient transfection experiments in Ptk2 cells, which do not express endogenous p63 or K5. The HsIIK5Luc construct was transfected into Ptk2 cells along with either a control expression plasmid pCMVHA, or plasmids expressing various HA-epitope tagged isoforms of p63. Again, a CMVLacZ plasmid was co-transfected to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency. As data presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005623.s002">Figure S2B</xref> indicate, expression of &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;, &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2;, and &#x00394;Np63&#x003b3; isoforms led to 3&#x02013;7 fold higher transcriptional activity of the K5 enhancer element respectively, as compared to the empty vector alone. Under similar conditions, activation by TAp63&#x003b1;, TAp63&#x003b2;, and TAp63&#x003b3; isoforms was modest and showed only 1.5&#x02013;2 fold higher transcriptional activity of the K5 enhancer element, as compared to the empty vector alone. These data suggest that various &#x00394;Np63 isoforms can regulate the expression of the K5 enhancer at the transcriptional level and this activation is considerably more potent than the TAp63 isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Ectopic expression of multiple isoforms of p63 can induce expression of K5</title><p>We have previously shown that ectopic expression of the various isoforms of &#x00394;Np63 are capable of inducing K14 expression and that this induction is dependent upon the DNA-binding activity of p63.

Transgene expression was directed to lung epithelia using mice expressing the reverse tetracycline-activator (rtTA) from the human Surfactant Protein-C (SPC) promoter (SP-C/rtTA). HA-&#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; or HA-&#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; transgenic mice, were bred to the SP-C/rtTA transgenic mice, which have been previously shown to regulate doxycycline-inducible expression of transgenes to single-layered lung epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Perl1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The SP-C promoter targets transgene expression to the cuboidal surfactant-secreting type II alveolar cells, and to the distal Clara cells of the lung epithelium. Neither of these cell types expresses endogenous p63, K5, or K14. Doxycycline was administered at embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5) of gestation to induce transgene expression in the lung epithelia of the Bi-transgenic (BG) mice (&#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;BG or &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2;BG). Lung biopsy specimens obtained from E18.5 animals were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The staining data demonstrated that ectopic expression of both the &#x00394;Np63 isoforms resulted in severe alterations in lung alveolar epithelial morphology, including squamous metaplasia in BG animals as compared to WT control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005623-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, immunofluorescence staining revealed that sustained expression of both &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; and &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; to the distal airway epithelium of the lungs, induced <italic>de novo</italic> expression of both K5 and K14. Staining of the lung tissue sections with HA antibody allowed us to confirm the ectopic expression of the &#x00394;Np63 proteins in the lung epithelial cells. In addition, we also examined expression of Thyroid Transcription Factor I (TTF1), a known marker of the lung epithelial cells targeted by the SP-C promoter, which showed overlapping expression with &#x00394;Np63 (data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Maeda1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown in ure 5C, lung epithelial cells expressing the &#x00394;Np63 transgene (green) also strongly expressed both K5 and K14 (red). This is in stark contrast to lung sections from wild type control littermate animals, which do not express the transgene and not show any staining for the basal keratins (data not shown). Interestingly, a subpopulation of K5 and K14&#x0002b;ve lung cells did not show detectable levels of p63, this could be possibly due to differences in protein stability or detection sensitivity or to unknown cell non-autonomous effects of the ectopically expressed &#x00394;Np63. Taken together, these results indicate that ectopic expression of both &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; and &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; are sufficient to commit a single-layered epithelium to an epidermal cell fate. To examine whether these altered lung cell types expressing &#x00394;Np63 further commit to a keratinocyte differentiation program, we stained BG lung tissues with antibodies against K1 and K10, which are characteristic markers of skin keratinocytes of the differentiated spinous layer. Surprisingly, BG lung epithelium, unlike WT control lungs exhibited strong expression of K1/K10 further validating the notion that expression of &#x00394;Np63 alone was sufficient to trigger the transformation of lung cells along a stratifying epidermal pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005623.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0005623-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005623.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>&#x00394;Np63 can induce <italic>de novo</italic> expression of K5 and K14 in single-layered lung epithelia.</title><p>A) Schematic depicting the mating scheme used to generate transgenic animals expressing the HA-&#x00394;Np63 transgene in single-layered lung epithelium using the surfactant protein C (SPC) promoter in a tetracycline inducible fashion.

Our experimental plan is different from the published study on several accounts. First, we overexpressed &#x00394;Np63 in the basal skin keratinocytes in an inducible fashion by utilizing the K5-promoter-Tet driver animals and second, the p63 knockout allele used in our study is different from the one previously used. This is important since it has been reported that the two p63 knockout alleles exhibit subtle but distinctly different skin phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Mills1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Yang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

Bi-transgenic animals that expressed either &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; or &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; did not completely restore the epidermal integrity of the p63 null animals as the animals perished soon after birth.

In agreement with the histological features, additional markers of differentiation such as K1, K10 (spinous layer) and filaggrin (granular layer) were also prominently expressed in focal areas of fully matured epidermis. Collectively, these data confirm results obtained from prior studies and suggest that the &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; and &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; isoforms alone are competent in initiating the expression of basal markers and stratification.</p><fig id="pone-0005623-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005623.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Ectopic Expression of &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; can partially rescue the p63 null phenotype.</title><p>Top left panel shows H&#x00026;E staining of p63<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and p63<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>,&#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; rescued animals.

The association of the K5/K14 IF network with the proliferating basal keratinocytes of the skin is a distinguishing feature that persists throughout the life of an organism. One path to a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that govern the initial commitment of epithelial cells to a keratinocyte cell fate and subsequent stratification and differentiation involves identification of transcription factors that control the regulation of K5 and K14. Our prior studies identified a number of evolutionarily conserved DNase I Hs elements scattered in the 5&#x02032; region of the K5 and K14 gene. We had shown that various transcription factors including those belonging to AP-1, AP-2 and Ets family were important in mediating the activity of K5 and K14 enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Sinha1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Kaufman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Sinha2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Initial studies, similar to those described in this paper led to an interesting hypothesis, mainly that TAp63 isoforms are required for commitment to a stratified cell lineage during embryonic skin development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Koster3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Koster4">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. This &#x0201c;commitment&#x0201d; model further suggests that the dominant negative &#x00394;Np63 function is required to oppose TAp63 isoforms to achieve proper differentiation. According to this study, TAp63 was expressed in the early ectodermal cells prior to the simple epithelial to epidermal switch. Furthermore it was capable of inducing the expression of K14 when ectopically expressed in epithelial cells and causing a squamous metaplasia when expressed in lung epithelium of transgenic mice. Indeed, the argument that had supported the notion that TAp63 was the driver for commitment was the fact that under similar experimental conditions, &#x00394;Np63 failed to induce basal keratins both in cell culture and in transgenic mice.</p><p>Our data presented in this paper clearly argues against the model in which TAp63 proteins are the only isoforms that are competent in conferring a basal-cell like phenotype. We posit that any question about the functional relevance of p63 isoforms should begin with a clear understanding of where they are expressed. While the expression of TAp63 and &#x00394;Np63 has been evaluated at the mRNA level by RT-PCR and by in situ hybridization experiments, the results have been contradictory. While according to one report, TAp63 mRNA can be detected in whole embryos as early as E9.5, other studies suggest that while in embryonic skin &#x00394;Np63 mRNA is expressed at high levels, TAp63 mRNA could barely be detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Koster3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Laurikkala1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This discrepancy has been attributed to experimental differences and due to the difficulties in processing and manipulating mouse embryos at such early developmental stages. With this controversy plaguing the p63 field, it is hence very important that the relative expression of these two isoforms be clearly evaluated, in particular at the protein level.</p><p>We have now thoroughly evaluated the expression of TAp63 and &#x00394;Np63 in mouse embryonic skin using antibodies generated in our laboratory that are specific to each isoform. These studies unequivocally argue that the &#x00394;Np63 and not TAp63 isoforms are predominantly expressed at various stages of early embryonic skin development and co-localize with the basal keratin markers K5 and K14. One of the arguments that have been made is that the TA proteins are labile and hence notoriously difficult to detect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Barbieri2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Truong2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. While this remains a possibility, our immunoflourescence studies with anti-TA antibodies clearly show robust expression of TAp63 in ovary. This data is also in agreement with the results obtained from the McKeon lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Suh1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, some recent publications have reported expression of TAp63 in the suprabasal layer of adult human skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Chikh1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Nylander1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Using our anti-TAp63 antibodies, so far we have failed to detect TAp63 in the differentiated mouse keratinocytes &#x02014; this could be due to species-specific or age related differences. Taken together, these results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that under normal physiological conditions, &#x00394;Np63 is the primary isoform expressed in keratinocytes.</p><p>Since p63 null animals lack epidermis and do not express K5 and K14, one potential role of p63 might be in regulating the expression of these basal-specific genes. Indeed, our studies have shown that p63 can directly interact with p63-responsive regulatory elements present in the enhancer of the K14 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Romano1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This data, coupled with the fact that p63 can activate or induce expression of K14 in a wide variety of epithelial cells strongly suggest that the basal keratin pair is a direct transcriptional target of p63 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Romano1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Koster3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Medawar1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Candi2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Boldrup1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the fact that K5 and K14 are typically co-expressed and hence likely to be coordinately regulated by a similar set of transcription factors, so far no experimental data have linked p63 to K5. To address this, we examined previously described DNAse I hypersensitive sites that are present in the 5&#x02032; upstream region of the K5 gene. Here we show that one of the most highly conserved enhancer segments does indeed contain a p63RE. We provide biochemical data to support the notion that &#x00394;Np63 can bind to this element both by EMSA and ChIP experiments and that all three isoforms of &#x00394;Np63 can induce K5 when ectopically expressed, thus confirming that K5, similar to its partner K14, is a direct transcriptional target of &#x00394;Np63. Although we found no p63-response elements in the proximal promoter region of K5, we cannot rule out the recruitment of &#x00394;Np63 to this region through protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors such as Sp1, as described for the &#x00394;Np63 promoter for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Romano2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although our data clearly show that both the basal keratins K5 and K14 are direct p63 targets, there are some lingering questions. For example, it is disconcerting to note that the global ChIP studies on p63 targets have so far not identified the p63RE described in this study. This could be potentially due to an inherent limitation of the ChIP&#x02013;Chip experiments in offering full coverage of the genome or differences in choice of cell lines, antibodies or other technical conditions. Hence, an argument can be made that the p63 target database is still evolving and far from completion, and there is a continuing need to find additional bona-fide p63 targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-DellaGatta1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Another observation that warrants discussion is the result obtained from one knockdown study of p63, which showed no change in K5 and K14 levels in regenerated human tissue, in contrast to dramatic loss of these basal keratins in p63-null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Truong2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. As suggested by the Khavari group, it is possible that regulation of the basal keratins differs in a developmental context versus that of committed, postnatal cells. Whereas the former process requires p63, the latter does not. Finally it is worth mentioning that expression of p63 in cell culture leads to a stronger and more consistent induction of K14 in contrast to K5 (our unpublished data). This is not surprising considering the growing evidence that the normal expression patterns of K5 and K14 in various basal cells might not be completely overlapping - a feature consistent with the notion that there might be differential mode of transcriptional regulation of K5 and K14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Lu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Larouche1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Mikaelian1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the induction of the basal keratins is not observed in a small percentage of p63&#x0002b;ve cells. This further suggests that the p63-mediated induction of specific genes is probably a complex process that is dependent upon a host of factors such as specific cell cycle stage, differentiation or epigenetic status, or the availability and activity of other transcription factors (such as AP-2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Guttormsen1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In an effort to probe the function of &#x00394;Np63 in an in vivo setting, we have generated an inducible transgenic system to express two isoforms, &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; and &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2;. We report that ectopic expression of &#x00394;Np63 in the lung epithelium results in a dramatic switch in cell lineage commitment whereby the type II alveolvar cells show clear evidence of metaplastic changes from a simple epithelium to a stratified epithelium accompanied by robust induction of both K5 and K14 as well as K1 and K10. It has been shown that in the absence of p63, the stratified squamous epithelium in cervix and vagina is transformed into a simple columnar epithelium expressing uterine epithelial differentiation markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Kurita1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, the ventral epithelium of the p63<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bladder, where &#x00394;Np63 is the predominant isoform is neither committed to stratification nor differentiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Cheng1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations taken with our gain-of-function studies further reinforce the idea that &#x00394;Np63 is the primary instructive driver in maintaining a stratified and differentiated epithelium. The discrepancy between our findings and those from a prior study where &#x00394;Np63 failed to activate basal-specific gene expression is likely due to differences in experimental set up or unknown modifying factors that remains to be sorted out.</p><p>One recent report has examined the relative contribution of &#x00394;Np63 and TAp63 by reintroducing these isoforms separately or in combination in p63 null mice with the help of K5 promoter-driven transgenic animals that express &#x00394;Np63 and TAp63 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Candi2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies by Candi et al. suggest that only &#x00394;Np63 and not TAp63 when expressed under the K5 promoter can partially rescue the skin phenotype and that there is improved rescue when both &#x00394;Np63 and TAp63 are co-expressed. This additive effect might be due to unique and complementary functions of &#x00394;Np63 and TAp63 or simply the results of an overall higher level of p63 due to the presence of both isoforms. Our inducible transgenic model system allowed us to revisit this issue. One major difference in the two studies is that we used a different p63 null allele &#x02013; an important consideration since it has been reported that these two animals show subtle yet distinct differences in the extent of epidermal integrity. While for the experiments described by Candi et al, p63 null animals supposedly contain clumps of differentiated cells in the epidermis, in the p63 null animals described in this study, no such clumps were observed in new born animals, as has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Mills1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Yang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Candi2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in agreement with prior studies, expression of &#x00394;Np63 can partially restore the p63 null skin phenotype and give rise to isolated, small pockets of stratified epithelium. These epithelial structures morphologically resemble a fully differentiated skin and express the entire battery of differentiation markers from basal-specific K5 and K14, early differentiation K1 and K10 to terminal differentiation filaggrin. What is remarkable is the fact that even the shorter &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; isoform, lacking a significant portion of the C-terminal domain is capable of rescuing the skin phenotype. This observation suggests that the SAM domain, a unique feature of p63 and p73 but not p53, is dispensable for the epidermal cell fate and stratification inducing properties of p63 &#x02013; a finding that is further substantiated by the lung squamous metaplasia phenotype of the SpC-&#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; transgenic animals. There are several potential reasons to account for only a partial and patchy rescue of the p63 null skin by &#x00394;Np63 overexpression - the K5/14 promoter is probably not active at an early enough developmental stage, and more importantly, promoter activity might be severely attenuated in the p63 null background given the fact that p63 itself is a critical regulator of these basal-specific promoters. It is important to highlight that exogenous expression of &#x00394;Np63 in ES-derived ectodermal cells efficiently differentiates them into keratinocytes and that in zebrafish, knockdown of &#x00394;Np63 leads to a block in epidermal proliferation and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Medawar1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005623-Lee1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.
