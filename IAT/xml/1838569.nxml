The majority of knowledge on IGF-1R signaling is concerned with its role in the activation of the canonical phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways. However, the role of IGF-1R ubiquitination in modulating IGF-1R function is an area of current research. In light of this we sought to determine the relationship between IGF-1R phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and modulation of growth signals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p>Wild type and mutant constructs of IGF-1R were transfected into IGF-1R null fibroblasts. IGF-1R autophosphorylation and ubiquitination were determined by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. IGF-1R degradation and stability was determined by cyclohexamide-chase assay in combination with lysosome and proteasome inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>IGF-1R autophosphorylation was found to be an absolute requirement for receptor ubiquitination. Deletion of C-terminal domain had minimal effect on IGF-1 induced receptor autophosphorylation, however, ubiquitination and ERK activation were completely abolished.

Ligand-receptor interaction results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain (spanning from amino acid 973&#x02013;1229) of the &#x003b2;-subunit.

In unstimulated state, the activation loop, containing the critical tyrosine (Y) residues 1131, 1135 and 1136, behaves as a pseudosubstrate that blocks the active site. Upon ligand binding the three tyrosines of the activation loop are transphosphorylated by the dimeric subunit partner. Phosphorylation of Y1135 and Y1131 destabilizes the auto-inhibitory conformation of the activation loop, whereas phosphorylation of Y1136 stabilizes the catalytically optimized conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Favelyukis1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, allowing substrate and ATP access. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for other signaling molecules such as insulin receptor substrate 1&#x02013;4 (IRS-1-4) and Shc, leading to the subsequent activation of the phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K), the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the 14-3-3 pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Baserga1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-LeRoith1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Baserga2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Yu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recent data has shown that IGF-1R is a substrate for ubiquitination, however, the role is unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Girnita2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Girnita4">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.Two E3 ligases, Mdm2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Girnita2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and Nedd 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Vecchione1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, have been demonstrated to be involved in mediating the covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties to lysine residues in IGF-1R.

There are several endocytic pathways that can mediate internalization of cell surface receptors, some of which are dependent on receptor ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-DiGuglielmo1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Sigismund1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

The graphs show the quantified signals of receptor phosphorylation and ubiquitination based on 3 separate experiments.

In this respect, we used cells stably transfected with the 4 aforementioned IGF-1R mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, Y1136F cells (with impaired IGF-1R kinase activity due to a point mutation at Y1136 site in the activation loop) is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated shortly after ligand stimulation, however the phosphorylation and ubiquitination patterns are transient when compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Both phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the receptor were detectable exclusively after 1 min exposure to IGF-1, however not after longer stimulation times (3&#x02013;20 min). Cells expressing Y950F receptors (with impaired signaling due to reduced binding of Shc and IRS-1 to the receptor) displayed phosphorylation and ubiquitination with similar kinetics as the wild type IGF-1R (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), although the ubiquitination signals persisted longer in Y950F cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, whereas the C-tail truncated IGF-1Rs in &#x00394;1245 and Y950F-&#x00394;1245 cells are fully phosphorylated (compared to the wild type receptor), the ubiquitination capacity is completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). This suggests that the C-terminal domain is critical for IGF-1 mediated ubiquitination.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>IGF-1R ubiquitination is important for ERK activation</title><p>Since we now have identified an IGF-1R construct with deficient ubiquitination capacity we sought to investigate whether ubiquitination influences the signaling responses mediated by IGF-1R. We stimulated serum starved wt, K1003R, Y1136F and &#x00394;1245 cells with IGF-1 for different time points (0&#x02013;20 min). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was assessed as a measure of MAPK activation and phosphorylation of Akt as a measure of PI3K activation. The levels of expression of phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-(S473) Akt were investigated by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Akt phosphorylation induced by wild type IGF-1R was seen after 1 min of IGF-1 stimulation, peaked at 3 min and was maintained until the final time point. IGF-1 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 became detectable at 3 min and reached a maximum at 10 min after which the level declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). As expected K1003R cells showed neither Akt nor ERK phosphorylation. Consistent with previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Vasilcanu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> Y1136F transfected cells did not exhibit any Akt activation, whereas ERK1/2 activation resembled that of wild type IGF-1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Intriguingly, IGF-1 stimulation of C-terminal truncated IGF-1R in &#x00394;1245 cells activated Akt but not ERKs. This suggests that IGF-1R ubiquitination, shown for wt and Y1136F in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g003">3</xref>, is important for signaling of the MAPK pathway. Consequently, the transient ubiquitination (detectable only at 1 min of ligand stimulation) observed for the Y1136F mutant seems to be sufficient to activate ERKs. On the other hand, it is evident that activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway requires a higher IGF-1R kinase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Ubiquitination status correlates with pathway of IGF-1R degradation</title><p>We investigated degradation of the different IGF-1R constructs using cyclohexamide (CHX) to block <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Gardner1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Zaiss1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

To find out whether the receptors were degraded by lysosomes and/or proteasomes, lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors were utilized. Cloroquine is a lysosomotropic weak base, which diffuses across membranes in a concentration-dependent manner. It rapidly becomes protonated thereby neutralizing the acidic environment of endocytic vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-deDuve1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast to peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitors like MG132, epoxomicin does not inhibit non-proteasomal proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, calpain, and cathepsin B at concentrations of up to 50 &#x000b5;M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Meng1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g005">Fig 5</xref>, in the absence of inhibitor wild type IGF-1R was reduced by approximately 50&#x00025; after 12 h. The lysosome inhibitor (LyI) completely prevented the degradation, while the proteasome inhibitor (PI) had a moderate, although statistically significant (<italic>P&#x0003c;0.05</italic>), stabilizing effect on IGF-1R. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g005">Fig. 5</xref> also shows that the ATPM receptor, being deficient in both ubiquitination and phosphorylation, is not degraded at all during the 6 or 12 h experiments. These data suggest that phosphorylation is necessary for degradation and moreover indicate that the lysosomes represent the main pathway by which the wild type IGF-1R is degraded. Nevertheless, the fact that IGF-1R degradation is somewhat delayed (approximately with 20&#x00025;) in the presence of PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) indicates that the proteasomal activity facilitates IGF-1R degradation. We tried to address whether this effect is directly due to involvement of proteasomes in IGF-1R degradation or is mediated through other mechanisms. It has been suggested for some receptors (e.g. interleukin 2 receptor and EGFR) that ubiquitination is important for endosomal sorting where ubiquitin seems to be required to prevent internalized receptors from recycling by shunting them into a pathway that results in lysosomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Rocca1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Lee1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Another explanation could be that the free pool of ubiquitin dramatically decreases after proteasome inhibitor treatment leading to altered ubiquitination patterns of the receptor, followed by altered internalization and lysosomal degradation. Therefore, we investigated degradation of IGF-1R in &#x00394;1245 cells (C-terminal truncated IGF-1R), which is phosphorylated but defective in ubiquitination. The C-terminal truncated IGF-1R is entirely protected from degradation by the lysosome inhibitor, whereas proteasome inhibitor had no protecting effect on it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that the delay in degradation of wild type IGF-1R caused by proteasome inhibition might be a direct effect of receptor ubiquitination and not due to indirect effects such as altered internalization caused by lack of free ubiquitin</p><p>Unexpectedly, we observed that the mutant receptors in Y1136F and Y950F cells, which both exhibited IGF-1R ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), are mainly degraded through proteasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Untreated Y1136F is degraded by 70&#x00025; after 12 h. Lysosome inhibitor decreased this degradation by 40&#x00025; while the proteasome inhibitor abolished it totally. The same pattern was seen in Y950F cells. In Y950F-&#x00394;1245 cells, with truncated C-tail and impaired IRS-1/Shc binding, the receptor showed essentially similar responses as in &#x00394;1245 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000340-g006">6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we sought to shed light on regulation of and role of IGF-1R ubiquitination. The results presented here show that phosphorylation of the receptor is necessary for its ubiquitination. Furthermore, we can state that the C-terminal domain of the receptor is needed in this context. In wild type IGF-1R the profile of ubiquitination matches its phosphorylation status. However, C-tail truncated IGF-1R cannot be ubiquitinated in spite of its normal kinase activity. Since, C-terminal truncation of IGF-1R inhibits receptor ubiquitination, one could speculate that the lysine(s) required for ubiquitination are located in the C-tail. However, out of the 29 lysine residues in the &#x003b2;-subunit of the IGF-1R only three are in the C-tail domain. Although these three lysines might function as ubiquitin acceptors, another possibility is that the C-terminal domain functions as an E3 ligase binding site. Further studies are, however, required to understand the distinct mechanism by which C-terminal truncation inhibits ubiquitination of IGF-1R. Importantly, when ubiquitination of IGF-1R is prevented by C-tail truncation the receptor is degraded explicitly through the lysosomes, suggesting a role of IGF-1 induced ubiquitination in proteasomal degradation of the receptor.</p><p>Intriguingly, we observed that the IGF-1R mutant Y1136F is mainly degraded via the proteasomes. Since this mutant did not exhibit any Akt phosphorylation, but intact phosphorylation of ERK1/2, it is possible that the PI3K/Akt pathway has a positive regulatory influence on lysosomal degradation. A similar predominance of proteasomal degradation occurred in case of the Y950F mutant, which has an impaired IRS-1 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-TartareDeckert1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Craparo1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Further support for a role of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in this context is contributed by our observations that all IGF-1R constructs exhibiting fully detectable Akt phosphorylation are mainly degraded by the lysosomes. Interestingly, accumulating data have emphasized a role of IGF-1 activated Akt in phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Mdm2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Ashcroft1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Zhou1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. These results could offer an explanation regarding the different pattern of IGF-1R degradation in the various mutants. Consistently, in mutant cell lines with impaired Akt activation (Y950F and Y1136F), Mdm2 is probably not phosphorylated with an increased cytoplasmic pool of Mdm2 as a consequence. Since Mdm2 is a ligase required for ubiquitination of IGF-1R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000340-Girnita2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, the raised levels of cytoplasmic Mdm2 would increase ubiquitination of IGF-1R followed by proteasomal degradation.</p><p>In summery we have identified a receptor domain critical for the IGF-1R ubiquitination and show that this post-modification is dependant of phosphorylation of the receptor. Furthermore, we show the co-existence of both proteasomal and lysosomal pathway for IGF-1R degradation, in which PI3K/Akt signaling may be important for the lysosomal pathway and ubiquitination for the proteasomal one. Also, IGF-1R activated MAPK/ERK signaling may be controlled by ubiquitination of the receptor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Polyclonal IGF-1R antibodies (C-20, and H-60), monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (PY99) and monoclonal antibody to ubiquitin (p4D1) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA.

IGF-1R is a heterodimeric receptor with two identical &#x000df;-subunit and two identical &#x003b1;-subunits. The &#x003b1;-subunit is completely extracellular, while the &#x000df;-subunit spans the membrane. The intracellular portion (residues 931&#x02013;1337) has a TK domain with intrinsic kinase activity. Important tyrosine residues in the TK domain, know as activation loop, are (Y1131, Y1135 and Y1136) shown in green. Tyrosine residue Y950 (in blue) is, when phosphorylated, a docking site for binding of signaling molecules. Other important regions of the receptor are the ATP binding site (K1003) and the C-terminal domain important for phosphorylation and signaling, respectively. B. The expression of all IGF-1R variants were investigated on cells growing under basal conditions (complete medium supplemented with serum). Cell lysates were subjected to western blotting using antibodies to IGF-1R (&#x003b2;-subunit) and GAPDH (loading control).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000340.g001"/></fig><fig id="pone-0000340-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000340.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title><underline>Ubiquitination of IGF-1R is phosphorylation dependent</underline>.</title><p>After 24-h serum starvation wt IGF-1R (A) and K1003R (B) cells were stimulated for indicated time points with 50 ng/ml IGF-1.
