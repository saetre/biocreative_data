As a subpopulation within the tumor mass, these cells are believed to constitute a tumor cell reservoir. Pathways controlling the renewal of normal stem cells are deregulated in cancer. The polycomb group gene Bmi1, which is required for neural stem cell self-renewal and also controls anti-oxidant defense in neurons, is upregulated in several cancers, including medulloblastoma. We have found that Bmi1 is consistently and highly expressed in GBM. Downregulation of Bmi1 by shRNAs induced a differentiation phenotype and reduced expression of the stem cell markers Sox2 and Nestin. Interestingly, expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3&#x003b2;), which was found to be consistently expressed in primary GBM, also declined. This suggests a functional link between Bmi1 and GSK3&#x003b2;. Interference with GSK3&#x003b2; activity by siRNA, the specific inhibitor SB216763, or lithium chloride (LiCl) induced tumor cell differentiation. In addition, tumor cell apoptosis was enhanced, the formation of neurospheres was impaired, and clonogenicity reduced in a dose-dependent manner. GBM cell lines consist mainly of CD133-negative (CD133-) cells. Interestingly, <italic>ex vivo</italic> cells from primary tumor biopsies allowed the identification of a CD133- subpopulation of cells that express stem cell markers and are depleted by inactivation of GSK3&#x003b2;. Drugs that inhibit GSK3, including the psychiatric drug LiCl, may deplete the GBM stem cell reservoir independently of CD133 status.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent studies suggest that cancer stem cells are the driving force behind tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007443-Visvader1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The very similar phenotypic and functional alterations induced by either inhibiting GSK3 or by downregulating Bmi1 in the present study points to a functional link between Bmi1 and GSK3.

The Wnt pathway is involved in regulating cell processes as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, mobility and stem cell self-renewal and has been described also as a major regulator of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007443-Byfield1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. In the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway GSK3&#x003b2; mediates &#x003b2;-catenin degradation. Use of GSK3 inhibitors leads to the accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin, which then drives cells into proliferation but this effect was not observed in the present study. This may be explained by the constitutive activation of several growth-promoting pathways, such as EGFR and PI3K, commonly found in GBM. This could lead to maximal Wnt signaling target activation masking additional activation. Conversely, differentiation- and apoptosis-inducing programs, which are low in cancer cells, could be influenced by GSK3 inhibition and are, therefore, directly detectable. On the opposite in normal system as in the A111 cells GSK3 inhibition lead to an increased cell proliferation in accordance with the previously described results in neural progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007443-Nusse1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>shRNA against Bmi1 downregulated not only GSK3 but also Bcl2, Nestin, Sox2 and not p16 and p14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007443-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The microarray data showed higher levels of GSK3 expression in brain tumors than in normal brain tissue, and protein was found to be expressed in the majority of the tumors analyzed indicating a role for GSK3 in GBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007443-g002">Figure 2</xref>). GSK3 can thus be regarded as an important regulator of tumor cell identity in GBM.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose GSK3 inhibitory drugs, e.g. LiCl, as possible first- and/or second-line treatments complementing standard cancer therapy.</p><p>The additive effect of combining the GSK3 inhibitor LiCl and the standard GBM therapeutic temozolomide suggests possible sensitization due to the induction of differentiation by interference with GSK3 activity. In addition, the vast clinical experience of this drug with psychiatric patients indicates safe application and the lower cancer prevalence in LiCl-treated patients than in the general population suggests a protective effect of the drug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007443-Cohen2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Clinically, LiCl could be tested in patients receiving standard treatments in an additional therapeutic arm, the clinical hypothesis being that long-term LiCl therapy in stabilized GBM patients may delay tumor recurrence from the residual cancer stem cell pool by driving cancer stem cells into differentiation and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007443.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Bmi1 down-regulation reduces GSK3&#x003b2; protein levels.
