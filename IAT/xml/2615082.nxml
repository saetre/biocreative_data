Using a heterologous expression cloning approach, we isolated &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB together with &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB pilot (GABPI), a multimembrane-spanning protein related to Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) proteins but lacking the DHHC consensus sequence. In the absence of GABPI, inactive &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB is trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Coexpression of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB and GABPI generates the active enzyme that is localized together with GABPI in the Golgi. GABPI associates with &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB and, when expressed with an ER retention signal, holds active &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB in the ER. Importantly, treatment of isolated membrane vesicles with Triton X-100 disturbs &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB activity. This phenomenon occurs with multimembrane-spanning glycosyltransferases but is normally not a property of glycosyltransferases with one membrane anchor.

Many glycosyltransferases appear in gene families specified mainly by the nature of the nucleotide sugar donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coutinho et al., 2003</xref>). Within a given family, individual glycosyltransferases differ regarding the recognized acceptor structures. To understand and modulate cellular glycosylation pathways, it is important to know how this substrate specificity is generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Graffenried and Bertozzi, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Important in this respect is the observation that acceptor specificity in many glycosyltransferases is not restricted to recognition of one or a few specifically linked monosaccharides. Some protein-specific glycosyltransferases obtain additional selectivity by recognizing specific peptide motifs in the acceptor. A classic example is the <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAcT), which modifies glycoprotein hormones with high selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Baenziger, 1988</xref>).</p><p>Some glycosyltransferases require other proteins that are not part of the acceptor structure for their specific activity. &#x003b2;1,4-galactosyltransferase (&#x003b2;4GalT) acts on terminally positioned <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues conjugated to proteins or lipids. Its specificity changes if it builds a complex with &#x003b1;-lactalbumin. In the complex, free glucose is used as an acceptor, and lactose is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brew et al., 1968</xref>). In the case of core 1 &#x003b2;3-galactosyltransferase (C1&#x003b2;3GalT), a molecular chaperone called Cosmc, with specificity for this single client, is required for folding and transportation to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ju et al., 2008</xref>). Also, for O-mannosylation, two proteins, POMT1 and POMT2, are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manya et al., 2004</xref>). However, in this case, a two-protein enzymatic complex is proposed. The same is true in heparin sulfate biosynthesis in which two different exostosins are required for efficient biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCormick et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>For several glycosyltransferases involved in glycolipid biosynthesis, data indicate that factors other than the enzyme and the acceptor substrate play a role. This is the case for &#x003b2;4GalT-V and -VI, which are homologues of the &#x003b2;4GalT mentioned in the previous paragraph and of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB (the subject of this study). Under in vitro conditions, &#x003b2;4GalT-V and -VI transfer galactose (Gal) into &#x003b2;1-4 linkage to terminally expressed GlcNAc residues on glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Die et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo et al., 2001</xref>). However, their involvement in the biosynthesis of lactosyl ceramide (Cer) by Gal transfer onto glucosyl Cer has been demonstrated as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nomura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sato et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kolmakova and Chatterjee, 2005</xref>). At least in the case of galactosyltransferase V, this latter activity depends on the enzyme's anchorage in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Die et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sato et al., 2000</xref>). Other enzymes involved in glycolipid biosynthesis have been shown to exhibit very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Vries et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Togayachi et al., 2001</xref>) or no (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steffensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schwientek et al., 2002</xref>) activity if expressed as soluble proteins. In general, very little is known about how lipid acceptors are recognized by glycosyltransferases. However, it has been suggested that a membrane-bound activator protein is required to present glycolipid acceptors to the modifying glycosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ramakrishnan et al., 2002</xref>). This hypothesis is substantiated by analogy to the lysosomal sphingolipid degradation machinery in which the sphingolipid activator protein presents the glycolipid substrates to glycosidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kolter and Sandhoff, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we describe a novel mechanism of glycosyltransferase maturation and functionalization for the glycolipid-specific &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This enzyme, which has been described as an inactive homologue of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haines and Irvine, 2005</xref>), is a member of the invertebrate branch of the &#x003b2;4GalT family involved in the biosynthesis of the lacdiNAc (GalNAc&#x003b2;1,4GlcNAc) epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kawar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vadaie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haines and Irvine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stolz et al., 2008</xref>). Because &#x003b2;4GalNAcT had not been cloned when this study was started, we searched for the corresponding activity using expression cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakker et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">M&#x000fc;nster et al., 1998</xref>). In a heterologous approach, a cDNA library from <italic>Drosophila</italic> was used for expression in CHO cells, whereas formation of the lacdiNAc epitope was monitored with a specific monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">van Remoortere et al., 2000</xref>). As will be demonstrated in this study, the expression of two cDNA clones was required to install the functionally active enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression cloning of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b2;4GalNAcT</title><p>Other than in many invertebrates, the lacdiNAc element has been identified on only a few glycoconjugates in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato et al., 2003</xref>). We ascertained that CHO cells are negative for lacdiNAc. Considering that in mammalian cells terminal GlcNAc residues are recognized by several galactosyltransferases, we additionally hypothesized that signals in the complementation cloning approach could be improved by the use of CHO Lec8 cells. They lack the Golgi UDP-Gal transporter and, consequently, show drastically reduced incorporation of Gal in glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deutscher and Hirschberg, 1986</xref>). A cDNA library was constructed from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, subdivided into pools, and, in an established sibling selection procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakker et al., 1997</xref>), used to search for clones that rendered cells positive for lacdiNAc. Cell surface lacdiNAc expression was monitored with antibody 259-2A1, which was originally raised from <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>&#x02013;infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">van Remoortere et al., 2000</xref>). In this procedure, it became obvious that two cDNA clones were required for the expression of the lacdiNAc epitope. Although clone one was a member of the &#x003b2;1,4GalT family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Die et al., 1997</xref>), the second clone (flybase CG17257) encoded a type III membrane protein that was related to a gene family referred to as Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitchell et al., 2006</xref>). This protein was termed &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB pilot (GABPI) to describe its crucial role in generating a functionally active &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB as shown in the following experiments. The identified &#x003b2;4GalNAcT was identical to the inactive &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB recently cloned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haines and Irvine (2005)</xref> in a homology-based approach. In agreement with this study, we found no in vivo activity for full-length &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB expressed in mammalian cells. It is remarkable that expression cloning identified &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB and not the homologous &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA, which was shown in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haines and Irvine, 2005</xref>) to be an active enzyme. To resolve the controversial finding, &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA was cloned by PCR and expressed in comparison with &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB&#x02013;GABPI in CHO and HEK293 cells. These experiments demonstrated that the cell surface lacdiNAc expression detected with antibody 259-2A1 as a result of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA was much lower than the lacdiNAc formation after the combined expression of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB and GABPI. Thus, the data demonstrate the existence of two functionally active &#x003b2;4GalNAcTs (&#x003b2;4GalNAcTA and &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> of which &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB needs the cooperation of GABPI. Because CHO cells demonstrated a low tolerance to expression of the <italic>Drosophila N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) transferases and HEK293 cells turned out to be a more suitable expression system, subsequent experiments were performed exclusively in HEK293 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;4GalNAcTB specifically modifies glycolipids</title><p>Despite elaborated analyses of <italic>Drosophila</italic> glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">North et al., 2006</xref>), the lacdiNAc structure has so far only been found as a modification of glycolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seppo et al., 2000</xref>). With both cloned enzymes at hand, we evaluated the question of acceptor specificity. HEK293 cells were transfected with &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA, &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB, or the combination &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB&#x02013;GABPI and analyzed for the presence of lipid- and protein-bound lacdiNAc using TLC followed by immunooverlay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and Western blotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), respectively. In both systems, <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, which are naturally positive for the antibody epitope, and HEK293 cells transfected with <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> &#x003b2;4GalNAcT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kawar et al., 2002</xref>) were used as controls. Although expression of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> enzyme confirmed the availability of &#x003b2;4GalNAcT acceptors on proteins, the absence of specific signals in both HEK293 cells transfected with the &#x003b2;4GalNAcTs and in S2 cells confirmed the earlier observations in flies. In contrast, immunostaining of the lipid extracts resulted in positive signals for S2 cells as well as for HEK293 cells transfected with the &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB&#x02013;GABPI pair. Expression of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB alone was not sufficient to produce a signal, whereas faint signals were reliably obtained with &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA. It is important to mention that lipid specificity is preserved, although the glycolipid acceptor structures are different in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and HEK293 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Drosophila</italic>-derived &#x003b2;4GalNAcTs are specific for glycolipids.</bold> (A) Glycolipid extracts from S2 cells and HEK293 cells after transfection with empty vector (mock) and GalNAcTs were separated on TLC and immunooverlayed with antibody 259-2A1.

In the first experiment, it was established that a soluble secreted construct of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB was still inactive when coexpressed with GABPI. Subsequently, we wondered whether the two proteins expressed in separate cells have the capacity to form an active enzyme. Microsomal fractions of HEK293 cells transfected with either &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB or GABPI were isolated, mildly treated with detergent (saponin 0.01%), and functionally tested in mixtures. The assay system used to follow &#x003b2;4GalNAcT activity was adapted from an established assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Palcic et al., 1988</xref>). In this assay system, [<sup>3</sup>H]UDP-GalNAc is the donor, and GlcNAc&#x02013;<italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl (pNP) is the acceptor substrate. No GalNAc transfer was measured in mixed vesicles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), whereas controls with microsomes of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA&#x02013; or &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB&#x02013;GABPI-transfected HEK293 cells were active after identical treatment with detergent. In accordance with lacdiNAc formation in intact cells, &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB was not active when expressed alone, but it showed higher activity than &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA when expressed in combination with GABPI.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Activity of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB is disrupted by Triton X-100.</bold> (A) Microsomal preparations of HEK293 transfected with &#x003b2;4GalNAcTs and GABPI as indicated were assayed for activity with GlcNAc-pNP as an acceptor and [<sup>3</sup>H]UDP-GalNAc or [<sup>3</sup>H]UDP-Gal (endogenous activity as an internal control) as donor substrates. Each value represents the mean of three independent vesicle preparations with standard deviation.

Only background levels were measured if membranes were treated with Triton X-100 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>) or NP-40 (not depicted) at 0.5%, which is routinely used in glycosyltransferase assays. The milder detergent saponin increased activity over a wide concentration range (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The rather low activity measured in the absence of detergent was probably a result of limited transport of the substrates over the vesicle membranes. As saponin is known to perforate and not disrupt membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schulz, 1990</xref>), these data suggest that the maintenance of protein complexes in intact membrane patches is required for &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB activity.</p></sec><sec><title>ER export of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB requires GABPI</title><p>The data presented so far for the interaction between &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB and GABPI are highly reminiscent of the interactions between the human C1&#x003b2;3GalT generating the T antigen (core 1 <italic>O</italic>-glycan Gal&#x003b2;1-3GalNAc&#x003b1;1-Ser/Thr) and its client-specific molecular chaperone, Cosmc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>). Cosmc supports functional folding of C1&#x003b2;3GalT in the ER but then dissociates and releases C1&#x003b2;3GalT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ju et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ju et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the following experiments addressed the subcellular localization of GABPI and &#x003b2;4GalNAcTs. Flag-&#x003b2;4GalNAcTs and Myc-GABPI were separately expressed in HEK293 cells and, after selection of stable clones, were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Flag-&#x003b2;4GalNAcTA and Myc-GABPI colocalized with the Golgi marker &#x003b1;-mannosidase II (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>). Only the signal generated by Flag-&#x003b2;4GalNAcTB overlapped with the ER marker calnexin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). However, when GABPI was cotransfected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, D&#x02013;F</xref>), the immunofluorescence images showed a clear shift of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB to the Golgi. Moreover, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>, GABPI and &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB colocalized in this compartment. This experiment demonstrated that ER export of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB needs piloting by GABPI, which by itself is an autonomous protein fully equipped with the information required for folding and transport to the Golgi.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>The Golgi resident protein GABPI pilots &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB to the Golgi apparatus.</bold> The subcellular localization of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTs and GABPI was analyzed with N-terminally tagged proteins expressed in HEK293 cells.

To answer this question, GABPI was tagged with a C-terminal KKTN dilysine signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zerangue et al., 2001</xref>), which retains proteins in the ER. GABPI was indeed successfully localized in the ER using this approach (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>). More importantly, &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB was also retained in the ER in cells expressing KKTN-tagged GABPI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref>). In vitro enzymatic activity of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB was about two times as high as the nonretained construct (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, right bars), and cell surface lacdiNAc was also detectable in these cells. Although the latter probably required cycling to the Golgi of at least part of the enzyme, ER retention might have allowed a higher protein expression level that was enzymatically active in vitro. Together, these data demonstrated that the DHHC family&#x02013;related protein has, in contrast to Cosmc, functions that go beyond those of a client-specific chaperone.</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of GABPI in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells delocalizes GalNAcTB and reduces lacdiNAc-containing glycolipid formation</title><p>To additionally evaluate the influence of GABPI on &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB localization in the natural environment, RNAi experiments were performed.

GABPI, in contrast to all mammalian and the other <italic>Drosophila</italic> members in the family, has exchanged this motif from DHHC to DHHS. This was already an argument against its function as acyltransferase. To validate this assumption, a series of mutants was constructed with which a potential involvement of the DHHS motif in GABPI functions could be tested. The ability of GABPI to install a functional &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB was not abolished by reconstruction of the DHHC motif, by replacement of the serine by alanine, or by successive replacement to AAAA (unpublished data). In addition, the critical cysteine residue (C29) that may serve as acyl residue acceptor in &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB was mutated. Again, no effect on GABPI&#x02013;&#x003b2;4GalNAcTB Golgi localization and activity was found (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>The stem region of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB is needed for activation by GABPI</title><p>Because the &#x003b2;4GalNAcTs isolated from <italic>Drosophila</italic> are highly homologous proteins, it was of relevance to identify primary sequence elements responsible for the strict GABPI dependency of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB. The aligned primary sequences indicated the stem region to be the domain of highest variability. Consequently, hybrids were made by domain swapping, as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. The chimera in which cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA were added to stem and catalytic regions of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB (hybrid A-B-B) remained GABPI dependent for Golgi localization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>) and activity (not depicted). However, additional replacement of the stem region destroyed activation by GABPI. The resulting protein was inactive and retained in the ER (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>). Because the stem region in &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA is considerably longer than in &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB, additional constructs were prepared in which the size was trimmed from the N and C termini to the exact length of the &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB stem region. All constructs remained inactive (unpublished data), allowing the conclusion that information contained in the stem region of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB is essential for its function. In contrast, &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA remained Golgi localized and active independently of GABPI when fused to the cytoplasmic and stem region of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB (construct B-B-A; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>). This is in agreement with the fact that the catalytic domain of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA can be produced as soluble enzyme and, therefore, is an independent active entity.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Protein domains of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB involved in the interaction with GABPI.</bold> Hybrids of Flag-&#x003b2;4GalNAcTA (red) and -B (blue) were cloned by domain swapping of the cytoplasmic (Cyt) and transmembrane domain (TMD), stem region, and catalytic domain (Cat) as illustrated and expressed in HEK293 with and without GABPI.

In this study, this enzyme was demonstrated to depend on the cooperation of a multimembrane-spanning protein related to the DHHC protein family. To point out the complexity of its involvement in forming a functionally active &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB, it was called GABPI. GABPI was cloned simultaneously to &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB in a classical expression cloning approach. This demonstrates the power of this technique, which exclusively screens for activity. The fact that the second &#x003b2;4GalNAc transferase in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haines and Irvine, 2005</xref>), was not detected in the expression cloning approach is a result of the much lower activity of this enzyme, which we confirmed in in vitro and in cellular test systems as well as on the systemic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stolz et al., 2008</xref>). Although &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA has been shown to act on protein acceptors in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sasaki et al., 2007</xref>), the low activity of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA in HEK293 cells observed in this study does not allow a conclusion on the nature of the acceptor. Obviously, &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB is strictly lipid specific. This specificity is remarkable because glycan structures added to lipid anchors are different between mammals and flies. This suggests that selectivity is at least partly established through the lipid anchors. GABPI might be involved in the lipid specificity, but &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB also requires GABPI for in vitro activity with the synthetic acceptor substrate GlcNAc-pNP. In particular, these types of small hydrophobic aglycon-linked monosaccharide acceptors usually overcome the restricted specificity of glycosyltransferases; even the glycoprotein hormone-specific &#x003b2;4GalNAcT is reactive with such acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Baenziger, 1988</xref>).</p><p>Trials to assemble an active enzyme by combining vesicle preparations containing &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB and GABPI separately failed. This was also the case for the O-mannosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manya et al., 2004</xref>). This shows that GABPI and &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB do not act in a sequential reaction mechanism. Combined with the experiments in which it was shown that &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB remains in the ER in an inactive state if expressed alone and can only reach the Golgi in the presence of GABPI, it can be concluded that interaction between &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB and GABPI most likely starts in the ER and requires coexpression of the two proteins. Most importantly, GABPI is an autonomous protein equipped with all of the information needed for Golgi destination. In this respect, GABPI seems to be different from Cosmc, the client-specific molecular chaperone required to activate C1&#x003b2;3GalT. A soluble, active form of recombinant C1&#x003b2;3GalT can be produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ju et al., 2002a</xref>), although Cosmc is not associated with this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>). Purified rat liver C1&#x003b2;3GalT was also devoid of Cosmc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ju et al., 2002b</xref>). According to the classical definition of a chaperone, Cosmc releases an active C1&#x003b2;3GalT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ju et al., 2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2008</xref>). In contrast, GABPI moves with &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB to the Golgi and retains &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB in the ER if it is retained itself. This and the fact that the proteins can be coimmunoprecipitated argue for a stable complex of both.</p><p>An insertion of the complex in an intact membrane patch is indispensable for functionality. Proof of this is provided by the fact that &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB activity tested with GlcNAc-pNP was almost completely abolished after addition of Triton X-100 or NP-40. Although these are rather mild detergents that normally do not dissociate protein complexes, their presence interferes with membrane integrity. This in turn may cause deformation of associated complexes. In contrast, saponin, which only perforates membranes, most likely increased activity by allowing the substrates to enter the vesicles without disturbing the proper embedding of the enzyme in the membrane. Detergent sensitivity is a property of many mannosyltransferases in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schutzbach, 1997</xref>), including the protein O-mannosyltransferase complex (POMT1 and POMT2), which is inactivated by Triton X-100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manya et al., 2004</xref>), and egghead, the mannosyltransferase acting two steps upstream of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB in <italic>Drosophila</italic> glycolipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wandall et al., 2003</xref>). These enzymes are multitransmembrane-spanning proteins. Glycosyltransferases of the Golgi containing one transmembrane domain are usually not sensitive to detergents. As &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB is a typical member of the Golgi type II transmembrane glycosyltransferases, the observed detergent sensitivity is expected to be conveyed by disturbance of GABPI or the GABPI&#x02013;&#x003b2;4GalNAcTB complex.</p><p>In line with the experiments in HEK293 cells, dsRNA-induced knockdown of GABPI in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells separated &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB from &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA, depleted cell surface expression of the lacdiNAc epitope, and provoked an accumulation of the &#x003b2;4GalNAcT glycolipid acceptor structures. These effects observed at the cellular level were exactly phenocopied in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant with an inactivated &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stolz et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The knowledge that all functionally characterized DHHC family proteins are palmitoyltransferases prompted experiments designed to determine whether GABPI could function as an acyltransferase. All residues critical for a potential acyltransferase activity in GABPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitchell et al., 2006</xref>) as well as the only cysteine residue that may serve as acyl acceptors in &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB were point mutated. None influenced the functionality of GABPI or activity of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB. The functionally crucial cysteine in the name-giving DHHC motif is exchanged by serine in GABPI, which argues against its function as a palmitoyltransferase.</p><p>In experiments aimed at understanding how &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB and GABPI interact, we demonstrated that the selectivity with which GABPI activates &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB and not the highly homologous &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA is attributed to a structural element in the stem region. However, this area cannot be the solely responsible element. Additional sequences in the catalytic domain must be involved in determining GABPI dependency.</p><p>The exact function of GABPI in priming activity of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB in the Golgi is difficult to address. However, several glycosyltransferases acting exclusively in the glycolipid biosynthetic pathways need membrane anchorage and cannot be expressed as soluble recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amado et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steffensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schwientek et al., 2002</xref>). One of these enzymes is brainiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schwientek et al., 2002</xref>), a &#x003b2;3GlcNAc transferase acting right upstream of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB in glycolipid biosynthesis of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The factors determining membrane dependency of brainiac are not yet identified. Because we found the product of brainiac accumulated in S2 cells treated with RNAi against GABPI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), an involvement of GABPI for brainiac function in vivo is not likely. However, because mammalian lipid-modifying enzymes have been suggested to form multienzyme complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraudo and Maccioni, 2003</xref>), GABPI, being an essential part of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB, might be an anchor position in the pathway without being essential for the activity of all enzymes. A striking parallel exists between &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB and &#x003b2;4GalT-V and -VI described in the Introduction. These mammalian galactosyltransferases are members of the same gene family and are essentially dependent on membrane contact for transfer of Gal onto glucosyl Cer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Die et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sato et al., 2000</xref>). As soluble enzymes, &#x003b2;4GalT-V and -VI recognize terminal GlcNAc residues instead of glucose. Therefore, it can be speculated that these enzymes require a cofactor similar to GABPI, which mediates glycolipid acceptor recognition. Orthologues of GABPI are found in arthropod and vertebrate species but not in nematodes, indicating that GABPI homologues might play a role in higher eukaryotes as well. In summary, it can be concluded that the identification of GABPI reveals a novel mechanism to generate specificity in the complex glycosylation pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Expression cloning</title><p>A cDNA library from <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) was constructed in pCMV-Script using the pCMV-ScriptXR cDNA library construction kit (Agilent Technologies).

Therefore, transfected cells were cultured for 3 wk in the presence of G-418 (EMD). For staining, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, fixed in 4% PFA, and permeabilized for 30 min with 0.1% saponin in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. Samples were incubated with the respective primary antibodies (anti-Flag tag M5, anti-Flag tag F7425, anti-HA tag 12CA5 or anti-Myc tag 9E10, and rabbit anti&#x02013;&#x003b1;-mannosidase II or -calnexin as a Golgi or ER marker) for 1.5 h at room temperature. After three washings (in PBS, 0.1% BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20), cells were incubated with anti&#x02013;mouse IgCy3 and anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 for 1 h at room temperature. After staining with the nuclear dye (Hoechst 33258; Hoechst Pharmaceuticals), the slides were washed with water, mounted (Dako), and analyzed under a microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a Plan Apochromat 63&#x000d7;/1.40 oil differential interference contrast objective (M27; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) at room temperature. Images (1,388 &#x000d7; 1,040 pixels) were taken using a camera (AxioCam MRm; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and Axiovision 4.4 software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Images taken in an automatic exposure setting with filter sets for Hoechst 33258, Alexa Fluor 488, and Cy3 were converted in blue, green, and red, respectively; intensities were adapted to be equal for the three colors, and images were reduced to 600 dots per inch for display in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells</title><p>dsRNA was made using the MEGAscript T7 transcription kit (Applied Biosystems).

After 30 min at room temperature, 2 ml of Schneider's medium containing FCS was added, and incubation was continued for 3 d at 27&#x000b0;C. For the immunocytochemical analysis of surface-expressed lacdiNAc structures, the protocol described in the Expression cloning section for CHO cells was used. Light microscopic images of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> were taken using the aforementioned microscope and software using a camera (AxioCam MRc; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and a Plan Apochromat 10&#x000d7;/0.45 objective (Ph1M27; Carl Zeiss, Inc.). To determine the subcellular localization of &#x003b2;4GalNAcTA and &#x003b2;4GalNAcTB in GABPI dsRNA&#x02013;treated cells, the N-terminally Flag- and HA-tagged enzymes were transiently transfected with Fugene (Roche) into cultures that had been treated for 3 d with dsRNA. The day after transfection, cells were washed with serum-free medium, and RNAi treatment was repeated with a concentration of 18.5 nM dsRNA. 2 d after transfection, cells were transferred to concanavalin A&#x02013;coated coverslips for 1 h, fixed in 4% PFA, and further processed as described in the previous section for HEK293 cells except that 0.1% saponin was kept in all incubation and washing solutions. Mouse anti-Flag M5 (Sigma-Aldrich) in combination with rabbit anti-HA (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to visualize the tagged &#x003b2;4GalNAc transferases, whereas the ER was stained with mouse anti-HDEL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Secondary antibodies used were goat anti&#x02013;mouse, Alexa Fluor 488, and goat anti&#x02013;rabbit Cy3. Fluorescent images were made using a microscope (Axiovert 200M) as for the aforementioned HEK293 cells except that the ApoTome mode was used and five images were averaged. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows 330 &#x000d7; 236-pixel sections of the original images.
