The gene for MEN1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor protein called menin. Menin was recently shown to interact with several components of a trithorax family histone methyltransferase complex including ASH2, Rbbp5, WDR5, and the leukemia proto-oncoprotein MLL. To elucidate menin's role as a tumor suppressor and gain insights into the endocrine-specific tumor phenotype in MEN1, we mapped the genomic binding sites of menin, MLL1, and Rbbp5, to approximately 20,000 promoters in HeLa S3, HepG2, and pancreatic islet cells using the strategy of chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis. We found that menin, MLL1, and Rbbp5 localize to the promoters of thousands of human genes but do not always bind together. These data suggest that menin functions as a general regulator of transcription. We also found that factor occupancy generally correlates with high gene expression but that the loss of menin does not result in significant changes in most transcript levels. One exception is the developmentally programmed transcription factor, <italic>HLXB9</italic>, which is overexpressed in islets in the absence of menin. Our findings expand the realm of menin-targeted genes several hundred-fold beyond that previously described and provide potential insights to the endocrine tumor bias observed in MEN1 patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>In multiple endocrine neoplasia type I, absence of the nuclear factor menin gives rise to endocrine tumors by a mechanism that is poorly understood. Using state-of-the-art genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis technology, this paper significantly enlarges our understanding of the role of menin by greatly extending the number of gene targets where menin binds. The authors show that while menin frequently colocalizes with a protein complex that modifies chromatin structure, menin can also bind to many other promoters by an alternative mechanism. They also present data that potentially implicate one of the menin target genes, <italic>HLXB9,</italic> in the endocrine specificity of tumorigenesis in multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1.

Other associations occasionally found in MEN1 patients include foregut carcinoids, facial angiofibromas, lipomas, collagenomas, meningiomas, and smooth muscle tumors. MEN1 patients typically inherit loss of function mutations in the <italic>MEN1</italic> gene, and tumors arise following loss of the remaining wild-type allele. Thus, the <italic>MEN1</italic> gene follows the classic &#x0201c;two-hit&#x0201d; tumor suppressor model first proposed by Knudson for retinoblastoma &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Somatic mutations in the <italic>MEN1</italic> gene are also frequently found in sporadic parathyroid adenomas, insulinomas, gastrinomas, and lung carcinoids &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, indicating that loss of the <italic>MEN1</italic> gene is a major contributor to the development and maintenance of many nonhereditary endocrine tumors. There is currently no prevention of or cure for MEN1 cancers, and cancer treatment options are generally limited to surgical interventions.</p><p>The protein product of <italic>MEN1,</italic> menin, is a ubiquitously expressed 67-kDa protein found predominantly in the nucleus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Studies in <italic>Men1</italic> knockout mice support menin's role as a tumor suppressor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Mice that are homozygous null for <italic>Men1</italic> show developmental defects and die at embryonic day 11.5 to 13.5. Heterozygous <italic>Men1</italic> mice eventually develop multiple endocrine tumors that arise following somatic loss of the wild-type <italic>Men1</italic> allele, and the spectrum of tumors observed in <italic>Men1<sup>&#x0002b;/</sup></italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice is remarkably similar to that in human MEN1 kindreds. We and others have also successfully developed conditional knockouts of the <italic>Men1</italic> gene, using the <italic>Cre-lox</italic> system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b010">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. When homozygous <italic>Men1</italic> &#x0201c;floxed&#x0201d; mice are bred to animals expressing Cre recombinase in the beta cells of the pancreatic islets, the resultant progeny develop multiple pancreatic insulinomas. These insulinomas arise long after homozygous inactivation of the <italic>Men1</italic> gene, suggesting that additional somatic events are required for frank tumor formation. <italic>Men1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> insulinomas are capable of developing in the absence of chromosomal or microsatellite instability, suggesting that the additional somatic events required for tumor formation are subtle, occurring at either the nucleotide or epigenetic level &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Although inherited mutations in the <italic>MEN1</italic> gene predispose individuals to several types of tumors, there is a particularly striking predisposition to tumors in endocrine tissues. The development of tumors in this endocrine-specific pattern is quite puzzling as menin appears to be expressed in all tissues. In a previous study, we set out to gain insights to this issue of tissue-specificity in MEN1 by breeding floxed <italic>Men1</italic> mice to transgenic mice expressing <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase from the albumin promoter, which is predominantly expressed in liver hepatocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. This strategy allowed us to assess the loss of menin in liver, a tissue not normally predisposed to developing tumors in humans or mice with heterozygous <italic>MEN1</italic> loss of function mutations. Progeny that were homozygous for a floxed <italic>Men1</italic> allele and expressing <italic>Cre</italic> showed a nearly complete loss of <italic>Men1</italic> mRNA and corresponding protein levels in the liver, yet the overwhelming majority of menin-null livers were histologically normal and remained tumor free. These findings suggest that in liver, menin's tumor suppressor function or functions are dispensable.</p><p>Menin has been reported to interact with a multitude of proteins including JunD, SMAD family members, Pem, NF&#x003ba;B, FANCD2, RPA2, NMMHC II-A, GFAP, vimentin, and Hsp70 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. The diverse functions of the menin partners suggest roles for menin in transcriptional regulation, DNA processing and repair, cytoskeletal organization, and protein degradation, although to date none of the interacting partners have been directly proved important in MEN1 pathophysiology. No convincing evidence of direct binding of menin to DNA has been shown, but menin has been shown to associate with a multimember protein complex whose composition is highly similar to that of the SET1 histone methyltransferase complex of yeast and humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Members of this complex include HCF-2 (host cell factor 2), Rbbp5 (retinoblastoma binding protein 5), WDR5 (WD repeat domain 5), and trithorax proteins MLL1/MLL2 (mixed-lineage leukemia) and ASH2 (absent, small, or homeotic). The menin-HMT&#x02013;associated complexes promote methylation of histone H3 tails at lysine 4 (H3 K4), an epigenetic mark that is generally associated with active gene transcription. At the time of this study, five target genes positively regulated by menin and MLL have been reported in various tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. These targets include the clustered homeobox genes, <italic>HOXA9, c6,</italic> and <italic>c8,</italic> and two cyclin-dependent kinase <italic>(CDK)</italic> inhibitors involved in cell cycle regulation, <italic>p27<sup>Kip1</sup></italic> and <italic>p18<sup>Ink4c</sup>.</italic></p><p>It has been hypothesized that menin mediates its tumor suppressor action by regulating histone methylation in promoters of <italic>HOX</italic> genes and/or <italic>p18, p27,</italic> and possibly other <italic>CDK</italic> inhibitors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with this hypothesis, H3 K4 methylation and expression of <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> were shown to be dependent on menin in pancreatic islets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. An additional clue for a role for <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> in MEN1 pathophysiology comes from studies in knockout mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The simultaneous loss of <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> in mice leads to a tumor spectrum that is similar to that in human MEN1 and MEN2 patients, including tumors in the pituitary, parathyroid, thyroid, endocrine pancreas, stomach, and duodenum. These findings raise critical questions regarding the function of menin and the basis of endocrine-tumor formation in MEN1. (1) Does menin mediate its tumor suppressor action by governing the expression of <italic>HOX</italic> and cell cycle genes alone or through additional key targets that have not yet been identified? (2) Does menin only target genes whose transcription is trithorax dependent, or can menin also target genes independently of MLL and its associated HMT complex members? (3) Could the specific bias for endocrine tumor formation in MEN1 result from differences in distinct genes that are targeted by menin in the endocrine tissues?</p><p>To gain a more complete understanding of the action of menin tumor suppression, we identified the genomic occupancy of menin and two associated HMT complex members, MLL1 and Rbbp5, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA microarray analyses (ChIP-chip) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Given the evidence that the menin-HMT complex methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, we also mapped the positions of H3 K4 (trimethylation) by ChIP-chip. Our data in HeLa S3, HepG2, and human pancreatic islet cells indicate that menin occupies the promoter regions of thousands of human genes, suggesting that menin acts as a global regulator of transcription. Menin occupancy frequently coincides with MLL1, Rbbp5, and H3 K4, but menin can also target promoters independently of the HMT complex. Factor occupancy generally correlates with high gene expression, and loss of menin in pancreatic islets, by and large, does not affect transcript levels. Last, we present a model for tumor suppression by MEN1 and offer insights into the endocrine tumor bias observed in MEN1 patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Pattern of Menin Binding at <italic>HOX</italic> Clusters and Elsewhere</title><p>We set out to investigate the genomic occupancy of menin using ChIP-chip.

To determine if menin preferentially binds to genes that contain homeobox domains, our arrays also included oligonucleotides corresponding to more than 100 homeodomain-containing genes located outside of the four <italic>HOX</italic> clusters. We also tiled probes corresponding to approximately 20 megabases (Mb) of random sequence on Chromosome 7, to assess menin occupancy in regions located at large distances from genes. As a pilot effort, we hybridized these HOX-centered microarrays with menin-chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA from HeLa S3 cells. A computer program incorporating a sliding window and threshold approach, ACME (Algorithm for Capturing Microarray Enrichment), was used to identify genomic sites enriched for menin-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Hybridizations to these HOX arrays with menin-chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA from HeLa S3 cells revealed striking differences between menin occupancy at the clustered <italic>HOX</italic> genes as compared to elsewhere. For genes located outside the four <italic>HOX</italic> clusters, menin was frequently localized to 5&#x02032; promoter regions, at or very near transcriptional start sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g002">2</xref>B). Little to no signal was detected in intragenic regions, or at 3&#x02032; untranslated regions. Menin occupancy at the <italic>HOX</italic> clusters was more extensive, with broad footprints that spanned intergenic and intragenic portions of <italic>HOX</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Specifically, within the <italic>HOX A</italic> cluster, menin sites clustered at <italic>HOXA6, A10, A11,</italic> and <italic>A13</italic>. Extensive binding to the <italic>HOX C</italic> cluster was also detected, with broad signals that extended across <italic>HOXC11, C10, C9,</italic> and portions of <italic>C4</italic> and <italic>C6</italic>. Menin sites were also detected near <italic>HOXB6</italic> and <italic>HOXB7,</italic> but the pattern of binding was less extensive than that detected at the <italic>HOX A</italic> and <italic>C</italic> loci. No significant menin binding was detected at the <italic>HOX D</italic> locus. Menin sites were also detected at several other homeobox genes located outside the four <italic>HOX</italic> clusters, but similar to other non-HOX loci, binding was localized to 5&#x02032; promoter regions (unpublished data). Our finding that menin binds to <italic>HOXA9, C6,</italic> and <italic>C8</italic> is consistent with prior studies in which these three <italic>HOX</italic> genes were identified by standard ChIP-PCR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; and supports the reliability of the ChIP-chip methodology used here for detecting genomic binding events by menin.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Genome-Wide Distribution of Menin in Multiple Cell Types</title><p>The results of the pilot study above indicate that, except for the <italic>HOX</italic> clusters, menin occupancy is highly specific for 5&#x02032; regions of genes. Based on these findings, we rationalized that menin sites could be identified on a near genome-wide scale by interrogating only those regions of DNA that correspond to the 5&#x02032; portions of genes. We therefore designed a second DNA microarray containing tiling oligonucleotides across the 5&#x02032; regions of approximately 20,000 human genes. Given the binding pattern of menin at the <italic>HOX</italic> clusters, this array also contained tiled oligos across all four clustered <italic>HOX</italic> loci, as well as the complete sequence of 381 genes (&#x02212;5,000 bp relative to the transcription start site to &#x0002b;5,000 bp relative to the transcription stop site) that showed evidence of menin occupancy on previous arrays (PCS, unpublished data). These promoter arrays were hybridized with menin-chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA from human islets, HeLa S3 and HepG2 cells. To assess if the bias for endocrine-tumor formation in MEN1 might be related to differences in distinct target genes in endocrine cells, we compared sites occupied in HeLa S3 and HepG2 cells to those identified in human pancreatic islet cells. As expected, hybridizations with menin-chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA from HeLa S3 cells revealed broad signals at the <italic>HOX</italic> clusters and promoter-specific signals at most other loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g003">3</xref>B). In HepG2 and pancreatic islet cells, the vast majority of menin sites were also detected in promoter regions, at or near transcriptional start sites. Notable differences in the pattern of menin binding were detected at the <italic>HOX</italic> clusters. Whereas multiple menin sites were detected at the <italic>HOX A</italic> and <italic>C</italic> clusters in HeLa cells, relatively little signal was detected at these clusters in HepG2 cells and pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and unpublished data). By using a stringent selection criterion of <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, we found that menin occupies 1,706 sites in HeLa S3 cells, 2,239 sites in HepG2 cells, and 1,541 sites in pancreatic islet cells. Sites that were concordant and discordant between each cell type are depicted in a Venn diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The finding that menin binds to a broad range of human promoters in all three cell types suggests that menin has a global role in transcription in both endocrine and non&#x02013;endocrine-derived cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Overlap of Genomic Occupancy of Menin, MLL, Rbbp5, and the H3 K4 Trimethyl Mark</title><p>Based on published evidence that menin associates with a HMT complex containing MLL, Ash2L, WDR5, and Rbbp5, we set out to determine if the genomic occupancy of menin coincides with two other members of this complex, MLL1 and Rbbp5. Given the ability of the SET1/MLL complex to catalyze the trimethlyation of histone H3 at lysine 4, we also mapped the genomic distribution of the H3 K4 trimethyl mark. Results for the <italic>HOX A</italic> cluster are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, where the binding patterns for menin, MLL1, Rbbp5, and H3 K4 are seen to be similar, although menin shows a more contiguous binding pattern across <italic>HOXA9, A10, A11,</italic> and <italic>A13</italic>. For non-<italic>HOX</italic> promoters, different binding combinations were seen for different promoters; for illustration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g003">Figure 3</xref>B displays a promoter where all factors bind near the transcriptional start site, but that was not always the case.</p><p>It is not uncommon for ChIP-chip data to reveal dramatic differences in the intensity of hybridization signals at multiple loci &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. While some loci appear highly enriched, others appear modestly enriched, and other loci entirely lack signal. Differences in signal intensities could reflect true differences in occupancy of the factor or could represent slight differences in amplification or hybridization of chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA. Because of the broad dynamic range in signal, assessing the overlap between different factors at multiple loci at a given significance threshold locus can be challenging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). To depict the overlap more accurately between sites occupied by each factor, we selected promoters that were occupied by menin and MLL1 at high confidence (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), and then plotted the corresponding <italic>p</italic>-values for each associated factor as a heatmap. Heatmaps from all three cell types indicate that a large proportion of promoters are bound by all factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g004">4</xref>C). The data also reveal distinct sets of promoters occupied by menin and not MLL1 or Rbbp5, and vice versa.

The percentage of menin sites that did not coincide with both MLL1 and Rbbp5 was lower: 21.7&#x00025; in HeLa cells, 9.5&#x00025; in HepG2 cells, and 2.4&#x00025; in pancreatic islets. These results suggest that menin targets promoters in cooperation with HMT complex members MLL1 and Rbbp5, but that menin can also occupy promoters in cooperation with other unidentified factors that may not be part of the HMT complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Validation of Factor Binding by Real-Time PCR</title><p>We used a standard approach that combines conventional ChIP and real-time PCR to assess the reliability of the ChIP-chip method and our approach for analysis of the raw microarray data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g004">Figures 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g005">5</xref>).

To test whether menin-targeted genes show alterations in expression in cells that lack menin, we determined in vivo expression changes incurred upon menin loss in a mouse model of MEN1.

Prior to this study, the only genes reported to be targeted by menin and MLL were <italic>Hoxc6, Hoxc8, HOXA9, p27,</italic> and <italic>p18</italic>. Our findings indicate that menin does not only target specific classes of genes like <italic>HOX</italic> and <italic>CDK</italic> inhibitors but that menin also targets a very broad range of promoters in multiple tissues. This expands the realm of menin-targeted genes several hundred-fold. We find that menin occupancy frequently coincides with members of the HMT complex, MLL1 and Rbbp5, as well as the H3 K4 trimethyl mark, raising the possibility that menin functions as a general transcriptional regulator that helps maintain stable gene expression. Averaged over thousands of genes, menin correlates with higher gene expression, but overall expression levels do not decrease upon loss of menin in null islets. Surprisingly, menin binds many regions of the genome independently of the HMT complex members, suggesting that menin may regulate transcription by cooperating with other, currently unknown proteins. Possible candidates include JunD, SMADs, NF&#x003ba;B, or other menin-associated transcription factors not part of the SET1/MLL complex.</p><p>A fundamental question for many tumor suppressor syndromes is the tissue specificity of tumor formation. Menin is expressed in nearly all tissues. Why do MEN1-associated tumors arise primarily in endocrine organs? Could the interactions between menin, MLL, and <italic>HOX</italic> gene expression suggest an explanation for the endocrine specificity?</p><p>MLL is an important regulator of <italic>HOX</italic> gene expression, and leukemic chromosomal translocations involving <italic>MLL</italic> appear to act by creating chimeric fusion proteins that constitutively activate <italic>HOX</italic> genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b033">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. The persistent expression of <italic>HOX</italic> genes results in a failure of terminal differentiation, and studies in mice have shown that overexpression of certain <italic>HOX</italic> genes, <italic>Hoxa9</italic> and <italic>Meis1</italic> in particular, leads to leukemogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

Collectively, these findings have led to the enticing hypothesis that tumorigenesis in MEN1, like leukemogenesis, is related to dysregulation of <italic>HOX</italic> genes normally bound by menin and MLL. If this hypothesis is valid, however, we would have expected to see menin occupancy at the <italic>HOX</italic> clusters in pancreatic islets. While we did detect extensive binding of menin (and MLL) to the <italic>HOX A</italic> and <italic>C</italic> clusters in HeLa S3 cells, virtually no signal was detected in either HepG2 cells or pancreatic islets. Moreover, the clustered homeobox genes are expressed at almost undetectable levels in pancreatic islets, and none of them significantly change in expression following loss of menin. Given these findings and the contrasts of menin function in myeloid versus endocrine tumors, we believe it is unlikely that dysregulation of <italic>HOX</italic> genes in islet cells contributes to MEN1 islet neoplasms.</p><p>If <italic>HOX</italic> genes are not the mediator, then how does menin loss lead to endocrine tumors? Menin was recently proposed to regulate pancreatic islet growth by promoting histone methylation and expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors <italic>p27</italic> and <italic>p18</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, the simultaneous loss of <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> in mice was shown to lead to development of tumors in many of the same endocrine tissues as humans with inherited mutations in the <italic>MEN1</italic> and <italic>MEN2</italic> genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. These studies argue for a major role for <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> in the tissue-specific tumor phenotype in MEN1. Specifically, loss of menin prevents H3 K4 methylation at the promoters of <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27,</italic> reducing their expression, and ultimately abrogating their inhibitory effect on cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2 and CDK4) and resulting in unrestrained cell growth. Consistent with this hypothesis, we detected menin at the promoters of <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> and reduced <italic>p18</italic> expression in islet cells that were conditionally null for <italic>Men1</italic>. However, <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> concentrations were reduced in <italic>Men1</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> liver, which is not susceptible to developing tumors in heterozygous <italic>MEN1</italic> patients, or in mice rendered null for menin in liver by a conditional knockout. A separate study showed that menin can regulate <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> expression in fibroblasts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, yet the phenotype of MEN1 does not include fibrosarcoma. These results indicate that while dysregulation of <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> may contribute to neoplastic transformation in MEN1, these genes alone cannot account for the specific bias for endocrine tumor formation in MEN1.</p><p>To identify other possible genetic causes for the tissue specificity of tumor formation, we identified a relatively small number of genes that were both bound by menin and altered in expression in menin-null islets. One of these genes was the developmentally programmed <italic>HLXB9,</italic> which codes for transcription factor HB9. Hb9 expression was significantly elevated in pancreatic islets in the absence of menin, suggesting that menin is a transcriptional repressor of <italic>HLXB9</italic>. It is also noteworthy that <italic>HLXB9</italic> was bound by menin only in islets, and not in HeLa or HepG2 cells. These findings raise the possibility that the specific bias for endocrine tumor formation in MEN1 could result from changes in expression in distinct genes, including <italic>HLXB9,</italic> that are specifically targeted by menin in endocrine tissues.</p><p>Based on our findings and the work of others, we propose the following model for tumor suppression by menin in pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020051-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In both endocrine and nonendocrine tissues, menin mediates transcriptional activation of genes that inhibit cell growth, including, but not limited to, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic>. In addition, menin can function as a corepressor of tissue-specific genes that promote cell growth, including <italic>HLXB9</italic>. Menin can mediate its regulatory functions in the presence of the HMT complexes or other menin partners. Endocrine neoplasia as a consequence of menin loss results from the combined effects of decreased <italic>p18</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> and increased <italic>HLXB9</italic> expression. Additional tissue-specific factors that are dysregulated upon menin loss probably also contribute to neoplasia. Similar studies in additional tissues, such as anterior pituitary or parathyroid, may help reveal the complete list of critical targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies for chromatin immunoprecipitation.</title><p>Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-menin (BL342), anti-Rbbp5 (BL766), and anti-MLL1 (BL1289) antibodies were obtained from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, Texas, United States).

Analyses performed at different window sizes and thresholds yielded similar results (unpublished data). All raw and processed ChIP-chip data is publicly available from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</ext-link>). The <italic>p</italic>-value scores for each promoter tested are included. The windowing and threshold program we developed, which we named ACME (Algorithm for Capturing Microarray Enrichment), is available from the authors upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Real-time PCR validation.</title><p>Standard ChIP with menin and trimethyl H3 K4 antibodies was performed on HeLa S3 cells in duplicate. PCR primer pairs were designed to amplify 150- to 200-bp fragments from selected genomic regions. For menin, we compared 67 promoters determined by ChIP-chip to be enriched for menin binding at <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 to 15 random promoter regions (0.001 &#x0003c; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 1) and seven random regions located outside of promoter regions. For H3 K4, we tested 38 promoters that were determined by ChIP-chip to be highly enriched (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), 20 marginally enriched genes (0.0001 &#x0003c; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), 17 unenriched promoter regions (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.5), and seven random regions.</p><p>Real-time PCRs were carried out in duplicate on each chromatin immunoprecipitated and input DNA sample using SYBR green PCR mix (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) in an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real Time-PCR machine (Foster City, California, United States). DNA obtained from menin chromatin immunoprecipitations was very limited in quantity and could not be quantitated by standard methods. As a result, unequal quantities of ChIP and input DNA were added to PCRs. To account for the differences in DNA quantity, for every genomic region studied, a &#x00394;C<sub>t</sub> value was calculated for each sample by subtracting the C<sub>t</sub> value for chromatin immunoprecipitated sample from the C<sub>t</sub> value obtained for the input. Raising 2 to the &#x00394;C<sub>t</sub> power yielded the relative amount of PCR product (relative enrichment). Average values for promoters occupied by either menin or H3 K4 were compared to those calculated for unoccupied promoters and random regions of the genome. All primer sequences are available upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Comparison of ChIP-chip and expression data.</title><p>ChIP-chip data from islet cells were merged to Affymetrix (Santa Clara, California, United States) islet expression data from the Novartis (version 2) data set &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020051-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. HeLa S3 and HepG2 ChIP-chip data were merged to expression data generated in our laboratory using Affymetrix U133A Plus microarrays (HeLa S3 and HepG2). All ChIP-chip and expression datasets were merged by gene symbol. For all three cell types, two replicate datasets were averaged.

Biotin-labeled cRNA was then purified, fragmented, and hybridized to MOE430A Affymetrix GeneChip probe arrays containing more than 22,000 probe sets.
