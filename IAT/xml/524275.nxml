In contrast, its homologue in fission yeast, Rad22, was assumed to play a less critical role possibly due to functional redundancy with another Rad52-like protein Rti1. We show here that this is not the case. Rad22 like Rad52 plays a central role in recombination being required for both Rhp51-dependent and -independent events. Having established this we proceed to investigate the involvement of the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 endonuclease in these pathways. Mus81 plays a relatively minor role in the Rhp51-dependent repair of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light. In contrast Mus81 has a key role in the Rad22-dependent (Rhp51-independent) repair of damage induced by camptothecin, hydroxyurea and methyl-methanesulfonate. Furthermore, spontaneous intrachromosomal recombination that gives rise to deletion recombinants is impaired in a <italic>mus81</italic> mutant. From these data we propose that a Rad22&#x02013;Mus81-dependent (Rhp51-independent) pathway is an important mechanism for the repair of DNA damage in fission yeast. Consistent with this we show that <italic>in vitro</italic> Rad22 can promote strand invasion to form a D-loop that can be cleaved by Mus81.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Problems associated with DNA damage can be compounded during S-phase. Single-strand breaks can act as run-off sites for polymerases resulting in replication fork collapse and the formation of one-ended double-strand breaks (DSBs). Bulky DNA lesions can block fork progress, and may in some instances result in replisome disassembly and the regression of the fork where the nascent strands are unwound and anneal to each other. Alternatively, the replisome may skip damaged sections of the genome leaving behind lesion-containing single-strand gaps. Problems such as these can be dealt with by homologous recombination, which promotes the repair of a break or a lesion-containing gap, enables template switching for polymerases to bypass DNA lesions, and helps restart replication at non-origin sites [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c1">1</xref>)].</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, recombination depends on the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group of genes [for reviews see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c3">3</xref>)]. Typically a 3&#x02032; tail, exposed by the resection of a DSB or unwinding of a single-strand gap, is bound by Rad51, which then catalyses strand invasion of a homologous DNA molecule to form a D-loop. The loading of Rad51 on to the DNA and catalysis of strand invasion are variously aided by proteins such as Rad52, Rad54, Rad55 and Rad57. In some situations Rad52 can promote the formation of a D-loop without Rad51 through its ability to anneal complementary ssDNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c4">4</xref>). D-loops can act as sites for replisome reassembly, and therefore by promoting strand invasion recombination can act to restart replication at stalled or broken replication forks [sometimes called recombination-dependent replication (RDR) or break-induced replication (BIR)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c1">1</xref>).</p><p>Various mechanisms have been proposed for RDR and most involve the formation and subsequent processing of one or two Holliday junctions (HJs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c1">1</xref>). One enzyme that has been implicated in resolving HJs in eukaryotes is Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 (Mus81&#x02013;Mms4 in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>). Mus81 is a member of the XPF family of endonucleases, and together with Eme1&#x0002f;Mms4 has been shown to cleave synthetic HJs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Evidence that it cleaves HJs <italic>in vivo</italic> has come from genetic studies which have shown that <italic>mus81</italic> and <italic>eme1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>mms4</italic> mutant phenotypes are suppressed by the bacterial HJ resolvase RusA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c9">9</xref>). However, the idea that Mus81&#x02013;Eme1&#x0002f;Mms4 is a HJ resolvase has been questioned by <italic>in vitro</italic> data showing that recombinant enzyme, purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, exhibits only weak HJ cleavage activity, whilst cleaving fork structures and 3&#x02032; flaps relatively well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c12">12</xref>). In the case of Mus81&#x02013;Mms4 this has lead to proposals that its prime function is to remove 3&#x02032; flaps that are formed during the repair of DSBs and single-strand gaps by synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c6">6</xref>). However, these models do not provide a satisfactory explanation why RusA suppresses <italic>mus81</italic> and <italic>eme1&#x0002f;mms4</italic> mutant phenotypes.</p><p>It has been shown recently that recombinant Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 can resolve four-way DNA junctions that contain a single-strand nick or gap at or near the junction centre at least as well as a 3&#x02032; flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c14">14</xref>). Such four-way junctions are formed during the regression of a replication fork and prior to the formation of a HJ at a D-loop. Based on these data we have proposed that Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 may cleave regressed replication forks to promote RDR, and resolve the four-way DNA junction at a D-loop during RDR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f1">1</xref>). In these models RusA is able to suppress <italic>mus81</italic> mutant phenotypes not because it provides a direct substitute for Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 but because it is able to resolve the HJs that will form in its absence.</p><p>Here we have investigated the relationship of Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 (for simplicity referred to as Mus81 throughout this paper) to recombinational pathways of DNA repair in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. Existing data suggest that the pathways of recombination in <italic>S.pombe</italic> are similar to those in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, with the exception that Rad22 (the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Rad52 homologue) is not required for all recombination possibly due to functional redundancy with another Rad52-like protein Rti1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c2">2</xref>). However, we show here that this is not the case and that Rad22 is in fact required for most recombination just like Rad52 in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. The original confusion in the literature appears to stem from the ease with which <italic>rad22</italic> strains acquire suppressor mutations. Having established that there are Rhp51-dependent (the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Rad51 homologue) and -independent pathways of recombination, which are both dependent on Rad22, we show that Mus81 functions predominantly in the Rhp51-independent pathway. We also show that Mus81 can cleave D-loops that are formed by Rad22 <italic>in vitro</italic>. These data are consistent with our proposal that Mus81 resolves D-loops formed by Rad22 (without Rhp51) during the repair of broken replication forks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>General techniques and strains</title><p>Procedures for <italic>S.pombe</italic> genetics were as described by Moreno <italic>et al</italic>.

However, in <italic>S.pombe</italic> genetic analyses suggest that Rhp51 can function without Rad22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c21">21</xref>). These data have been explained by the presence of another Rad52-like protein in <italic>S.pombe</italic> called Rti1 (or Rad22B), which could substitute in the absence of Rad22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c23">23</xref>).</p><p>To clarify the genetic interactions between <italic>rad22</italic> and the <italic>rhp51</italic> epistasis group we first constructed a new <italic>rad22</italic> deletion strain by replacement of the entire <italic>rad22</italic> open reading frame with an <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker. This strain grew much slower and was much more hypersensitive to UV light, HU, MMS and CPT than previously published <italic>rad22</italic> mutant strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f2">2</xref>). These more extreme phenotypes were solely due to the deletion of <italic>rad22</italic> because they could be fully complemented by a cloned copy of the gene expressed from a plasmid (data not shown). The discrepancy in phenotypes between these different <italic>rad22</italic> mutant strains is explained by the presence of suppressor mutations, which will be analysed elsewhere.</p><p>Having obtained a non-suppressed <italic>rad22</italic> mutant we could unambiguously establish <italic>rad22</italic>'s relationship to the <italic>rhp51</italic> epistasis group. A <italic>rad22 rhp51</italic> double mutant strain was constructed and compared to its respective single mutant strains for sensitivity to different DNA damaging agents. The <italic>rad22</italic> single mutant is more sensitive to UV, HU, MMS and CPT than a <italic>rhp51</italic> single mutant but is similarly sensitive to gamma irradiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f3">3</xref>A and B). The double mutant exhibits slightly more sensitivity to most of these DNA damaging agents than the <italic>rad22</italic> single mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f3">3</xref>A and B). This enhanced sensitivity is particularly noticeable at high UV doses where the sensitivity of the <italic>rad22</italic> strain appears to plateau off (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f3">3</xref>B). The majority of the <italic>rad22</italic> mutant survivors at high UV doses had acquired a suppressor mutation, and, as suppression depends on <italic>rhp51</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (our unpublished data), this explains why the <italic>rad22</italic> single mutant appears to be slightly less sensitive to DNA damage than the <italic>rad22 rhp51</italic> double mutant. When taken together these data show that <italic>rad22</italic> and <italic>rhp51</italic> are epistatic for the repair&#x0002f;tolerance of DNA damage. For DSBs caused by gamma irradiation it would seem that Rhp51 and Rad22 mainly work together to promote repair since both <italic>rhp51</italic> and <italic>rad22</italic> single mutants show approximately the same sensitivity as a <italic>rhp51 rad22</italic> double mutant. However, the greater sensitivity of a <italic>rad22</italic> mutant compared to a <italic>rhp51</italic> mutant to agents such as UV, HU, MMS and CPT, which variously cause replication fork stalling, blockage and breakage, suggests that the recombinational repair of damaged replication forks can be undertaken by Rad22 both with and without Rhp51.</p></sec><sec><title>Pathways of direct repeat recombination in <italic>S.pombe</italic></title><p>To investigate the relationship between <italic>rhp51</italic> and <italic>rad22</italic> with respect to recombination we used strains containing a non-tandem direct repeat of <italic>ade6</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> heteroalleles to measure Ade<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> recombinant frequencies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f3">3</xref>C). Such recombinants arise from inter- or intra-chromatid recombination by a number of different pathways, which in part can be categorised using a <italic>his3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene placed between the repeats that allows Ade<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> recombinants that are His<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (deletion types) to be distinguished from those that are His<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (conversion types) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c24">24</xref>). In wild-type strains &#x0223c;3.5 Ade<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> recombinants are generated in every 10<sup>4</sup> viable cells of which &#x0223c;30% are conversion types and &#x0223c;70% are deletion types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f3">3</xref>D). Mutants from the <italic>rhp51</italic> epistasis group, including <italic>rhp51</italic>, <italic>rhp54</italic> and <italic>rhp55</italic> single mutants and <italic>rhp51 rhp55</italic> and <italic>rhp54 rhp55</italic> double mutants, are devoid of conversion type recombinants but exhibit a 4- to 5-fold increase in deletion type recombinants compared to wild-type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f3">3</xref>D). The <italic>rad22</italic> mutant is also devoid of conversion types, but unlike the <italic>rhp51</italic>, <italic>rhp54</italic> and <italic>rhp55</italic> mutants it exhibits a &#x0003e;3-fold reduction in recombinant frequency (&#x0003c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f3">3</xref>D). The same low level of recombinants and absence of conversion types is seen in both <italic>rhp51 rad22</italic> and <italic>rhp55 rad22</italic> double mutants. These data show that two Rad22-dependent pathways are responsible for the majority of recombination between repeated DNA sequences in <italic>S.pombe</italic>. One of these pathways involves the Rhp51 epistasis group of proteins, and is required for generating conversion type recombinants, whilst the other is independent of Rhp51 and only generates deletion type recombinants.</p></sec><sec><title>Mus81 functions in Rad22-dependent pathways of DNA repair</title><p>In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Mus81&#x0002f;Mms4 functions in the Rad52-dependent pathway for the repair&#x0002f;tolerance of UV- and MMS-induced damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c5">5</xref>).

These data indicate that Mus81 functions in a separate but overlapping pathway to Rhp51 for the repair of at least some types of DNA damage.</p><p>We have recently reported that a <italic>mus81 rhp54</italic> double mutant exhibits a synergistic increase in poor growth and reduced viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c27">27</xref>). Rhp54 is a homologue of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Rad54, which is believed to promote recombination by aiding Rad51-mediated strand invasion and D-loop formation, remodelling chromatin, and dissociating Rad51-dsDNA filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c28">28</xref>). We have observed that <italic>rhp51</italic> and <italic>rhp54</italic> mutants exhibit an epistatic relationship with respect to genotoxin sensitivity consistent with Rhp51 and Rhp54 proteins functioning together (unpublished data). It was conceivable therefore that the poor growth and viability of a <italic>mus81 rhp54</italic> double mutant might be due to aberrant or unresolved recombination intermediates formed by Rhp51. To test this we compared a <italic>mus81 rhp51 rhp54</italic> triple mutant with its respective double mutants for growth and viability. The triple mutant exhibited improved growth and viability compared to a <italic>mus81 rhp54</italic> double mutant indicating that either Rhp54 or Mus81 are required to prevent Rhp51-mediated toxicity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f4">4</xref>D, data not shown). Unexpectedly we also observed that the triple mutant grew slightly better than a <italic>mus81 rhp51</italic> double mutant suggesting that Rhp54 can have a deleterious effect in the absence of both Mus81 and Rhp51. When we tested these strains for genotoxin sensitivity it was apparent that the deletion of <italic>rhp54</italic> in a <italic>mus81 rhp51</italic> mutant background also reduced sensitivity to UV, HU and MMS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f4">4</xref>D, data not shown). In the case of UV, sensitivity is reduced almost to the level of a <italic>rhp51 rhp54</italic> double mutant, which is the same as a <italic>rhp51</italic> single mutant. These data show that the additive UV sensitivity of a <italic>mus81 rhp51</italic> double mutant is mostly a consequence of Rhp54-mediated toxicity, and suggest that <italic>mus81</italic> and <italic>rhp51</italic> may in fact function in the same pathway for the response to UV-induced damage. However, a <italic>mus81 rhp51 rhp54</italic> triple mutant is still synergistically more sensitive to HU, MMS and CPT than <italic>mus81</italic> single and <italic>rhp51 rhp54</italic> double mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f4">4</xref>D, data not shown). This reaffirms our conclusion that Mus81 functions in a Rhp51-independent pathway for the repair of certain kinds of DNA damage.</p><p>To see if Mus81 functions in a Rad22-dependent Rhp51-independent pathway we compared <italic>mus81</italic> and <italic>rad22</italic> single and double mutants for growth and genotoxin sensitivity. Contrary to our expectation a <italic>mus81 rad22</italic> double mutant grows much slower and is more sensitive to UV, HU, MMS and CPT than its respective single mutant strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f4">4</xref>A&#x02013;C). A comparison of this double mutant with a <italic>mus81 rhp51 rad22</italic> triple mutant revealed that the poor growth and enhanced sensitivity of the <italic>mus81 rad22</italic> mutant strain is due mainly to <italic>rhp51</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f4">4</xref>E, data not shown). Seemingly in the absence of both Rad22 and Mus81, Rhp51 has a deleterious effect. When we compared the triple mutant to a <italic>rad22 rhp51</italic> double mutant we observed that both strains are similarly sensitive to UV, MMS and CPT, and that the triple mutant is slightly more sensitive to HU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f4">4</xref>E). Taken together these data indicate that Mus81 functions mainly in a Rad22-dependent pathway for the repair of damage induced by UV, HU, MMS and CPT. Moreover in most cases this pathway is independent of Rhp51.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of <italic>mus81&#x00394;</italic> on the frequency of direct repeat recombination</title><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f3">3</xref>D Rad22-dependent (Rhp51-independent) recombination generates only deletion-type recombinants. Consistent with Mus81's involvement in this pathway the formation of deletion types is suppressed in a <italic>mus81</italic> mutant, whereas the frequency of conversion types remains unaffected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f5">5</xref>). Although the reduction in deletion types is modest it is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02). Furthermore it accounts for approximately half of the deletion types that are dependent on Rad22. Deletion of <italic>mus81</italic> also slightly reduces the elevated frequency of deletion types in a <italic>rhp55</italic> mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f5">5</xref>). Again the effect is modest but significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02). Finally, the residual level of deletion types in a <italic>rad22</italic> single or <italic>rad22 rhp55</italic> double mutant is unaffected by <italic>mus81</italic> mutation showing that Mus81 promotes deletion type formation in a Rad22-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage of Rad22-dependent D-loops by Mus81 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Our genetic data indicates that Mus81 can function with Rad22 independently of Rhp51 to promote the repair of DNA damage. Human (Hs) Rad52 can promote the formation of D-loops <italic>in vitro</italic> independently of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c4">4</xref>). This reaction probably depends on Rad52 promoting annealing between the invading single-stranded DNA and transiently unwound duplex DNA. It has also been shown recently that both human and budding yeast Rad52 can promote DNA strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c30">30</xref>). Therefore one-way in which Rad22 and Mus81 could function together to promote DNA repair without Rhp51, is if Rad22 forms D-loops that Mus81 cleaves. To test this possibility <italic>in vitro</italic> we first purified recombinant Rad22 and found that it could promote D-loop formation similar to HsRad52 (data not shown). Standard D-loop assays measure homologous pairing between ssDNA fragments and superhelical dsDNA substrates, with reaction products being resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. In such assays the ssDNA typically shares absolute homology to a region of the dsDNA and therefore can form a D-loop with no extruding flaps. However, the repair of a collapsed replication fork would involve strand invasion from a detached arm of the replication fork (i.e. a duplex DNA with a single-stranded tail). This would generate a D-loop with a four-way DNA junction containing three duplex arms. Such D-loops are ideal substrates for Mus81 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c13">13</xref>).</p><p>In order for Rad22 to promote the formation of the type of D-loop that Mus81 favours for cleavage, we used a radiolabelled partial duplex consisting of a 20 bp heterologous duplex region and an 80 nt 3&#x02032;-ended single-stranded region with homology to &#x003c6;X174 DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>A). Incubation of these two DNAs in the absence of Rad22 results in trace amounts of two retarded radiolabelled products. Both products migrate slightly behind the position of the unlabelled &#x003c6;X174 supercoiled DNA, and the slightly faster migrating product runs approximately at the position of linear &#x003c6;X174 DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>B, lane a; data not shown). When the partial duplex is pre-incubated with stoichiometric amounts of Rad22 prior to the addition of the supercoiled DNA there is &#x0003e;10-fold increase in the amount of these retarded species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>B, lanes b&#x02013;d). Optimal formation of these species occurs at approximately a 1:1 ratio of monomeric Rad22 and nucleotides of single-stranded tail, which is the same as for D-loop formation by HsRad52 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>B and C, data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c4">4</xref>). To see if these species have the expected properties of the type of D-loop formed by RecA or HsRad52 we first looked to see if they were dependent on homology. To do this we made a second radiolabelled partial duplex that shares homology to a region of pBR322. Pre-incubation of this partial duplex with Rad22, followed by the addition of supercoiled pBR322 DNA, results in the formation of a D-loop (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>C, lanes e&#x02013;h). However, if &#x003c6;X174 is used instead of pBR322 then no D-loop is formed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>C, lanes b and c). Similarly, combining the &#x003c6;X174-based partial duplex with pBR322 also results in no D-loop (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>C, lanes i and j). These data show that the D-loops formed by Rad22 are homology-dependent. A second characteristic of a bona fide D-loop is that it can be dissociated by spontaneous branch migration. Branch migration induced either by heat treatment or through the release of superhelical tension, by cutting the &#x003c6;X174 DNA away from the D-loop with a restriction enzyme, resulted in the dissociation of the D-loops formed by Rad22 (data not shown). Finally, similar to HsRad52, pre-incubation of Rad22 with the &#x003c6;X174 DNA inhibited its ability to promote D-loop formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>B, lanes e&#x02013;g) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c4">4</xref>). This suggests that a Rad22&#x02013;&#x003c6;X174 DNA complex is unable to form a D-loop.</p><p>Having established that the D-loops generated by Rad22 are genuine we looked to see whether Mus81 could cleave them. Reactions in which Mus81 was added just after the supercoiled DNA showed a Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent decrease in the amount of D-loop together with an increase in the smear of radiolabelled material migrating between the D-loop and the free partial duplex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>D, compare lanes c&#x02013;e). In these reactions Mus81 preferentially affects the more retarded D-loop band. These results are consistent with cleavage of the D-loop by Mus81, which would release the superhelical tension in the &#x003c6;X174 DNA thereby enabling the D-loop to dissociate by branch migration.</p><p>To provide further evidence of Mus81's ability to target D-loops, we purified the D-loops from a Rad22 reaction and incubated them with Mus81 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>E). In the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> Mus81 dissociated the purified D-loops, again preferentially targeting the more retarded D-loop band (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f6">6</xref>E, lanes c and d). A comparison with D-loops dissociated by heat treatment (lane a), shows that Mus81 dissociates much of the D-loop back to free partial duplex. Analysis of these reaction products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed very little cleavage of the partial duplex DNA (data not shown). Incubation of Mus81 with supercoiled &#x003c6;X174 DNA also revealed relatively little non-specific nicking activity (data not shown). Furthermore, incubation of Mus81 with synthetic D-loops under the conditions used here, confirms that Mus81 cleaves predominantly at sites just 5&#x02032; of the four-way DNA junction in the strand that is complementary to the invading 3&#x02032; single-stranded tail (Supplementary Material). These data indicate that Mus81 is causing the dissociation of the D-loop by specifically nicking the &#x003c6;X174 DNA at the D-loop.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Epistasis analysis of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Rad52 homologue Rad22 originally suggested that, unlike in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, Rad22 and Rhp51 worked independently of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c20">20</xref>). This conclusion was questioned by data showing that Rad22 and Rhp51 physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c31">31</xref>). A further characterization of <italic>rad22</italic> mutant phenotypes, using a new <italic>rad22</italic> deletion mutant, also suggested that earlier conclusions were misguided by the use of a presumed hypomorphic allele of <italic>rad22</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c22">22</xref>). However, these studies still did not observe the same kind of dramatic effect on recombination that mutation of <italic>RAD52</italic> has in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c22">22</xref>). It was therefore concluded that Rad22 played a less critical role in <italic>S.pombe</italic> because of functional redundancy with another Rad52-like protein called Rti1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c31">31</xref>). We have shown here that this is not the case. Deletion of <italic>rad22</italic> has a profound effect on survival following exposure to a range of different genotoxins, which, depending on the genotoxin, is either equivalent or greater than that of a <italic>rhp51</italic> mutant. Direct repeat recombination is also dramatically reduced in a <italic>rad22</italic> mutant, including a total ablation of conversion type recombinants. Finally, these <italic>rad22</italic> mutant phenotypes show epistasis with those of a <italic>rhp51</italic> mutant indicating that recombination is driven by Rad22-dependent mechanisms that are both dependent and independent of Rhp51. This is just like the relationship between <italic>RAD52</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic> in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. The reason that the earlier studies of <italic>rad22</italic> were misguided appears to be due to the presence of suppressor mutations in the strains that were used. The identity and characterisation of the suppressors will be presented elsewhere.</p><sec><title>Direct repeat recombination in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic></title><p>From our analyses it appears that the pathways of spontaneous direct repeat recombination are essentially the same in <italic>S.pombe</italic> as those that have been described in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c32">32</xref>). In both yeast there are <italic>RAD52</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>rad22</italic>-dependent and -independent pathways. Although the exact mechanisms of recombination are unknown, it has been proposed that the major mechanism of <italic>RAD52</italic>-independent recombination is single-strand annealing (SSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c33">33</xref>). In contrast <italic>RAD52</italic>-dependent recombination may be a mixture of SSA, <italic>RAD51</italic>-dependent gene conversion&#x0002f;reciprocal exchange, and BIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c33">33</xref>). In the absence of <italic>RAD51</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>rhp51</italic> the frequency of gene conversion&#x0002f;reciprocal exchange is reduced or abolished, but the overall frequency of recombination increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c34">34</xref>). Like in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> this hyper-recombination in <italic>S.pombe</italic> is dependent on <italic>rad22</italic>, and may stem from un-repaired lesions (e.g. single-strand gaps) being converted into DSBs that are then repaired by SSA or BIR.</p></sec><sec><title>Mus81 functions in a recombinational repair pathway that is independent of Rhp51</title><p>We have shown that Mus81 generally functions in a Rad22-dependent pathway for DNA repair. Furthermore, for damage induced by HU, MMS and CPT it can promote repair independently of Rhp51. These genotoxins can variously cause stalling, blockage and breakage of the replication fork. It is difficult therefore to ascertain the exact type of lesion that is repaired by the Rad22&#x02013;Mus81-dependent pathway. The exquisite hypersensitivity of <italic>mus81</italic> mutant strains to CPT, however, provides perhaps the best clue as to what Mus81 may be doing in mitotic cells. CPT traps Top1 cleavage complexes thereby generating single-strand breaks at which replication forks collapse by &#x02018;replication run-off&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c35">35</xref>). Cleavage complexes may also block DNA replication if present in the lagging strand template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c36">36</xref>). Therefore Mus81 would appear to play an important role in the repair of blocked and&#x0002f;or broken replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c8">8</xref>). Suppression of this hypersensitivity by RusA indicates that Mus81's prime role here is in the processing of reversed replication forks and&#x0002f;or recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c8">8</xref>). From our epistasis analysis we know that there are Rhp51-dependent and independent pathways for repairing CPT-induced damage. Furthermore, we know that Mus81 functions in the Rhp51-independent pathway, and based on our observation that <italic>mus81 rhp51</italic> and <italic>rad22 rhp51</italic> double mutants exhibit similar sensitivities to CPT, it seems that this pathway is largely dependent on Mus81. As <italic>mus81</italic> and <italic>rhp51</italic> single mutants exhibit similar sensitivities to CPT, we suspect that the Rhp51-independent pathway deals with approximately half of the replication fork problems induced by CPT.</p><p>We have found that CPT induces mostly deletion recombinants in the direct repeat substrate used in our studies (unpublished data). This is consistent with data showing that fork collapse gives rise to deletions between direct repeats, which occurs by strand invasion from the broken sister chromatid into the &#x02018;wrong&#x02019; repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c37">37</xref>). Interestingly approximately 50% of spontaneous Rad22-dependent deletion type recombinants are dependent on Mus81. We suspect that, like CPT-induced deletion types, these spontaneous events are due to replication fork collapse. The observation that half of these deletion types depend on Mus81, correlates well with our supposition that the Rhp51-independent pathway deals with approximately half of the replication fork problems induced by CPT. The hyper-levels of Rad22-dependent deletion types in a <italic>rhp55</italic> mutant (equivalent to a <italic>rhp51</italic> mutant), which are largely independent of Mus81, probably arise by SSA.</p><p>We have shown that Rad22 can promote the strand invasion of a double-stranded DNA molecule by a 3&#x02032; single-stranded tailed duplex. Therefore, the Rhp51-independent pathway for dealing with CPT-induced damage could involve the repair of one-ended DSBs by Rad22-promoted strand invasion. Mus81 could be required to generate these one-ended DSBs by cleaving stalled replication forks. However, it is our contention that its primary role is to resolve the D-loops that are formed by Rad22 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f1">1</xref>A). Certainly our <italic>in vitro</italic> data shows that Mus81 has this ability. The idea that a Rhp51-independent mechanism could be a prominent way of repairing collapsed replication forks is consistent with data showing that the accumulation of HJs in the rDNA array in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> depends on <italic>RAD52</italic> and not <italic>RAD51</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c38">38</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Rad52 can repair two-ended DSBs by BIR independently of Rad51. BIR involves strand invasion from one of the broken ends into an intact sister chromatid or homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c3">3</xref>). This primes DNA synthesis allowing chromosomal regions on the other side of the break to be recovered by DNA replication. However, the <italic>RAD51</italic>-independent pathway of BIR is relatively inefficient, and a recent study has shown that &#x0003e;95% of BIR events involving a single-end invasion depend on <italic>RAD51</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c39">39</xref>). The inefficiency of the <italic>RAD51</italic>-independent pathway is probably due to the dependence of Rad52-promoted strand invasion on the donor duplex being transiently unwound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh853c39">39</xref>). This study questions our idea that a Rad22&#x02013;Mus81-dependent (Rhp51-independent) pathway could be a significant mechanism for one-ended DSB repair in <italic>S.pombe</italic>. However, studies of BIR in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> measure recombination between one broken DNA end and an intact sister chromatid or homologous chromosome. In contrast, replication fork collapse, by &#x02018;replication run-off&#x02019; or by Mus81 cleavage of a reversed fork, generates one broken DNA end and a sister chromatid with a single-stranded gap [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh853f1">1</xref>A (step 2) and B (step 4a)]. We think that this gap may provide access for a DNA helicase, which could generate the necessary unwound donor duplex for efficient Rad22-dependent strand invasion&#x0002f;annealing. We are currently investigating the validity of this assertion.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_18_5570__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_18_5570__1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_18_5570__2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh853f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Hypothetical model showing potential roles that Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 might have in processing stalled and broken replication forks.
