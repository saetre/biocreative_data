To test this, we first determined whether dFmrp is associated with the endogenous miRNAs. We used the previously developed anti-dFmrp antibody to perform immunoprecipitation from the lysates of both wild-type (WT, <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) and <italic>dfmr1<sup>3</sup></italic> mutant ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000444-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000444-Dockendorff1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

To identify the miRNAs specifically associated with dFmrp, we determined the level of each miRNA in both IP and input RNAs from WT and <italic>dfmr1<sup>3</sup></italic> mutants. We identified the miRNAs that were consistently enriched by more than two-fold in WT-IP over both WT-Input and <italic>dfmr1<sup>3</sup></italic>-IP in two independent experiments, since such miRNAs are likely to be the ones specifically associated with dFmrp based on previous IP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000444-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000444-Zarnescu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since the hypomorphic allele of <italic>bantam (ban)</italic>, <italic>ban<sup>EP3622</sup></italic>, was fertile and exhibited no apparent defects in germ cells, including PGCs and GSCs, we performed a mutagenesis through imprecise mobilization of the P-element from <italic>ban<sup>EP3622</sup></italic> to generate stronger alleles for the <italic>ban</italic> gene.

Previous investigations have demonstrated that the self-renewal of GSCs requires both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms. Gene products, such as Piwi, Yb, Dpp, and Gbb, are produced from niche cells and function as extrinsic factors for GSC maintenance. On the other hand, intrinsic factors, including Nanos (Nos), Pumilio (Pum), the Dpp-dependent receptors, and transcription factors, are also important for GSC self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000444-Spradling1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000444-Wong1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this paper, we found that the bantam miRNA is associated with dFmrp in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary. To determine the role of the bantam miRNA, we generated null alleles of <italic>ban</italic> and examined the role of the bantam miRNA in the maintenance and fate specification of GSCs.

Furthermore, the transgene <italic>P{banP-ban}</italic> could not rescue the GSC phenotype associated with the loss of <italic>dFmr1</italic> (data not shown). The role of <italic>ban</italic> in GSC maintenance and its genetic interaction with <italic>dFmr1</italic> appear specific since another miRNA that is associated with dFmrp, miR-1, has no effect on GSCs (Chen and Jin, unpublished data).
