Here, we demonstrate that reactivation of Notch signaling causes embryonic stem cell&#x02013;derived and neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes to enter the cell cycle. The proliferative response of neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes declines as they mature, such that late activation of Notch triggers the DNA damage checkpoint and G2/M interphase arrest. Notch induces recombination signal-binding protein 1 for J&#x003ba; (RBP-J&#x003ba;)-dependent expression of cyclin D1 but, unlike other inducers, also shifts its subcellular distribution from the cytosol to the nucleus. Nuclear localization of cyclin D1 is independent of RBP-J&#x003ba;. Thus, the influence of Notch on nucleocytoplasmic localization of cyclin D1 is an unanticipated property of the Notch intracellular domain that is likely to regulate the cell cycle in multiple contexts, including tumorigenesis as well as cardiogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>V&#x000ed;ctor M.

The incapacity of adult cardiomyocytes to divide underlies the inability of the heart muscle to regenerate after an injury, such as a myocardial infarction, that frequently leads to overload and heart failure. Notch signaling is normally active in the embryonic heart of multiple species, where it influences cell fate and morphogenesis, including within the early myocardial field, atrioventricular canal myocardium and cushions, and in the ventricular wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rones et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loomes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rutenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grego-Bessa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Niessen and Karsan, 2007</xref>). In addition to controlling cell fate, several studies indicate that Notch influences tissue formation and morphogenesis during development by regulating the balance between a progenitor or precursor pool and differentiating progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dallas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mammucari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Es et al., 2005</xref>). In principal, a similar process could contribute to tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kohler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Su et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakamura and Chiba, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poss, 2007</xref>). Because the signals that control fetal and early neonatal cardiomyocyte replication and the subsequent postnatal withdrawal from cell cycle are unclear, we explored whether Notch reactivation might trigger and sustain the cell cycle of neonatal dividing and quiescent cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Binding to the transmembrane Delta or Jagged ligands on a signaling cell triggers a &#x003b3;-secretase&#x02013;dependent proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane Notch receptors on the responding cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schweisguth, 2004</xref>). Cleavage releases the Notch intracellular domain (ICD) that complexes with the transcription factor recombination signal-binding protein 1 for J&#x003ba; (RBP-J&#x003ba;; also known as CSL [CBF1, Su(H), LAG-1]) to activate transcription of downstream targets. In addition to this canonical cascade, RBP-J&#x003ba;&#x02013;independent signaling has recently been demonstrated to occur through various intermediaries, including the Dishevelled (Dsh) protein required for Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bush et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ramain et al., 2001</xref>). Despite its involvement in tumorigenesis and tissue morphogenesis, details of the mechanisms that might link Notch signaling to cell cycle control are unclear, although the complex containing the Notch ICD and RBP-J&#x003ba; directly activates transcription of the cyclin D1 gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ronchini and Capobianco, 2001</xref>).</p><p>We found that activation of the Notch pathway in mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived and early neonatal cardiomyocytes induced cyclin D expression and stimulated cell cycle entry, mitosis, and cell division. Cell cycle progression involved the RBP-J&#x003ba;&#x02013;dependent induction of cyclin D1, which led to its cytosolic accumulation. Translocation to the nucleus, retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation, and cell cycle entry, however, specifically required the Notch ICD. This constitutes a novel function for the ICD that might account for aspects of RBP-J&#x003ba;&#x02013;independent signaling that have been implicated recently in tumorigenesis (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leong and Karsan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miele et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, N2<sub>ICD</sub> induced older cardiomyocytes to enter cell cycle; however, DNA damage checkpoint activation and G<sub>2</sub>/M interphase arrest followed, most likely reflecting an intrinsic barrier to replication of mature cardiomyocytes that might serve a beneficial role in the mature heart by preventing mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis in response to mitogenic stimuli. Together, these results point to a role for Notch in the expansion of cardiomyocyte progenitor or precursor pools needed for heart growth during development and potentially during regeneration after injury in the adult.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Notch induces quiescent cardiomyocytes to reenter the cell cycle</title><p>Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCs) normally exit the cell cycle and enter G<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 1999</xref>), but infection with a recombinant adenovirus encoding the N2<sub>ICD</sub> (Ad-N2<sub>ICD</sub>) dramatically changed the cell cycle profile of cardiomyocytes, increasing the percentage of NRVCs in S/G<sub>2</sub>/M phase 2.4-fold 48 h after infection (which corresponds to postnatal day 5 [P5]; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A, C, and D</xref>).

As expected, aphidicolin, which blocks cells at the G<sub>1</sub>/S interphase, reduced the percentage of Ad-N2<sub>ICD</sub>&#x02013;expressing NRVCs that had progressed into S, G<sub>2</sub>, or M phases of the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>), confirming entry into S phase. Nocodazole interferes with microtubules and causes cells to arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>/M interphase. Importantly, nocodazole did not alter the percentage of cardiomyocytes in S/G<sub>2</sub>/M phase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>), which is suggestive of the fact that cells were already arrested at this point. To test this idea, the nocodazole was washed out during the last 12 h of culture. Normally, cycling cells resume progression after removal of nocodazole; however, this had no effect on the P5 NRVCs, which indicates that they were likely arrested at or before G<sub>2</sub>/M. In contrast, the residual noncardiomyocytes (MF20<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells) in the preparations arrested at G<sub>2</sub>/M upon nocodazole treatment and were released by its removal (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>), which demonstrates that the Notch-induced block was specific to the cardiomyocytes in the cell preparation.</p><p>AuroraB directly phosphorylates Ser<sub>10</sub> of His3.

A blockade at the level of AuroraB confirmed the G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest and suggested activation of the DNA damage checkpoint.</p><p>Caffeine effectively overrides DNA damage G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint activation and can permit entry of arrested cells into M phase by inhibiting the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad-3 related (ATR) kinases, and most likely other DNA checkpoint components (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kastan et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarkaria et al., 1999</xref>). Entry into M phase in the presence of caffeine is therefore diagnostic of checkpoint activation. Caffeine treatment alone did not increase the level of phospho-Ser<sub>10</sub>-His3 in uninfected P5 NRVCs and in fact caused a minor reduction (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A&#x02013;E</xref>). In contrast, N2<sub>ICD</sub> increased the number of phospho-His3&#x0002b; NRVCs by 3.5-fold. Overriding checkpoint activation pushed cells into mitosis and resulted in cell death, visualized by an 87-fold increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, I and J</xref>), which is consistent with induction of programmed cell death when the checkpoint is overridden in cells with DNA replication defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belka, 2006</xref>).

Moreover, fusion to a nuclear localization sequence that targeted cyclin D1 to the nucleus was sufficient to induce Rb phosphorylation and cell cycle reentry of quiescent NRVCs.</p><p>The localization of cyclin D1 to the nucleus probably occurs as a balance between import, for which the mechanism is poorly understood, and regulated export of phospho&#x02013;Thr<sub>286</sub>&#x02013;cyclin D1 through the transporter CRM1 into the cytosol, where it is degraded by the proteosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diehl et al., 1998</xref>). Two lines of evidence indicate that N2<sub>ICD</sub> acts upstream of export: first, we noted a superaccumulation of cyclin D1 in the presence of N2<sub>ICD</sub> and LMB, which inhibits CRM1-mediated export, indicating that N2<sub>ICD</sub> acts upstream of CRM1. Second, N2<sub>ICD</sub> did not modulate GSK3&#x003b2; activity nor reduce the levels of phospho&#x02013;Thr<sub>286</sub>&#x02013;cyclin D1, as did BIO. Thus, inhibition of export seems unlikely to be responsible for N2<sub>ICD</sub>-directed nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1, and we favor the model in which N2<sub>ICD</sub> regulates import. In contrast, BIO itself is sufficient to promote cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tseng et al., 2006</xref>), and we propose that inhibition of cyclin D1 Thr<sub>286</sub> phosphorylation, leading to protein stabilization and nuclear localization, is the likely mechanism.</p><p>How might the Notch ICD promote nuclear translocation? We did not detect a physical interaction between N2<sub>ICD</sub> and cyclin D1, Cdk4, or Cdk6 by coimmunoprecipitation from NRVCs (unpublished data). Moreover, the spatially localized immunostaining pattern of cyclin D1 within the nucleus differed from the diffuse pattern seen for N2<sub>ICD</sub> or its V5 epitope tag; thus, Notch might not participate directly in a cyclin D complex. In terminally differentiated neurons, cyclin D1 becomes cytoplasmic, and forced expression of p21<sup>WAF1</sup> (Cip1) induces nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sumrejkanchanakij et al., 2003</xref>), so one possibility is that Notch modulates the interaction of cyclin D1 with proteins such as p21. Little is known about the mechanism that keeps cyclin D1 from entering the nuclei of terminally differentiated cells, but activated Notch is seen in several tumors, such as breast, colon, and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Es et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stylianou et al., 2006</xref>), and it will be interesting to evaluate whether it controls cyclin D1 trafficking in cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Progression through the cell cycle: implications of the neonatal decline in mitotic response to Notch</title><p>Between days 4 and 7 after birth, NRVCs lose most of their ability to respond to exogenous Notch, first because of the decline in Notch 1 and Notch 2 receptors (unpublished data; Collesi et al., 2008) but also because of a pronounced activation of DNA damage checkpoint in response to activated Notch (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).

Although the phenotypes caused by systemic deletions of Notch signaling components are consistent with such a model, the cardiac defects are likely to also be caused by secondary consequences of the loss of Notch, such as in the endocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grego-Bessa et al., 2007</xref>). All 3D-type cyclins are present in the developing heart, and, interestingly, the triple knockout mouse exhibited severely hypoplastic ventricular myocardium and died by embryonic day 16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kozar et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we speculate that myocyte-autonomous Notch&#x02013;cyclin D interactions might underlie ventricular growth. Myocardial conditional knockouts of RBP-J<sub>k</sub> and Notch2 using appropriate Cre lines are being analyzed to address this issue.</p><p>An important implication of this study is that Notch might play a similar role after myocardial injury by sustaining proliferation of a committed precursor or progenitor pool, although the origin and prevalence of such cells remains unclear (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsieh et al., 2007</xref>) and a direct role for Notch remains to be tested. Regeneration of the adult zebrafish heart is preceded by Notch reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raya et al., 2003</xref>). The zebrafish Notch isoform characterized as being involved, Notch1b, is expressed by endothelial cells of the endocardium rather than by the myocardium, and, therefore, would be expected to influence cardiomyocyte regeneration only indirectly. Thus, whether Notch signaling exerts a cell-autonomous effect in regenerating cardiomyocytes needs to be resolved using appropriate transgenic models and development of specific agonists to stimulate such cells in situ.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated with a neonatal rat/mouse cardiomyocyte isolation kit (Cellutron) and cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in humidified air with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
