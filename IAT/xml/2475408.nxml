Allele frequency in control (T- or Z-score &#x0003e;-1.0) and osteoporotic (T- or Z-scores &#x0003c;-2.5) groups were compared using Chi squared tests. No differences were found between the 2 groups with either of the polymorphisms. When allele frequency was compared in patients with and without history of fracture, no differences were found in the frequency of the COL1A1 alleles. However there were significantly more fracture patients, who had been previously treated with corticosteroids for other conditions, carrying the T allele of the VDR polymorphism (X2 = 5.65, p&#x0003e;0.01&#x0003c;0.02). In conclusion, neither of these polymorphisms aid in the prediction of osteoporosis but the VDRT allele may carry an increased fracture risk in patients who require corticosteroid treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00006-0029.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="26" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00006-0030.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="27" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00006-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="28" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00006-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="29" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00006-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="30" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00006-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="31" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00006-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="32" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00006-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="33" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
