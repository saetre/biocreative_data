Evidence suggests that relaxin-3, a recently discovered member of the insulin superfamily, is an orexigenic hypothalamic neuropeptide. Relaxin-3 is thought to act in the brain via the RXFP3 receptor, although the RXFP1 receptor may also play a role. Relaxin-3, RXFP3, and RXFP1 are present in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, an area with a well-characterized role in the regulation of energy balance that also modulates reproductive function by providing inputs to hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Other members of the relaxin family are known to play a role in the regulation of reproduction. However, the effects of relaxin-3 on reproductive function are unknown. We studied the role of relaxin-3 in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Intracerebroventricular (5 nmol) and intraparaventricular (540&#x02013;1,620 pmol) administration of human relaxin-3 (H3) in adult male Wistar rats significantly increased plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) 30 min postinjection. This effect was blocked by pretreatment with a peripheral GnRH antagonist. Central administration of human relaxin-2 showed no significant effect on plasma LH. H3 dose-dependently stimulated the release of GnRH from hypothalamic explants and GT<sub>1</sub>-7 cells, which express RXFP1 and RXFP3, but did not influence LH or follicle-stimulating hormone release from pituitary fragments in vitro. We have demonstrated a novel role for relaxin-3 in the stimulation of the HPG axis, putatively via hypothalamic GnRH neurons. Relaxin-3 may act as a central signal linking nutritional status and reproductive function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RXFP3</kwd><kwd>RXFP1</kwd><kwd>paraventricular nucleus</kwd><kwd>gonadotropin-releasing hormone</kwd><kwd>gonadotropins</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

GnRH neurones are situated in the rostral hypothalamus and medial preoptic area (MPOA), as well as the basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>). Primary afferents to GnRH neurons are located predominantly in periventricular areas of the hypothalamus, including the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and paraventricular (PVN) nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>). Several hypothalamic neuropeptides and their receptors are present in these nuclei, including the most recently characterized member of the insulin superfamily, relaxin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>).</p><p>Before the discovery of the relaxin (RLN)-3 gene and its peptide, only one other relaxin gene, RLN1, had been characterized in most species. However, in humans and higher primates, two separate genes, RLN1 and RLN2, had been identified encoding for relaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). &#x0005b;The human gene product of RLN2, human relaxin-2 (H2), is the functional ortholog of the RLN1 gene in other mammals&#x0005d;. Relaxin has been classically associated with female reproductive physiology, although it is also known to have marked effects on water intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>). In contrast, the physiological role of relaxin-3 remains unclear. However, evidence suggests it may play a role in appetite control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Unlike relaxin, relaxin-3 is highly homologous across species. It is expressed at greatest levels in the central nervous system, and expression is localized to a distinct area called the nucleus incertus (NI), situated in the caudoventral region of the pontine periventricular gray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). Anatomical studies suggest that this nucleus is involved in a midbrain behavior control network that influences circuits regulating locomotion, attention, and learning processes and that responds to stress-related neuroendocrine signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Tracing studies have shown that the neurons of the NI project extensively to hypothalamic areas, including the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, and the medial and periventricular zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Relaxin-3 immunoreactivity has been described in hypothalamic areas important in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, including the PVN, ARC, MPOA, and lateral preoptic area (LPOA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). Thus, although the NI itself has not been implicated in reproduction or feeding, relaxin-3 immunoreactive fibers project from this area to hypothalamic areas of the brain with well-characterized roles in the regulation of appetite and reproduction. Interestingly, relaxin-3 has also been shown to be expressed peripherally in the mouse by RT-PCR, in tissues including the testis, ovary, thymus, lung, and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). Peripheral expression of relaxin-3 mRNA has been detected by RT-PCR in human and rat testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>), reinforcing a potential peripheral role in reproduction. However, Northern blotting has indicated that the primary site of expression in the mouse is the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>).</p><p>Unlike insulin, which signals via tyrosine kinase receptors, relaxin peptides signal via G protein-coupled receptors to modulate intracellular cAMP. Relaxin binds with high affinity to two leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors, RXFP1 (formerly known as LGR7) and RXFP2 (formerly known as LGR8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Both of these receptors are expressed in the brain, in addition to the testis and other peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). Relaxin-3 binds to RXFP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>) and inhibits cAMP production, but it also binds and activates RXFP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>) and RXFP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>), a receptor that is not expressed in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>) but does contribute to relaxin-3 binding in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>). RXFP1 and RXFP3 are both expressed within the rat hypothalamus, particularly in the PVN and supraoptic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>).</p><p>Because relaxin-3 immunoreactive fibers and relaxin-3 receptors are present in areas where GnRH neurons are present and/or primary afferents to GnRH neurons are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>), we hypothesized that relaxin-3 may play a role in the control of the HPG axis. The aims of these current studies were threefold. First, we sought to investigate the effects of central administration of relaxin-3 on circulating gonadotropins and total testosterone in male rats following administration of relaxin-3 in the third cerebral ventricle and injection in the PVN, an area rich in relaxin-3 immunoreactivity, relaxin-3 receptors, and afferents to GnRH neurons.

Finally, we sought to investigate the possibility of a direct effect of relaxin-3 on GnRH neurons in vitro by examining relaxin-3 receptor expression and the actions of relaxin-3 on GT<sub>1</sub>-7 cells.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Human relaxin-3 (H3; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA, and the Howard Florey Institute, Melbourne, Australia) was synthesized using solid-phase synthesis.

With the use of these primers, amplified fragments of 385 bp for RXFP1, 385 bp for RXFP3, and 440 bp for RXFP4 would be expected.

A large number of peripheral hormones that alter food intake, including leptin, ghrelin, and peptide Y 3&#x02013;36 (PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub>), have been shown to play a role in the control of the reproductive axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). Central regulators of appetite, including neuropeptide Y (NPY), the orexins, and galanin-like peptide, can also modulate the HPG axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). However, the regulation of, and interactions between, energy status and reproductive function are not yet fully understood.</p><p>We have previously shown that central administration of H3 increases food intake in rats and modulates the HPG axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). These studies also demonstrated that central H3 injection increases plasma LH, an effect that is blocked by administration of a peripheral GnRH antagonist. Relaxin-3 immunoreactivity is found at high concentration in the PVN, and RXFP3 receptors are also present here. Although the PVN is considered important in the regulation of energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>), it is not traditionally associated with a role in reproduction. However, recent studies have shown that intraparaventricular injections of the neuropeptide kisspeptin, a potent central and peripheral stimulator of the HPG axis, increase LH and testosterone levels in male adult rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). Primary afferents to GnRH neurons are located in the PVN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>), suggesting this nucleus may play a role in coordinating reproductive responses to altered energy balance. This evidence, together with the presence of relaxin-3 immunoreactivity and relaxin-3 receptors in the PVN, prompted us to investigate the role of intraparaventricular H3 on the HPG axis. A single intraparaventricular injection of H3 stimulated the HPG axis, reinforcing the suggestion that the PVN may be important in providing inputs to GnRH neurons. The effects of intraparaventricular H3 on LH release in adult male rats were dose dependent, with an intranuclear dose of 540 pmol of H3 being required to elicit a significant response at 30 min postinjection. Following intracerebroventricular H3 administration, total plasma testosterone rose, mirroring changes in circulating LH concentrations, although these changes did not reach statistical significance. Because changes in plasma testosterone levels are downstream from changes in plasma LH, a later time point, e.g., 60 min following central administration of relaxin-3, may have shown a significant increase in plasma testosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>). There was no effect on circulating FSH with intracerebroventricular or intraparaventricular administration of H3 at 30 min at all doses of peptide. Changes in the GnRH pulse pattern can independently affect the synthesis and release of LH and FSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). Many central stimulators of the HPG axis have a lesser effect on circulating FSH levels relative to changes in LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>). In addition, stimulatory effects on FSH release often occur later than those on LH release, and a later time point may have revealed an effect of relaxin-3 on FSH levels. Further studies are required to investigate whether the differential effects of H3 administration on LH and FSH release reflect a physiological or pharmacological effect.</p><p>We hypothesized that relaxin-3 stimulates the reproductive axis via modulation of hypothalamic GnRH pathways. In accord with this hypothesis, preadministration of a peripheral GnRH antagonist abolished the increase in circulating concentrations of LH induced by intracerebroventricular or intraparaventricular injection of H3 in adult male rats. Our in vitro studies also support this hypothesis. H3 dose dependently stimulated the release of GnRH from in vitro hypothalamic explants, appearing to reach a maximal effect at 100 nM relaxin-3. This effect may represent an indirect stimulation of GnRH release by relaxin-3 via afferent neurons in the PVN and ARC where relaxin-3 immunoreactivity is present. However, H3 also stimulated the release of GnRH from the hypothalamic cell line, GT<sub>1</sub>-7, in a dose-dependent manner, and the relaxin receptors, RXFP1 and RXFP3, are expressed on GT1-7 cells. It is therefore possible that the stimulatory effects of relaxin-3 on GnRH release are partly via a direct effect on GnRH neurons. This is in accord with reports of relaxin-3 immunoreactivity in the MPOA. However, further studies, such as dual immunohistochemistry (IHC)/in situ hybridization (ISH) for GnRH and relaxin receptors, are required to further investigate the possibility of a direct effect of relaxin-3 on GnRH neurons. Current commercially available RXFP3 antibodies have limited utility for IHC, suggesting that dual ISH may be the more useful technique.</p><p>GnRH neurones are not located in a single hypothalamic nucleus but are dispersed throughout the anterior hypothalamic area. In rodents, the vast majority of GnRH is produced by a small and diffuse population of neurons located in the MPOA, medial septum, and diagonal band of Broca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). Within the hypothalamus, primary afferents to GnRH neurons are located in areas that include the PVN, ARC, LHA, dorsomedial hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, LPOA, and MPOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>), areas where relaxin-3 immunoreactivity is also present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). In addition, RXFP1 and RXFP3 receptors are both present in several hypothalamic nuclei, including the supraoptic nucleus and the PVN, and RXFP1 receptors are also expressed in the ARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>). Relaxin-3 neurons and receptors may be strategically placed as part of the complex local intrahypothalamic circuitry providing information to GnRH neurons about nutritional and reproductive status. Further research is required to define the roles of specific populations of relaxin-3 immunoreactive and relaxin-3 responsive neurons. It would be interesting to assess in future whether hypothalamic nuclei other than the PVN may also be involved in stimulation of the HPG axis. For example, the anterior preoptic area is rich in both GnRH neurons and relaxin-3 immunoreactivity.</p><p>Expression of RXFP3 in the pituitary has been demonstrated by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). RXFP1 has been shown to be expressed in the pituitary glands of pregnant mice, but not in those of male or nonpregnant female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). In our studies, relaxin-3 had no effect on the release of LH or FSH from anterior pituitary fragments harvested from male rats, suggesting that relaxin-3 is unlikely to mediate its effect on the HPG axis via the anterior pituitary.</p><p>In contrast to H3, equimolar doses of H2 (5 nmol icv and 540 pmol iPVN), the human ortholog of relaxin, did not result in a statistically significant rise in LH at 30 min in adult male rats following intracerebroventricular or intraparaventricular administration. H2 and H3 bind to the RXFP1 receptor with high affinity, but only H3 binds to RXFP3, which suggests that the effects of relaxin-3 on the HPG axis may be mediated via RXFP3. However, in all experiments, H2 resulted in a nonsignificant increase in LH and testosterone levels. Actions at the RXFP1 receptor therefore cannot be excluded, and it is possible that higher doses of H2 may significantly stimulate the HPG axis. In addition, GT<sub>1</sub>-7 cells express both RXFP1 and RXPF3, making it difficult to determine which receptor is responsible for mediating the relaxin-3-induced release of GnRH. Further studies requiring as yet unavailable specific relaxin receptor agonists and antagonists will be necessary to determine the receptor system or systems that mediate the effects of the relaxins on the HPG axis.</p><p>It has long been recognized that regulation of appetite and reproduction is tightly linked, but the neuroendocrine networks responsible for this are only now being defined. Together with important peripheral factors such as leptin, ghrelin, and PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>), there are a growing number of central neuropeptides that have been found to exert an effect on both reproduction and energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). Classically, neuropeptides that stimulate appetite suppress the HPG axis and vice versa, although the pathways mediating the interaction between energy stores and fertility have yet to be fully delineated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). Intracerebroventricular administration of a RXFP3 receptor antagonist to satiated rats decreases food intake induced by a RXFP3 agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>), but further experiments are required to show that relaxin-3 plays a physiological role in the regulation of food intake. To date, no changes in the expression of relaxin-3 mRNA or its receptors in satiated and starved animals have been reported. If relaxin-3 plays a physiological role as an anorexigenic peptide in controlling appetite, one might expect increased relaxin-3 expression in the brain stem during food restriction and decreased expression in the satiated state. Our previous studies have shown that exogenous H3 treatment is effective at increasing food intake in both satiated and nonsatiated rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>), and one might postulate that relaxin-3 would also be effective at increasing LH in both states. However, food restriction might increase endogenous relaxin-3, and, in addition, the GnRH pulse generator is extremely sensitive to energetic stress. GnRH pulses are readily suppressed by starvation, extreme temperatures, or excessive exercise, and GnRH pulsatility returns rapidly when the energetic challenge is alleviated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). It is possible that exogenous relaxin-3 might be ineffective at increasing LH in food-restricted animals, and it would be interesting to study this effect in starved animals.</p><p>In addition, a number of neuropeptides have been shown to exert differential effects on the HPG axis depending on the steroid milieu. For example, intracerebroventricular administration of the potent orexigenic peptide NPY can stimulate LH release in sex-steroid primed ovariectomized (OVX) rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>) but produces a striking inhibition of LH release in OVX rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). Chronic intracerebroventricular infusions of NPY also lead to a profound inhibition of the gonadotrophic axis in intact male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). Orexins, which increase food intake and energy expenditure, have been shown to have a dual response similar to that of NPY by stimulating LH secretion in OVX steroid-primed rats and inhibiting LH secretion in unprimed OVX rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). This ovarian steroid-dependent bimodal LH response is also shown in response to the anorexigenic peptide neuromedin S, which increases LH in cycling rat females but decreases LH levels in OVX rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>) (this latter response also being demonstrated by the structurally related peptide, neuromedin U) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). It would be interesting to determine if the actions of relaxin-3 on LH are dependent on the ovarian/testicular steroid environment and whether relaxin-3 displays a dual action in the regulation of the HPG axis. The data presented here suggest that relaxin-3 may belong to a growing group of hypothalamic peptides that neurochemically bridge the regulatory networks controlling reproduction and energy balance.</p><p>In summary, we have investigated the effects of relaxin-3 on the HPG axis. Both intracerebroventricular and intraparaventricular administration of relaxin-3 increases plasma LH, and this effect is blocked by administration of a GnRH antagonist, suggesting that it is mediated via an effect on hypothalamic GnRH neurons. In accord with these results, relaxin-3 stimulates the release of GnRH from hypothalamic explants but has no effect on LH or FSH release from pituitary fragments. Stimulation of GnRH release from GT<sub>1</sub>-7 cells suggests that relaxin-3 may be able to stimulate GnRH neurons directly, and both RXFP1 and RXFP3 receptors are detectable from GT<sub>1</sub>-7 cell RNA by RT-PCR. The effects of relaxin-3 on the HPG axis seem likely to be mediated via RXFP3, but actions via RXFP1 cannot be excluded. We have therefore demonstrated a novel role for relaxin-3 in the regulation of the HPG axis in the adult male rat. Relaxin-3 may play a role in coordinating feeding and reproductive responses to alterations in energy balance. Further studies are required to define the physiological importance of relaxin-3 in the regulation of reproduction.</p></sec><sec><title>GRANTS</title><p>The department is funded by program grants from the Medical Research Council (MRC) (G7811974) and Wellcome Trust (072643/Z/03/Z) and by European Union FP6 Integrated Project Grant LSHM-CT-2003-503041.
