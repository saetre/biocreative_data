The reductionist approach attempts to explain the behavior of such circuits in terms of the behavior of the components. Despite many molecular components of biological organisms being identified and characterized using genetic and biochemical techniques, it is still not possible to predict system behavior except in the simplest systems. Synthetic biology provides an alternative to the study of naturally occurring systems. By constructing increasingly complex analogs of natural circuits, synthetic biology attempts to test sufficiency of mechanistic models and gain insights that observation and analysis alone do not provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Benner and Sismour, 2005</xref>). Several synthetic networks constructed by rearranging regulatory components in a cell have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Elowitz and Leibler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gardner <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Becskei <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Atkinson <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). For this type of network design to lead to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks, detailed studies of the synthetic systems are needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Benner and Sismour, 2005</xref>), for example, through a systematic examination of the effects of parameter variations with quantitative modeling and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Ozbudak <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, this approach can be difficult because there are unknown and uncontrollable parameters in synthetic circuits within cells.</p><p>An <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstruction with known components offers a unique opportunity to investigate how system behavior derives from reaction mechanisms. The first nontrivial system behavior created by an <italic>in vitro</italic> chemical system was the Belousov-Zhabotinsky oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Zaikin and Zhabotinsky, 1970</xref>), but it is difficult to see how these reaction mechanisms could support a wide variety of chemical logic, as is found in biochemistry. An excellent example of <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstruction using biochemical components is the cyanobacterial circadian clock, the operation of which has been shown to be independent of transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Nakajima <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, operating and characterizing biochemical circuits outside the cell remains a challenge. A reconstituted cell-free transcription-translation system requires almost one hundred purified components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Shimizu <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) or poorly characterized cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Noireaux <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). A variety of interesting circuits can be constructed within cell-free transcription&#x02013;translation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Noireaux <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Isalan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), but they have not yet resulted in quantitative models. Feedback circuits modeled after predator&#x02013;prey dynamics have also been constructed as a much simpler <italic>in vitro</italic> system containing only three enzymes, T7 RNA polymerase, M-MLV reverse transcriptase, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Wlotzka and McCaskill, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ackermann <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), but quantitative agreement of models and experiments was not achieved, and it is unclear how to construct more complex circuits using this approach.</p><p>In order to investigate a wide range of possible circuits using a small selection of known components, we developed an experimental analog of genetic regulatory circuits that makes use of only T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) and <italic>E. coli</italic> ribonuclease H (RNase H) in addition to synthetic DNA templates regulated by RNA transcripts. This system meets our goal of dramatically reducing the chemical complexity by removing the irrelevant genes and regulatory processes of the whole organism, which includes removing protein production and degradation machinery. Moreover, nucleic acid regulatory molecules have the advantage that the structures are well defined and that interactions governed by Watson&#x02013;Crick base-pairing rules can be easily programmed, allowing for modular designs. Despite the simplicity of our system compared to previous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Noireaux <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Isalan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) that use protein signals, we have shown theoretically that arbitrary logic circuits and abstract neural network computations can be implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The weights and thresholds of corresponding neural networks are represented by continuously adjustable concentrations of DNA molecules in the <italic>in vitro</italic> circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). In previous formal models that treat genetic regulatory circuits as neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Mjolsness <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Buchler <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), thresholds are encoded as binding constants of regulatory proteins and therefore tuning the circuit requires modifying protein structure through natural or directed evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Yokobayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). There is, in fact, a growing appreciation of the diversity of roles that nucleic acids can play in regulating cell function; for instance, diverse <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> gene regulation by noncoding RNA molecules such as microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Carrington and Ambros, 2003</xref>) and antisense RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kramer <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) have been characterized in natural organisms and engineered RNA regulatory molecules have been used for control of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Isaacs <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bayer and Smolke, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we address the following questions using an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcriptional network. First, we ask whether crisp regulation of transcription can be achieved with nucleic acid regulatory molecules. We demonstrate a design for switches and feedforward circuits that exhibit sigmoidal transfer curves with sharp and adjustable thresholds. The threshold is established by a competitive hybridization mechanism analogous to the &#x02018;inhibitor ultrasensitivity' mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Ferrell, 1996</xref>). Second, we demonstrate that our synthetic switches are modular and programmable. To this end, we construct a mutually inhibitory feedback circuit by linking two previously characterized switches. The mutually inhibitory circuit shows bistability, as expected based on the transfer curves of the feedforward circuits. Third, we achieve dynamic behavior and steady-states in our <italic>in vitro</italic> circuit by balancing enzyme-controlled production and degradation mechanisms. This contrasts with many previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Atkinson <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Rosenfeld <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) that treat degradation and dilution of signal molecules (as occurs in exponentially growing cells and in chemostats) as a first-order process. We find that without dilution, degradation by RNase H helps establish steady-state switch activities in feedforward circuits and allows reactivation of switches in feedback circuits. However, circuits often accumulate RNA transcripts and non-degradable intermediates. Achieving steady-state RNA signal levels, with complete clean-up of RNA signals to single nucleotides, would require additional RNases with different substrate specificities. Surprisingly, the saturation of RNase degradation capacity is an important determinant of multistability in our mutually inhibitory circuit. Finally, as a test of our understanding of reaction mechanisms, we present a simple mathematical model to explain various aspects of the circuit behavior (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). This model reproduces the transfer curves for individual switches, the bifurcation diagram for the bistable circuit, and the phase plane dynamics for the bistable circuit with a single parameter set.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>The synthetic DNA template design is modular with easily programmable connectivity dictated by Watson&#x02013;Crick base-pairing rules. The regulatory domain is upstream of the promoter region; the output domain is downstream of the promoter region. This separation of domains allows us to design DNA templates that have any desired connectivity. Regulated DNA templates are called switches (&#x02018;Sw'), whereas unregulated DNA templates are called sources (&#x02018;So'). A switch can assume two different conformations with different transcription efficiency: ON or OFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The OFF state of the switch consists of a double-stranded DNA template (&#x02018;T') with a partially single-stranded (ss) and thus incomplete promoter region. Similar templates are known to transcribe poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Martin and Coleman, 1987</xref>). The switch is turned on by the addition of an ssDNA activator (&#x02018;A') that completes the promoter region. Templates with nicked promoters (&#x02018;T&#x000b7;A') have been found to transcribe well, approximately half as efficiently as fully double-stranded sources (data not shown, also cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). The activator contains a &#x02018;toehold', a single-stranded overhang beyond the helical domain it forms with the DNA template, where an inhibitor can bind to initiate a toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Yurke and Mills, 2003</xref>). Thus, the switch can be turned off upon addition of an inhibitor strand (either ssRNA, &#x02018;I', or ssDNA, &#x02018;dI'). An ON state source template has a complete promoter sequence with a nick and an OFF-state source template is missing five bases of the promoter sequence on the template side. Source templates do not interact with activators, due to the hairpin stem permanently covering the branch migration sequence, and therefore maintain their transcription efficiency in the presence of inhibitors. Due to the identical structures in the promoter region (17 bases colored blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>), an ON or OFF source has the same transcription speed as an ON or OFF switch with less than 10&#x00025; deviation (data not shown). In a typical reaction network, the RNA inhibitor strands will be produced by RNAP from upstream templates using NTP as fuel and will be degraded by RNase H.</p><p>An important goal for our circuits is to obtain switches with an ultrasensitive response, that is, a sharp threshold. Several alternative mechanisms can give rise to the ultrasensitive response in biological circuits, for example, cooperative binding of regulatory proteins and multistep phosphorylation of target protein by kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Ferrell, 1996</xref>). We use competitive binding of nucleic acid species rather than cooperative binding to achieve ultrasensitivity. Our approach is closely related to &#x02018;inhibitor ultrasensitivity', where a stoichiometric inhibitor to the activating enzyme is used. Similar mechanisms have been suggested for regulation of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Thron, 1994</xref>) and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Voigt <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The threshold in our transcriptional circuit derives from three types of strong DNA and RNA hybridization reactions (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>), which we call activation, annihilation, and inhibition. An activator binds to an OFF switch template to turn the switch on (activation); an activator binds to an inhibitor and is not available for the switch template (annihilation); an inhibitor displaces an activator from an ON switch template, the T&#x000b7;A complex, to turn the switch off (inhibition). The key requirements for the inhibition mechanism are that the activator-inhibitor binding is thermodynamically more favorable than the template-activator binding, and that there is a fast kinetic pathway to the lowest energy state (in our case, toehold-mediated strand displacement by branch migration; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Yurke and Mills, 2003</xref>). Since the activator and inhibitor annihilate each other, the difference of total activator and inhibitor concentrations is the most important determinant of the state of switch: an excess of inhibitor will turn the switch off while an excess of activator will turn the switch on. All three mechanisms are needed for fast switch response.</p><p>Sequences of the synthetic DNA templates were chosen to minimize alternative folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Flamm <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) and spurious interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Seeman, 1982</xref>). Various domain lengths have been experimentally tested for functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>); for example, the binding domains of an OFF switch template to an activator (27 bases) and of an activator to an inhibitor (35 bases) are long enough to ensure the activation and annihilation mechanisms, while the toehold of an activator (8 bases) is long enough to facilitate the inhibition mechanism without being so long as to reduce ON-state transcription efficiency (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>). The 3&#x02032;-end hairpin structure (16 bases) increases copy number and also decreases self-coded extension of RNA transcripts by RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Triana-Alonso <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). An OFF switch template has only five bases missing in the promoter region, which permits leaky expression. However, increasing the extent of activator binding to the promoter domain can cause a spurious binding between non-matching activator and template pairs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>). The specific, strong, and repeatable hybridization of template&#x02013;activator pairs and activator&#x02013;inhibitor pairs has been confirmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the proposed hybridization mechanism leads to a sharp threshold, the transfer curves of individual switches were measured with the total concentration of DNA inhibitors as inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). For the total concentration of certain species, we consider both isolated species and complexes containing that species. Thus, for the DNA inhibitor, &#x0005b;dI<sup>tot</sup>&#x0005d;&#x0003d;&#x0005b;dI&#x0005d;&#x0002b;&#x0005b;dI&#x000b7;A&#x0005d;. The DNA inhibitor is a permanent input signal because it is not degraded by RNase H. The switch activity, defined as the concentration of ON switch template, &#x0005b;T&#x000b7;A&#x0005d;, can be measured in real-time using fluorescence: the OFF switch template T is labeled with a fluorophore and the activator A is labeled with a quencher such that the fluorescence of the OFF switch T is high but the fluorescence of the ON switch T&#x000b7;A is low due to fluorescence quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Marras <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The time course of Sw<sub>21</sub> inhibited by DNA inhibitor dI<sub>1</sub> with 1 &#x003bc;M activator A<sub>1</sub> is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). The fluorescence signal is stable in the presence of enzymes. When the DNA inhibitor dI<sub>1</sub> input is less than 0.9 &#x003bc;M, the fluorescence signal remains low. On the other hand, the fluorescence signal quickly reaches its maximal value upon addition of more than 1 &#x003bc;M dI<sub>1</sub> input. The transfer curves were constructed by normalizing the fluorescence signal to obtain the proportion of switches in the OFF state. We have shown that the correspondence of normalized fluorescence to the switch state is quantitative, as discussed below. The role of the activator as an adjustable threshold can be seen in the transfer curves of switch Sw<sub>21</sub>: the switching thresholds depend on the total concentration of activator A<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). To test programmability of our synthetic switch design, we swapped the input and output domains of switch Sw<sub>21</sub> to create the switch Sw<sub>12</sub>. The response of switch Sw<sub>12</sub> is similar to that of switch Sw<sub>21</sub>, flat at low and high levels of DNA inhibitor dI<sub>2</sub>, yet sensitive when the total concentration of DNA inhibitor dI<sub>2</sub> is close to the total concentration of activator A<sub>2</sub>, 1 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>This tunable sigmoidal curve has the piecewise-linear shape predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>), which uses a single parameter set for all model fitting results shown in this paper. To compare the sharpness of the transition achieved by our competitive inhibition mechanism with that of other biological mechanisms such as binding cooperativity, the transfer curves were also fit to the following Hill equation:</p><p><inline-graphic id="N0x8fb5428N0x98ef240" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb4100099-i1.jpg"/></p><p>where <italic>y</italic><sub>min</sub> is the minimum switch activity, <italic>y</italic><sub>max</sub> is the maximum switch activity, <italic>x</italic> is the total concentration of DNA inhibitor, <italic>n</italic> is the Hill coefficient, and <italic>K</italic> is the total concentration of DNA inhibitor required for half repression. The Hill coefficient for the switch Sw<sub>12</sub> transfer curve is 14.1, and those for the switch Sw<sub>21</sub> transfer curves are 18.6, 30.0, and 32.9, respectively. The transfer curve of the switch Sw<sub>12</sub> is not as sharp as the transfer curve of the switch Sw<sub>21</sub>, possibly due to an unexpected secondary structure in activator A<sub>2</sub> or in the single-stranded region of switch template T<sub>12</sub>, which could interfere with the binding of A<sub>2</sub> to T<sub>12</sub>. Nonetheless, the Hill coefficients are much higher than most biological repressors and are adjustable by changing the total concentration of activators. We can understand the change of Hill coefficients as follows: increasing total activator concentration increases the threshold, that is, <italic>K</italic>, yet the switching width (in terms of DNA inhibitor concentration change) remains constant because it depends on the total concentration of switch template (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). Consequently, the switching width becomes narrower relative to the threshold as we increase the threshold, resulting in a higher Hill coefficient, <italic>n</italic>. The change of sharpness is clear when the inputs are scaled by the half-repression points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>).</p><p>Next, to determine whether the switches also have a sharp threshold with actively maintained RNA input signals, the transfer curves of switch Sw<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> driven by an RNA inhibitor I<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Unlike DNA inhibitors that serve as permanent input signals, the RNA inhibitors are continuously being produced and degraded by the enzymes. This dynamic control of regulatory signals is necessary to achieve dynamic behavior within circuits where individual switches change their states in response to inputs and states of other switches. In our experiments, an upstream source So<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> is used to achieve a steady-state RNA inhibitor I<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> level and the source So<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> activity is controlled by preparing a mixture of ON and OFF source templates. We keep the total concentration of ON and OFF source templates the same, while tuning the source activity, to simulate the continuous tuning of an upstream switch activity. Note that when source template concentrations are sufficiently high, RNA inhibitor production by RNAP will exceed RNase H's capacity for degradation, and RNA inhibitor levels will increase without bound rather than achieve a steady state. In such cases, however, switch activity nonetheless approaches an asymptotic &#x02018;steady-state' value. An additional complicating factor is that over the course of several hours, both RNAP and RNase H activities decrease due to depletion of NTPs, change of buffer composition, and other effects, thus altering the instantaneous &#x02018;steady-state' level. In this paper, we use the term in this loose sense, acknowledging such effects.</p><p>The time course of Sw<sub>21</sub> inhibited by So<sub>1</sub> with 1 &#x003bc;M activator A<sub>1</sub> is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). Unlike the dI-triggered switch state changes, here the fluorescence signal changes do not occur immediately after enzyme addition because the production of RNA inhibitor I<sub>1</sub> takes time and inhibitor I<sub>1</sub> is mostly consumed by the free activator A<sub>1</sub> initially. For low source activities, no detectable fluorescence change ensued. As the source So<sub>1</sub> activity increases, the steady-state concentration of inhibitor I<sub>1</sub> increases and turns the switch Sw<sub>21</sub> off. As with the DNA input, thresholds are determined by the total concentration of activator; three thresholds were demonstrated for switch Sw<sub>21</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>). The transitions are not as sharp as with DNA inhibitors due to the constant turnover of RNA inhibitors by RNase H. This breakdown pathway of the activator&#x02013;inhibitor complex partially reverses the annihilation and inhibition mechanisms necessary to establish a sharp transition (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). The transfer curves were fit to the Hill equation (<xref rid="N0x8fb5428N0x98ef240">equation (1)</xref>) where <italic>x</italic> is the upstream source activity, and <italic>K</italic> is the upstream source activity required for half repression. The Hill coefficient for the switch Sw<sub>12</sub> transfer curve is 5.17, and those for the switch Sw<sub>21</sub> transfer curves are 3.09, 5.40, and 5.96, respectively. Although lower than for DNA inhibitors, the Hill coefficients are comparable to that of a two-stage synthetic biological repressor cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hooshangi <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The change of sharpness is clear when the inputs are scaled by the half-repression points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the fluorescence read-out reflects the actual molecular state of the system, gel-based experiments were performed for switch Sw<sub>21</sub> regulated by source So<sub>1</sub> with the total concentration of activator A<sub>1</sub> at 1 &#x003bc;M. In this experiment only, fluorophore-(rather than quencher-) labeled activators were used to allow identification in the gel. In the denaturing gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>), all DNA and RNA species migrate as single strands such that major bands can be identified based on length. We measured the total concentration of inhibitors (the sum of the concentration of isolated inhibitor, &#x0005b;I&#x0005d;, and the concentration of activator-inhibitor complex, &#x0005b;A&#x000b7;I&#x0005d;), as a function of source So<sub>1</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). In the nondenaturing gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>), the concentrations of activator&#x02013;inhibitor complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>) and the concentration of OFF switch template, &#x0005b;T<sub>21</sub>&#x0005d;, are measured as a function of source So<sub>1</sub> activity. For the total concentration of RNA inhibitor I<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> less than the total concentration of A<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, &#x0005b;A<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>I<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>&#x0005d; is the same as &#x0005b;I<sub><italic>j</italic></sub><sup>tot</sup>&#x0005d; because of the strong binding interactions of activator-inhibitor pairs. The switch states measured in the nondenaturing gel agree with the switch states measured by fluorescence quenching in the fluorometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed activator bands that migrate slower than free activators but faster than the activator&#x02013;inhibitor complexes in control lanes (bracket in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). We interpret this as activators binding to a mixture of incomplete inhibitors (abortive transcripts or incomplete degradation products; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>) shown as smearing less than 40 nucleotide long in the denaturing gel. We counted these bands as free activators and excluded incomplete inhibitor bands for our simple model. In the nondenaturing gel, we did not observe spurious binding complexes containing switch template T<sub>21</sub>, but a short-lived interaction might occur among the switch template, activators and incomplete inhibitors. From the gel data analysis, we could account for the concentrations of all the major species present in the system: &#x0005b;T&#x0005d;, &#x0005b;T&#x000b7;A&#x0005d;, &#x0005b;A&#x0005d;, &#x0005b;A&#x000b7;I&#x0005d;, and &#x0005b;I&#x0005d;. The gel data are consistent with switching behavior observed by fluorescence read-out and with the model fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).</p><p>We further constructed a mutually inhibitory circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom) where the switch Sw<sub>12</sub> and the switch Sw<sub>21</sub> inhibit each other. The behavior of the mutually inhibitory circuit can be understood in terms of the characterized feedforward circuits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>, top). For the moment, consider that the mutually inhibitory circuit is essentially a two-dimensional dynamical system where the two switch activities give a complete description of the state of system because other variables, the concentrations of activators, inhibitors, and the enzyme&#x02013;substrate complexes in Michaelis&#x02013;Menten enzyme reactions, relax to their steady-states much more rapidly. Then, the mutually inhibitory circuit behavior can be described as (d/d<italic>t</italic>)&#x0005b;T<sub>12</sub>A<sub>2</sub>&#x0005d;&#x0003d;<italic>f</italic>(&#x0005b;T<sub>21</sub>A<sub>1</sub>&#x0005d;) and (d/d<italic>t</italic>)&#x0005b;T<sub>21</sub>A<sub>1</sub>&#x0005d;&#x0003d;<italic>g</italic>(&#x0005b;T<sub>12</sub>A<sub>2</sub>&#x0005d;). We replace the input source So<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> activities in the transfer curves of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E and F</xref> with equivalent switch Sw<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> activities and interpret them as the nullclines of the mutually inhibitory circuit given by <italic>f</italic>(&#x0005b;T<sub>21</sub>A<sub>1</sub>&#x0005d;)&#x0003d;0 and <italic>g</italic>(&#x0005b;T<sub>12</sub>A<sub>2</sub>&#x0005d;)&#x0003d;0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). The sigmoidal shape of transfer curves results in three fixed points, two stable and one unstable, to the extent that the approximations are valid. Thus, we expect that the two mutually inhibiting switches will show bistability with two stable attractors.</p><p>Because activator concentrations set the switching thresholds, we systematically varied activator concentrations to probe the conditions for multistability and to test the robustness of our system to parameter variation. A convenient experimental way to probe for multistability is to subject the network to different initial conditions and explore whether the network gets locked in different stable expression states. We therefore started the reaction either in the presence of excess RNA inhibitor I<sub>1</sub> (switch Sw<sub>21</sub> OFF, switch Sw<sub>12</sub> ON) or in the presence of excess RNA inhibitor I<sub>2</sub> (switch Sw<sub>21</sub> ON, switch Sw<sub>12</sub> OFF), the expected stable attractors from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>. If the mutually inhibitory circuit is bistable, the steady-state switch activities are locked in different states depending on the initial RNA inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, right), while the switch activities converge irrespective of initial RNA inputs in the monostable parameter regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). A large region of activator parameter space displays persistent memory, bordered by monostable regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). In the latter cases, the switch Sw<sub>21</sub> activity (M2), switch Sw<sub>12</sub> activity (M1), or both switch activities (M0) were completely inhibited independent of the history. The activator concentrations can be shifted from the bistable regime to one of the monostable regimes (by way of adding DNA inhibitor dI<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> to eliminate activator A<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>) and back to the bistable regime (by way of adding activator A<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>). The circuit maintained the state acquired in the monostable parameter regime when returned to the bistable parameter regime (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>).</p><p>We singled out the case with both activators at 1 &#x003bc;M to probe detailed dynamics in the phase plane. By initiating the reaction with various amounts of externally supplied RNA inhibitors, we can reset the system to various locations in the phase plane. The amounts of RNA inhibitors determine the initial conditions yet do not determine multistability as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>. We chose a 15&#x00025; variation of RNA inhibitor concentrations spanning the high-gain region of switch. The dynamic responses of both switches are simultaneously shown as trajectories in the switch activity phase plane with arrows to indicate directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>) and as time courses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8A</xref>). Both switches start by inhibiting each other and the trajectories move towards the corner where both switches are OFF. In all 12 cases, one of the switches recovers its activity and stabilizes. Two initial conditions are highlighted, where a 5&#x00025; difference of RNA inhibitor I<sub>2</sub> concentrations leads trajectories to different stable attractors on opposite corners: (switch Sw<sub>21</sub> activity, switch Sw<sub>12</sub> activity)&#x0003d;(64 nM, 3 nM) and (4 nM, 63 nM). The experimental trajectories agree with the simulation results shown as trajectories in the switch activity phase plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>) and as time courses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8B</xref>). The location of two attractors (circles with crosses inside; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>), although not perfect, agrees with the location of attractors determined by the nullcline analysis (black circles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). Some experimental trajectories cross themselves and each other, and both experimental and simulation trajectories cross the separatrix for initial switch activity constructed from the model (blue line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>). This indicates that the state of dynamical system cannot be completely described by the switch activities alone and is influenced by unmeasured variables and possibly by unmodeled effects such as &#x02018;bursting' enzyme kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Jia and Patel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kuzmine and Martin, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, the model does not accurately reproduce the kinetics of the system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8B</xref>) although it gives the correct qualitative behavior. The recovery process is especially slow and incomplete for the switch Sw<sub>12</sub>, which also showed less ideal behavior in the feedforward circuit. The system could maintain its memory for up to 11 h, after which loss of NTP or loss of RNAP activity lead to decrease in inhibitor levels, turning both switches on.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Surprisingly, controlling the degradation pathway turned out to be more difficult than controlling the production pathway. RNase H can only degrade the signal part of the transcript where hybridization to DNA activator occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Lima and Crooke, 1997</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Thus, unlike the full-length transcripts (active signal) that turn over continuously, the shorter degradation products (inactive signal) accumulate during the circuit operation. This may help explain the slowness when switching multiple times between ON and OFF states. We have implemented the transcriptional circuit in combination with other ribonucleases to clean up inactive signals. Commercially available ribonucleases, of which we tested RNase I, A, III, and V, are endoribonucleases. Their activities quickly saturate because more RNA substrates are generated as a result of RNA substrates being cut internally. Also, they degrade long RNA substrates faster than short RNA substrates, accelerating the build-up of inactive signal. Following the observation that the degradation of RNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> is completed by the concerted action of an endoribonuclease, a processive exoribonuclease and a helicase in the degradosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Grunberg-Manago, 1999</xref>), we tested two 3&#x02032; processive exoribonucleases. RNase R (gift of Dr Deutscher) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Cheng and Deutscher, 2002</xref>) proved to be an excellent cleaner, but it also degrades full-length transcripts, consequently lowering the switch gain. Bistability was lost when a significant amount of RNase R was used, because inhibitor I<sub>2</sub> was a better substrate for RNase R than inhibitor I<sub>1</sub> in competing situations. OligoRNase (gift of Dr Malhotra) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fiedler <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) specifically degrades short single-stranded species, thus it would attack only incomplete RNA products. Unfortunately, the high NTP concentration in our transcriptional circuit inhibits the activity of oligoRNase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Datta and Niyogi, 1975</xref>). Apparently, &#x02018;all-or-none' degradation of RNA signals would require simultaneous activity of multiple ribonucleases with different substrate specificities, a challenge for our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p><p>Reproducing the bifurcation diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>) with our model is a stringent test on the validity of the model over a wide range of parameters, and demonstrates that Michaelis&#x02013;Menten saturation is essential to the circuit behavior. When the circuit is modeled with first-order enzyme reactions, it is bistable at low levels of activators and monostable above a certain level of activators, quite contrary to experimental observation. Because in a first-order model the degradation rates of inhibitors in activator&#x02013;inhibitor complexes increase linearly with the total concentration of activators, at high activator levels, the degradation rates exceed the production rates of inhibitors and repression of the target switch is lost. However, with Michaelis&#x02013;Menten enzyme reaction equations, the degradation capacity of RNase H is shared by two activator&#x02013;inhibitor substrates. This means that the relative abundance of an activator&#x02013;inhibitor complex determines the probability of the activator&#x02013;inhibitor complex being associated with RNase H, which in turn determines the degradation rate of inhibitor within that complex. Consequently, the bistability is maintained if the degradation rates of both inhibitors are relatively balanced despite high activator concentrations.</p><p>For engineering purposes, switches are most suitable when they contribute independently to the whole circuit. However, global coupling of rate equations through enzyme saturation can lead to global feedback regulation in the Michaelis&#x02013;Menten enzyme reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ackermann <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Noireaux <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). First-order enzyme reactions are justified in the following cases. First, when the substrate concentrations are well below the Michaelis constants of enzymes: the enzyme reactions are limited by substrate, and consequently become first-order. However, both RNAP and RNase H have low Michaelis constants such that slow operation limited by DNA and RNA hybridization speed is inevitable in this parameter regime. Second, when there are many competing and compensatory species: the enzyme is at a similar saturation level even if a few substrate concentrations fluctuate, thus free enzyme concentration would be roughly a constant. This might be true for genetic regulatory circuits in a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">McClure, 1985</xref>), but not for our bistable circuit with only four substrates for RNAP and two for RNase H. The concentration change in one substrate has a significant impact on the effective enzyme rate on another substrate.</p><p>Our circuit construction is much simpler than other approaches using protein signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Noireaux <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Isalan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), yet general in computational power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and quantitatively explained better than other nucleic-acid based feedback circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Wlotzka and McCaskill, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ackermann <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), although accurately predicting kinetics rather than steady-states still remains a challenge. We did not model known enzyme activities such as &#x02018;bursting' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Jia and Patel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kuzmine and Martin, 2001</xref>) or side reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cazenave and Uhlenbeck, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Zaher and Unrau, 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, the characterization of feedforward circuits was sufficient to predict bistability in our feedback circuit, attesting modularity and programmability of the components. Thus, the synthetic switches in principle can be assembled to implement different logical networks with increasing complexity, offering a testbed for probing the design space of biochemical networks. For example, systematic exploration of parameter space in small feedback circuits and feedforward circuits, such as alternative implementations of oscillators and cascades, could elucidate principles for biochemical circuit design. A theoretical correspondence to neural network architecture would allow implementing networks of arbitrary complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hopfield, 1984</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> transcriptional circuits are suitable both for studying continuous mass action dynamics and, in principle, stochastic dynamics in small volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">McAdams and Arkin, 1997</xref>). Because of its simplicity, the characterization of noise source and propagation in small biochemical circuits should be facilitated. As discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ackermann <italic>et al</italic> (1998</xref>), dead-end side reactions can be important in <italic>in vitro</italic> systems that lack sophisticated control mechanisms found in the cell. Some of the known side reactions can be suppressed by experimental design, as in this work, and other constraints such as the exhaust of fuel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Klungs&#x000f8;yr <italic>et al</italic>, 1968</xref>) and build-up of degradation products could be relaxed in a chemostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Atkinson <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), a dialysis bag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Madin <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), or vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Noireaux and Libchaber, 2004</xref>).

Thus, the dynamics of each switch is described by the following three ordinary differential equations:</p><p><inline-graphic id="N0x8fb5428N0x9939dc0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb4100099-i5.jpg"/></p><p>In addition to the 18 rate parameters mentioned above, three additional parameters were required to fit the whole data set simultaneously: Rv, Rhv, and Dv (Materials and methods). These parameters are not unique; similar fits can be achieved with some parameters changing by more than a factor of 10 when appropriate trade-offs are made. However, our choice of parameters shows that the model we present here is quantitatively plausible. For comparison, the parameter values and enzyme constants from other biochemical studies are listed below. The T7 RNA polymerase parameters were measured on synthetic DNA templates that have a complete promoter sequence (different from our ON state template by a nick at &#x02212;12) or a promoter sequence with five bases missing on the template side (identical to our OFF state template) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Martin and Coleman, 1987</xref>). Higher <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> for our ON state template may be attributed to the presence of nick. Because the transcript was very short (5 bases) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Martin and Coleman (1987)</xref>, only the initiation rate constant was measured as <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>. The initiation rate was 30 times faster than the steady-state transcription rate (&#x02018;bursting') in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Jia and Patel, 1997</xref>), which may explain our small <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> values. The RNase H parameters were measured on RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid stems of molecular beacons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Rizzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Since our substrates (activator&#x02013;inhibitor complexes) are longer than those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Rizzo <italic>et al</italic> (2002)</xref>, slower <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>'s are plausible. Thus, our enzyme parameters are reasonable compared to other biochemical studies. Hybridization rate constants (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>TA</italic></sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>AI</italic></sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>TAI</italic></sub>) are expected to be on the order of 10<sup>5</sup>/M/s in the absence of enzymes; in our fits, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>TA</italic></sub> is consistently slow, suggesting that enzyme binding or interaction with degradation products is interfering in the reaction.</p><p><inline-graphic id="N0x8fb5428N0x9939ee0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb4100099-i6.jpg"/></p></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x8fb5428N0x98ee100" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplementary Text</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb4100099-s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Design of synthetic switches and circuits. (<bold>A</bold>) Design of DNA sequences and reaction mechanisms. Each sequence subdomain is color-coded with its length in nucleotides written above it. For example, 62 base long inhibitor I<sub>2</sub> consists of five parts: the spacer sequence including the 6 base transcription initiation sequence (11 bases, green), the toehold-binding sequence (8 bases, light blue), the branch migration sequence (22 bases, red), the 5&#x02032; end of the promoter sequence (5 bases, blue) and the 3&#x02032; end hairpin structure (16 bases, brown). Switch templates have two distinct states, ON or OFF, with different transcription speed. The ON-state switch template (T&#x000b7;A complex) has a complete promoter sequence (17 bases, blue) with a nick, while the OFF-state switch template (T) is missing 5 bases of the promoter sequence on the template side. The two single strands that form the switch templates are the longer nontemplate side strand, T-nt, and the shorter template side strand, T-t (Materials and methods). The T-nt strands are labeled with fluorophores (pink circle, Texas Red; yellow circle, TAMRA) and A strands are labeled with quenchers (black circles). Thus, the state of each switch can be monitored by measuring the fluorescence quenching efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Marras <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The ON-state source template has a complete promoter sequence with a nick (like the ON-state switch) and the OFF-state source template is missing five bases of the promoter sequence on the template side (like the OFF-state switch). Unlike the switch templates, source templates do not interact with activators, due to the hairpin stem permanently covering the branch migration sequence, and therefore maintain their transcription efficiency in the presence of inhibitors. The source activity can be controlled by preparing a mixture of ON and OFF source templates. The two single strands that form the source templates are the longer nontemplate side strand, So-nt (ON or OFF), and the shorter template side strand, T-t; the template side strands are the same for the switch and source templates that encode the same outputs (Materials and methods). For any given transcriptional circuit, we use either source template So<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> (with some desired mixture of ON and OFF templates) or switch template Sw<sub><italic>ji</italic></sub> to produce RNA inhibitor I<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>. RNAP produces RNA inhibitors from DNA templates, while RNase H degrades RNA inhibitors bound to DNA activators.
