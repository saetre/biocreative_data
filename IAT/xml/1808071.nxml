Previous studies have shown that upon viral infection, a protein called TANK-binding kinase-1(TBK1) signals the induction of a program of protection that results in inhibition of viral replication. During infection of mammalian cells by bacteria, a different type of microbe than a virus, TBK1 also sends signals, but the functional contribution of TBK1 to controlling bacterial infection was unknown. Here, we show that TBK1 does protect host cells from bacterial infection; however, the TBK1-dependent mechanisms that inhibit viral infection were not effective against bacterial growth. Instead, TBK1 maintained the integrity of the vacuolar compartment, consisting of small membrane-bound vesicles, where the invading bacteria were trapped. In the absence of TBK1, pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella,</italic> enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> and Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> were able to escape from the confining host vacuoles and grow to high levels within the host cytosol. Thus, TBK1 plays an important role in the cellular response to bacterial infection, distinct from its function in antiviral immunity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Radtke AL, Delbridge LM, Balachandran S, Barber GN, O'Riordan MXD (2007) TBK1 protects vacuolar integrity during intracellular bacterial infection.

Thus, TBK1 protects cells during bacterial infection by confining invading pathogens to a membrane-bound compartment.</p><p>The best studied TBK-dependent signaling pathway triggered by bacterial infection is LPS-mediated induction of Type I interferons through TLR4, TBK1, and IRF3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. However, our data showed that TBK1 did not require IRF3 or Type I interferon to exert a protective effect on host cells during bacterial infection. It is yet unclear whether TLR4 activation contributes to TBK1-dependent maintenance of vacuolar integrity. We still observed a protective effect by TBK1 on pathogen-containing vacuoles in HeLa cells, which do not express surface TLR4 due to lack of the accessory protein, MD2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. This observation suggests that TLR4 signaling is not absolutely required for the restrictive function of TBK1 in bacterial infection, but further studies will be necessary to definitively determine the role of TLR4 or other TLRs in modulation of vacuolar integrity by TBK1.</p><p>The vacuolar compartment is a restrictive antimicrobial environment because of its ability to decrease pH, produce degradative enzymes, and in some cell types, to generate harmful reactive oxygen species in a confined environment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b040">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, there are few cytosolic antimicrobial mechanisms, possibly to minimize damage to cytosolic host machinery.

TBK1-dependent mechanisms may prevent many bacterial pathogens from accessing the cytosol by modulating integrity or function of the endocytic compartment during infection. Our data suggest two nonexclusive models by which TBK1 may contribute to the cellular response to bacterial invasion. First, TBK1 could function at the post-transcriptional level in response to an infection by phosphorylating target proteins. In the case of bacterial infection, there may be TBK1 kinase substrates whose function directly or indirectly modifies the pathogen-containing vacuole. Secondly, TBK1 may act prior to infection to establish a state of immune competence, perhaps by regulating expression of gene products that are important for the immediate response to bacterial invasion. This model requires that TBK1 have some constitutive activity prior to infection. Since there is a known requirement for TBK1 in embryonic development in the absence of infection, it is likely that TBK1 may function in normal adult animals in the absence of infection as well &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

In response to bacterial invasion, TBK1 could control initiation of autophagy, which can capture bacteria in damaged vacuoles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, it is notable that all of the bacterial species, for which we showed cytosolic localization in <italic>tbk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, have mechanisms by which vacuolar membranes are damaged during infection, i.e., <italic>Salmonella</italic> and EPEC contain Type III secretion machinery, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pyogenes</named-content> encodes the pore-forming toxin Streptolysin O &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b048">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030029-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, a TBK1-dependent target could modulate influx/efflux of ions or water into the pathogen-containing vacuole to maintain its physical continuity or otherwise alter membrane dynamics in response to infection.

Our findings are consistent with damage to the vacuolar membrane as a possible trigger for TBK1-dependent function during bacterial infection.</p><p>The innate immune system is required both for controlling pathogen replication and for communicating with other cell types. In viral infections, TBK1 clearly acts as a regulator of innate immunity by communicating with other cells through Type I interferon, which contributes to control of viral replication. However, we have demonstrated that in bacterial infections, TBK1 plays an important role in limiting pathogen replication by protecting the integrity of the pathogen-containing vacuole, independently of Type I interferon. Our findings do not preclude an additional requirement for TBK1 in antibacterial immunity through stimulation of cytokine or chemokine expression, but suggest an early TBK1-dependent mechanism by which host cells can achieve innate control of bacterial infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat-0030029-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Trafficking of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Populations in <italic>tbk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> MEFs</title><p>(A) <italic>Tbk1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>tbk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> MEFs were transfected with a LC3-GFP-expressing plasmid (green) to identify autophagosomes and infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic>-RFP (red).
