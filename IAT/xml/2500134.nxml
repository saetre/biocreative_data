Nuclear receptors recruit a cohort of histone-modifying enzymes in response to ligand binding and regulate proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the steroid hormone ecdysone binds its heterodimeric receptor ecdysone receptor/ultraspiracle to spatiotemporally regulate the transcription of several genes.

Our data suggest that the dynamic recruitment of dLKR/SDH to ecdysone-regulated gene promoters controls the timing of hormone-induced gene expression. In the absence of dLKR/SDH, histone methylation occurs prematurely, resulting in enhanced gene activation.

Distinct modifications act sequentially or in combination to form the histone code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Strahl and Allis, 2000</xref>). These modifications provide a platform recognition surface for nonhistone proteins that translate the histone code to ultimately affect many biological processes, including gene expression, DNA replication, and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although histone acetylation/deacetylation has been studied extensively, dynamics of histone methylation was the subject of considerable debate, as it was long thought to be a stable epigenetic modification because of the absence of a known histone demethylase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies have revealed that histone methylation on both lysine and arginine residues can be extremely dynamic on various promoters and in response to specific signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Metivier et al., 2003</xref>). Methylation of arginine residues on histone 3 (H3) by CARM1 and histone 4 (H4) by PRMT1 is known to occur in response to nuclear hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). The discovery of PADI4 lent support to the dynamic nature of histone methylation, as it was demonstrated to deiminate both the unmodified and monomethylated forms of histone H3R2, R17, and R26, forming citrulline and thereby antagonizing histone arginine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuthbert et al., 2004</xref>). This was followed by identification of the first lysine-specific demethylase, LSD1, a nuclear amine oxidase that was found to demethylate H3K4me1 and me2 in a flavin adenine dinucleotide&#x02013;dependent oxidative reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shi et al., 2004</xref>). This is consistent with the finding that LSD1 is part of the Co-REST repressor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballas et al., 2001</xref>). The discovery of JHDM1A (FBXL11), which specifically demethylates histone H3K36 using Fe (II) and &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate as cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsukada et al., 2006</xref>), led to the establishment of the third family of demethylases, the JmjC domain&#x02013;containing histone demethylases. This family is evolutionarily conserved with 30 proteins in humans and mice and 13 in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klose et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi and Whetsine, 2007</xref>). It is now apparent that the dynamics of histone methylation is a tightly regulated process involving both histone methyltransferases and histone-specific demethylases. As more demethylases will inevitably be discovered, the question arises as to how the rapid kinetics of histone arginine methylation/demethylation is controlled at the molecular level and how this relates to the dynamics of other histone modifications involved in the histone code in response to a given signal.</p><p>Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that bind to target gene promoters. In the presence of ligand, they recruit coactivators to modify and remodel the chromatin structure, which ultimately leads to the assembly of the RNA polymerase II&#x02013;containing transcription complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tsai and Fondell, 2004</xref>). A ligand-induced conformational change results in direct recruitment of the p160 coactivators, further recruiting p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) and coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase (CARM1), which methylates histones H3R2, R17, and R26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schurter et al., 2001</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the major metamorphic transitions during development are mediated by the steroid hormone ecdysone, which binds its heterodimeric receptor, ecdysone receptor/ultraspiracle (EcR/Usp), and regulates proliferation, programmed cell death, and differentiation in a tissue- and developmental-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Truman and Riddiford., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar and Cakouros, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yin and Thummel, 2005</xref>). An ecdysone pulse toward the end of the larval stage signals puparium formation and histolysis of the larval midgut. A second ecdysone pulse &#x0223c;12 h later initiates head eversion and histolysis of the larval salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Truman and Riddiford, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar and Cakouros, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yin and Thummel, 2005</xref>). Previously, we discovered that the caspase <italic>dronc</italic> is dramatically up-regulated in dying larval salivary glands in response to ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorstyn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cakouros et al., 2002</xref>), and this is partly the result of direct binding of EcR/Usp to the promoter that controls its temporal expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daish et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cakouros et al., 2004a</xref>). DRONC and its adaptor Apaf1-related killer (ARK) are essential for ecdysone-mediated cell death of larval salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daish et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akdemir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mills et al., 2006</xref>). We also found that the arginine histone methyltransferase CARMER/DART4 is associated with EcR/Usp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cakouros et al., 2004b</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identify a novel cofactor, <italic>Drosophila</italic> lysine ketoglutarate reductase (LKR [dLKR])/saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), that binds EcR/Usp and regulates hormone-mediated transcription. dLKR/SDH specifically inhibits CARMER-mediated H3R17me2 by directly interacting with histone H3 but does not inhibit H3K4me3, which is also induced by ecdysone. dLKR/SDH genetically interacts with EcR/Usp and is recruited to hormone-responsive promoters to control the kinetics of H3R17me2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>dLKR/SDH is recruited to the EcR/Usp-binding element</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the only known coactivators for EcR/Usp are Taiman (p160 coactivator), CARMER, and the trithorax-related protein (TRR; a histone lysine methyltransferase). To identify other factors, we used the immobilized template bead assay in which the EcR/Usp-binding element (BE) of the caspase <italic>dronc</italic> promoter was biotin tagged, immobilized onto streptavidin beads, and incubated with nuclear extracts from <italic>Drosophila l</italic>(2)mbn cells with or without ecdysone treatment. <italic>l</italic>(2)mbn cells have been used in the past for characterizing ecdysone-mediated transcription and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cakouros et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2004b</xref>). To verify recruitment of the EcR-B1 isoform to the <italic>dronc</italic> promoter, the bound extracts were subjected to immunoblotting, which demonstrated the recruitment of EcR-B1 to the template in both the absence and presence of ecdysone treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, bottom). However, recruitment to the mutated EcR/Usp BE template was reduced as expected. This mutation, which alters the consensus binding site for EcR/Usp, has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cakouros et al., 2004a</xref>). Several proteins were identified by mass spectrometry to be specifically recruited to the wild-type EcR/Usp BE in the presence of ecdysone. These included CG10473, which is involved in chromatin condensation; CG10223 (topoisomerase II), which is involved in transcription from polymerase II promoters; a zinc finger protein, CG10084; an unknown methyltransferase, CG8545; a helicase, CG6375; as well as an uncharacterized protein (CG7144) of &#x0223c;110 kD that we have called dLKR/SDH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, top).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>dLKR/SDH is recruited to the <italic>dronc</italic> promoter and localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus.</bold> (A) Nuclear extracts from cells treated with either ethanol (&#x02212;) or 10 &#x003bc;M ecdysone (Ecd &#x0002b;) for 2 h were incubated with double-stranded biotin-tagged wild-type (WT) or mutated (mut) oligonucleotides corresponding to the <italic>dronc</italic> EcR/Usp BE and pulled down with streptavidin beads.

It is a dual activity enzyme with an N-terminal LKR domain and a C-terminal SDH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sacksteder et al., 2000</xref>). Except in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, in which <italic>Lys1</italic> encodes for the LKR and <italic>Lys9</italic> encodes for the SDH enzyme, bifunctional LKR/SDH is encoded by a single protein. dLKR/SDH is 51% identical and 71% similar to mouse and human LKR/SDH. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, yeast, mice, and humans, this enzyme is involved in catabolism of lysine to saccharopine by the LKR domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and from saccharopine to amino adipate semialdehyde by the SDH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharjee, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goncalves-Butruille et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sacksteder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhu et al., 2000</xref>). The reaction uses NADH and &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate in the first step, which is oxidized to NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and then NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is used for the conversion to amino adipate semialdehyde. In yeast, these reactions are reversible and can produce lysine from saccharopine; however, mammalian LKR/SDH is unable to do this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sacksteder et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Using GST fusion proteins of both individual enzyme domains (LKR and SDH) and in vitro&#x02013;translated EcR-B1, the direct association of the carboxyl SDH domain with the EcR-B1 isoform was observed both in the absence and presence of ecdysone, whereas the LKR domain displayed a much weaker interaction in both the absence and presence of ecdysone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). To further narrow the binding region, we sequentially deleted the SDH domain. Although the region spanning amino acids 618&#x02013;928 bound EcR/Usp efficiently, further deletion to residue 803 diminished binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Endogenous EcR-B1 immunoprecipitated with dLKR/SDH both in the absence and presence of ecdysone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). An antibody raised in rabbits identified a 110-kD dLKR/SDH protein in <italic>l</italic>(2)mbn cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. This protein is nearly ablated by dLKR/SDH RNAi in <italic>l</italic>(2)mbn cells, absent in a homozygous dLKR/SDH genetic deficiency, and reduced in heterozygous animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>).</p><p>To determine the subcellular localization of dLKR/SDH, fractionation experiments were performed using lysates from <italic>l(</italic>2)mbn cells. dLKR/SDH was readily detectable in the cytosol of both untreated and ecdysone-treated cells. dLKR/SDH was also seen in nuclear extracts, and the protein levels appeared to be dynamic upon ecdysone treatment, decreasing at 10&#x02013;30 min of treatment and increasing by 1 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). The same membrane was blotted for cytosolic proteins DRONC and DRICE as well as the nuclear heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1-&#x003b2;), demonstrating the purity of the fractions. Our antibody was unsuitable for immunohistochemical detection of the low levels of endogenous dLKR/SDH protein (unpublished data). Therefore, we further analyzed dLKR/SDH localization by expressing a tagged version of the protein in <italic>l</italic>(2)mbn cells. As shown in Fig. S1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712169/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712169/DC1</ext-link>), ectopically expressed dLKR/SDH localized to both the cytosol and nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>dLKR/SDH represses ecdysone-mediated transcription</title><p>To test the effect of dLKR/SDH on ecdysone-mediated transcription, we expressed and purified full-length His-tagged dLKR/SDH from insect cells. By using lysine as a substrate, we measured oxidation of NADH to NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and observed a time-dependent decrease in NADH, implying that the full-length protein is enzymatically active (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). <italic>l</italic>(2)mbn cells were therefore transfected with a promoter-reporter (pEcR-Luc) that is activated by direct binding of the preexisting EcR/Usp complex. This reporter was activated by ecdysone and repressed by coexpressing increasing amounts of dLKR/SDH, indicating a direct effect on the EcR/Usp complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Given the high conservation of dLKR/SDH throughout evolution, the putative NADH-binding domain, which is responsible for enzymatic activity, was identified based on homology to the extensively characterized yeast homologue. This domain was mutated (see Oligonucleotides and primers section), and its effect on reporter expression was examined. The mutated dLKR/SDH was enzymatically inactive (unpublished data). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, there was no significant difference in the repressive ability of the mutant and wild-type proteins, suggesting that the repressive effect is independent of dLKR/SDH's catalytic activity. In contrast, overexpression of dLKR/SDH had no significant repressive effect on transcription mediated by an unrelated transcription factor, broad complex (BR-C), when driving expression of a BR-C&#x02013;regulated promoter-reporter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). In support of its role as a repressor of ecdysone-mediated transcription, knockdown of dLKR/SDH resulted in a significant increase in ecdysone-induced reporter activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>), whereas no effect was evident on the BR-C reporter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>dLKR/SDH represses ecdysone receptor&#x02013;mediated transcription.</bold> (A) 5 &#x003bc;g of recombinant active or heat-inactivated dLKR/SDH was incubated with 1 mM NADH, 2 mM &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate, and 14 mM lysine.

This was examined using calf thymus histones, recombinant LKR or SDH domain, and appropriate cofactors. The LKR domain alone or together with the SDH domain did not demethylate H3K4me1, me2, me3, H3K9me2, me3, or H3R17me2 (H3R17me1 could not be detected; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The same results were obtained when using purified histones from HeLa cells (unpublished data). We next examined whether dLKR/SDH might inhibit histone methylation mediated by histone methyltransferases involved in hormone-mediated transcription. To test this, histones were incubated with increasing amounts of the LKR domain and were methylated with either TRR, which mediates H3K4me3, or CARMER, which mediates H3R17me2. The LKR domain had no significant effect on H3K4me3 but strongly inhibited H3R17me2 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>).

Detailed analysis of the kinetics of histone methylation showed recruitment of EcR-B1 to the promoter as early as 10 min after ecdysone treatment, which remained stable until 1 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). H3R17me2 methylation appeared after 10 min of ecdysone treatment and was present at 30 min; however, by 1 h it had diminished, suggesting the dynamic nature of this modification (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). As expected, CARMER was recruited by 10 min, coinciding with the appearance of H3R17me2; however, it had disengaged by 30 min and surprisingly reappeared by 1 h, when H3R17me2 was less abundant. A very low level of H3K4me3 was detected in the absence of ecdysone, but it rapidly increased by 10 min after ecdysone treatment. The levels of H3K4me3 increased with time up to 1 h, which is consistent with its role as a positive regulator of transcription. A high level of H3K9me3 was detected in untreated cells; however, in response to ecdysone treatment, H3K9me3 rapidly decreased with time consistent with its role as a repressor of transcription (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>).

By electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we found an EcR/Usp BE that lies 807 bp upstream of the transcription start site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). This site specifically binds the EcR-B1 isoform but not the A isoform (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). ChIP analysis showed that a low level of EcR-B1 was associated with the <italic>ark</italic> promoter, which increased by 10 min of ecdysone treatment followed by a decrease at 30 and 60 min (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). This is in contrast to the kinetics of recruitment to the <italic>dronc</italic> promoter. H3R17me2 methylation was also evident by 10 and 30 min of ecdysone treatment. However, by 1 h it had diminished. Flag-tagged dLKR/SDH was present on the promoter in untreated cells and cells treated with ecdysone for 10 min; however, a decrease was evident at 30 min and 1 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Recruitment of CARMER was evident by 10 min, reaching a maximum at 30 min, followed by a decrease by 60 min. H3K4me3 increased from 30 min onwards, and H3K9me3 decreased in response to ecdysone treatment with time. Collectively, these results demonstrate that by 10 min after ecdysone treatment, increased recruitment of EcR-B1 coincides with the recruitment of CARMER and the presence of H3R17me2. After 30 min of ecdysone treatment, this is followed by a rapid decline. Although CARMER is recruited again at 1 h (for <italic>dronc</italic> promoter), this does not coincide with H3R17me2 at that time, as dLKR/SDH presumably inhibits H3R17me2.</p><p>Common to both <italic>dronc</italic> and <italic>ark</italic> promoters, the presence of endogenous dLKR/SDH seems inversely proportional to H3R17me2, which is present mostly at the time when H3R17me2 does not occur or at the beginning of its appearance. It is also present at 1 h, as is CARMER, although H3R17me2 does not occur at this time. Based on these data, we conclude that dLKR/SDH inhibits H3R17me2 methylation when present on the promoter. This was confirmed by knocking down dLKR/SDH by RNAi and assessing changes in arginine methylation along the <italic>dronc</italic> promoter. Cells treated with control dsRNA showed the appearance of H3R17me2 by 7 min after ecdysone treatment, reaching maximum levels at 30 min and a decrease at 1 h (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Knockdown of dLKR/SDH resulted in a dramatic shift in the kinetics of H3R17me2 methylation, with levels at a maximum between 4&#x02013;7 min and decreased again from 10 min onwards (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). This experiment was validated by semiquantitative real-time PCR of the ChIP-enriched DNA and was compared with total input genomic DNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). The results clearly show that H3R17me2 is generally low along the <italic>dronc</italic> promoter, with levels increasing at 10&#x02013;30 min of ecdysone treatment and decreasing by 1 h. When dLKR/SDH was knocked down, in the absence of ecdysone, there is no significant difference in the levels of H3R17me2. However, as early as 4 min of hormone treatment, H3R17me2 levels increase sharply and then steadily decrease. These results indicate that dLKR/SDH inhibits H3R17me2 when occupying the promoter and controls kinetics of methylation at the promoter.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>dLKR/SDH regulates the dynamics of histone H3R17me2.</bold> (A) 10<sup>7</sup><italic>l</italic>(2)mbn cells were treated with either double-stranded RNA to control (Ndfip2) or dLKR/SDH for 48 h.

Surprisingly, this cofactor is an enzyme involved in lysine catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sacksteder et al., 2000</xref>). The fact that this gene is transcriptionally up-regulated in larval salivary glands undergoing programmed cell death in response to rising levels of ecdysone as well as in response to &#x003b3; irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2003</xref>) prompted us to further characterize it. We established that dLKR/SDH binds directly to EcR/Usp in vitro, and this interaction occurs both in the absence and presence of ecdysone. This differed from the template assay, in which dLKR/SDH was recruited only in the presence of hormone. We believe that the complexes formed on oligonucleotides in this system are unstable, and therefore we could only detect dLKR/SDH and other factors in the presence of hormone, which is believed to increase the affinity of cofactors for their receptors.</p><p>With the use of reporter assays and RNAi in cells and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we found that dLKR/SDH is a repressor of ecdysone-induced transcription of <italic>dronc</italic> and <italic>ark</italic>. Its repressive effect is consistent with the fact that dLKR/SDH inhibits ecdysone-inducible H3R17me2. The greatest effect of dLKR/SDH knockdown on transcription was evident at 6 h of ecdysone treatment. This is likely the result of the active transcription of these genes occurring in the first 12 h of ecdysone treatment in <italic>l</italic>(2)mbn cells. Any effects on active transcription will therefore be more evident at earlier time points (i.e., 6 h) rather than later time points (i.e., 24 h). <italic>ark</italic> transcription is also more affected at 6 h than <italic>dronc</italic>, which may reflect different modes of <italic>ark</italic> and <italic>dronc</italic> regulation by ecdysone. For example, although <italic>ark</italic> seems primarily regulated by direct EcR/Usp binding, <italic>dronc</italic> is known to be additionally regulated by other ecdysone-inducible transcription factors such as BR-C and E93 (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar and Cakouros, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments show that dLKR/SDH does not demethylate histones but potently inhibits arginine methylation of histone H3 by CARMER. Although we could not detect any interaction with CARMER, dLKR/SDH specifically interacted with H3 and H4 via its LKR domain but not H2B and H2A. This is intriguing given that arginine methylation occurs preferentially on H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedford and Richard, 2005</xref>). The absence of any modifications by full-length dLKR/SDH on histone H3 allows us to speculate that ketoglutarate might be important for dLKR/SDH to adopt a conformation required to sterically inhibit CARMER for methylating histone H3. This scenario is somewhat similar to the mechanism used by the corepressor C-terminal binding protein, which represses transcription using NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), and Sir2, which uses NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Imai et al., 2000</xref>). Given that dLKR/SDH and its homologues recognize lysine, it was surprising that it did not affect methylation of lysine on histone H3. In fact, we have mutated H3K4 and H3K9, and these mutations do not affect the interaction between dLKR/SDH and histone H3 (unpublished data). Therefore, it is highly likely that a group of amino acids within the N terminus are important for the interaction of dLKR/SDH with histone H3 and that the conformation adopted by dLKR/SDH specifically inhibits H3R17me2. We are currently examining the mechanisms involved in more detail.</p><p>Endogenous dLKR/SDH is present in the cytosol, consistent with its possible role in lysine catabolism, and in the nucleus, where its levels seem to fluctuate in a time-dependent manner in response to hormone treatment. Apart from histones, protein arginine methyltransferases are involved in methylating several other substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedford and Richard, 2005</xref>). In fact, the predominant arginine methyltransferase in human cells, PRMT1, is responsible for 85% of all arginine methylations and for methylating H4R3 when recruited by nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pawlak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tang et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, it has also been shown to methylate heterogenous nuclear RNP, which is involved in pre-mRNA processing and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu and Dreyfuss, 1995</xref>). PRMT1 lacks a nuclear localization signal, is localized preferentially in the cytoplasm, and shuttles into the nucleus by associating with other proteins entering the nucleus. Only when methylation is inhibited can PRMT1 be seen to accumulate in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herrmann et al., 2005</xref>). It is predicted that PRMT1 is attached to unmethylated substrates such as newly synthesized heterogenous nuclear RNP molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herrmann et al., 2005</xref>). It is thus possible that dLKR/SDH is regulated in a similar manner, as it has no nuclear localization signal but does have a putative nuclear export signal. It is also possible that dLKR/SDH might regulate methylation in other cellular compartments. Given its ability to inhibit H3R17me2, it is not surprising that mechanisms exist to prevent its accumulation in the nucleus, where it could prevent H3R17me2 for prolonged periods of time and hinder the hormonal response. Although dLKR/SDH can bind EcR/Usp, our ChIP data show that dLKR/SDH is on the promoter spanning the BE before EcR/Usp is recruited. It is therefore more feasible that another constitutive factor is responsible for recruiting dLKR/SDH and interacting with histone H3, and its cycling back onto the promoter at 1 h of ecdysone treatment might be mediated by its ability to interact with EcR/Usp.</p><p>The ChIP data after dLKR/SDH knockdown demonstrated the premature appearance of H3R17me2 as well as the premature loss of H3R17me2, confirming that the role of dLKR/SDH is to control the kinetics of H3R17me2. Based on our in vitro data, this occurs by inhibiting methylation by the positive regulator CARMER. It has been documented that H3R17me2 serves to recruit RNA polymerase II to the promoter, and removal of H3 arginine methylation is needed for elongation of RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Metivier et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, this may explain why the change in H3R17me2 kinetics by dLKR/SDH knockdown results in a dramatic shift in transcription kinetics, as the initiation and elongation of the RNA polymerase could possibly occur more frequently when dLKR/SDH is knocked down. The only other enzyme capable of inhibiting R17 methylation is PADI4 in mammals, which is also involved in amino acid catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuthbert et al., 2004</xref>). However, a PADI4 homologue is not present in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which prompts us to conclude that dLKR/SDH may be functionally equivalent in flies.</p><p>Knockdown of dLKR/SDH in the salivary glands resulted in a premature increase in the expression of <italic>dronc</italic> but, in spite of this, showed no discernible alterations in tissue histolysis or metamorphosis. Furthermore, dLKR/SDH-deficient flies or ones harboring tissue-specific RNAi do not show strong phenotypes. Given that dLKR/SDH is a negative regulator of ecdysone-induced gene expression, these phenotypes suggest that dLKR/SDH plays a fine-tuning role as opposed to an essential role for ecdysone-regulated transcription. The mild phenotypes observed for alterations in dLKR/SDH are not surprising given the phenotypes observed for some other histone-modifying enzymes such as the histone demethylases LSD1 and Lid. <italic>Drosophila LSD1</italic> homozygous mutants are viable but sterile despite showing alterations in the pattern of histone methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rudolph et al., 2007</xref>), and overexpression of <italic>lid</italic> during eye differentiation had no effect on the adult phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Secombe et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, dLKR/SDH can genetically interact with the ecdysone receptor in the eye and wing, and loss of dLKR/SDH results in specific developmental phenotypes in the wing. The smaller wing size (in both deficiency and RNAi lines) is suggestive of defects in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and/or differentiation. We measured wing hair density in dLKR/SDH knockdown compared with control and observed no change, indicating that cell size is not altered (unpublished data). We are currently investigating alternative pathways that are mediated by dLKR/SDH and whether these effects are involved in the phenotypes observed in vivo.</p><p>Our current work supports a model shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> in which dLKR/SDH binds the promoter region spanning the EcR/Usp BE. In response to hormone, there is an increase in EcR/Usp binding to the <italic>dronc</italic> and <italic>ark</italic> promoters followed by recruitment of CARMER within 10 min. However, the LKR domain of dLKR/SDH already bound to histone H3 shields H3R17 from methylation. dLKR/SDH is then removed by an unknown mechanism from the promoter, allowing CARMER to methylate H3R17. Between 30 and 45 min of hormonal stimuli, H3R17me2 is removed, followed by the recruitment of dLKR/SDH and CARMER by 1 h. dLKR/SDH therefore serves to control the correct developmental timing of ecdysone-induced genes such as <italic>dronc</italic> and <italic>ark</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> at least partly by controlling histone H3R17 methylation kinetics.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>A model for dLKR/SDH function.</bold> In this model, dLKR/SDH is present on the EcR/Usp BE via its interaction with EcR/Usp. In the presence of ecdysone, CARMER is recruited to the promoter, but dLKR/SDH inhibits its ability to methylate histone H3 on R17 as a result of its ability to bind H3 and hinder methylation. Eventually, dLKR/SDH is removed, and methylation proceeds. The methyl mark is then removed, dLKR/SDH is recruited followed by CARMER, and the cycle is repeated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820481f09"></graphic></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and antibodies</title><p><italic>l(2)</italic>mbn cells (a gift from A.
