PP2A holoenzymes comprise a core dimer composed of a catalytic C and a structural A subunit, which can associate with a variable B-type subunit. The importance of the B-type subunits for PP2A regulation cannot be overestimated as they determine holoenzyme localisation, activity and substrate specificity. Three B-type subunit families have been identified: PR55/B, PR61/B' and PR72/B", of which the latter is currently the least characterised.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We deduced the sequences and genomic organisation of the different murine PR72/B" isoforms: three genes encode nine isoforms, five of which are abundantly expressed and give rise to genuine PP2A subunits. Thereby, one novel subunit was identified. Using Northern blotting, we examined the tissue-specific and developmental expression of these subunits. All subunits are highly expressed in heart, suggesting an important cardiac function. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a striated expression pattern of PR72 and PR130 in heart and skeletal muscle, but not in bladder smooth muscle. The subcellular localisation and cell cycle regulatory ability of several PR72/B" isoforms were determined, demonstrating differences as well as similarities.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In contrast to PR55/B and PR61/B', the PR72/B" family seems evolutionary more divergent, as only two of the murine genes have a human orthologue. We have integrated these results in a more consistent nomenclature of both human and murine PR72/B" genes and their transcripts/proteins. Our results provide a platform for the future generation of PR72/B" knockout mice.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), one of the major serine/threonine protein phosphatases in the cell, is involved in the control of a large number of cellular events including cell growth, intracellular signalling, DNA replication, transcription, translation, cell differentiation and cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The key to understand how PP2A is capable of regulating such diverse, and sometimes even opposite functions, is its structure. The core of PP2A consists of a structural PR65/A subunit and a catalytic C subunit, both existing in two isoforms, &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;. To this PP2A dimer (PP2A<sub>D</sub>), a third regulatory B-type subunit can bind. It is generally believed that the regulatory B-type subunits target the phosphatase to distinct substrates and intracellular localisations. At present approximately 20 regulatory B-type subunits have been described. Based on their primary structure, they can be divided into three families: PR55/B, PR61/B' (also called B56) and PR72/B" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. They share two conserved A subunit binding domains (ASBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In theory, about 80 different combinations of trimeric ABC holoenzymes can be formed. How many actually exist in the cell, is unknown and most probably differs in different tissues due to the tissue-specific expression of some PP2A subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, phosphorylation and methylation of the catalytic C subunit play an important role in the assembly of specific trimeric holoenzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we focus on the regulatory PR72/B" subunit family named after the molecular weight of the first identified member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In mammals, sofar 6 members have been described: PR72 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], PR130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], PR70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], PPP2R3L product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], G5PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and mPR59 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], all sharing a conserved region with two ASBDs important for binding to PP2A<sub>D</sub>. Characteristically for this family, are &#x02013; in addition to both ASBDs &#x02013; two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-hand motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Mutation analysis of these EF-hand motifs together with several binding and activity studies indicate that Ca<sup>2+ </sup>can influence the heterotrimeric assembly and catalytic activity of the B"-containing PP2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>PR72 and PR130, the founding members of the B" family, are two N-terminal splice variants with a different tissue distribution pattern. PR72 is highly abundant in heart and skeletal muscle and barely detectable in other tissues. PR130, on the other hand, has a more widespread distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Both splice variants have a role in Wnt signalling since they both regulate Naked Cuticle (Nkd) function, yet apparently in opposite ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, addition of IQ-1, a compound which disrupts binding of PR72 and PR130 to both PP2A<sub>D </sub>and Nkd, results in prevention of embryonic stem cell differentiation due to a change of co-activators associating with &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, PR72-containing PP2A (PP2A<sub>T72</sub>) is also responsible for the glutamate-dependent dephosphorylation of Thr75 in dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) in dopaminoceptive neuronal cells of the striatum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. PR130-containing PP2A (PP2A<sub>T130</sub>) has been described as an interacting protein of CG-NAP (centrosome and Golgi localised PKN-associated protein), a scaffolding protein that assembles several protein kinases (PKA, PKN) and protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A<sub>T130</sub>) on centrosome and Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. PP2A<sub>T130 </sub>is also suggested to be involved in the calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of heart cells as it can interact with the ryanodine receptor type 2, a heart-specific Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channel found to be hyperphosphorylated in some patients with heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, an additional splice variant, named XN73, has been found. This protein contains the specific N-terminus of PR130 followed by a short tail of 7 amino acids and thus lacks the ASBD necessary for PP2A<sub>D</sub>-binding. Consequently, this protein is not a regulatory PR72/B" subunit <italic>strictu senso </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] but-based on its sequence-might compete in binding to other cellular partners of PR130.</p><p>After identification of PR48 as a B" subunit family member which can bind Cdc6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and therefore involved in regulation of the cell cycle, it was found that PR48 represents a partial clone of a larger human B" subunit, PR70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Currently, two PR48-containing isoforms have been described with different N-termini: PR70 and PPP2R3L product. PPP2R3L product is mainly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], whereas PR70 is ubiquitously expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently, various links between PR70 and cell cycle progression have been discovered. PR70 can bind retinoblastoma protein (pRb), thereby regulating its phosphorylation status following oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and it can associate with Cdc6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Another member of the B" subunit family is named G5PR. It has a wide expression pattern and can bind both PP2A<sub>D </sub>and PP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, G5PR can interact with GANP, a DNA-primase which is selectively up-regulated in germinal centre B cells after immunisation with T cell-dependent antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. B-cell-specific G5PR knockout mice display a decreased number of splenic B cells. This enhanced cell death, specifically induced upon antigen binding to the specific B cell receptor, is caused by an increased activation of c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal protein kinase and Bim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In parallel, T-cell-specific G5PR knockout mice display a decreased number of thymocytes. The enhanced cell death, mainly seen in CD4 and CD8 double positive thymocytes, is accompanied by increased activation of both c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase and caspase-3, but not Bim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>mPR59 is a mouse-specific B" subunit, discovered as an interacting protein of p107, a Rb related protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. No human orthologue of mPR59 is found so far. It is expressed in various tissues and overexpression can regulate p107 phosphorylation, causing an increase of cells in the G<sub>1 </sub>phase of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, mPR59 co-purifies with the L-Type Calcium Channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2, a voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channel important for Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx in cells of the cardiovascular system, heart and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Undoubtedly, the generation of (additional) PR72/B" knockout mice will be a valuable tool to obtain further insights into the potential physiological roles of the PR72/B" regulatory subunits. To provide a framework for the generation and analysis of such PR72/B" knockout mice, we present a comprehensive overview of the murine PR72/B"-encoding genes, their exon/intron organisation, their (alternative) transcripts and their developmental and tissue-specific expression. Surprisingly and in contrast to the murine PR55/B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and PR61/B' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] families of PP2A subunits, the murine PR72/B" subunits have evolved somewhat differently compared to their human orthologues. As a consequence the current PR72/B" nomenclature is confusing, and we now propose some changes to make it more consistent. At the cellular level, we determine the subcellular localisation of the major PR72/B" subunits and their ability to affect cell cycle progression upon overexpression. Evidence is presented for at least one novel murine PR72/B" isoform, adding to the high diversity of PP2A B-type subunits.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The murine B" family isoforms</title><p>In mammals, four genes of the B" regulatory subunit family of PP2A have been described, giving rise to six isoforms: PR72 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], PR130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], PR70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], PPP2R3L product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], G5PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and mPR59, an isoform sofar only found in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Upon searching the NCBI database for murine B" family members via the BLAST algorithm, we retrieved the complete protein sequence of two murine PR72 isoforms: the human PR72 orthologue [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAE21013">BAE21013</ext-link>] (referred to as mPR72/B"&#x003b1;2) and a shorter variant missing the last 41 residues [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAC28935">BAC28935</ext-link>] (referred to as mPR72/B"&#x003b1;4).

Additionally, two partial protein sequences of murine PR130 homologues were retrieved, one containing the first 615 amino acids of the PR130 specific N-terminus [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAC31413">BAC31413</ext-link>] and the other containing the last 203 amino acids of the specific N-terminus followed by 12 additional residues [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAC37349">BAC37349</ext-link>], resembling <italic>Xenopus </italic>XN73 (referred to as mPR130/B"&#x003b1;3). Of the full-length mPR130 (referred to as mPR130/B"&#x003b1;1), only a predicted sequence [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XP_135153">XP_135153</ext-link>] could be found.</p><p>To confirm these <italic>in silico </italic>data and to get an idea about the abundancy of these clones, we scanned the NCBI database for murine EST-clones containing the B"-specific N- or C-termini. Only very few EST-clones were found carrying the sequence of the mPR72 C-terminus lacking 41 residues [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BE852268">BE852268</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CA984544">CA984544</ext-link>], the XN73-like truncated mPR130 C-terminus [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AV356684">AV356684</ext-link>] and the alternative mPR59 C-terminus [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BB357167">BB357167</ext-link>], making it rather unlikely that murine B" family members containing these termini (mPR130/B"&#x003b1;3, mPR72/B"&#x003b1;4 and mPR59/B"&#x003b4;4) do abundantly exist. In contrast, five EST-clones of the specific N-terminus of mPR59/B"&#x003b4;3 and multiple (&#x0003e; 15) EST-clones of the other B"-specific N- and C-termini were found, suggesting that mPR72/B"&#x003b1;2, mPR130/B"&#x003b1;1, mG5PR/B"&#x003b3;, mPR59/B"&#x003b4;1, PR59/B"&#x003b4;2, and PR59/B"&#x003b4;3 are much more abundant, and probably represent the main murine B" isoforms.</p><p>Since mPR59/B"&#x003b4;1 and mPR59/B"&#x003b4;3 are putatively novel, and to further confirm their existence, we performed a reverse transcription on NIH 3T3 and murine heart RNA using primer E<sub>3 </sub>annealing in the mPR59 3' UTR. With the resulting cDNAs as templates and the use of five different primers, annealing with the specific N-termini of PR59/B"&#x003b4;1&#x02013;4 (B<sub>&#x003b4;1</sub>, B<sub>&#x003b4;2</sub>, B<sub>&#x003b4;3/4</sub>) and/or the specific C-termini of PR59/B"&#x003b4;1&#x02013;3 (E<sub>2</sub>) and PR59/B"&#x003b4;4 (E<sub>1</sub>), we were able to generate several DNA fragments, which after sequencing, were shown to correspond to PR59/B"&#x003b4;1, PR59/B"&#x003b4;2 and PR59/B"&#x003b4;3. <italic>In vitro </italic>transcription-translation reactions of these cDNAs revealed proteins of about 60 kDa (PR59/B"&#x003b4;1), 55 kDa (PR59/B"&#x003b4;2) and 40 kDa (PR59/B"&#x003b4;3) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), implying that not only the messengers of PR59/B"&#x003b4;1,&#x003b4;2,&#x003b4;3 are present in murine cells, but that they can also be translated into proteins.

No other specific bands could be observed, even upon prolonged exposure, confirming our <italic>in silico </italic>and RT-PCR analysis. Consequently, it can be concluded that should the mPR130/B"&#x003b1;3 and/or mPR72/B"&#x003b1;4 isoforms exist, their expression would be very low or highly restricted in time and/or space.</p><p>Together, six main B" family members are present in mice: mPR130/B"&#x003b1;1, mPR72/B"&#x003b1;2, mG5PR/B"&#x003b3;, mPR59/B"&#x003b4;1, mPR59/B"&#x003b4;2 and mPR59/B"&#x003b4;3, with mPR59/B"&#x003b4;1 and &#x003b4;3 being novel ones.

To retain the logic in the PR72/B" gene nomenclature, we propose to rename this gene into <italic>Ppp2r3a</italic>, analogous to the human <italic>PPP2R3A </italic>gene. The mPR130/PR72 gene is located on chromosome 9F1 (101 Mb). This region corresponds to human chromosome 3q22, where <italic>PPP2R3A </italic>is located. The mPR130/PR72 gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) spans approximately 106 kb and consists of 15 exons. In addition to the exons giving rise to mPR130/B"&#x003b1;1 and mPR72/B"&#x003b1;2, we could also locate both the exon containing the sequence of the 12 specific C-terminal amino acids of mPR130/B"&#x003b1;3 (exon 2), and the exon responsible for the premature ending of PR72/B"&#x003b1;4 (exon 14B) at the correct sites within the gene. Since PR72/B"&#x003b1;2 is the result of an intra-exonic splicing event within exon 14, PR72/B"&#x003b1;4 might well be the result of a splicing error at this position, possibly explaining its low abundance. In the human PR130/PR72 gene (<italic>PPP2R3A</italic>), the exon responsible for the putative generation of a human PR72/B"&#x003b1;4 isoform is also present. The NCBI human EST database contains exactly one EST [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CA427549">CA427549</ext-link>] containing this exon. In contrast, no sign of the specific C-terminal tail of either mPR130/B"&#x003b1;3 or XN73 could be found in <italic>PPP2R3A</italic>. In addition, no human EST-clones were retrieved containing the PR130-specific N-terminus followed by nucleotides other than those of the common part of PR130 and PR72.</p><p>To unravel the genomic organisation of the murine PR59 gene (MGI: 1335093), we analysed NCBI contig NW_001030923. Currently, this gene's symbol is <italic>Ppp2r3a</italic>, but as one could easily mistake it for the murine orthologue of <italic>PPP2R3A</italic>, we propose to change its name into <italic>Ppp2r3d </italic>(see also further). This gene spans approximately 9 kb and consists of 13 exons. The exons encoding the complete sequences of all mPR59 isoforms were found at the appropriate locations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). To find the human <italic>Ppp2r3d </italic>homologue, we scanned the human genome using the BLASTN program with the different mPR59 isoforms as input. The closest match was the human PR70/PPP2R3L product gene (<italic>PPP2R3B/L</italic>), followed by the human PR130/PR72 gene (<italic>PPP2R3A</italic>), confirming the similarity between PR70/PPP2R3L and mPR59 at the genomic level. Therefore, the murine <italic>Ppp2r3d </italic>and the human <italic>PPP2R3B/L </italic>gene may have evolved from a common ancestor gene. This hypothesis looks promising since to our knowledge no organism contains both a PR70/PPP2R3L product and a PR59-encoding gene. A phylogenetic tree, based on the protein sequences of various PR72/B" family members in man and mouse, further supports this hypothesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic tree (MULTALIN)</bold>.

The conserved region, which contains two ASBDs and two EF-hand motifs, is necessary for PR65/A binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Since the first ASBD is not intact in mPR59/B"&#x003b4;3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), we wondered whether this isoform is still able to bind PP2A. To this end, we made GST-fusion proteins of the main B" family members and overexpressed these in COS-7 cells. After a GST-pull down assay, we evaluated the binding of both the PR65/A and catalytic subunit of PP2A via Western blotting. As expected, all main B" isoforms (hPR130, hPR72, hPR70, mG5PR/B"&#x003b3;, mPR59/B"&#x003b4;1 and mPR59/B"&#x003b4;2) bind PP2A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), and are therefore genuine B" subunits. In contrast, mPR59/B"&#x003b4;3 fails to bind PP2A, suggesting it is not a regulatory subunit of PP2A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Like XN73 and mPR130/B"&#x003b1;3, it might be involved in regulation of PP2A by competing with the other mPR59 isoforms for binding to other binding partners.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Association of the main human and murine PR72/B" isoforms with PP2A<sub>D</sub></bold>.

To evaluate whether these bands represent the I- or A-bands, we counterstained the sections with iron hematoxylin. This dye gives the A-band a dark blue colour and colocalises with mPR130/B"&#x003b1;1 and mPR72/B"&#x003b1;2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B, f&#x02013;g</xref>).

This band probably represents the H-zone. In sections of murine myocardium, a similar striated staining pattern could be observed in the longitudinally positioned muscle fibers. Cross-sectional muscle fibers did not show staining of any specific structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, h&#x02013;i</xref>).

Since the PR130 AB is suitable for direct immunofluorescence, we also evaluated the subcellular localisation of endogenous PR130 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], hPR72 is mainly present in the nucleus (N &#x0003e;&#x0003e; CP). PR130 is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (N &#x0003e; CP). mPR59/B"&#x003b4;1 (CP = N) and mPR59/B"&#x003b4;2 (CP &#x0003e; N) appear both in cytoplasm and nucleus but are clearly less abundant in the nucleus than hPR72 and PR130. mG5PR/B"&#x003b3; is more abundant in the nucleus than the cytoplasm (N &#x0003e; CP), corresponding to earlier published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and additionally is highly abundant in the cell periphery.

Although the B-type subunits can be classified into three distinct gene families (PR55/B, PR61/B' and PR72/B"), their still increasing number, the sometimes confusing nomenclature and species-specific differences add to the complexity, especially for the non-specialist. In particular, for the PR72/B" subunit family the current situation may be confusing. With the aim to make this more clear and at the same time to provide a platform for the generation of B" knockout mice, we have presented here a comprehensive overview of the murine B" family members-in analogy to previous reports of the murine B' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] families.</p><p>In addition to the previously described murine-specific PR59 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and the murine orthologues of PR130, PR72 and G5PR, we have identified two novel splice variants of mPR59 as members of the murine B" family. Based on the genomic organisation of the <italic>Ppp2r3d </italic>gene, we named the original isoform PR59/B"&#x003b4;2 and the novel isoforms PR59/B"&#x003b4;1 and PR59/B"&#x003b4;3. In contrast to PR59/B"&#x003b4;1 and &#x003b4;2, no <italic>in vivo </italic>interaction of PR59/B"&#x003b4;3 with PP2A could be observed. Consequently, PR59/B"&#x003b4;3 can not be considered as a regulatory subunit of PP2A. In addition, other potential murine B" family members (mPR130/B"&#x003b1;3, mPR72/B"&#x003b1;4 and mPR59/B"&#x003b4;4) were found to be present in the NCBI EST database. Although genomic evidence for these isoforms could be found, our attempts to confirm their existence at either the mRNA or protein level failed. This suggests that these isoforms are poorly expressed or might result from splicing errors. Nevertheless, we can not exclude the possibility that their expression is missed because of a tight regulation or restriction in space and/or time. Moreover, the existence of two B" isoforms (PR130/B"&#x003b1;3 and PR59/B"&#x003b4;3) which do not interact with the PP2A core dimer, gives further support to the idea that B" subunits can exist- and be stable-independently of PP2A and that their function might extend beyond regulation of phosphatase activity as such (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] for a discussion). Even if so far only minute amounts of these atypical unexpected messages could be detected, specific conditions might lead to an upregulation and possible functional consequences.</p><p>To our surprise, no murine orthologues of human PR70 or PPP2R3L product could be found. These gene products arise from the <italic>PPP2R3B/L </italic>gene, and according to the genomic organisation of <italic>PPP2R3B/L</italic>, we propose to rename these two N-terminal splice variants PR70/B"&#x003b2;1 and PR70/B"&#x003b2;2 respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Several arguments suggest that the murine <italic>Ppp2r3d </italic>gene (PR59) originates from a common ancestor of the human <italic>PPP2R3B/L </italic>gene (PR70), the <italic>Canis familiaris PPP2R3B </italic>gene (PR70) and the <italic>Xenopus laevis LOC398610 </italic>gene (PR70): (1) none of these organisms contain both the genes responsible for the expression of PR59 and PR70 isoforms; (2) these genes share the highest degree of homology amongst the B" members, both on the protein as well as on the genomic level; (3) from both genes, two B" regulatory subunits arise by using alternative first exons; and (4) human PR70/B"&#x003b2;1 can interact with and regulate the phosphorylation status of pRb while murine PR59/B"&#x003b4;2 can associate with and regulate the phosphorylation status of p107, another member of the retinoblastoma family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, they may share some functional similarities. Despite these similarities, we do not consider PR59 as the murine orthologue of PR70. This is based on (1) the rather low sequence homology between the specific N-terminal regions of the different PR59 and PR70 isoforms and (2) the ubiquitous expression of both PR59 regulatory subunits in contrast to the skeletal muscle and heart-specific expression of hPR70/B"&#x003b2;2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For these reasons, we suggested to rename the PR59-encoding gene <italic>Ppp2r3d</italic>, instead of <italic>Ppp2r3b</italic>. Because of the diversity between mice and humans, it can be concluded that in contrast with the PP2A PR55/B and PR61/B' families, the PR72/B" family represents a less evolutionary conserved group of proteins.

As mentioned earlier, we propose to change the murine PR72/B" gene names in such a way that the relationship with their human counterparts becomes clearer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). As for the PR72/B" proteins, until now, most of them have been named according to their molecular weight (with G5PR as an exception to this rule). In this report, we would like to propose a nomenclature which is in accordance with the corresponding gene name and the organisation of that gene, and is consistent with the nomenclature of the proteins of the PR55/B and PR61/B' families. For historical reasons we prefer to keep the original and commonly known PR130, PR72, PR70, PR59 and G5PR protein names combined with the B" indication and an additional specification (Greek letter) to denote the specific isoform. As such, B" proteins encoded by the <italic>PPP2R3A </italic>gene (PR130 and PR72) will get the '&#x003b1;' extension, followed by a number to designate the specific splice variant; B" proteins encoded by the <italic>PPP2R3B </italic>gene (PR70) get the '&#x003b2;' extension etc. For the comfort of the authors and readers, once in a manuscript the subunit is clearly defined, the short names B"&#x003b1;1, B"&#x003b3;1 etc. can be used. In Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, a summary of the (old and new) murine and human B" nomenclature is given. If one intents to indicate the whole family, one can use PR72/B" as a common denominator since this makes an unequivocal distinction with the other B-type third subunits: PR55/B and PR61/B'.</p><p>We have also investigated the tissue distribution and developmental expression of all murine PP2A PR72/B" subunits on the RNA level. Taking together previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and our northern blot analyses, it can be concluded that mPR130/B"&#x003b1;1, hPR130/B"&#x003b1;1, mPR59/B"&#x003b4;1, mPR59/B"&#x003b4;2, mG5PR/B"&#x003b3; and XPR70/B"&#x003b2;1 are ubiquitously expressed, indicating that these subunits are involved in general cellular processes. In contrast, mPR72/B"&#x003b1;2, hPR72/B"&#x003b1;2, and hPR70/B"&#x003b2;2 are highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and barely detectable in other tissues, suggesting a specific role for these subunits in striated muscle tissues. In fact, all B" subunits seem to be highly expressed in heart, an observation which is given the presence of two EF-hands in their primary structures and their regulation by Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ions, of particular interest.</p><p>Immunohistochemical analysis of longitudinal fibers of murine heart and skeletal muscle showed a striated pattern for mPR130/B"&#x003b1;1 and mPR72/B"&#x003b1;2. Counterstaining with iron hematoxylin revealed that they both colocalise with the A-band. In contrast to the I-band, the A-band does not only contain thin, actin-rich filaments but also thick, myosine-rich filaments. mPR130/B"&#x003b1;1 and mPR72/B"&#x003b1;2 staining is virtually absent in the smooth muscle of the bladder, suggesting that these subunits may play a specific role in striated muscle contraction only. Although mPR130/B"&#x003b1;1 and mPR72/B"&#x003b1;2 stain the nuclei in longitudinal as well as cross sections of heart and skeletal muscle, their nuclear localisation in these tissues is less pronounced compared to cultured fibroblast cell lines, probably due to their relatively high abundance in the contractile apparatus.</p><p>During embryogenesis no significant differences in expression from E7 until E17 could be observed for transcripts of mG5PR/B"&#x003b3;, mPR59/B"&#x003b4;1 and mPR59/B"&#x003b4;2, indicating that the expression of these proteins is not regulated during early embryonic development. Meanwhile, mPR130/B"&#x003b1;1 and mPR72/B"&#x003b1;2 expression increases from E7 to E17. This might imply a role for these proteins during early embryogenesis. Alternatively, protein levels of these isoforms are simply building up for a more maximal expression during late development or after birth. In accordance with this increased expression during embryogenesis, depletion of XPR72 in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos caused several severe developmental defects (defects in somite formation, a short axis phenotype and lack of eye differentiation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Depletion of XPR130 resulted in milder developmental defects such as a disruption of somite organisation and an underdeveloped tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Together these data provide valuable information that will aid in the development of suitable strategies to generate future B" knockout mice, as well as in their phenotypic analysis.</p><p>At the cellular level, we have also determined the subcellular localisation of the main murine and human B" subunits via expression of EGFP-fusion proteins in COS7 cells (for PR72/B"&#x003b1;2, G5PR/B"&#x003b3;, PR70/B"&#x003b2;1, PR59/B"&#x003b4;1 and PR59/B"&#x003b4;2) or via indirect immunofluorescence (for PR130/B"&#x003b1;1). A high diversity was observed: whereas PR130/B"&#x003b1;1, PR72/B"&#x003b1;2 and G5PR/B"&#x003b3; are predominantly nuclear, PR59/B"&#x003b4;1 is equally well expressed in the cytoplasm, and PR70/B"&#x003b2;1 and PR59/B"&#x003b4;2 are predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm. The latter observation further extends the relationship and functional homology between these two isoforms. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic localisation of PR70/B"&#x003b2;1 is in contrast with the reported nuclear localisation of its truncated PR48 form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], suggesting that nuclear import/export of PR70 isoforms may be a regulated event. Further, putative nuclear localisation signals are predicted in G5PR/B"&#x003b3; (mono- and bipartite), PR130/B"&#x003b1;1 and PR72/B"&#x003b1;2 (monopartite), but not in PR59/B"&#x003b4;1, PR59/B"&#x003b4;2 or PR70/B"&#x003b2;1, whereas a nuclear export signal is predicted in the common part of PR59/B"&#x003b4;1 and PR59/B"&#x003b4;2. Although the functionality of these motifs remains to be determined, their putative occurrence/absence fits quite well with our experimental observations.</p><p>Upon overexpression, all B" subunits tested can induce a G1/S cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells, suggesting that this property may be independent of their subcellular localisation. The failure to proceed to S-phase may be related to the suggestion that many B" subunits play roles in DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the mechanism of this induced cell cycle arrest may equally well be the result of a dominant negative effect, such as for instance a competition between 'free' B" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and trimeric B" for binding a substrate, or competition between B" and other B-type subunits for binding to PP2A<sub>D</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the murine PR72/B" family exhibits an equal complexity and diversity as the PR55/B and PR61/B' families of PP2A subunits, with three genes encoding nine isoforms/splice variants, of which at least five are abundantly expressed and give rise to genuine PP2A subunits. An important difference with the PR55/B and PR61/B' families however, is the poorer relationship between human and murine genes, which might indicate that the B" family is evolutionary more divergent. Moreover, the diversity of PR72/B" members does not only originate from the number of isoforms, but extends to their specific tissue distribution, developmental expression and subcellular localisation. These differences add to the notion that no matter how similar their primary structures may be, different PP2A B-type isoforms likely display different <italic>in vivo </italic>functions.
