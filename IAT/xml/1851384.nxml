According to a 2002 estimate, more than 1,100,000 patients were newly diagnosed with breast cancer, and approximately 410,000 patients died of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent improvements in detecting breast cancer at an early stage through mammographic screening have contributed to a decrease in breast cancer-associated mortality. Mastectomy is among the first options for treatment of localized breast cancer. Despite surgical removal of primary tumors, however, relapse at local or distant sites occurs in a subset of patients, probably due to undetectable micrometastases at the time of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Cancer therapies directed at specific molecular targets in signaling pathways of cancer cells, such as tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors and trastuzumab (Herceptin), have been proven to be useful for treatment of advanced breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors suppress the estrogen-related signaling pathway and trastuzumab is the first approved monoclonal antibody for blocking the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2/ErbB-2) signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Patients with tumors that express estrogen or HER-2 receptors can benefit from either of these therapies and are expected to have a better quality of life and prognosis. However, increased risk of endometrial cancer with long-term tamoxifen administration and of bone fracture due to osteoporosis in postmenopausal women undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy are recognized side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Due to the emergence of these side effects and also because of drug resistance, it is necessary to search for novel molecular targets for drugs on the basis of well-characterized mechanisms of action.</p><p>Toward the goal of identifying good molecular targets for drug development, we analyzed the detailed expression profiles of 81 breast tumors, representing 23,040 genes, using a combination of laser-microbeam microdissection and cDNA microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. After comparing the expression profiles of these breast cancers with those of various normal human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we focused on a gene termed <italic>maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase </italic>(<italic>MELK</italic>) that was significantly overexpressed in the great majority of breast cancer cases examined.</p><p>In this study, we report evidence indicating that MELK functions as a cancer-specific protein kinase, and that down-regulation of <italic>MELK </italic>results in growth suppression of breast cancer cells. In addition, we demonstrate that MELK physically interacts and phosphorylates a long isoform of Bcl-G (Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Our findings suggest that the kinase activity of MELK is likely to affect mammary carcinogenesis through inhibition of the pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>. We propose that MELK kinase activity could be a promising molecular target for the treatment of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cancer cell lines and clinical samples</title><p>Human breast cancer cell lines HBL100, HCC1937, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435S, SKBR3, T47D, YMB1, BSY-1 and BT-20, human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line, HeLa, and monkey kidney cells transformed with SV40 T-antigen, COS7 cells, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).

The <italic>MELK </italic>gene (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_014791">NM_014791</ext-link>) was found to be one of the genes transactivated at a very high level in the great majority of the breast cancers examined. The subsequent semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the transcript confirmed the elevated expression of <italic>MELK </italic>in 11 of 12 clinical breast cancer specimens (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the expression pattern of this gene in breast cancer cell lines and normal tissues, we performed Northern blot analyses with mRNAs from multiple human tissues and breast cancer cell lines using a cDNA fragment corresponding to the 3' untranslated region of the <italic>MELK </italic>gene as a probe. The results showed that an approximately 2.7 kb band was most highly expressed in testis, and weakly expressed in thymus and small intestine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Interestingly, Northern blot analyses of breast cancer cell lines using the same probe showed that 2.4 to 2.7 kb bands were significantly over-expressed in breast cancer cells but were not expressed in vital organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>), indicating that some cancer specific transcripts are present over this range.</p><p>To characterize the variants specifically transcribed in breast cancer cells, we screened a cDNA library of breast cancer cells. Subsequent cDNA sequencing analysis identified three different transcriptional variants, designated V1 (2,501 bp; NM_014791), V2 (2,368 bp; AB183427) and V3 (2,251 bp; AB183428). These three different transcriptional variants consist of 18, 17 and 16 exons, respectively. The V2 variant lacks exon 3 (86 bp) and the V3 variant lacks exon 3 (86 bp) and exon 4 (117 bp) as a result of alternative splicing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). The V2 and V3 variants contain early stop codons (TGA) in exon 4 and exon 5, respectively, if they are translated from the same first ATG codon of the V1 variant. However, if they are translated from a second ATG codon located downstream of the first ATG codon of the V1 variant, the V2 and V3 variant proteins are thought to produce 618 and 581 amino acid peptides, respectively. Thus, to examine both possibilities, we carried out an <italic>in vitro </italic>translation assay and found that the V1, V2 and V3 proteins were 75, 71 and 66 kDa, respectively, indicating that the V2 and V3 proteins were translated from the second ATG codon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we examined MELK expression in breast cancer cell lines by western blot analysis with anti-MELK polyclonal antibodies. The results indicate that the V1 protein is dominantly overexpressed in breast cancer cells compared with the V2 and V3 proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>). Furthermore, although all of the three variant proteins possess the KA1 domain in their carboxyl terminus, the V2 and V3 proteins lack the amino-terminal portion, which corresponds to the first 48 amino acids of the V1 protein and is considered to be the catalytic kinase domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g</xref>). Although we can not rule out the possibility that the V2 and V3 variants have some functional role in carcinogenesis, for example, dominant-negative functions, in this study we focus on the kinase activity of the V1 transcript due to its predominant expression in cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Growth-inhibitory effects of siRNA against <italic>MELK</italic></title><p>To assess a possible role of <italic>MELK </italic>in mammary carcinogenesis, we knocked down the expression of endogenous <italic>MELK </italic>in the breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,b</xref>), in which <italic>MELK </italic>was overexpressed at a high level, by means of the mammalian vector-based RNAi technique (see Materials and methods). We examined expression levels of <italic>MELK </italic>by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses, and found that the <italic>MELK</italic>-siRNAs si-#3 and si-#4 significantly reduced its expression at the transcriptional and protein levels compared with scramble-siRNA (SC), si-#1 and si-#2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Comparison of silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels containing the pulled-down proteins identified an approximately 30 kDa protein in the lane corresponding to proteins pulled-down with WT-MELK but not in that corresponding to proteins pulled-down with D150A-MELK (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). MALDI-TOF analysis showed this 30 kDa protein to be Bcl-G, a member of the Bcl-2 protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. According to NCBI database, <italic>Bcl-G </italic>has three alternative splicing isoforms, termed <italic>Bcl-G </italic>short isoform (<italic>Bcl-G</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>), median isoform (<italic>Bcl-G</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) and long isoform (<italic>Bcl-G</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>), and encoding 252, 276 and 327 amino acid peptides, respectively.</p><p>We first examined the expression patterns of these <italic>Bcl-G </italic>isoforms at the transcriptional level in breast cancer cell lines by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and found that <italic>Bcl-G</italic><sub><italic>S </italic></sub>and <italic>Bcl-G</italic><sub><italic>L </italic></sub>were expressed in all breast cancer cells examined, whereas the <italic>Bcl-G</italic><sub><italic>m </italic></sub>transcript was not detected at all (data not shown). Furthermore, we examined expression of endogenous Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>in breast cancer cell lines at the protein level by western blot analysis using an anti-Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>antibody and detected an approximately 30 kDa endogenous Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>, corresponding to the size identified by protein pull-down experiment, in all the breast cancer cell lines examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Therefore, we focused on Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>as a candidate interacting protein for MELK.</p><p>To validate an interaction between WT-MELK and Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>, we constructed plasmids designed to express HA-tagged WT-MELK (HA-WT-MELK) and Flag-tagged Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>(Flag-Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>). These plasmids were co-transfected into HeLa cells and the proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. Immunoblotting of the precipitates using anti-HA antibodies indicated that Flag-Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>was co-precipitated with HA-WT-MELK (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrated that His-tagged WT-MELK could pull-down with Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>but His-tagged D150A-MELK could not, indicating that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>interacts directly with WT-MELK but not with D150A-MELK (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>). To further determine which segment of Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>can interact with WT-MELK, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analyses using HA-WT-MELK and partial Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>proteins tagged with Flag (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>). After co-transfection of plasmid clones into HeLa cells, we performed immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody, and then immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. We found that the N-1 construct (amino acids 12 to 327) as well as a full-length Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>(FL) bound to WT-MELK, whereas N-2 (amino acids 72 to 324), N-3 (amino acids 121 to 327) or N-4 (amino acids 171 to 327) did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref>). Concordantly, all of the partial products that contained the amino-terminal portion of Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>&#x02013; C-1 (amino acids 1 to 305), C-2 (amino acids 1 to 295), and C-3 (amino acids 1 to 215) bound to WT-MELK (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref>). These results suggest that the region corresponding to amino acids 12 to 71 of Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>is likely to interact with WT-MELK.</p></sec><sec><title>MELK phosphorylates Bcl-G<sub>L</sub></title><p>To examine whether the Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>protein is a substrate of MELK kinase activity, we performed an immune complex kinase assay. We first confirmed the exogenous expression of Flag-tagged Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>(Flag-Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>) by western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, WT-MELK could phosphorylate Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>, but D150A-MELK could not (single arrowhead). In addition, autophosphorylation of an approximately 75 kDa protein of MELK was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>; double arrowheads). Furthermore, we also confirmed that WT-MELK could phosphorylate GST-Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>but D150A-MELK could not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>), indicating MELK can directly phosphorylate Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>. These findings suggest that Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>is a potential substrate for MELK.</p><p>We subsequently examined WT-MELK kinase activity on various partial amino-terminal Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>products (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>). First, we confirmed the amount of immunoprecipitated protein corresponding to partial Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>(N-1, N-2, N-3 and N-4) as well as to full-length Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>(FL) by western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref>), and then examined the extent of their phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). The MELK recombinant protein phosphorylated N-1 as well as full-length Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>, whereas it could not phosphorylate N-2, N-3 or N-4 proteins, corresponding with their inability to interact.</p></sec><sec><title>MELK involvement in the apoptotic pathway through Bcl-G<sub>L</sub></title><p>Because MELK can physically interact with and phosphorylate Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), we hypothesized that it might be involved in the apoptosis cascade through the Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>-related pathway. To investigate this hypothesis, we transiently co-transfected two plasmid clones designed to express HA-tagged MELK (WT or D150A) and Flag-tagged Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>into COS7 cells, and then performed a TUNEL assay and FACS analysis to measure the proportions of apoptotic cells (see Material and methods). We first confirmed the exogenous expression of MELK and Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>in COS7 cells by western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). As indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b,c</xref>, the overexpression of full-length Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>(HA-Mock+Flag-Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>) significantly increased the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells compared with the cells transfected with the mock plasmids (HA-Mock+Flag-Mock), indicating that Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>induces apoptosis, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast, the co-overexpression of WT-MELK with Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>(HA-WT-MELK+Flag-Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>) reduced the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells compared with over-expression of Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>alone (HA-Mock+Flag-Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>) (<italic>P </italic>= 0.0001, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). However, the co-overexpression of D150A-MELK with Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>(HA-D150A-MELK+Flag-Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>) did not affect the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>, FACS analysis of the cells under the same conditions also confirmed that the overexpression of Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>increased the sub-G1 population of cells compared with the mock-transfected cells. Similarly to the TUNEL analysis, the overexpression of WT-MELK with Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>reduced the proportion of sub-G1 cells (<italic>P </italic>= 0.03, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test), while D150A-MELK increased the sub-G1 population. Our results imply that the kinase activity of MELK may play a critical role in the regulation of the pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Microarray technologies applied to the study of cancer have contributed to the discovery of genes that play essential roles in carcinogenesis, the discovery of novel molecular target(s) for the development of anti-cancer agents and/or diagnosis, and the identification of genes related to chemo- or radio-sensitivity. Although such information has been applied in the development of novel therapeutic agents for breast cancer, the range of available treatments for advanced-stage patients is still very limited. Thus, it is urgent that further molecular targets are discovered to enable development of new anti-cancer drugs that are specific for malignant cells with a minimum risk of adverse reactions.</p><p>Using genome-wide expression profiles of breast cancers and normal human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we identified <italic>MELK</italic>, one of the transcripts of which was specifically up-regulated in the great majority of clinical breast cancer samples, but expressed in none of 29 normal human tissues examined except testis, thymus and small intestine.</p><p>In this study, we characterize the biological function of MELK and indicate that it would be a good candidate as a molecular target for breast cancer therapy, although there would be some concerns over intestinal adverse reactions. We demonstrated by means of siRNA that knockdown of endogenous MELK expression results in growth suppression of breast cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Furthermore, our cDNA microarray data indicate that <italic>MELK </italic>is also up-regulated relatively frequently in bladder cancers, osteosarcoma and small cell lung cancers (data not shown). Together, these findings suggest that <italic>MELK </italic>has an oncogenic role in not only breast cancers but also bladder cancers, bone cancers and small cell lung cancers.</p><p><italic>MELK </italic>was previously identified as a new member of the snf1/AMPK serine-threonine kinase family that is involved in mammalian embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This gene was shown to play an important role in hematopoiesis, stem cell renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and cell-cycle progression through an interaction with zinc finger-like protein ZPR9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and splicing factor NIPP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To investigate the expression pattern of these proteins in breast cancer cells, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and observed no significant correlation of gene expression between <italic>MELK </italic>and these interacting molecules in breast cancer cells (data not shown). Thus, to investigate the biological significance of MELK in breast cancer cells, we searched for a possible substrate(s) of MELK by means of <italic>in vitro </italic>pull-down assays with recombinant wild-type MELK (WT-MELK) and kinase-dead MELK (D150A-MELK). We identified a long isoform of Bcl-G (Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as a potential substrate for MELK. In addition to physical interaction between these two proteins, <italic>in vitro </italic>immune complex kinase and <italic>in vitro </italic>binding assays showed that Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>was directly bound to MELK and specifically phosphorylated by it <italic>in vitro </italic>(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a,b</xref>).</p><p>As reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we demonstrated by TUNEL assay and FACS analysis that introduction of full-length Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>into COS7 cells induced apoptosis. However, under the same conditions, addition of exogenous WT-MELK suppressed induction of apoptosis by Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>, but addition of D150A-MELK did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b&#x02013;d</xref>). Thus, we speculate that MELK might promote cell growth by inhibiting the pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-G<sub>L </sub>through its phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings clearly suggest that <italic>MELK </italic>is overexpressed in both breast cancer specimens and cancer cell lines, and that its kinase activity possibly plays a significant role in breast cancer cell growth. Recent anti-cancer drug development is focused on targeting important molecules involved in the oncogenic pathways, represented by imatinib mesylate and trastuzumab. We found that down-regulation of <italic>MELK </italic>by treatment with siRNA significantly suppressed the cell growth of breast cancer, indicating its crucial role in the proliferation and tumorgenesis of breast cancer. In particular, we demonstrate a new biological function for <italic>MELK </italic>in breast carcinogenesis, the inhibition of apoptosis though its interaction with and phosphorylation of Bcl-G<sub>L</sub>, a pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family. Our data should contribute to a better understanding of breast carcinogenesis, and they suggest that <italic>MELK </italic>is a promising molecular target for breast cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>&#x003b2;2MG = beta-2-microglobulin; DTT = dithiothreitol; GST = glutathione S-transferase; Her-2/ErbB-2 = epidermal growth factor 2; HMEC = human mammary epithelial cell; MTT = 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi = RNA interference; SC = scramble control.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LML performed all experiments and drafted the manuscript.
