On a global scale, cataracts are the leading cause of blindness, accounting for approximately 48% of all blindness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Around three-quarters of the world<sup>&#x02019;</sup>s blind children live in developing countries in Africa and Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Although congenital cataract is much less common than age-related cataract, it is still responsible for approximately one tenth of childhood blindness worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Isolated congenital cataracts tend to be highly penetrant Mendelian traits, with autosomal dominant more common than autosomal recessive and X linked inheritance cataracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>].</p><p>Most progress has been made in identifying the genes causing autosomal dominant congenital cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Of the cataract families for whom the mutant gene is known, about half have mutations in crystallins, about a quarter have mutations in connexins, with the remainder divided among the genes for heat shock transcription factor-4 (<italic>HSF4</italic>), aquaporin-0 (<italic>AQP0, MIP</italic>), and beaded filament structural protein-2 (<italic>BFSP2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p><p>Crystallins are known to constitute about 90% of the water-soluble proteins of the lens and contribute to transparency and refractive properties due to a uniform concentration gradient in the lens. The vertebrate crystallins are divided into two families: <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-crystallins and &#x003b2;&#x003b3;-crystallins. In addition to being refractive proteins in the lens, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-crystallins are molecular chaperones and function as protective proteins against physiological stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Vertebrate lens &#x003b2;&#x003b3;-crystallins have two domains, each comprising two structural motifs with signature folds called 'Greek keys' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. The relative position of the two domains in &#x003b3;B- and &#x003b2;B2-crystallins (&#x003b3;B and &#x003b2;B2) differs in crystallographic structures, having either &#x02018;closed&#x02019; or &#x02018;opened&#x02019; conformation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. &#x003b2;&#x003b3;-Crystallins are more heterogeneous with seven subunits (four acidic &#x003b2;A1-, &#x003b2;A2-, &#x003b2;A3-, and &#x003b2;A4-crystallin, and three basic &#x003b2;B1-, &#x003b2;B2-, and &#x003b2;B3-crystallin) in the heterooligomeric &#x003b2;-crystallin and six subunits (&#x003b3;A-&#x003b3;F-crystallin) in the monomeric &#x003b3;-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>].</p><p>In the lens, crystallins interact to generate a gradient of refractive index so that light can focus to the retina with minimal scattering. Also protein interactions enhance protein stability or solubility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>B2 is the major &#x003b2;-crystallin in the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>] and is the least modified during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. It is also the most soluble of all the &#x003b2;-crystallins, remaining soluble during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], and is needed to maintain the solubility of hetero-oligomers during isolation. There is a tendency for other &#x003b2;-crystallins to precipitate when separated from &#x003b2;B2. This has led to the proposal of a role for &#x003b2;B2 in maintaining the solubility of other &#x003b2;-crystallins that are heavily modified during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>Crystallins are excellent candidate genes for inherited cataracts because of their high lens expression. Many congenital cataract crystallin mutations have been reported; a missense mutation in <italic>CRYBB2</italic> (Q155X) has been identified in three unrelated families with ADCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, the phenotype in each family is very different despite the identical mutation indicating that other modifier genes are likely to influence the cataract phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Another mutation in &#x003b2;B2-crystallin, W151C has been reported recently in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] and V187E in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Herein, we report the identification (by functional candidate gene analysis) of a novel missense mutation (G607A) in exon 6 of <italic>CRYBB2</italic> that led to an exchange of Val for Met (V187M) as the probable cause of the disease in this family. The majority of visually impaired people live in developing countries, and since most disorders leading to visual impairment are preventable or curable; their control is a priority in these countries. Better understanding of genetic and environmental influences in pathogenesis of congenital and infantile cataract in developing countries may highlight the importance of ophthalmic examination of parents and family members of otherwise healthy children with cataract, to ensure hereditary cases are not overlooked so that genetic counseling may be provided. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of nuclear cataracts associated with the <italic>CRYBB2</italic> mutation (V187M) affecting a three-generation Basotho family in Lesotho.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>The three generation Basotho family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) was enrolled from Maluti Adventist Hospital, Lesotho.

A detailed medical history was obtained by interviewing all family members. Cataracts in affected individuals were either present at birth or developed during childhood. Affected status was determined by ophthalmologic examination, which included visual acuity, slit lamp and fundus examination with the dilated pupil. Slit lamp examination of the affected lenses revealed a bilateral nuclear cataract phenotype.

Briefly, four discs of about 6 mm in diameter were punched out from S&#x00026;S 903 specimen collection paper stained with dried blood. To prevent DNA contamination, the paper punch was sterilized first by punching out a clean paper at least fifteen times and then by alcohol burner flame after each separate paper punch. The isolated DNA was then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the exons (and their flanking regions) of <italic>CRYGC</italic>, <italic>CRYGD</italic>, <italic>CRYAA</italic>, <italic>CRYAB</italic>, <italic>CRYBA1, CRYBB1, CRYBB2</italic> and <italic>GJA8</italic>. Primers for PCR amplification of exon 6 of the <italic>CRYBB2</italic> were as follows: forward; 5'-CAC TGT GTC CAA GGT CAC ACA GCT AAG C-3' and reverse; 5'-CCC CTC GTT CAC CCT CCC ATC A-3'. The cycling conditions for PCR included a 95 <sup>o</sup>C preactivation of the enzyme for 3 min, 10 cycles of touchdown PCR with a 1 <sup>o</sup>C decrement of the annealing temperature per cycle from 70 <sup>o</sup>C to 61 <sup>o</sup>C, then maintained at 60 <sup>o</sup>C for 20 more cycles. Each cycle consisted of a denaturation at 94 <sup>o</sup>C, annealing step and extension at 72 <sup>o</sup>C, all for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 <sup>o</sup>C for 10 min. PCR products obtained from the proband and one unaffected member of the family with these primers were sequenced using ABI Genetic Analyzer 3730 (Invitrogene Ltd, Shanghai, China). The sequencing results were analyzed using Chromas 2.3 and compared with the reference sequence in the NCBI database. The mutation was confirmed by the presence of the cleavage site for the restriction enzyme NIaIII (New England BioLabs, Beijing, China) in the other participating affected family members. For control, we analyzed 100 DNA samples from ophthalmologically normal individuals of the same ethnic background as the family members. The mutation was further analyzed in 40 senile cataract patients by restriction fragment length polymorphism.

The proband (II:1), a 44-year-old male, was diagnosed with bilateral cataract at his first decade of life. Later on, his female sib also complained of blurred vision in her early teens. The two children (a girl and a boy) of the proband and the son of the proband&#x02019;s sister also suffered from congenital cataract from birth. Apart from congenital cataract, the proband and his two children (III:1 &#x00026; III:2) also presented with strabismus.

However, bidirectional sequencing of exon 6 of <italic>CRYBB2</italic> in one of the affected individual (II:1) showed a heterozygous change at position 607 (c. 607G&#x02192;A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, the mutation was not seen in a healthy family member (III:4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). The mutation was confirmed by an NIaIII digest of the PCR amplified exon 6 of <italic>CRYBB2</italic>. The same alteration was found in the four other family members who were also affected (II:3, III:1, III:2, and III:3) but was not observed in the healthy family members tested nor in the 100 unrelated control subjects and 40 senile cataract patients from the same Basotho population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). This nucleotide substitution replaced an evolutionarily highly conserved Valine with Methionine at amino acid position 187 (p.V187M) in the fourth Greek key motif of &#x003b2;B2 crystallin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="f2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Mutation analysis of <italic>CRYBB2</italic>.

The <italic>Cryb</italic> genes consist of six exons: The first exon is not translated, the second exon encodes the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal extension, and the subsequent four exons are responsible for one Greek key motif each [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. By molecular screening of &#x003b2;/&#x003b3;-crystallin genes, in the three generation family of Basotho with ADCC, we finally identified a sequence variation (GA) within exon 6 of <italic>Crybb2</italic>. The corresponding alteration at the amino acid level (Val187Met) is thought to affect the formation of the fourth Greek key motif of the &#x003b2;B2-crystallin. The mutation is located in the (sixteenth &#x003b2; strand) &#x003b2;<sub>4</sub>-sheet of the fourth Greek key motif of the protein, a region crucial to the correct formation of the tertiary structure of the &#x003b2;B2-crystallin, even if previous structural examination of the COOH-terminal region focused on the amino acids from 173 to 185, but did not include Val187 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Improper folding of <italic>CRYBB2,</italic> the most abundantly expressed &#x003b2;-crystallin in the lens, could well cause protein aggregation and result finally in the cataract. Although the function of the Greek key motif is still a matter of debate, computer-based analysis suggests that they form an interdomain association &#x02013; intramolecular in the -crystallins, and intermolecular in the &#x003b2;-crystallins. In this way, they allow a dense packaging of the proteins minimizing light scattering, but providing an optimum in transparency of the eye lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. &#x003b2;B2-Crystallin is the most abundant &#x003b2;-crystallin in the human lens and is important in formation of the complex interactions of lens crystallins. The <italic>CRYBB2</italic><sup>V187M</sup> in this case could have possibly destabilized the complex formation that is critical for lens transparency. A second functional aspect of the Greek key motif is its Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. In conditions of stress, it may be important for the &#x003b2;-crystalline to be recruited into the cytoplasm to stabilize other proteins via its high beta sheet content, and/or to ensure that storage levels of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> are maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>].</p><p>Due to their long life spans, crystallins undergo an unusually large number of modifications with deamidation being a major factor. All modifications except one involve oxidation of either methionine, cysteine, or tryptophan residues. In human congenital cataracts, expression of specific genetic mutations of crystallin genes causes changes in protein&#x02013;protein interaction and subsequent protein density fluctuations, but at a younger age over a much shorter time period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. The <italic>CRYBB2</italic><sup>V187M</sup> identified in our family with ADCC results in loss of a valine residue in the fourth motif of the COOH-terminal domain. A protein&#x02013;protein BLAST search (NCBI) of human &#x003b2;B2-crystallin amino acid sequence shows that valine is absolutely conserved in the COOH-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure&#x000a0;2D</xref>). The removal of a valine residue from a highly conserved structural domain is likely to facilitate further modifications and may contribute to compromised ability of &#x003b2;B2-crystallin to maintain the solubility of other more modified &#x003b2;-crystallins. This is in keeping with the observation by Liu and Liang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>], that mutations in Val-152, Leu-165, and Val-187 destroyed &#x003b2;<sub>13</sub>-, &#x003b2;<sub>14</sub>-, and &#x003b2;<sub>16</sub>-strands located in the motif-4 critical in dimerization and resulting in the large reduction in SEAP activity (reduced protein-protein interation). The &#x003b2;<sub>16</sub>-strand of the fourth Greek key motif is affected in the new allele reported here.</p><p>Finally, an even more striking consequence is the modification of the electrostatic potential in this area. The mutant protein exhibits a strikingly enlarged negative potential in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). This might be the electrostatic explanation for the predicted change of the hydrophobic nature from neutral (0) to -1.145 in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). It is a matter for speculation whether the increase in hydrophilicity of the altered &#x003b2;B2-crystallin could be due to the oxidation of M187 probably by interacting with water by hydrogen bonding, potentially causing loosening or partial unfolding of the hydrophobic clusters in the protein. Nevertheless, further physico-chemical experiments are necessary to explore the underlying molecular and biochemical mechanisms in details. A corresponding mouse counterpart to the human mutants at the <italic>Crybb2</italic> gene locus is the <italic>Philly</italic> and <italic>Crybb2</italic><sup>Aey2</sup> mutations which lead to a progressive dominant cataract although the progression was slower in the <italic>Aey2</italic> mutant than in the <italic>Philly</italic> probably because of the smaller molecular lesion in the <italic>Aey2</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. The mutation in our family affects also the same region of the protein (close to the carboxyl-terminus) as does the <italic>Crybb2</italic><sup>Aey2</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="f4" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>A schematic overview of the mutations identified in <italic>Philly</italic>, <italic>Aey2</italic>, and index II:1 (in our study). The mutation in <italic>Philly</italic> is indicated by a shaded rectangle; the exchanged amino acid is noted below the sequence in <italic>Aey2</italic> and above the sequence in II:1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mv-v15-1470-f4"/></fig><p>In conclusion, we identified a missense mutation in <italic>CRYBB2</italic> (V187M) that is associated with autosomal dominant nuclear congenital cataract in a three generation Basotho family. The V187M substitution is thought to affect the formation of the fourth Greek key motif of the &#x003b2;B2-crystallin, potentially disturbing the integrity of the subunit interaction domains which is important in sustaining their stability and or dimerization. However, the mechanisms underlying the molecular process of cataract formation still remain unclear and need further study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge the family members for their participation in this study.
