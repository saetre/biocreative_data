Motility and metastasis are thought to be regulated, in large part, by the interaction of membrane proteins with cytoplasmic linker proteins and of these linker proteins, in turn, with actin. However, complete membrane-to-actin linkages have been difficult to identify. We used co-immunoprecipitation and competitive peptide assays to show that intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM-2)/&#x003b1;-actinin/actin may comprise such a linkage in neuroblastoma cells. ICAM-2 expression limited the motility of these cells and redistributed actin fibers <italic>in vitro</italic>, and suppressed development of disseminated tumors in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of metastatic neuroblastoma. Consistent with these observations, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated ICAM-2 expression in primary neuroblastoma tumors exhibiting features that are associated with limited metastatic disease and more favorable clinical outcome. In neuroblastoma cell lines, ICAM-2 expression did not affect AKT activation, tumorigenic potential or chemosensitivity, as has been reported for some types of transfected cells. The observed ICAM-2-mediated suppression of metastatic phenotype is a novel function for this protein, and the interaction of ICAM-2/&#x003b1;-actinin/actin represents the first complete membrane-linker protein-actin linkage to impact tumor cell motility <italic>in vitro</italic> and metastatic potential in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model. Current work focuses on identifying specific protein domains critical to the regulation of neuroblastoma cell motility and metastasis and on determining if these domains represent exploitable therapeutic targets.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The actin network is a primary determinant of the motility of cells and organelles.

In normal cells, the interaction of a particular membrane-bound cell adhesion molecule with a specific cytoplasmic linker protein has been associated with a unique cell function. In inactive neutrophils, for example, membrane-bound &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-integrin binds to the cytoplasmic linker protein talin.

Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) to which these linker proteins bind, such as deleted in colon cancer (DCC) and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), are members of the IgG superfamily to which ICAM-2 belongs.

As is true for most types of solid tumors, the primary cause of death is the development of metastatic disease; but no current therapies specifically target the metastatic process, as a potential approach for limiting the occurrence or the progression of disseminated tumors. The integral role of cell motility (migration and invasion) in the metastatic process and data in the literature suggesting the potential involvement of CAMs in regulating cell motility provided the rationale for the studies reported here. The long-range goal of the work is to identify molecular interactions that regulate the metastatic potential of neuroblastoma, and to determine if these molecular interactions represent potential therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ICAM-2 associates with &#x003b1;-actinin and actin to establish a membrane-to-actin linkage</title><p>In tumor cells, proteins of the cytoplasmic actin linker families contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis.

Proteins in lysates from pIRESneo and pIRES.ICAM2 transfectants were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to ICAM-2, and an aliquot of precipitated proteins was analyzed by immunoblot with a polyclonal antiserum to this protein. The blot in the lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003629-g001">Fig. 1D</xref> shows the expected difference in level of ICAM-2 precipitated from ICAM-2 compared to control transfectants.

Subsequent immunoblots to detect proteins that co-precipitated with &#x003b1;-actinin revealed that both actin and ICAM-2 associated with &#x003b1;-actinin in lysates from SK-N-ASpIRES.ICAM2 cells, but little or no actin or ICAM-2 co-precipitated with &#x003b1;-actinin in lysates from SK-N-ASpIRESneo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003629-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>).

Patients with tumors of this stage and histology have a poor prognosis with virtually certain development of metastatic disease. Consistent with results obtained using neuroblastoma cells lines, ICAM-2 expression (Expression Score&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0) and metastatic potential are inversely related. The stage 2 tumor is a differentiating neuroblastoma, Schwannian stroma-poor, comprised of some immature neoplastic cells (&#x0223c;10&#x00025; of tumor cells) as well as a sizeable population of neoplastic cells that exhibit histologic features of ganglionic differentiation (&#x0223c;90&#x00025; of tumor cells). The immature neuroblastoma cells are negative for ICAM-2, but all tumor cells exhibiting histologic features of ganglionic differentiation express high levels (3&#x0002b;) of ICAM-2.

These functions for ICAM-2 were independent of immune stimulation, since the tumorigenic potential of ICAM-2-expressing neuroblastoma cells as xenografts in SCID mice was unaffected and cell phenotype was altered <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>. Results with primary tumor specimens also reflected the inverse relationship between ICAM-2 expression and predicted low-risk for progressive metastatic disease, as was seen with the preclinical model.</p><p>Our data are in agreement with published literature in that the novel function reported here for ICAM-2 is similar to that of the related cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1 which binds directly to actin to inhibit tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Chen1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, but without the requirement for a cytoplasmic linker protein. ICAM-2 and CEACAM1 are also similar in that their association with the actin cytoskeleton and their suppression of tumor growth or metastasis (for CEAMCAM1 or ICAM-2, respectively) depend on an intact intracellular domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Izzi1">&#x0005b;37 and data herein&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Multiple other functions have been reported for ICAM-2 in different cell types.

Potentially, the dual functions of stimulating an immune response and inhibiting tumor cell motility could contribute to a more favorable clinical outcome. ICAM-2 has also been reported to increase the motility of endothelial cells and leukocytes, and also to activate AKT leading to inhibition of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Huang1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Huang2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, ICAM-2 expression facilitated rather than inhibited endothelial cell motility. The increase in endothelial cell motility was directly related to an increased phosphorylation of Rac, a small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) and known regulator of actin organization, cell motility, and angiogensis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Huang2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. ICAM-2 also facilitated leukocyte migration, albeit in a stimulus-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Huang1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Also in contrast to published studies with osteosarcoma and breast cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Khanna1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Elliott1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, we detected no involvement of the linker protein ezrin in the phenotype that ICAM-2 conferred on neuroblastoma cells.</p><p>The as yet unexplained differences in function of ICAM-2-interacting proteins in different cell types are, nonetheless, relatively common observations. Disease progression in uveal malignant melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Makitie1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> is associated with a relatively high level of expression of the ERM cytoskeletal linker protein ezrin.

Similarly, the linker protein &#x003b1;-actinin-4 decreases the tumorigenic potential of neuroblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Nikolopoulos1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> but is associated with a progressive phenotype in breast and colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Honda1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Honda2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We speculate that varying levels of expression of ICAM-2-interacting proteins by specific cell types or the protein composition of extracellular matrices or of adjacent cells in different tissues may modulate the state of activation (conformation) and/or the function of ICAM-2. In tumor cells in particular, constitutive activation of proteins up- or down-stream of the bidirectional signals mediated by CAMs might also affect ICAM-2 function and cell phenotype. Quite likely, while some of the protein interactions of ICAM-2 and the pathways or functions affected by these interactions are known (e.g., binding of ICAM-2 to CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18 integrins facilitates adhesion of human leukocytes to endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Kotovuori1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>; and ICAM-2 induces phosphorylation of Rac and modulates motility of endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Huang2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>), others will undoubtedly be identified.</p><p>However, despite the multiple proteins and pathways known to be affected by cell adhesion molecules in general and ICAM-2 in particular, complete membrane-to actin linkages that regulate CAM function in tumor cells have been difficult to identify. Several laboratories, however, have described the involvement of specific linker proteins and documented the impact of these linker proteins on the migratory and metastatic potential of tumor cells. In leukemic cells, for example, membrane-bound tetraspanin proteins EWI-2 and EWI-F bind to cytoskeletal linker ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins to regulate cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-SalaValdes1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This binding links cell membranes (EWI-1 and EWI-F proteins) with cytoplasmic actin cytoskeletal proteins (ERM proteins), but simultaneous association of these complexes with actin fibers has not yet been reported. Also of note, individual linker proteins appear to function differently in cells from different tumor types.</p><p>In neuroblastoma cells, we detected an association of ICAM-2 with &#x003b1;-actinin, and data with competitive peptides and truncated proteins suggest that this association plays a role in the regulation of the observed ICAM-2-mediated phenotype. Potentially, in addition to limiting the interaction of ICAM-2 with &#x003b1;-actinin, truncation of the intracellular domain of ICAM-2 may also have prevented the association of membrane-bound ICAM-2 with other as-yet-unidentified intracellular proteins. However, the hypothesis that the novel function for ICAM-2 described here depends at least partly on the association of membrane-bound ICAM-2 with &#x003b1;-actinin and actin is consistent with published reports documenting the role of &#x003b1;-actinin as a determinant of metastatic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Honda1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Gluck1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Honda2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Menez1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and the observation that &#x003b1;-actinin associates with an unknown membrane protein to decrease the tumorigenic or metastatic potential of neuroblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Nikolopoulos1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data indicate that ICAM-2 may be such a membrane protein. Our results are also consistent with the correlations between the juxtamembrane localization of actin fibers and decreased motility or decreased metastatic potential that have been reported for mouse embryonic fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-James1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and for primary oral squamous cell carcinoma tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, respectively.</p><p>Finally, the finding that ICAM-2 expression inhibited tumor cell motility in scratch and modified Boyden chamber invasion assays <italic>in vitro</italic> merits further discussion. With respect to metastasis, <italic>in vitro</italic> cell motility assays may indicate how likely a tumor cell is 1) to detach from a primary tumor (and enter systemic circulation); or 2) to migrate through the vascular endothelial layer at an anatomic site distant from the primary tumor; or, 3) once through the endothelium, to invade the normal tissue stroma to facilitate development of tumor at secondary sites.</p><p>We suggest that the component of the metastatic process most likely affected by ICAM-2 is the invasion of normal stroma. This opinion is based primarily on results from immunostaining of the TMA, and from scratch and Boyden chamber assays. Firstly, ICAM-2 was expressed predominantly by primary neuroblastoma cells with some degree of ganglionic differentiation, and therefore predicted low metastatic potential. The notable exception to this was the 3&#x0002b; staining of undifferentiated neuroblasts of some 4S tumors. Patients with 4S tumors frequently have liver, dermal, and/or limited (&#x0003c;10&#x00025;) bone marrow, as well as adrenal, involvement at diagnosis, i.e., secondary tumors are present at diagnosis. However, unlike stage 4 tumors, 80&#x00025; of patients with 4S disease do not develop progressive disease at metastatic sites. Rather, 4S tumors usually regress spontaneously without treatment, suggesting a limited invasive potential. Secondly, scratch assays performed in the presence of Matrigel, in which extracellular matrix proteins can influence cell function, showed readily distinguishable differences between control and ICAM-2 transfectants. However, when these assays were performed in the absence of Matrigel (data not shown), no differences in cell motility were observed. Thirdly, results from standard Boyden chamber invasion assays, in which cells invade a layer of Matrigel to migrate toward a chemoattractant, corroborated results of scratch assays. The presence of extracellular matrix proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> influenced ICAM-2-mediated cell function. Fourthly, Stage 4 neuroblastomas are progressively invasive tumors with a generally poor outcome; while most Stage 4S tumors are self-limiting variants of neuroblastoma despite transient involvement of skin, liver, or bone marrow. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that ICAM-2 limits the invasive potential of neuroblastoma cells.</p><p>We suggest further that the significance of ICAM-2 expression can be compared with that of <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification. If <italic>MYCN</italic> is amplified, it is regarded as a prognostic indicator for poor outcome. If <italic>MYCN</italic> is not amplified, prognosis may still be poor&#x02014;normal <italic>MYCN</italic> copy number is uninformative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003629-Maris1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, ICAM-2 expression is associated with a more favorable prognosis. However, lack of ICAM-2 expression is not necessarily associated with poor prognosis; it is simply uninformative.</p><p>In summary, the observed ICAM-2/&#x003b1;-actinin/actin interaction appears to represent a complete membrane-to-actin linkage that contributes to regulation of the motility (possibly, the invasive potential) and therefore the metastatic phenotype of neuroblastoma cells. Our long-range goal is to determine the specific protein domains essential to this regulation and to investigate the possibility that small molecule agonists can be developed to mimic the effects of ICAM-2 expression in neuroblastoma cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblots</title><p>Immunoprecipitations of ICAM-2, &#x003b1;-actinin, ezrin, and actin done with antibodies IC2/2, MAB1682 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), C-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and 4968 (Cell Signaling Technology), respectively.
