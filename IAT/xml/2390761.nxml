To identify the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genes responsible for this aspect of immune evasion, we used a macrophage cell line expressing a reporter for IL-12p40 transcription to screen a transposon library of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> for mutants that lacked this function. This approach led to the identification of the <italic>mmaA4</italic> gene, which encodes a methyl transferase required for introducing the distal oxygen-containing modifications of mycolic acids, as a key locus involved in the repression of IL-12p40. Mutants in which <italic>mmaA4</italic> (<italic>hma</italic>) was inactivated stimulated macrophages to produce significantly more IL-12p40 and TNF-&#x003b1; than wild-type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and were attenuated for virulence. This attenuation was not seen in IL-12p40-deficient mice, consistent with a direct linkage between enhanced stimulation of IL-12p40 by the mutant and its reduced virulence. Treatment of macrophages with trehalose dimycolate (TDM) purified from the &#x00394;<italic>mmaA</italic>4 mutant stimulated increased IL-12p40, similar to the increase observed from &#x00394;<italic>mmaA</italic>4 mutant-infected macrophages. In contrast, purified TDM isolated from wild-type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> inhibited production of IL-12p40 by macrophages. These findings strongly suggest that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has evolved <italic>mmaA4</italic>-derived mycolic acids, including those incorporated into TDM to manipulate IL-12-mediated immunity and virulence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Currently, one-third of the world's population has tuberculosis (TB). TB, an ancient foe, has reemerged to become a threat to global public health. A central problem in TB research is to investigate why the host immune system cannot sterilize the infection caused by the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Interleukin-12 (IL-12), a molecule produced by macrophages in response to pathogens, plays an important role in orchestrating sterilizing immunity. However, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has evolved mechanisms that block IL-12 production and thereby assist the bacterium in establishing chronic infection. We discovered that mutation of the mycobacterial <italic>mmaA4</italic> gene, which controls the chemical modification of complex lipids of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> called mycolic acids, renders the bacterium unable to block IL-12 production. Mycolic acids incorporated into a secreted bacterial molecule called trehalose dimycolate (TDM) from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> had the ability on their own to suppress the production of IL-12 by activated macrophages; we also showed that TDM from the <italic>mmaA4</italic> mutant of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is attenuated for suppression. Our results identify a critical part of the genetic basis and mechanism for an important immune evasion function in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and should contribute to the design of future vaccines and immunotherapies for disease caused by this pathogen.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Frieden1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Onyebujoh1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is well adapted to the human host, and possesses a variety of mechanisms that promote immune evasion and thereby permit latent infection in the presence of host innate and adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Flynn1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Tufariello1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, work on developing new and more immunogenic vaccine candidates is crucial and requires advances in our understanding of the host-pathogen interaction.</p><p>Because phagocytic cells recognize microbes before the development of specific immunity, the macrophage response to the infection is critical for the initial local containment of infection and the subsequent development of adaptive immunity. The cytokine profile produced by macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells within the first days or weeks following infection can define the type of host immunity induced, and thereby determine its effectiveness for controlling the microbial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Hsieh1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. A critical cytokine in the control of intracellular infections is interleukin-12 (IL-12), which is produced mainly by macrophages and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Trinchieri1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Members of the IL-12 family, including IL-12p80, IL-12p70, and IL-23, are central players in various arms of early nonspecific innate immune resistance and subsequent antigen-specific adaptive immune responses to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Cooper1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Khader1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These cytokines are dimers that all share the common IL-12p40 subunit in association with a different partner, and each has a different immunoregulatory role during various stages of the immune response to intracellular pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Beadling1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, during innate immune response, macrophages release IL-12p80, which is a homodimer of p40 subunits, upon initial infection to stimulate local recruitment of more macrophages. The IL-12p70 cytokine, a heterodimer of p35 and p40 subunits, induces macrophage bactericidal activity and also proliferation, cytolytic activity, and IFN&#x003b3; production by NK cells during the early innate phase of the immune response. During the induction of the adaptive response, IL-12p70 produced by macrophages and dendritic cells plays a central role in polarizing T helper type 1 (Th1) differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Trinchieri1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to IL-12p70, IL-12p80 also has a role in initiating adaptive immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Khader2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, maintenance and recall responses of immunological memory require both IL-12p70 and IL-23 (a dimer of p40 and p19) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Feng1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is known that mice and humans with mutations in the IL-12p40 or IL-12 receptor genes are highly susceptible to mycobacterial infection, highlighting the importance of this family of cytokines in resistance to infection with these bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Altare1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Jouanguy1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, even in a host that is genetically normal with respect to its IL-12 axis, virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can evade eradication.

Studies of the mechanisms of immune evasion by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> have revealed that one of the strategies used by the tubercle bacillus to resist eradication is to actively repress macrophage production of IL-12p40 while stimulating secretion of IL-10, an inhibitor of IL-12 mediated-immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Hickman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Nau1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

To identify the mechanisms and effector molecules responsible for this, we screened a transposon library of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> mutants using a macrophage cell line expressing a reporter gene for monitoring IL-12p40 expression. This identified a major role in IL-12p40 repression for the <italic>mmaA4</italic> (methoxy mycolic acid synthase 4) gene, which encodes the methyl transferase that introduces oxygen-containing modifications of cell wall mycolic acids. Mutants in which <italic>mmaA4</italic> was inactivated induced more IL-12p40 from murine macrophages, and were attenuated for virulence in mice. The attenuation of virulence was reversed in IL-12p40-deficient mice, indicating that this attenuation depended on IL-12p40-mediated immunity. Furthermore, the abundant surface and secreted glycolipid trehalose 6,6&#x02032;-dimycolate (TDM) was identified as an effector molecule for the repression of IL-12p40 production by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. However, purified TDM from the &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> mutant, which contained mycolates that were devoid of distal oxygen-containing modifications, stimulated markedly increased production of IL-12p40 and TNF-&#x003b1; compared to the levels resulting from stimulation with TDM from wild type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Our data identify the role of <italic>mmaA4</italic>-dependent mycolic acid modifications in the repression of IL-12p40 production, thus establishing part of the genetic and mechanistic basis for an important aspect of the immune evasion strategy of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> mutants defective in repression of IL-12p40 production</title><p>To screen for mutants of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that were defective in repression of IL-12p40 production, we generated a macrophage reporter cell line to monitor IL-12p40 expression.

To identify the factor(s) involved in this evasion strategy, we screened for mutants that induced IL-12p40, and identified the <italic>M. tuberculosis mmaA4</italic> gene as a key locus involved in modulation of IL-12p40. We demonstrated that infection of macrophages with the &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> mutant of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv resulted in production of more IL-12p40. In addition, our results strongly suggest that this enhanced induction of IL-12p40 could be mediated by the mycolate-containing glycolipid TDM, which is known to be secreted as a potential immunomodulator into the cytosol of infected macrophages. Consistent with this view, we also showed that TDM from wild type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> repressed macrophage IL-12p40 production. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such inhibitory activity for TDMs of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and also the first data to implicate the methoxy- and keto- modifications of the mycolates in TDM in the expression of this inhibitory activity on macrophages.</p><p>Consistent with findings reported in the literature that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> does not repress IL-12 production in dendritic cells, we found that dendritic cells produced similar amounts of IL-12, whether infected with the wild type, the complemented strain, or the &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> mutant. Additionally, dendritic cells treated with TDM produced levels of IL-12 comparable to those resulting from LPS treatment. Thus, the <italic>mmaA4</italic> mutation has a selective effect on macrophages. It is interesting to note that suppression of IL-12 production in macrophage, but not dendritic, cells as an immune evasion mechanism has also been observed for other well-characterized persistent intracellular pathogens, such as, <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Scott1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Carrera1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Two independent reports have shown that constitutive expression of the IL-12p40 gene in mice did not improve host immunity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Leemans1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Olleros1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

This disparity between a protective response when IL-12 is produced at the time of infection and a lack of enhanced immunity when IL-12 is constitutively expressed, underscores the importance of temporal and spatial regulation of IL-12p40 expression during infection. Thus, any perturbation of such regulation, such as constitutive and generalized expression, or <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-mediated repression, could shift the balance toward a suboptimal induction of host immunity. In the current study, we showed that the ability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to interfere with normal production of IL-12p40 was dependent on its production of mycolic acids with distal chain keto or methoxy groups, and that TDMs containing such modified mycolates could be the effector molecules for this immune evasion mechanism of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Specifically, our data suggest that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> may have evolved keto- and methoxy-modification of the mycolic acids incorporated into TDM in order to manipulate IL-12p40-mediated immunity in the host macrophages. We predicted that the removal of such IL-12p40 inhibitory components of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> would lead to a decrease in bacterial burden and would increase host survival. Indeed, Dubnau <italic>et al.</italic> previously showed attenuation of growth of the &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> mutant (also known as <italic>hma</italic>) in a mouse model of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Extending this observation, our data demonstrated that mice infected with the &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> mutant survived 400 days, at which time the experiment was terminated. Moreover, the attenuation depended on IL-12p40-mediated immunity. As part of the mechanism of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis, our results provide new insights into the link between oxygenated mycolic acids on TDM and the suppression of IL-12p40-mediated immunity contributed by macrophages.</p><p>Mycolic acids are long-chain &#x003b1;-alky &#x000df;-hydroxy fatty acids unique to mycobacteria, and they comprise approximately 30&#x00025; of the dry weight of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Takayama1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Structurally, the mycolic acids can be broadly distinguished into two classes, de-oxygenated (cyclopropyl) and oxygenated (keto and methoxy), based on the chemical functional group at the distal position of their long meromycolate chains. Several cyclopropane synthetases and methyl transferases are involved in the introduction of these functional groups, including the so-called methoxy mycolic acid synthases encoded by the <italic>mmaA3</italic> and <italic>mmaA4</italic> genes that were the focus of our current study. While mycolates are found covalently attached to the arabinogalactan of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cell wall, they also have an important role as a component of several extractable cell wall glycolipids, such as TMM and TDM. Significantly, both of these glycolipids are shed from the mycobacterium into the cytoplasm of infected macrophages, and they are widely believed to play a role in modulating many of the cellular processes that occur in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected mammalian host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Rhoades1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

The findings of these investigators are consistent with our observation that wild type TDM induced low levels of IL-12p40 production by macrophages. In addition, by comparing the effects of wild type and &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> TDMs on macrophage production of IL-12p40, we uncovered an underappreciated novel repressing function for wild type TDM. This was evident in the ability of wild type TDM to significantly dampen LPS-induced IL-12p40 production. Since LPS signals mainly through the TLR4 receptor and wild type TDM bioactivity has been found to be independent of TLR4 signaling, it is unlikely that inhibition of LPS-mediated IL-12p40 production resulted from competition between wild type TDM and LPS for the TLR4 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Geisel1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. In comparison, &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> TDM was attenuated in its ability to repress induction of IL-12p40 by LPS, and &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> TDM was also more directly stimulatory than wild type TDM with regard to activating macrophage production of IL-12p40.</p><p>It is likely that the different biological activities observed for TDMs from wild type versus those from &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> bacteria were based on the chemical and structural differences conferred by the functional groups of their mycolates. In particular, while the lack of methoxy- and keto- groups may have been responsible for the loss of ability to repress the activation of IL-12 transcription, it is also possible that the novel appearance of epoxy mycolates that we observed in the &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> mutant TDM accounted for at least part of its increased stimulatory effect. Although entirely speculative at this point, this possibility is suggested by the fact that the epoxide functional group is highly reactive, and may thus interact more avidly with cellular components that are normally not engaged during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. At present, it is not technically feasible to purify TDMs based on their precise mycolate composition into separate homogeneous groups, and future studies using chemically synthesized TDMs with precisely fixed mycolate structures may be required to clarify the cytokine-inducing or -repressing activity of each mycolic acid functional group when associated with different TDMs.</p><p>Previous studies focused on transcriptional profiling of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the lungs of infected mice have shown that the <italic>mmaA4</italic> gene is upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, compared to its level in bacteria growing in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Rachman1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation suggests the interesting possibility that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> remodels its mycolic acid composition as a counter-response to host immunity. In support of this idea, analysis of mycolic acid production during infection has shown that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> synthesizes more keto-mycolates following macrophage infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Yuan1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Evading host immunity by modifying bacterial components that interact with the host is a strategy common among opportunistic bacteria that cause chronic infection. For example, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (associated with cystic fibrosis) and <italic>Porphyromonas gingivitis</italic> (associated with periodontal disease) have naturally occurring variants of LPS structures that antagonize cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Coats1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Hajjar1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

A prominent theme emerging from studies of immunologically active glycolipids in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is that this pathogen has evolved a number of mechanisms for modifying these compounds to reduce their recognition by the innate immune system and dampen their tendency to stimulate cytokine production. In addition to the modification of mycolic acids in TDM, the modification of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lipomannan (LM) by attachment of a large arabinan to generate lipoarabinomannan (LAM) also may represent a strategy designed to block the ability of a mycobacterial glycolipid to activate IL-12p40 production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Dao1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Pathak1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, the phenol group on phenolic glycolipid alters cytokine production of macrophages. Absence of this phenol group in mutants lacking the <italic>pks 1&#x02013;15</italic> gene cluster abrogates cytokine-repressing activity, and leads to attenuation of virulence with extended survival in mouse infection studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Reed1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our current findings add to a growing literature demonstrating that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has evolved a repertoire of molecules that disrupt macrophage effector mechanisms.

We believed that additional bacterial components of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> involved in IL-12p40 repression could be revealed by extending our screening approach to saturation. The identification and removal of mycobacterial genes involved in the inhibition of important cytokine responses, such as we have demonstrated in the current study for <italic>mmaA4</italic>, should provide a straightforward and rational approach for creating more immunogenic strains of attenuated mycobacteria that may ultimately yield more effective vaccines and immunotherapies for the prevention of tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial cultures</title><p>Cultures of mycobacteria were routinely grown in 7H9-C media which contained Middlebrook 7H9 media supplemented with OADC (<underline>o</underline>leic acid/<underline>a</underline>lbumin/<underline>d</underline>extrose/<underline>c</underline>atalase) (Difco, Becton-Dickinson), 0.5&#x00025; Glycerol, and 0.05&#x00025; Tween-80.

The residual cell pellet was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis using 15&#x00025; aqueous tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) at 100&#x000b0;C overnight, followed by the addition of 4 ml of dichloromethane, 300 ml iodomethane, and 4 ml of water. The entire reaction mixture was then mixed for 1 hr. The upper aqueous phase was discarded and the lower organic phase washed twice with water and evaporated to dryness. Mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMES) were re-dissolved in diethyl ether. After centrifugation, the clear supernatant was again dried and resuspended in dichloromethane (100 ml) and an aliquot subjected to 1-dimensional High Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography (1D-HPTLC), using two developments of hexane/ethyl acetate &#x0005b;95:5&#x0005d;). MAMES were visualized by autoradiography by exposure of TLCs to X-ray film (Kodak X-Omat).</p></sec><sec id="s4p"><title>Large-scale lipid extraction and purification of TDM and TMM</title><p>Four liter cultures of wild type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>mmaA4</italic> mutant were grown to OD<sub>600nm</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.4. Mycobacteria were recovered by centrifugation at 3000 RPM for 15 min in a table-top centrifuge.

TDM and TMM were visualized either by spraying plates with &#x003b1;-naphthol/sulfuric acid, or by spraying with 5 &#x00025; ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid, followed by gentle charring.</p><p>The crude lipid extract (250 mg) dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) was applied to a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose column (2 cm&#x000d7;15 cm) and the flow-through kept for further purification. TDM and TMM were further purified by preparative TLC on 10 cm&#x000d7;20 cm plastic-backed TLC plates of silica gel 60 F254 (Merck 5735, Darmstadt, Germany), run in chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (80:20:2, v/v/v). The plates were then sprayed with 0.01&#x00025; 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene dissolved in petroleum ether/acetone (9:1, v/v), and lipids were visualized under UV light. Following detection, the plates were re-developed in toluene to remove diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, and the corresponding TDM and TMM bands were scraped from the plates and extracted from the silica gel using 3 extractions of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) to provide highly purified TDM and TMM. Quantitation of the purified TDM and TMM was done by directly weighing the material.</p><p>The highly purified TDM and TMM from wild type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was reconstituted in petroleum at a concentration of 200 &#x000b5;g/ml. Aliquots of 500 &#x000b5;l were dispensed into endotoxin-free glass vials, and the samples were dried under nitrogen for storage. The TDM and TMM stock was tested for endotoxin contamination using the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay from Bio Whittaker, following the manufacturer's protocol.

The plate was air dried to evaporate the solvent, washed once with PBS, and then air dried again. The TDM dose used in this assay was higher than that typically used for pathogen glycolipids from gram-negative bacteria such as LPS, but comparable to that used for glycolipids and other cell wall-associated immune activators of gram-positive bacteria, such as lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Ellingsen1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000081-Takeuchi1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.

The contents were mixed to ensure even distribution of the lipids before the plate was air-dried, washed with PBS, and then air dried again, before the addition of macrophages. For <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS and wild type TDM cotreatment, the wells were first coated with 5 &#x000b5;g wild type TDM, air dried, washed with PBS, and then air dried again.
