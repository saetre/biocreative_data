This bacterial population is acquired shortly after birth, is estimated to number 10<sup>14</sup> organisms, and is remarkably diverse, being composed of at least 500&#x02013;1,000 individual species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). The host&#x02013;commensal relationship is the product of millions of years of coevolution, and it can be influenced by the number and composition of bacterial species within the intestine. For example, studies using germ-free (GF) animals demonstrated that commensal bacteria are required for normal development of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Commensal bacteria have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as colitis-prone mice fail to develop intestinal inflammation if reared under GF conditions and patients suffering from IBD exhibit dysregulated immune responses against commensal bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T (Th17) cells play a significant role in the pathogenesis of IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). The differentiation of Th17 cells is promoted by IL-6&#x02013; and TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;dependent expression of the transcription factor retinoic acid&#x02013;related orphan nuclear receptor-&#x003b3;t (ROR&#x003b3;t [<italic>Rorc</italic>]), whereas IL-23 controls their expansion or survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Th17 cells are found constitutively in the small intestine of naive mice housed under conventional conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), suggesting the presence of commensal bacteria may promote their development or maintenance in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). An alternative model proposes that rather than promoting the presence of effector CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell populations and cytokines in the intestine, commensal bacteria are recognized by Toll-like receptors, and MyD88-dependent NF-&#x003ba;B activation results in the maintenance of epithelial integrity that is associated with decreased proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression, leading to a state of immune hyporesponsiveness in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, mice depleted of commensal bacteria by antibiotic treatment are highly susceptible to chemically induced colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), and disruption of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in IECs results in exaggerated expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the development of spontaneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) and infection-induced intestinal inflammation before disruption of the epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that intestinal commensal bacteria regulate expression of the IL-17 family of cytokines in the intestine. The frequency of Th17 cells was significantly increased in the large intestine of GF mice compared with conventionally reared (CNV) mice and was associated with heightened levels of IL-23. Expression of the IL-17 family member IL-25 (IL-17E) by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) was dependent on the presence of commensal bacteria and administration of IL-25 to GF mice reduced expression of IL-23, and the frequency of Th17 cells in the large intestine. Consistent with a role for IL-25 in limiting IL-23 and Th17 cells in the large intestine, neutralization of IL-23 also resulted in decreased frequencies of Th17 cells in the large intestine of GF mice. Further, IL-25 directly inhibited LPS-induced IL-23 expression by macrophages in a STAT6-independent manner. Thus, these results demonstrate a functional link between commensal bacteria and the IL-25&#x02013;IL-23&#x02013;IL-17 axis and identify a novel commensal-dependent mechanism in the regulation of Th17 cells in the intestinal microenvironment.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>The role of commensal bacteria in intestinal immune homeostasis remains unclear. One study identified the constitutive presence of Th17 cells primarily in the small intestinal lamina propria (LP) and hypothesized that commensal bacteria may be required for their presence in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), whereas another reported that Th17 cells are found only in the large intestinal LP of CNV mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). We sought to test whether signals derived from commensal bacteria promote or inhibit the presence of Th17 cells in the intestine. We examined the frequency of Th17 cells in tissues isolated from CNV BALB/c or GF BALB/c mice by flow cytometry. In CNV mice, Th17 cells were present primarily in the LP of the small intestine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Comparison of CNV and GF mice revealed equivalent frequencies of Th17 cells in the Peyer's patches and small intestinal LP of CNV and GF mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast, the frequency of Th17 cells in the cecal patch (a lymphoid follicle associated with the cecum that is analogous to the human appendix) and large intestinal LP was three- to fourfold higher in GF mice compared with CNV animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Analysis of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in whole sections of large intestinal tissue isolated from CNV or GF mice demonstrated elevated expression levels of mRNA for <italic>Il17</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Elevated levels of <italic>Il17</italic> mRNA were independent of genetic background, as GF C57BL/6 mice also expressed significantly higher levels of <italic>Il17</italic> than CNV C57BL/6 mice (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1</ext-link>). These results implicate signals derived from commensal bacteria in limiting the frequency of intestinal Th17 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Enteric commensal bacteria are required to limit the frequency of Th17 cells in the intestine.</bold> (A) Expression of IL-17 by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the Peyer's patches, cecal patch, and LP of the small or large intestine of CNV and GF mice was analyzed by flow cytometry.

To test whether the absence of commensal bacteria influenced the development or survival/expansion of Th17 cells, we examined expression of IL-6, TGF-&#x003b2;, and IL-23 in the intestine of CNV and GF mice. Although the levels of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tgfb</italic> mRNA were equivalent in the large intestine of mice housed under both conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), the levels of IL-23p19 (<italic>Il23a</italic>) and IL-12/23p40 (<italic>Il12b</italic>) mRNA were significantly higher in the large intestine of GF mice compared with CNV mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Secretion of IL-6 and IL-12/23p40 protein in large intestinal explant cultures confirmed mRNA expression patterns, with equivalent production of IL-6 (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1</ext-link>) by intestinal tissue of CNV and GF mice and increased production of IL-12/23p40 by GF intestinal tissue (Fig. S2 B). Expression of <italic>Il23a</italic> was also significantly increased in the large intestine of GF C57BL/6 mice (Fig. S3). These findings suggest that the commensal bacteria do not influence expression of cytokines that govern Th17 cell differentiation from naive precursors, but rather signals derived from commensal bacteria inhibit expression of IL-23 and the subsequent expansion and/or survival of Th17 cells in the large intestine.</p><p>An alternative approach was adopted to determine whether there was a link between commensal bacteria and expression of IL-23 and -17 in CNV mice. Oral administration of antibiotics has been shown to effectively reduce the numbers of bacteria in the intestine and leads to increased susceptibility to inflammation and food allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). To test whether heightened susceptibility to inflammation after antibiotic treatment was associated with altered expression of the IL-23&#x02013;IL-17 axis, mice were treated orally with antibiotics for 6 wk, and segments of small and large intestine were analyzed for expression of <italic>Il23a</italic> and <italic>Il17</italic>. Antibiotic treatment of adult mice resulted in increased levels of <italic>Il23a</italic> and <italic>Il17</italic> in the large intestine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). Critically, this effect was confined to the large intestine, as there were no significant changes in expression of <italic>Il23a</italic>, <italic>Il12b</italic>, or <italic>Il17</italic> in the small intestine (Fig. S4, A&#x02013;C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, reduction in total numbers of commensal bacteria in adult mice results in heightened expression of IL-23 and -17 in the large intestine, suggesting that commensal bacteria are actively promoting inhibition of IL-23 and -17.</p><p>Recent studies identified a reciprocal developmental pathway between Th17 cells and Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether the elevated frequency of Th17 cells in GF mice was associated with dysregulation of regulatory T cells. No significant differences in the frequency of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) or IL-10&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the mesenteric LN (mLN), cecal patch, or large intestinal LP were observed between mice housed under CNV or GF conditions (Fig. S5, A&#x02013;C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1</ext-link>). Additionally, there were no differences in the expression levels of <italic>Il10</italic> mRNA in the large intestine between CNV and GF mice (Fig. S5 D). Consistent with normal frequencies of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in GF mice, there was no evidence of global dysregulation in expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Splenocytes from both CNV and GF mice produced equivalent levels of IFN-&#x003b3; under neutral conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>) or in the presence of exogenous IL-12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Further, there were no significant differences in the expression of IL-12p35 (<italic>Il12a</italic>) mRNA (Fig. S6 A) or the frequencies of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells producing IFN-&#x003b3; in the mLN, cecal patch, and large intestinal LP of CNV and GF mice (Fig. S6 B). Collectively, these results suggest that the absence of commensal bacteria is associated with the selective overexpression of IL-23 and enhanced persistence, survival, or recruitment of Th17 cells in the intestinal microenvironment, rather than a general loss of regulatory T cell&#x02013; and IL-10&#x02013;dependent immune regulation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Equivalent regulatory T cell and Th1 cell responses in CNV and GF mice.</bold> (A) Cells isolated from the spleen, mLN, cecal patch, or large intestinal LP were stained for expression of CD4 and Foxp3 and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Based on these findings, we sought to test the hypothesis that commensal bacteria promote expression of cytokines that could negatively regulate the frequency of Th17 cells in the intestine. IL-27 and -25 have both been shown to limit Th17 cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). IL-27 acts directly on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to inhibit their differentiation into the Th17 cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), whereas IL-25, which can be produced by a variety of cell types, including epithelial cells, mast cells, macrophages, and T cells, limits Th17 cell development by promoting expression of IL-13 that acts on DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). We observed no significant difference in mRNA expression levels of the IL-27 subunits p28 (<italic>Il27p28</italic>) and Epstein-Barr virus&#x02013;induced (EBI)-3 (<italic>Ebi3</italic>) in the large intestine between CNV and GF mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In contrast, there was a significant reduction in the levels of <italic>Il25</italic> mRNA in large intestinal tissue isolated from GF mice compared with CNV mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Consistent with a role for commensal bacteria in the expression of <italic>Il25</italic>, antibiotic treatment of CNV mice resulted in decreased expression of <italic>Il25</italic> in the large intestine (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1</ext-link>). Expression of <italic>Il25</italic> was detected in purified IECs from CNV but not GF mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), suggesting that signals from commensal bacteria may be acting directly on IECs to induce expression of IL-25. Although we did not detect <italic>Il25</italic> expression in the spleen, LNs, Peyer's patches, or LP in CNV or GF mice (unpublished data), we cannot rule out the possibility that other resident or infiltrating LP cell populations could also express <italic>Il25</italic> in the intestine. Thus, absence of commensal bacteria was associated with decreased expression of IL-25 in IECs, heightened IL-23, and increased frequencies of Th17 cells in the large intestine.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Commensal-dependent expression of IL-25 inhibits IL-23 and the frequency of Th17 cells in the large intestine.</bold> (A) Expression of mRNA for <italic>Il27p28</italic> and <italic>Ebi3</italic> in the large intestine of CNV and GF mice was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR.

To test this, exogenous IL-25 was administered to GF mice. IL-25 treatment resulted in decreased expression of <italic>Il17</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>) and lower frequencies of Th17 cells in the LP of the large intestine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).

The association between administration of IL-25 and reduced levels of IL-23 and -17 in GF mice suggested that the effects of IL-25 were mediated through the inhibition of IL-23. To directly address whether dysregulated expression of IL-23 in GF mice resulted in the increased frequency of Th17 cells observed, GF mice were treated with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against IL-23 (&#x003b1;p19). Consistent with results obtained from administration of IL-25, neutralization of IL-23p19 in GF mice resulted in significantly decreased expression of <italic>Il17</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> in the large intestine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, G and H</xref>), as well as a significant decrease in the frequency of Th17 cells in the large intestinal LP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 I</xref>). These results suggest that commensal-dependent expression of IL-25 is a component of the pathways that regulate expression of IL-23 and the frequency of Th17 cells in the intestinal microenvironment.</p><p>As GF mice and antibiotic-treated CNV mice expressed lower levels of IL-25, we hypothesized that the absence of IL-25 in CNV mice would recapitulate the heightened expression of IL-23 and increased frequency of Th17 cells observed in GF mice.

To test this, CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were isolated from the large intestinal LP of CNV and GF mice and analyzed for ex vivo expression of <italic>Il23a</italic> and <italic>Il12b</italic> mRNA. CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells isolated from GF mice expressed higher levels of <italic>Il23a</italic> and <italic>Il12b</italic> than those isolated from CNV mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). To examine whether IL-25 could directly act on macrophages to limit IL-23 expression, bone marrow&#x02013;derived macrophages were activated with LPS, a TLR ligand that is known to induce IL-23, in the absence or presence of IL-25. Examination of mRNA levels revealed that IL-25 inhibited LPS-induced <italic>Il23a</italic> gene expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). This effect was specific for IL-23, as no down-regulation of <italic>Il12a</italic>, <italic>Tgfb</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, or <italic>Il10</italic> gene expression was observed after exposure to IL-25 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C&#x02013;F</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that IL-25&#x02013;induced IL-13 production by DCs that could inhibit IL-23 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). However, treatment of macrophages with IL-25 failed to induce <italic>Il4</italic> or <italic>Il13</italic> mRNA (unpublished data), and IL-25 inhibited LPS-induced expression of <italic>Il23a</italic> in macrophages derived from mice deficient in STAT6 (<italic>Stat6</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice), which is the primary signaling molecule downstream of IL-4 and -13 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Consistent with this, despite higher levels of <italic>Il23a</italic> mRNA in GF mice, we did not detect any difference in <italic>Il13</italic> mRNA in the large intestine of mice housed under CNV or GF conditions (Fig. S8, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1</ext-link>). Therefore, IL-25 can act directly on macrophages to inhibit TLR-induced IL-23 expression independently of the IL-4&#x02013;IL-13&#x02013;STAT6 pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>IL-25 limits accessory cell-derived IL-23 independently of STAT6.</bold> (A) Increased expression of <italic>Il23a</italic> and <italic>Il12b</italic> by CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells isolated from the large intestinal LP of GF mice.

Specifically, recognition of commensal bacteria promotes expression of IL-25 by IECs that is a component of the cytokine network necessary to limit expression of IL-23 and the size of the Th17 cell pool in the intestine under steady-state conditions (Fig. S9, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080720/DC1</ext-link>). Several studies suggest that commensal bacteria can promote immune cell hyporesponsiveness to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis. For example, commensal bacteria can actively inhibit the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and expression of proinflammatory cytokines by several mechanisms, including sequestration of signaling components such as PPAR-&#x003b3; and RelA and inhibition of I&#x003ba;B degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). The absence of these signals in GF mice could contribute to a mechanism that results in increased IL-23 and -17 expression in the absence of commensal bacteria. Supporting a model in which innate recognition of commensal bacteria shapes the local immune environment, a recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> highlighted the influence of signals derived from commensal bacteria in the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). When NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent expression of antimicrobial peptides was disrupted in intestinal cells of the fly, there was an outgrowth of a population of pathogenic commensal bacteria that led to fly mortality. In mammals, disruption of innate recognition of commensal bacteria via IEC-specific deletion of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway by targeting I&#x003ba;B kinase-&#x003b2; (IKK-&#x003b2;) or IKK-&#x003b3;/NEMO, resulted in spontaneous and infection-induced intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Collectively, these studies highlight the growing recognition of the influence of commensal bacteria-derived signals that promote immunoregulatory pathways in the intestine. Thus, in addition to established immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;, the demonstration of a role for commensal bacteria in influencing IL-25 expression identifies a previously unrecognized pathway through which commensal bacteria can regulate intestinal immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>BALB/c, C57BL/6, and BALB/c <italic>Stat6</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Il25</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).
