One such system is the olfactory system, which detects chemicals by a large number of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the nose. In mammals, each OSN expresses a single allele of one odorant receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] on a dendrite that is exposed to the external world, and on an axon terminal that extends into the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The projection of OSNs is highly ordered: all neurons expressing a given receptor converge to the same region in the ipsilateral olfactory bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], terminating in a single glomerulus, i. e., a spherical area of dense synaptic neuropil. Guidance of axons is determined by a combination of factors, including the odorant receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As a result of this well-ordered projection, chemical information is presented to the brain as spatial activity patterns across the array of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Olfactory sensory neurons are morphologically diverse, consisting of ciliated, microvillous and crypt neurons. In fish, there appears to be some correlation between neuronal morphology, receptor class, G-protein type, and ligand spectrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Ciliated OSNs express receptors similar to those found in the main olfactory system of mammals express the G&#x003b1;<sub>olf </sub>subunit and respond to amino acids or nucleotides. Microvillous neurons, on the other hand, express receptors from the V2R family found in the vomeronasal system of mammals, G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub>, G&#x003b1;<sub>q </sub>or G&#x003b1;<sub>i-3</sub>, and respond to amino acids or bile acids. In mammals, microvillous neurons detect pheromones, but can also respond to other odors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Crypt neurons, which have a distinct rounded morphology, also contain G&#x003b1;<sub>q </sub>in the apical region. Different classes of OSNs project to different regions of the olfactory bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The recombination activation gene, <italic>Rag1</italic>, is expressed in the olfactory epithelium of mice and zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The <italic>Rag1 </italic>gene, together with <italic>Rag2</italic>, is thought to have entered the genome of an ancestral organism 450 million years ago, soon after the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates; both genes have remained adjacent to one another throughout evolution. Acting together, RAG1 and RAG2 proteins function similarly to bacterial transposases such as Tn10 and are able to cleave DNA in a sequence-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. They mediate V(D)J recombination, and are thus responsible for the generation of antibodies and T-cell receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As a result, each <italic>Rag1 </italic>expressing immune cell has a different identity, characterized by a permanent change to its genome, as well as the proteins expressed on its surface. Mutations in <italic>Rag1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] or <italic>Rag2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] lead to immunodeficiency.</p><p>The function of <italic>Rag1 </italic>in the olfactory system is unclear, although there has been some speculation that DNA rearrangement could be involved in odorant receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As a step towards understanding the role of <italic>Rag1</italic>, we have initiated a study using the zebrafish, a model system with a relatively well-characterized olfactory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The transparency of the zebrafish larva enables gene expression analysis at single cell resolution, while genetics and morpholinos provide tools for assessing gene function using anatomical or physiological methods. Our results suggest that RAG1 protein is present in a subset of OSNs, including some microvillous olfactory neurons, but is not required for axon targeting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>Rag1 </italic>expression in the zebrafish olfactory system</title><p>Using a transgenic zebrafish line in which the coding sequence of <italic>Rag1 </italic>within a PAC was replaced with GFP, Shuo Lin and colleagues have reported the expression of <italic>Rag1 </italic>in olfactory sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To confirm the fidelity of GFP expression, double-labelling with antibodies to zebrafish RAG1 and GFP was carried out. The specificity of the RAG1 antibody was first tested by preabsorption and immunofluorescence on thymocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). Olfactory neurons from 4 day-old <italic>Rag1</italic>:<italic>GFP </italic>fish were then isolated, fixed and doubled-labelled. In these cells, two classes of GFP expression was seen &#x02013; bright and dim. An overlap of RAG1 (red) and GFP (green) immunofluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;E</xref>) was observed. From 3 double-labelling experiments, 100 out of 105 cells with high levels of GFP were found to be RAG1-positive, with label predominantly in the nucleus. 91 out of 102 cells that expressed a lower level of GFP were also RAG1-positive. These observations establish that RAG1 protein is present in olfactory neurons, and that GFP expression in the transgenic line can serve as an indicator of endogenous RAG1.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Immunofluorescent labelling of RAG1. </bold>(A) Isolated zebrafish thymocytes, labelled with the antibody to RAG1 (in red) and DAPI (blue).

Fluorescing neurons projected axons to the lateral region of the OB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C&#x02013;E</xref>).

To test this idea, three morpholinos were used to knock down Rag1 in embryos. The first morpholino (mo1) targeted the start codon of RAG1 and was tested using a fusion of the 5' end of RAG1 to GFP. Injection of mRNA for the fusion protein alone led to a strong fluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), whereas co-injection with the morpholino suppressed fluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), indicating that mo1 knocked down <italic>Rag1 </italic>translation. The second morpholino (mo2) was targeted to the splice donor site of the first exon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Injection of this morpholino led to aberrant splicing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>), resulting in an mRNA with a premature stop codon (data not shown). The third morpholino (mo3) was designed to the donor site of the second exon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>), and this resulted in loss of the normal transcript (not shown). Splice donor morpholinos were tested because the use of internal ATGs, which has been reported for some forms of Omenn's syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], might obscure the effects of mo1.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>The effect of RAG1 depletion on the olfactory projection. </bold>(A) An embryo injected with mRNA encoding the 5' end of <italic>Rag1 </italic>fused to EGFP.

This occurred despite there being an 8-nucleotide mismatch in the transgene (since GFP replaces the <italic>Rag1 </italic>coding sequence), presumably because the mismatch is contiguous and exclusively at one end of the morpholino. The convergence of brighter axons to one lateral target persisted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C, D</xref>; n = 15). Aside from the decrease in GFP expression, no other defect could be detected. With mo2, injections of 0.8 &#x003bc;M caused slight non-specific morphological abnormalities, such as small eyes. Injection with 0.8 &#x003bc;M mo3 caused stronger abnormalities. Less abnormality was seen when a mixture of 0.6 &#x003bc;M mo2 and 0.6 &#x003bc;M mo3 was injected. This led to a dramatic loss of normally spliced <italic>Rag1 </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>). Injection of either mo2 or mo3 or the mixture did not cause any defect in the targeting of the GFP-expressing neurons (n = 50 embryos each).

The lateral neuropil structure that is innervated by neurons with strong GFP expression could be visualized in mutants, as in wild types (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> J-L). Together with the morpholino data, these observations indicate that Rag1 is not required for pathfinding of OSN axons to the olfactory bulb, or for establishment of glomeruli.</p></sec><sec><title>Odor-evoked activity maps in the <italic>Rag1 </italic>mutant</title><p>The spatial organization of OSN axons in the olfactory bulb and their functionality was further examined by calcium imaging of odor-evoked activity maps in 3 month-old fish.

This method allows for the optical detection of odor-evoked activity selectively in OSN axons within glomeruli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In wild type fish, amino acids evoke activity predominantly in the ventro-lateral region of the OB that contains densely packed, small glomeruli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Within this region, clusters of glomeruli can be identified by their response to amino acids sharing particular chemical features (e. g., a short neutral side chain, a long neutral side chain, or a basic side chain). Response patterns vary considerably between individuals, but functionally defined clusters are found at similar relative positions along the anterior-to-posterior axis in different individuals, thus establishing a conserved chemotopic map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The distribution and magnitude of response patterns evoked by a diagnostic set of L-amino acids with different chemical features (Met, Ala, Val, Lys, Phe, His, Trp; each 10<sup>-5 </sup>M) were generally similar in wild type and <italic>Rag1 </italic>mutant fish (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>). However, in both wild type and <italic>Rag1 </italic>mutants, the fine structure of these activity patterns varied between individuals. To examine the chemotopic organization in more detail, we therefore defined three glomerular regions by characteristic response properties, as done previously to identify chemotopically organized glomerular clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The first region was defined by responses to the basic amino acid, Lys, and partially to Trp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>; red arrowheads), the second region was defined by responses to all short-chain neutral stimuli (Phe, Trp and Ala; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>; yellow arrowheads), and the third region was defined by the response to the long-chain neutral amino acids, Val and Met (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>; light blue arrowhead). Regions with these functional properties were identifiable in each wild type and <italic>Rag1 </italic>mutant fish. Their spatial arrangement was analyzed by overlaying the outlines of the regions from different individuals. In both wt (n = 7) and <italic>Rag1 </italic>mutant (n = 10) fish, the three clusters occurred in a characteristic sequence along the anterior-to-posterior axis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C, D</xref>), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Hence, the chemotopic organization of glomerular response maps was comparable in wild type and <italic>Rag1 </italic>mutant fish. Other response properties, such as wide-spread responses to food extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], were also similar between wild types and <italic>Rag1 </italic>mutants (not shown). We also quantitatively analyzed the similarity relationships between activity patterns evoked by different stimuli using correlation and factor analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and observed no obvious differences between wild type and <italic>Rag1 </italic>mutant fish. Hence, physiological responses of OSNs to amino acids and their chemotopically organized projections to the OB were not detectably altered in <italic>Rag1 </italic>mutants.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Chemotopic organization of glomerular activity patterns in wild type and Rag1 mutant fish. </bold>(A) Glomerular activity patterns evoked by different amino acid stimuli (10<sup>-5 </sup>M) in the ventro-lateral OB of a wild type fish.

Immunofluorescence using an antibody to zebrafish RAG1 indicates that the protein is present in OSNs. Imaging of a transgenic line, which is a sensitive method to monitor gene expression in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], suggests that <italic>Rag1 </italic>is expressed only in a subset of OSNs. Some of the neurons expressing <italic>Rag1 </italic>are likely to be microvillous neurons, as indicated by their morphology and G&#x003b1;<sub>o </sub>expression. Neurons expressing GFP project to the lateral bulb, which is a region of the bulb known to contain termini of amino-acid sensitive OSNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Their projection pattern appears to be complementary to neurons expressing a reporter under the OMP promoter, as these project to the medial bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. <italic>Rag1 </italic>expression thus appears to mark a subset of distinct OSNs. These neurons are likely to be heterogenous, given that not all of them express G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub>.</p><p>A feature of the <italic>Rag1</italic>:GFP transgenic line analyzed here is that one glomerular target in each bulb is more brightly labelled than other targets. One interpretation of this observation, given that some cell bodies, axons and termini are brighter than others, is that neurons expressing GFP at high levels all have a particular identity and project to a single target. These neurons do not express any of the markers tested, possibly because of their distinct identity. Alternatively, they may not be fully mature when GFP is expressed strongly. This would be consistent with the finding that not all bright neurons take up DiI or Di8ANEPPQ from the external environment, which would be the case if their dendrites were immature. These neurons may eventually have reduced levels of GFP, and express G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub>. It should be noted that high levels of GFP expression cannot be a feature of all immature OSNs. If this were the case, it would be expected that there would be bright neurons projecting to all glomeruli; this was never seen. Although we cannot yet make any firm conclusions as to why some axons are brighter than others, their reproducible targeting can serve as a useful marker in genetic screens or in physiological analysis.</p><p>In the olfactory system, sensory neurons are distinguished from one another on the basis of odorant receptor expression, and targeting to a particular glomerulus is dependent on the odorant receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], amongst other axon guidance cues. It has been suggested that odorant receptor expression could be regulated by a mechanism similar to V(D)J recombination, given the genomic organization of the receptors. We found that axon targeting and chemotopic activity maps in the OB were not affected by knockdown of <italic>Rag1 </italic>or by a mutation that abolishes the catalytic activity of <italic>Rag1</italic>. Hence, it appears that RAG1 does not have a role in defining the identity of OSNs. Recent cloning experiments show that the genome of mammalian OSNs is not rearranged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Those experiments were carried out with neurons expressing receptors of the OR class, i.e. those expressing G&#x003b1;<sub>olf</sub>, which is probably not expressed in <italic>Rag1</italic>-positive OSNs in zebrafish. The observations described here suggest that this conclusion also holds for other olfactory neurons.</p><p>RAG1 contains the active site for V(D)J recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and can cleave DNA in vitro on its own, although it does so with low efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Once DNA has been cleaved, RAG1 can bind to the broken ends and serve a protective role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Given the relatively high rate of DNA breaks in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], one possibility is that RAG1 protects the genome in some neurons. However, this view does not explain why only a subset of neurons expresses <italic>Rag1</italic>. Another function of RAG1, provided by the RING-finger, is as an E3 ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], raising the possibility that this activity may be required in a subset of receptor neurons. Additionally, RAG1 can independently act as an endonuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It is apparent that RAG1 can carry out several functions, but it is unknown at present whether the expression of <italic>Rag1 </italic>in the olfactory epithelium reflects any of these abilities. The expression described here suggests that any function of <italic>Rag1 </italic>must be restricted to a subset of OSNs only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that <italic>Rag1 </italic>is expressed and translated in a subset of zebrafish olfactory neurons projecting to the lateral olfactory bulb.
