The role of the different receptor(s) implicated in the recognition of Mtb in particular remains poorly defined, and those that have been found to have activity <italic>in vitro</italic> were subsequently shown to be redundant <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>To identify novel receptors involved in the recognition of Mtb, we screened a macrophage cDNA library and identified scavenger receptor B class 1 (SR-B1) as a receptor for mycobacteria. SR-B1 has been well-described as a lipoprotein receptor which mediates both the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters and the efflux of cholesterol, and has also recently been implicated in the recognition of other pathogens. We show here that mycobacteria can bind directly to SR-B1 on transfected cells, and that this interaction could be inhibited in the presence of a specific antibody to SR-B1, serum or LDL. We define a variety of macrophage populations, including alveolar macrophages, that express this receptor, however, no differences in the recognition and response to mycobacteria were observed in macrophages isolated from SR-B1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or wild type mice <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, when wild type and SR-B1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals were infected with a low dose of Mtb (100 CFU/mouse) there were no alterations in survival, bacterial burdens, granuloma formation or cytokine production in the lung. However, significant reduction in the production of TNF, IFN&#x003b3;, and IL10 were observed in SR-B1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice following infection with a high dose of Mtb (1000 CFU/mouse), which marginally affected the size of inflammatory foci but did not influence bacterial burdens. Deficiency of SR-B1 also had no effect on resistance to disease under conditions of varying dietary cholesterol. We did observe, however, that the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the diet significantly enhanced the bacterial burdens in the lung, but this was independent of SR-B1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SR-B1 is involved in mycobacterial recognition, but this receptor plays only a minor role in anti-mycobacterial immunity <italic>in vivo</italic>.

The causative agent, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), enters the host typically via aerosols, and alveolar macrophages are considered the first cells to engulf Mtb and become infected. Although the initial interaction of the pathogen with the host macrophage is considered a critical step in the pathogenesis of Mtb, the role of the receptors that play a role in mediating the entry of Mtb into macrophages and in transducing intracellular signals is very controversial and far from being understood. Over the years, more than a dozen receptors have been shown to recognize and bind mycobacteria (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Schafer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>).

Although their impact for recognition of Mtb has not been extensively studied, there are a few reports that show the general involvement of scavenger receptors in binding of mycobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Zimmerli1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Neyrolles1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Notably, binding of mycobacteria to SR-B1 transfected cells, although reduced, still occurred in the presence of serum. To further investigate whether the serum-inhibition of bacterial binding was direct or indirect, we performed experiments where BCG-lux was pre-incubated in medium in the presence or absence of serum and then added to SR-B1 expressing cells in the presence or absence of serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, left panel). The bacteria pre-incubated in the absence of serum were inhibited by serum, as observed before (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, left panel). A similar effect was observed when the bacteria were pre-incubated in the presence of serum; binding of these bacteria was only inhibited by the presence of serum during the binding assay. Importantly, pre-incubation of the bacteria in serum did not affect subsequent binding to the SR-B1 expressing cells in the absence of serum. Therefore the serum-inhibition effect was due to direct competition of serum components for the receptor rather than an &#x0201c;opsonization&#x0201d; effect on the bacteria.

Therefore experiments were designed to investigate whether the observed binding of BCG-lux to cells expressing SR-B1 was due to direct interaction of the bacteria with the receptor, or because of an increased accumulation of cholesterol in the membrane. To this end, the binding of BCG-lux to SR-B1 was investigated after blocking of the receptor with a specific antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g002">Fig. 2E</xref> (left panel) SR-B1 expressing R6F cells pre-incubated with anti-SR-B1 showed a significant reduction in binding of BCG-lux, whereas the antibody had no affect on the binding of the mycobacteria to control SIGNR1 cells. This was further supported by the observation that depletion of the membrane's cholesterol by cyclodextrins did not significantly reduce the amount of BCG-lux binding to R6F cells expressing SR-B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>), although SR-B1 transfected R6F cells did show more cholesterol accumulation when stained with filipin compared to control cells (data not shown).</p><p>We next wanted to test whether these results also held true for virulent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv. Although we had some difficulty in generating uniform suspensions of this bacterium which interfered with our binding assays, all the trends observed with BCG-lux could be confirmed with Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g002">Fig. 2A&#x02013;E</xref>; right panels). Importantly, Mtb-lux bound to SR-B1 transfected R6F cells and this binding could be inhibited by the presence of serum, LDL and BAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g002">Fig. 2A, C and D</xref>, right panels), which was due to direct competition for the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, right panel). Further, the binding of Mtb-lux to SR-B1 expressing cells could be inhibited in the presence of an antibody against SR-B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, right panel). Thus overall, these data suggest that SR-B1 can directly recognize mycobacteria and that this interaction can be inhibited by serum and surfactant components.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The Role of SR-B1 for Mycobacterial Infection of Primary Cells</title><p>Having demonstrated that SR-B1 can mediate the recognition of mycobacteria in transfected cells, we next investigated the contribution of this receptor on primary cells.

Furthermore, when we blocked SR-B1 with a specific antibody, binding of mycobacteria to the macrophages was unaltered compared to untreated controls (data not shown).

This is supported by an earlier study on SR-B1 expression of transfected COS-7 cells, where the presence of SR-B1 had no effect on the level of free cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-KellnerWeibel1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

The accumulation of cholesterol in the inflammatory lesions of the SR-B1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse lungs might account for the fact that cholesterol transport across the macrophage membrane is impaired in these animals. Although we did detect decreased levels of TNF, IFN&#x003b3; and IL10 in the SR-B1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals infected with a high dose Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), the bacterial burdens in both groups of animals was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). In fact, there were still substantial amounts of TNF and IFN&#x003b3; present in the SR-B1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lungs: 76&#x00025; TNF and 63&#x00025; IFN&#x003b3; levels compared to those found in wild type animals, while the amount of IL10 was decreased to 40&#x00025; compared to wild type. While the changes in cytokine levels are likely to have contributed to the slight difference in size of the inflammatory lesions that were observed following infection with a high dose Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>), we do not feel these data represent a significant biological difference between wild type and knockout animals.</p><p>The lack of a substantial effect of SR-B1 deficiency was surprising, however, considering the elevated serum cholesterol levels in SR-B1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g006">Fig. 6A and C</xref>).

This clearly shows that when studying the interaction of Mtb with its host <italic>in vivo</italic> the particular experimental setting greatly affects the outcome.</p><p>In this context, the preparation of the mycobacteria has much influence on the experimental observations: we and others found that mycobacteria bind to and activate macrophages to a much greater extent when sonicated rather than syringed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Stokes2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and data not shown).

With the static binding conditions as presented here, one would also identify low-affinity receptors. It is possible that SR-B1, being a true scavenger with broad ligand specificity, is a low-affinity receptor for mycobacteria and simply plays only a minor role <italic>in vivo</italic>. Experimental differences will also occur when different strains of mycobacteria (virulent vs. avirulent) and/or genetic background of the receptor-deficient mice (relatively resistant such as C57BL/6 vs. relatively susceptible such as BALB/c) are being used. To add to the complexity, different macrophage populations (i.e. resident vs. elicited vs. immune-activated as well as human vs. murine) express a different array of receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Bowdish1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Stokes1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and therefore respond differently to infection with Mtb. This is also important in our experimental approach: we identified SR-B1 when screening a cDNA library generated from the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. These cells might express a completely different array of receptors compared to primary cells, leading to the identification of Mtb-binding surface molecules that might not be relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>As discussed in the literature before, it seems that Mtb enters the host cell via a number of possible receptor/ligand interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Schafer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Pieters1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability of Mtb to engage multiple receptors (or receptor clusters) simultaneously might be an evolutionary advantage for its pathogenesis: in the absence of a single receptor, phagocyte infection by mycobacteria can be efficiently supported by alternative receptors.</p><p>Taken together, we demonstrate that SR-B1 is another example of the diverse spectrum of receptors that recognize mycobacteria <italic>in vitro</italic> but is redundant in the extremely complex macrophage-mycobacterium interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. On the one hand, this redundancy of SR-B1 in mycobacterial infection might be a result, at least in part, of surfactant blocking the bacterial-receptor interactions, as we demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008448-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Surfactant may directly compete with Mtb for the receptor binding site, or that aggregated mycobacteria alter their interaction with the host cells, as shown for SP-D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Ferguson1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Ferguson2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, the redundancy may stem from down-regulation of this receptor during mycobacterial infection, as macrophage activation has been shown to suppress SR-B1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008448-Baranova1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.
