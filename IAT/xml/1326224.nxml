Whereas G6PD deficiency is an x-linked enzymopathy and among the most common genetic disorder in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], sickle cell disease is a common and severe haemoglobinopathy, caused by sickling haemoglobin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The cytoplasmic G6PD enzyme is expressed in all tissues and is essential for the capacity of cells to withstand oxidative stress. Individuals with lowered levels of the G6PD enzyme are more susceptible to develop acute haemolytic anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Apart from childhood death, patients with sickle cell diseases suffer from diverse clinical conditions including anaemia, infarctions and other variable painful crisis throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The disorders arise from single nucleotide point mutations in the haemoglobin beta-globin (<italic>HbB</italic>) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>G6PD</italic>) genes, resulting in single amino acid substitutions. Despite the fact that more than hundred allelic variants have been described for each polymorph gene-locus, only a few reach high frequencies and, thus, become of clinical importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In sub-Saharan Africa, G6PD is essentially a tri-allelic polymorphism. G6PD (B) is the most common allele with normal enzymatic activity; G6PD (A) is associated with a single amino acid substitution at codon (c) 126 where Asn is changed to Asp (N126D), causing around 85% of the normal enzymatic activity. The G6PD (A-) deficiency allele has a single amino acid substitution at c68 from Val to Met (V68M), always in conjunction with the N126D mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The G6PD (A-) variant has only around 12% of normal enzymatic activity with frequencies of 5&#x02013;25% of the affected population in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although most individuals with the G6PD (A-) polymorphic variant are asymptomatic, acute haemolytic anaemia can manifest in hetero- and homozyogte females as well as hemizygote males under oxidative stress of the red blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This condition can be induced by infections, anti-inflammatory agents and chemotherapeutics, including anti-malarials such as sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, lapudrine-dapsone or primaquine, making it of importance to know the G6PD status of individuals receiving drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The most prevalent polymorphic variants of the <italic>HbB </italic>gene consist of the normal gene (HbA) in which SNPs in the same amino acid position give rise to either the sickle haemoglobin S, (HbS, Glu to Val at c6 (E6V)) or the common west-African haemoglobin C (HbC, Glu to Lys at c6 (E6K)). A third SNP at position 26 creates the Southeast-Asian haemoglobin E (HbE, Glu to Lys (E26K)) variant, which is not found in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Apart from several other abnormal haemoglobin gene-combinations, such as beta-thalassaemia, sickle cell disease is found in individuals with homozygote HbSS (sickle cell anaemia) and heterozygote SC genotypes, whereas the inheritance of two C-alleles (HbCC) or one A plus one C or S allele (HbAS and HbAC) give rise to phenotypes associated with limited pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Both haemoglobin S, C and E confer some degree of protection against severe malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa, HbS gene frequencies exceed 25%, resulting in a widespread, but unequal distribution of the HbAS sickle cell trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The procedures for diagnosing sickle cell anaemia and G6PD deficiency includes the sickling test, haemoglobin electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and enzymatic diagnostic assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Current approaches also deploy DNA-analysis using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] or dot-blot hybridization analysis of the appropriate PCR-amplified fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, these techniques can have difficulties in detecting heterozygotes and discerning false-negatives and false-positives thereby hampering specificity and sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the methods are relatively laborious, technically demanding and expensive, and may, therefore, be inappropriate for screening large numbers of samples in resource-poor settings.</p><p>Here, a method for screening human populations for the different haemoglobin polymorphisms A, S, C and E as well as the G6PD polymorphisms B, A and A- by use of PCR and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOPs) to detect the various SNPs and visualized in an ELISA system, is described and evaluated. The methodology is accurate and simple and would be applicable at laboratories with limited facilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Samples and DNA-extraction</title><p>Blood samples from 90 children under the age of five years, living in Mkokola village in North-Eastern Tanzania, collected on filter paper during a cross-sectional survey in March 2004, were used for validation of the method.

DNA extracted from volunteering Danish blood donors were used as controls for wildtype HbAA and G6PD (B) (68VV/126NN). Two samples from the villages Kwemasimba and Tamota in neighbouring areas were identified by the RFLP technique to be HbSS-type and HbAC-type, respectively, and were used as controls in comparison with the SSOP-ELISA technique.

The assay was able to screen these samples for the three haemoglobin and two G6PD SNPs during one day and determine the genotype frequencies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

Of the PCR-amplified samples, the majority reacted with the SSOPs with a signal-to-background OD value above 1.0. As expected, no samples with HbC or HbE were identified in the village. Twelve individuals carried one HbS allele and had the HbAS genotype, corresponding to a prevalence of 14% of the sickle cell trait. The majority the individuals, 86% (75/87), carried the normal HbAA genotype.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p><italic>HbB </italic>and <italic>G6PD </italic>genotype frequencies for children living in a Tanzanian village and analysed by the SSOP-ELISA method.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>HbB Genotype</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Numbers (87)</bold><sup>a</sup></td><td align="center"><bold>G6PD Genotype</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Numbers (84)</bold><sup>a</sup></td><td align="center"><bold>68 Status</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>126 Status</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Deduced Phenotype</bold><sup>b</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center">68&#x02013;126</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">75 (86%)</td><td align="center">VV-NN<sup>c</sup></td><td align="center">51 (61%)</td><td align="center">Wildtype</td><td align="center">Wildtype</td><td align="center">G6PD B</td></tr><tr><td align="center">SS</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">VV-DD<sup>d</sup></td><td align="center">8 (10%)</td><td align="center">Wildtype</td><td align="center">Mutant</td><td align="center">G6PD A</td></tr><tr><td align="center">AS</td><td align="center">12 (14%)</td><td align="center">M-D<sup>e</sup></td><td align="center">6 (7%)</td><td align="center">Mutant</td><td align="center">Mutant</td><td align="center">G6PD A-</td></tr><tr><td align="center">AC</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">VM-ND</td><td align="center">10 (12%)</td><td align="center">Single Mutant</td><td align="center">Single Mutant</td><td align="center">G6PD A</td></tr><tr><td align="center">CC</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">VV-ND</td><td align="center">8 (9%)</td><td align="center">Wildtype</td><td align="center">Single Mutant</td><td align="center">G6PD A</td></tr><tr><td align="center">SC</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">VM-DD</td><td align="center">1 (1%)</td><td align="center">Single Mutant</td><td align="center">Mutant</td><td align="center">G6PD A</td></tr><tr><td align="center">No PCR-product</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">No PCR-product</td><td align="center">6</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>: Numbers refer to the remaining individuals from the field with amplified PCR-product</p><p><sup>b</sup>: Phenotype of the G6PD trait was not measured, but deduced based on the genotype</p><p><sup>c</sup>: Out of the 51 individuals, 30 were males with the V-N genotype</p><p><sup>d</sup>: Out of the 8 individuals, 5 were males with the V-D genotype</p><p><sup>e</sup>: All 6 individuals were males hemizygote for M-D genotype</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>For G6PD, 61% (51/84) had the (68VV/126NN) normal genotype (G6PD B variant), whereas 20% (17/84) had the 68M mutation. These individuals could be divided into 6 (7%) with the deficient genotype (68M/126D &#x02013; only hemizygote males), having the G6PD (A-) variant, and 11 (13%) which were heterozygote for the 68M mutation (10 with 68MV/126ND and 1 with 68MV/126DD) genotype having the G6PD (A) variant.</p><p>To verify the genotypes determined by the SSOP-ELISA assay, the PCR-products were processed by the RFLP method, which currently is commonly used for genotyping. For HbB, control and field samples gave identical results in 98% (88/90) of the cases. A minor disagreement was found in two samples typed as AS and AC, respectively. The samples had weak positive signals for the S and C probes close to the cut-off OD value of 0.3 in the SSOP-ELISA method. The restriction digestion analysis typed the samples as HbAA and not AC or AS.</p><p>Among 87 samples amplified for G6PD, there was 95% (83/87) and 97% (84/87) concordance between the two methods for the 68 and 126 mutation, respectively. Four samples with positive signals for 68V, showed weak signals with OD values between 0.2 and 0.5 for the 68M probe. Two of these were typed as 68MV by the RFLP method, whereas the two remaining were typed as 68VV. Another three samples, initially considered containing the 126D allele, typed as either 126DN or 126NN by the RFLP method. Ten samples (6 for the 68 mutation and 4 for the 126 mutation) with clear-cut OD values by the SSOP-ELISA method were difficult to interpret by the RFLP method due to ambiguous band-separation and band-resolution even after repeating the restriction digests.

Our new SSOP-ELISA method proved to be highly accurate in detecting the different SNPs of both the <italic>HbB </italic>and <italic>G6PD </italic>genes, with signal-to-background differences in OD values greater than 2.0 in most cases. Thus, with only a minimum discordance between the results obtained by the RFLP and SSOP-ELISA methods, the SSOP-ELISA technique confirmed to be an efficient alternative to the RFLP method. Although the SSOP-ELISA originally was developed for detecting <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>haplotypes related to anti-malarial drug resistance, the technique has been shown to be adapted to analyse human genotypes as well. The results clearly showed that the OD values were not reduced in samples with two different SNPs a (heterozygote) compared to samples with two identical alleles (homozygotes). All individuals classified as heterozyogtes by the SSOP-ELISA were females, as expected.</p><p>The chosen PCR-products have the advantage of covering three important SNPs in the <italic>HbB </italic>gene and two important SNPs in the <italic>G6PD </italic>gene. The single PCR product from the G6PD gene covers both mutations, whereby amplification of two fragments, as has been done previously, is avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The probes used were all designed to surround the SNP in question and only in the case of the 68M SNP, additional probes were designed to optimise a suitable binding reaction. In contrast, the PCR-RFLP methodology is dependent on recognisable restriction sites around the SNP, limiting the choice of size of the PCR fragment and binding of the primers. The SSOP-ELISA method also has the advantage of not relying on laborious electrophoresis work. Ambiguous results were more frequently observed with the RFLP method, caused by either incomplete enzymatic digestion of PCR fragments or inaccurate gel-resolution and band separation. The generation of ELISA-based OD values removes much of the conjecture over gel results, and a simple spreadsheet can be used for data analysis to identify samples, which need confirmation by the RFLP method. With duration of approximately 3 hours for the PCR amplification step followed by 4 hours for the SSOP-ELISA detection, 90 samples can easily be screened for both haemoglobin and G6PD genotypes or 180 samples for either haemoglobin or G6PD, during one day. Apart from being accurate and rapid, the technique is also relatively cheap as costs pr. sample analyzed and DNA extracted approximately is 1$.</p><p>From a practical point of view, setting up and running this new method only requires the use of relatively cheap equipment: a PCR thermal cycler, an incubation oven and an ELISA reader. These are increasingly becoming commonplace in many settings, also in laboratories in resource-poor settings in Africa. At this stage, the SSOP-ELISA technique has already been established at sites in Tanzania for the routine monitoring of molecular markers of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>drug resistance. The method can be adapted to other areas where different mutations predominate and even modified into a higher throughput system with access to more advanced and expensive equipment. In African populations, screening for the V68M mutant only will suffice, if the intention is solely to assess symptomatic G6PD deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The fact that this method is only able to detect specific SNPs, limits its use to monitoring already known genotypes, and sequencing analysis will be needed to identify unknown molecular markers or other variants of G6PD deficiency. Although by far the largest proportion of individuals with G6PD deficiency have the 68MM genotype, making it unlikely that a person in sub-Saharan Africa without the V68M mutation would be G6PD deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], it is important to consider that ethnically different populations, e.g. with Arabic influence, could harbour other G6PD deficient variants (e.g. the Arabic G6PD<sup>med </sup>variant) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and that rare deficiency mutations (G680T and T968C) could be present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Limited access to and delayed diagnosis of sickle cell diseases and G6PD deficiency in tropical Africa may hamper prevention of severe illness and consequently lead to increases in morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Efficient high-throughput screening methods, as described here, may help to map the distribution of these inherited disorders and, thus, contribute as an epidemiological tool to characterize disease patterns. Molecular epidemiology of genes promoting or protecting against disease, including malaria, is important when large-scale interventions are planned, e.g. studies on malaria immunity, vaccine trials and drug trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here, a simple screening method is described, detecting, at molecular level and with limited costs, the most important human haemoglobin and G6PD polymorphisms associated with malaria. This assay represents a useful tool for analysing the relation between various combinations of these major genotypes and a variety of epidemiological factors in particular malaria immunity, incidence and severity. The method has proved to be accurate and rapid and will be beneficial at research institutions in resource-poor settings in Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AE conceived of the study, performed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.
