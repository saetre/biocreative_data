To analyse the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of TAK1 in cartilage, we generated mice with a conditional deletion of <italic>Tak1</italic> driven by the collagen 2 promoter. <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice displayed severe chondrodysplasia with runting, impaired formation of secondary centres of ossification, and joint abnormalities including elbow dislocation and tarsal fusion. This phenotype resembled that of bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)1 and <italic>Gdf5</italic>-deficient mice. BMPR signalling was markedly impaired in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes as evidenced by reduced expression of known BMP target genes as well as reduced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinases. TAK1 mediates Smad1 phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues. These findings provide the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence in a mammalian system that TAK1 is required for BMP signalling and functions as an upstream activating kinase for Smad1/5/8 in addition to its known role in regulating MAP kinase pathways. Our experiments reveal an essential role for TAK1 in the morphogenesis, growth, and maintenance of cartilage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BMP</kwd><kwd>cartilage</kwd><kwd>Smad</kwd><kwd>TAK1</kwd><kwd>TGF&#x003b2;</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During endochondral ossification, mesenchymal stem cells undergo a highly organized differentiation program during which they condense and differentiate into chondrocytes, forming the template for bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kronenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Yoon and Lyons, 2004</xref>). Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) were originally isolated as proteins that promote ectopic cartilage and bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Wozney <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>). Further studies have confirmed the role of BMPs in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during cartilage and bone formation and revealed additional functions in other developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Yoon and Lyons, 2004</xref>). For example, BMP-2 and BMP-4 are essential for the induction of ventral mesoderm formation during early mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Winnier <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). BMP family members transduce signals through heteromeric complexes of type II and type I transmembrane serine/threoine kinase receptors. Type II receptor ligation initiates the recruitment of type I receptors to form heteromeric receptor complexes that are then transphosphorylated. The type I receptors in turn initiate Smad signalling by phosphorylating the receptor-regulated Smads, R-Smad1/5/8. Once phosphorylated, R-Smads associate with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Massague, 1998</xref>). In addition to the Smad-dependent pathway, BMPs can also activate TGF&#x003b2; activated kinase 1 (TAK1) leading to MKK3/6-mediated p38 MAP kinase activation. However, the mechanism by which TAK1 regulates BMP signalling in chondrocytes is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Derynck and Zhang, 2003</xref>).</p><p>TAK1, a member of the MAPKKK family, was originally identified as a key regulator of MAPK kinase activation in TGF&#x003b2; and BMP signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> development, TAK1 mediates mesoderm induction and patterning downstream of BMP ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Shibuya <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Mutations in the mouse <italic>Tak1</italic> gene causes defects in the developing intraembryoinc vasculature and yolk sac, phenotypes similar to those caused by loss of function mutations in SMAD5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chang <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Shim <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Jadrich <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), suggesting that TAK1 may be important for Smad activation downstream of BMP stimulation. However, no biochemical or <italic>in vivo</italic> functional data currently exist to support this hypothesis.</p><p>Because of the early lethality of mice with a germline deletion of <italic>Tak1</italic>, cellular studies in these mice were limited to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). TAK1-deficient MEFs displayed normal activation of canonical Smads after TGF&#x003b2; stimulation, despite displaying a block in NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK activation by microbial products in the innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Shim <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). TAK1 also has critical functions in the regulation of adaptive immunity where it is required for antigen receptor signalling in both T cells and B cells through its regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Sato <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Wan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In addition to its role in the immune system, TAK1 functions as a key regulator of vascular development and keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Omori <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Sayama <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and mediates survival of hematopoietic cells and hepatocytes through its regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Tang <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Given earlier studies suggesting a role for TAK1 in signalling downstream of both the BMP and TGF&#x003b2; signalling pathways and the importance of these pathways for chondrocyte biology, we decided to generate mice with cartilage-specific deletion of the <italic>Tak1</italic> gene to address the physiological roles of mammalian TAK1 in cartilage. Deletion of <italic>Tak1</italic> in chondrocytes resulted in a dramatic runting phenotype with chondrodysplasia and joint abnormalities similar to that seen in mice deficient in BMP signalling. Biochemical analysis of TAK1-deficient chondrocytes confirmed a defect in BMP signalling that unexpectedly resulted in impaired Smad1/5/8 activation in addition to defective p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinase signalling. We provide the first evidence that TAK1 is required for the normal development and preservation of cartilage.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of TAK1 in cartilage</title><p>As the expression pattern for TAK1 in cartilage is unknown, we stained for TAK1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on coronal tibial sections from a postnatal day 20 (p20) mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). TAK1 staining was largely restricted to prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes. Hypertrophic chondrocytes from both the terminal growth plate and the area surrounding the secondary centre of ossification showed positive staining. Additionally, TAK1 expression in E16.5 embryos was examined. TAK1 is widely expressed in multiple embryonic cartilage tissues, including the chondroepiphyses of the long bones, the laryngeal and tracheal cartilage, and the developing frontal bone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Abnormal cartilage development in TAK1-deficient mice</title><p>To determine the role of TAK1 in cartilage development, we generated mice lacking <italic>Tak1</italic> in cartilage by intercrossing a <italic>Tak1</italic> floxed-allele strain of mice with a type II collagen-cre deleter strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Ovchinnikov <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). IHC for TAK1 expression confirmed deletion specifically in chondrocytes, with staining absent in both the terminal growth plate and the hypertrophic chondrocytes surrounding the secondary centre of ossification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Animals homozygous for the floxed allele expressing the cre transgene (hereafter referred to as <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice) displayed severe postnatal growth retardation culminating in death by 2&#x02013;3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). As shown in Alizarin red S/Alcian blue stained skeletal preps of p20 mice, <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice showed proportional shortening of the long bones of the limbs, a &#x02018;doming' of the cranium, malocclusion, and kyphosis of the thoracic spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> postnatal day 0 (p0) offspring showed a modest reduction in the length of long bones and disorganization of proliferating chondrocyte columns in the growth plate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2A and B</xref>). Animals heterozygous for the floxed allele expressing the cre transgene showed no appreciable phenotype at any age (data not shown). Histologic analysis of coronal sections of <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> tibias confirmed a marked reduction in overall size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, the formation of secondary ossification centres was delayed, with <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice showing only minimal vascular invasion and calcification within the secondary centre of ossification. Notably, <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> chondrocytes surrounding the secondary ossification centre progressed normally through the hypertrophic stage of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>, arrow).</p><p>To determine whether the runting observed in <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice is the result of a delay in endochondral ossification of long bones, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for osteopontin on femurs from E16.5 embryos to highlight the ossified portion of the bone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). As <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> embryos displayed a similar extent of ossification, it is unlikely that the runting phenotype observed postnatally is the result of defects in the early stages of endochondral ossification. The long bones of E18.5 embryos were similarly of comparable length to wild-type controls (data not shown). Finally, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of Collagen X&#x003b1; (ColX) was performed to determine the effects of TAK1 deletion on chondrocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although p20 mice displayed a moderate reduction in the size of the prehypertrophic/hypertrophic zone of ColX-positive chondrocytes, E16.5 and E18.5 embryos were found to display normal growth plate architecture. Taken together, these data indicate that the runting phenotype observed in <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice has an onset sometime between E18.5 and birth.</p><p>The overall reduction in the size of the <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> chondroepiphysis could be due to increased chondrocyte apoptosis or decreased chondrocyte proliferation. To determine the relative contributions of each, <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> chondroepiphyses were stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an index of cell proliferation and by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) as a marker for apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> chondroepiphyses displayed both a decrease in chondrocyte proliferation in the prehypertrophic/proliferating zone of the growth plate and an increase in the apoptosis of terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes, indicating that both mechanisms contribute to the decrease in the size of the chondroepiphysis.</p><p>Radiographs revealed dislocation of the elbow and a corresponding lateral deviation of the forearm in <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>, upper panels). The penetrance of this phenotype was &#x0223c;80&#x00025; by two weeks of age. Alizarin red/alcian blue stained skeletal preparations of the elbow showed a similar disruption of the elbow architecture with the formation of ectopic calcifications in the joint space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>, lower panels). Tissue sections taken parallel to the long axis of the forelimb showed that this phenotype corresponds with an overgrowth of the articular cartilage on the distal humerus facing the radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2F</xref>, upper panels). The proximal end of the radius has expanded extensively around the protruding articular cartilage of the humerus to the point of displacing the normal articulation between the ulna and the distal humerus. To determine whether the elbow phenotype observed postnatally represents a developmental defect in joint formation, we examined the elbow joint of E14.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2F</xref>, lower panels). The distal humerus and the proximal radius were present as a single continuous skeletal element in <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> embryos, whereas control embryos showed a clear cavitation of the joint and a separation of the two skeletal elements. Cavitation of the joint between the humerus and the ulna occurred normally (data not shown). Considering that histologic analysis of the p20 elbow joint shows the presence of a joint space between the distal humerus and proximal radius, this indicates that <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice display a delay in cavitation of the humero-radial joint space.</p><p>In addition, as shown in the high-power views of skeletal preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G</xref>), the phalanges of the hindlimbs show a marked medial deviation and the tarsals show a failure to separate during development, the cuboid, lateral cuneiform, intermediate cuneiform, navicular, and calcaneus all forming a continuous skeletal element. Although the tarsals of the littermate control mouse show complete ossification by 20 days of age, the fused tarsal element of <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice shows incomplete ossification with a layer of Alcian blue positive cartilage surrounding the ossified centre. In contrast, the hip, shoulder, and temperomandibular joints showed no signs of developmental abnormalities (data not shown). Thus, <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice show both impaired growth of skeletal elements and defects in the elbow and tarsal joints. In this respect, they resemble a mixture of the tarsal and elbow abnormalities observed in GDF5-deficient mice and the long bone abnormalities present in mice lacking BMP 2/4/7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Storm <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reduced levels of BMP signalling in TAK1-deficient mice</title><p>Overall phenotypic similarities between <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice and mice with specific deletions of multiple BMP receptor subunits in chondrocytes suggested a role for TAK1 in BMP signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Yoon <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). To address this possibility directly, we performed immunostaining analysis for the phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 (BMP-responsive Smads) in the proximal tibia of <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice. Phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/8 were significantly reduced in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, immunoblotting analysis of primary chondrocytes showed decreased basal levels of phosphorylated Smad 1/5/8 in TAK1-deficent chondrocytes derived from p0 <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice, as compared with littermate control chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, <italic>Tak1</italic> deletion did not affect the <italic>ex vivo</italic> basal phosphorylation levels of Smad2, and levels of Smad1 and Bmpr1A protein in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes were comparable to wt chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Hence, <italic>Tak1</italic> deletion results in reduced levels of activated Smad1/5/8 <italic>in vivo</italic> implying that TAK1 may regulate BMP-responsive Smad activation (Smad1/5/8), but not TGF&#x003b2;-responsive Smad activation (Smad2). In addition, TAK1 appears to regulate Smad phosphorylation rather than altering expression of BMP signalling components. P38 is also known to be phosphorylated downstream of BMP stimulation; however, we were unable to determine phospho-p38 levels in cartilage <italic>in vivo</italic> by IHC, despite multiple attempts.</p><p>As BMP signalling was reduced in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> measurements of phosphorylated signalling intermediates in <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice, we examined expression levels of known BMP target genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indian hedgehog (IHH) is a key regulator of bone formation that coordinates both chondrocyte proliferation/differentiation and osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kronenberg, 2003</xref>). Mice in which chondrocytes are genetically unable to respond to BMPs show decreased expression of IHH in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, and this is proposed as a major contributor to the limb growth retardation seen in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Grimsrud <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Yoon <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). We tested whether a similar reduction in IHH might contribute to the runting seen in <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panels). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization of the proximal tibia with IHH probes showed a moderate decrease of IHH transcript levels in the hypertropic chondrocytes of <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice. To show that this reduction in IHH transcript levels resulted in a functional decrease in IHH signalling <italic>in vivo</italic>, we also performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to quantify levels of the IHH target gene, patched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panels). Patched expression was reduced in both prehypertrophic chondrocytes and in the bone collar. The reduction in patched expression even outside of cartilage strongly suggests that TAK1 functions upstream of IHH expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes and not in signal transduction downstream of IHH.</p><p>To confirm a functional defect in BMP signalling <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to measure the transcript levels of <italic>Id1</italic>, a known BMP target gene in multiple systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002</xref>). ID1 expression was almost completely ablated in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> mice, whereas expression of type X collagen (ColX), the major extracelluar matrix marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes, was little affected by <italic>Tak1</italic> deletion, showing only a modest reduction in the overall size of the hypertrophic zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panels). These findings suggest that TAK1 is indispensable for the <italic>in vivo</italic> response to BMPs in the terminal growth plate.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Impaired BMP signalling in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes</title><p>BMP signalling through Smad1/5/8 is required for the induction of several canonical BMP target genes, including <italic>Id1</italic>, <italic>Msx1</italic>, and <italic>Noggin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kameda <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Wan and Cao, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Binato <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). We analysed the induction of these BMP target genes in primary TAK1-deficient chondrocytes by using a quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). After activation by BMP2/7, wt but not TAK1-deficient chondrocytes showed an appreciable induction in levels of Id1, Msx1, and Noggin transcripts consistent with a role for TAK1 in mediating BMP-induced gene expression in chondrocytes.</p><p>To facilitate further biochemical analysis, we immortalized primary chondrocytes derived from <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> newborn offspring by stably transfecting them with the SV40 large T antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Shim <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Immunoblotting for TAK1 confirmed a significant reduction in TAK1 expression in <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> relative to <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). As deletion of <italic>Tak1</italic> by col2-cre is not 100&#x00025; efficient and chondrocytes were maintained as bulk cultures rather than colonies to avoid clonal artifacts, residual TAK1 expression is present in <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> chondrocyte cultures. We tested the requirement for TAK1 in BMP or TGF&#x003b2; signalling by measuring BMP/TGF&#x003b2;-dependent promoter activation. Cells were transfected with BMP or TGF&#x003b2;-responsive luciferase reporters and stimulated with BMP2/7 or TGF&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> chondrocytes showed approximately two-fold induction in luciferase reporter activity in response to BMP2/7, whereas <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> chondrocytes showed no response. Similarly, overexpression of a catalytically inactive TAK1 mutant (&#x00394;N/K63W; hereafter CI) blocked gene induction in wt chondrocytes in response to BMP2/7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>, right panel). TGF&#x003b2;-induced luciferase reporter activity was not affected by <italic>Tak1</italic> deletion, suggesting that, in chondrocytes, TAK1 is important for BMP but not TGF&#x003b2; signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reduced activation of Smad and MAP kinase pathways by BMPs in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes</title><p>It has been reported that BMP signalling is mediated by two distinct pathways: the canonical Smad pathway and the TAK1-p38 MAP kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Derynck and Zhang, 2003</xref>). We examined the activation of these two arms of BMP signalling in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for phospho-Smad1/5/8 and phospho-p38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>). In the absence of TAK1, Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation was moderately decreased, and a small, but reproducible decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of phosphorylated Smad proteins was detected. However, <italic>Tak1</italic> deletion did not affect total Smad1 protein levels, implying that TAK1 regulates Smad phosphorylation rather than altering expression of Smad1/5/8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3C</xref>). <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> chondrocytes exhibited impaired activation of p38, Erk1/2, and Jnk1/2 MAP kinases in response to BMP2/7, implying that TAK1 may function as a key regulator of BMP-mediated MAP kinase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D and E</xref>).

Importantly, analysis of endogenous TAK1 and Smad1 showed an association 5&#x02013;15 min after stimulation with BMP2/7, kinetics similar to the rate of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation indicating that TAK1 interacts with BMP-responsive Smad proteins in chondrocytes in an inducible manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>).

As expected, GST-Mkk6, a known TAK1 substrate, was phosphorylated by HA-TAK1 (&#x00394;N), but not HA-TAK1 (CI). Notably, GST-Smad1 and -Smad2 were also both phosphorylated by HA-TAK1 (&#x00394;N) but not HA-TAK1 (CI), indicating that TAK1 can phosphorylate Smad proteins. Given that TAK1 can bind and phosphorylate both Smad1 and Smad2, it may be important for Smad phosphorylation in both BMP and TGF&#x003b2; signalling pathways. To test this hypothesis, we analysed TAK1-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1 and 2 after BMP and TGF&#x003b2; stimulation using <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>). Surprisingly, little GST-Smad2 phosphorylation was detected in response to TGF&#x003b2;, whereas GST-Smad1 was strongly phosphorylated with peak activity 15 min postinduction by BMP2/7. However, GST-Mkk6 was equivalently phosphorylated after stimulation with either TGF&#x003b2; or BMP2/7, indicating that TAK1 is similarly activated downstream of TGF&#x003b2; and BMP2/7 signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>).

BMPR1 was not detectable in co-immunoprecipitations with HA-TAK1 (&#x00394;N), making it unlikely that the S463/S465 phosphorylation observed was mediated by BMPR1 that co-purified with HA-TAK1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4E</xref>). TAK1-induced phosphorylation at C-terminal serines was weaker than phosphorylation by constitutively active BMPR1B (Q203D), implying that BMPR1B is able to phosphorylate Smad1 at C-terminal serines more efficiently than TAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).

The observation that the <italic>Tak1</italic> phenotype represents a mixture of BMP-associated phenotypes indicates that TAK1 serves an essential function downstream of multiple BMP family members.

Hence, these aspects of the <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> phenotype may be due to dysregulation of Smad signalling downstream of BMPs. However, mice with a conditional deletion of Smad4 in chondrocytes do not display elbow dislocation or fusion of the tarsal bones.

Combined with the earlier onset of the dislocation phenotype in TAK1-deficient mice, this finding suggests that BMPR1B may have partial functional redundancy with another receptor subunit acting upstream of TAK1. This receptor subunit is highly likely to be BMPR1A, but the severe cartilage defects in mice lacking both BMPR1A/B in cartilage make analysis of this redundancy difficult <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Yoon <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>This similarity between <italic>GDF5</italic> and <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>col2</sup> phenotypes is further supported by the finding of tarsal bone fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Storm <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>).

In our study, analysis of primary and transformed chondrocytes revealed that TAK1 is able to phosphorylate Smad proteins in response to BMP2/7 but not TGF&#x003b2;. However, Smad1 (a BMP-responsive Smad) and Smad2 (a TGF&#x003b2;-responsive Smad) can both be phosphorylated by overexpressed, constitutively active TAK1, indicating that TAK1 has an equivalent intrinsic ability to phosphorylate both substrates. Additionally, phosphorylation of MKK6 by TAK1 is similar after BMP2/7 and TGF&#x003b2; stimulation, indicating that the activation of TAK1 kinase is similar downstream of each ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that the activated TGF&#x003b2; receptor 1 recruits TRAF6 to the receptor complex and subsequently induces ubiquitination of TRAF6 and promotes TRAF6 interaction with TAK1, thereby resulting in activation of p38/JNK MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Sorrentino <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Yamashita <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).

Given these observations, the most likely explanation for the selective involvement of TAK1 in Smad phosphorylation downstream of BMP but not TGF&#x003b2; stimulation is that another component of the TGF&#x003b2; receptor complex acts to block TAK1 access to Smad2. For such a mechanism to be effective, the active fraction of TAK1 must be sequestered at the TGF&#x003b2; receptor complex.

Further, the absence of detectable phosphorylation sites in the MH1 and MH2 domain by the phosphopeptide analysis suggests that these additional sites might lie inside the linker region. Unfortunately, the lack of Trypsin and Lys-C cleavable sites precluded finding phosphorylation site in this region. It has been reported that the Smad1 linker region contains four MAPK phosphorylation sites and two Gsk3&#x003b2; sites and MAPK and Gsk3&#x003b2; phosphorylation of the linker region restricts Smad1 activity by recruiting the ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, leading to degradation of Smad1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kretzschmar <italic>et al</italic>, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fuentealba <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Sapkota <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). As phosphorylation of these sites is important for the regulation of FGF/BMP pathway crosstalk, it will be interesting to test the possibility that TAK1 is involved in the regulation of BMP signalling by FGF through its phosphorylation of those linker phosphorylation sites.

Gel band containing Flag-Smad1 was excised and subjected to in-gel reduction and alkalyation followed by Lys-C or trypsin digestion. Digested peptides were extracted from the gel and analysed by liquid chromatography MS/MS (LC-MS/MS). Peptides were separated across a 37-min gradient ranging from 4 to 27&#x00025; (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1&#x00025; (v/v) formic acid in a microcapillary (125 &#x003bc;m &#x000d7; 18 cm) column packed with C<sub>18</sub> reverse-phase material (Magic C18AQ, 5 &#x003bc;m particles, 200 &#x000c5; pore size, Michrom Bioresources) and on-line analysed on The LTQ Orbitrap XL<sup>TM</sup> hybrid FTMS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each cycle, one full MS scan acquired on the Orbitrap at high mass resolution was followed by 10 MS/MS spectra on the linear ion trap XL from the 10 most abundant ions. MS/MS spectra were searched using the Sequest algorithm against Smad1 protein with dynamic modification of methionine oxidation and serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation.
