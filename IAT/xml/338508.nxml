Hybridization experiments revealed the presence of multiple bcr gene-related loci within the human genome. Two of these were molecularly cloned and characterized. Both loci contain exons and introns corresponding to the 3' region of the bcr gene. Restriction enzyme and DNA sequence analysis indicate a very high degree of conservation between bcr and the two related genomic sequences. Both bcr-related loci are located on chromosome 22, one centromeric, the other telomeric, of the bcr gene. Within the two bcr related genomic sequences, fragments or the complete coding sequences of an unrelated gene were found to be present. This gene was identified; it encodes gamma-glutamyl transferase, an enzyme involved in the glutathione metabolism.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0285-a" xlink:role="8047"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0289-a" xlink:role="8051"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0290-a" xlink:role="8052"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0283.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8045"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0284.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8046"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0285.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8047"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0286.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8048"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0287.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8049"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0288.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8050"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0289.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8051"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0290.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8052"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0291.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8053"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0292.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8054"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0293.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8055"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00158-0294.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8056"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
