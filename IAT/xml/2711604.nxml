Although dynamin was originally identified as a microtubule-binding protein, the physiological relevance of this function was unclear. Recently, mutations in the ubiquitously expressed dynamin 2 (dyn2) protein were found in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, which is an inherited peripheral neuropathy. In this study, we show that one of these mutations, 551&#x00394;3, induces prominent decoration of microtubules with the mutant dyn2. Dyn2 was required for proper dynamic instability of microtubules, and this was impaired in cells expressing the 551&#x00394;3 mutant, which showed a remarkable increase in microtubule acetylation, a marker of stable microtubules. Depletion of endogenous dyn2 with a small interfering RNA also resulted in the accumulation of stable microtubules. Furthermore, the formation of mature Golgi complexes, which depends on microtubule-dependent membrane transport, was impaired in both dyn2 knockdown cells and cells expressing the 551&#x00394;3 mutant. Collectively, our results suggest that dyn2 regulates dynamic instability of microtubules, which is essential for organelle motility, and that this function may be impaired in CMT disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynamin was first identified as a microtubule-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shpetner and Vallee, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Scaife and Margolis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Maeda et al., 1992</xref>). However, the importance of its association with microtubules was questioned after the establishment of a function for dynamin in endocytosis. Dynamin is a homologue of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster shibire</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 1991</xref>), mutations in dynamin block endocytosis, and dynamin&#x02019;s GTPase activity is crucial for the fission of endocytic pits. Polymerized dynamin rings have been proposed to function as a pinchase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Urrutia et al., 1997</xref>) or poppase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stowell et al., 1999</xref>) or by a molecular switch mechanism requiring subsequent activation of a downstream substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sever et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Three dynamin isoforms have been identified in mammals. Dynamin 1 (dyn1) and dyn3 are tissue specific (neurons and brain for dyn1; testis, lung, and heart for dyn3), whereas dyn2 is ubiquitously expressed. Dynamin has five characteristic domains: a GTPase domain in its N terminus, a middle domain that binds to &#x003b3;-tubulin; a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds to phosphinositide-4,5-diphosphate and leads to membrane localization, a GTPase effector domain, and a pro-rich domain in the C terminus. The pro-rich domain binds to various SH3 domain&#x02013;containing proteins and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Herskovits et al., 1993b</xref>).</p><p>Recently, dyn2 mutations were found to be associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zuchner et al., 2005</xref>), but the molecular and cellular mechanisms of dyn2&#x02019;s involvement in disease pathogenesis are still unclear. The CMT hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies fall into two main groups. CMT type 1 includes demyelinating forms of the disease in which nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) are reduced; CMT type 2 includes the axonal forms in which NCVs are normal, but conduction amplitudes are decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Suter and Scherer, 2003</xref>). There are also dominant intermediate (DI) subtypes of CMT, denoted DI-CMTA, DI-CMTB, and DI-CMTC, that are characterized by both axonal and demyelinating NCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kennerson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Verhoeven et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Jordanova et al., 2003</xref>). DI-CMTB patients have mutations within the dyn2 PH domain, including the deletion mutant 551&#x00394;3 and the point mutant K558E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zuchner et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests that the impairment in CMT may be caused by an inability to form active dynamin polymers, which are needed to bind and then deform membranes to carry out peripheral cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">McNiven, 2005</xref>). In this study, we investigated the effect of the 551&#x00394;3 mutation on dyn2 function and found that it induces the accumulation of stable microtubules, as does the reduction of endogenous dyn2, indicating that dyn2 regulates the dynamic instability of microtubules and that increased microtubule stability is one feature of CMT that is linked to mutations in dynamin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We assessed whether expression of the CMT-associated 551&#x00394;3 and K558E dyn2 mutants inhibits endocytosis by transfecting COS-7 cells with dyn2 cDNAs and examining uptake of Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;transferrin. As a positive control, the cells were transfected with K44A, a GTPase-negative dyn2 mutant which is known to inhibit endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Herskovits et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van der Bliek et al., 1993</xref>). Although expression of either the K558E or K44A mutant completely blocked endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zuchner et al., 2005</xref>), expression of 551&#x00394;3 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). However, the transferrin-containing compartments in the 551&#x00394;3-transfected cells no longer accumulated at the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) but were instead transported to early and recycling endosomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803153/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Internalized transferrin-containing endosomes are transported along microtubules by dynein&#x02013;dynactin complexes to perinuclear recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Burkhardt et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that processes involved in capturing endosomes or traveling along microtubules are impaired in 551&#x00394;3-expressing cells. Supporting this microtubule-related role for dyn2, it has previously been shown that 551&#x00394;3 expression induces microtubule reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zuchner et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, dynamin was originally identified as a microtubule-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shpetner and Vallee, 1989</xref>). Both dyn1 and dyn2 polymerize around microtubules, and these interactions lead to the stimulation of dynamin GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Maeda et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Warnock et al., 1997</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of the 551&#x00394;3 dyn2 mutant does not inhibit transferrin endocytosis.</bold> COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;transferrin for 30 min.

Microtubules were visualized by immunostaining for &#x003b1;-tubulin. Immunostaining with antibodies to V5 indicated that wild-type dyn2 was present in a punctate pattern on the plasma membrane as well as in substantial amounts in the cytosol, where the puncta seemed to colocalize with the microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>). 551&#x00394;3 dyn2 also colocalized with and prominently decorated microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, G&#x02013;I</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zuchner et al., 2005</xref>). To more clearly demonstrate the association of dyn2 with microtubules, we performed immunolocalization after cytosolic proteins were extracted from cells with Triton X-100. Both wild-type dyn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D&#x02013;F</xref>) and 551&#x00394;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, J&#x02013;L</xref>) clearly colocalized with the microtubules in these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zuchner et al., 2005</xref>). These results indicate that a subpopulation of dyn2 molecules localizes to microtubules in vivo and that the 551&#x00394;3 mutation may alter the microtubule-binding properties of dyn2.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Dyn2 remains associated with microtubules after the extraction of soluble proteins.</bold> (A&#x02013;L) COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and incubated with antibodies specific for V5 (A, D, G, and J) or &#x003b1;-tubulin (B, E, H, and K), and the V5 and &#x003b1;-tubulin images were merged (C, F, I, and L).

Therefore, we tested whether the dyn2 mutants could have the same effect. Acetylation distinguishes stable microtubules from dynamic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Piperno et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Westermann and Weber, 2003</xref>), although tubulin acetylation itself does not promote microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Palazzo et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, we assessed the effect of 551&#x00394;3 expression in COS-7 cells on microtubule acetylation. Expression of wild-type, K44A, or K558E dyn2 did not alter the degree of microtubule acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref> and not depicted). In contrast, 551&#x00394;3 expression resulted in a massive accumulation of acetylated tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Quantitative image analysis revealed a significant increase of acetylated tubulin in 551&#x00394;3-expressing cells (the fluorescence intensity ratios of acetylated tubulin to dynamin-V5 were 3.9 &#x000b1; 1.8 and 2.4 &#x000b1; 1.1 in 551&#x00394;3 and wild-type cells, respectively; <italic>n</italic> = 30, P &#x0003c; 0.05), with no significant difference in total tubulin expression between 551&#x00394;3 and the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). Thus, the differential microtubule-binding patterns observed in 551&#x00394;3-expressing cells are likely caused by the abnormal accumulation of acetylated microtubules.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of the 551&#x00394;3 dyn2 mutant causes the accumulation of acetylated tubulin.</bold> (A) COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs, fixed 48 h later, and visualized with antibodies specific for V5 (red) and acetylated-tubulin (Acet-tubulin; green).

To this end, we examined the effect of siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous dyn2 on microtubule stability in HeLa cells. Two different dyn2-specific siRNAs successfully knocked down endogenous dyn2 in HeLa cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803153/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>), and transferrin internalization was inhibited (not depicted), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). Immunofluorescence of the dyn2 siRNA&#x02013;treated (dyn2 siRNA) cells did not show any apparent reorganization of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). However, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that these cells had an approximately twofold increase in acetylated tubulin, although the total tubulin protein levels did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). In addition, localization of EB1 to the plus end of dynamic/growing microtubules in control siRNA&#x02013;treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Mimori-Kiyosue and Tsukita, 2003</xref>) was significantly reduced in dyn2 siRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref> and Fig. S2, D and E), whereas total EB1 protein levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In contrast, the minus ends of microtubules were not affected by the siRNA treatment, as judged by staining pericentrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) or &#x003b3;-tubulin (not depicted). These results indicate that depletion of endogenous dyn2, like the 551&#x00394;3 mutant, induces the accumulation of acetylated microtubules and reduces the proportion of dynamic/growing microtubules. Thus, the 551&#x00394;3-induced accumulation of stable microtubules is caused by a loss of microtubule-related dyn2 function.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Depletion of endogenous dyn2 by RNAi results in stable microtubule accumulation.</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with control or dyn2-specific siRNA.

First, we treated siRNA-transfected HeLa cells with nocodazole, which is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization. As the half life of stable microtubules (&#x0223c;1 h) is much longer than that of dynamic microtubules (&#x0223c;5&#x02013;10 min; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Schulze et al., 1987</xref>), nocodazole is expected to be more effective on dynamic microtubules. Nocodazole treatment for up to 1 h resulted in the disappearance of microtubules in control cells, whereas microtubules persisted in dyn2 siRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>). Next, we analyzed the effect of dyn2 siRNA on HeLa cells that stably express GFP-tubulin. In control cells, microtubules showed repeated growth and shrinkage, a behavior known as dynamic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>), whereas growth and shrinkage were less frequently observed in dyn2 siRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803153/DC1">Video 1</ext-link>). Thus, dyn2 depletion indeed induces stable microtubule accumulation. Analysis of various microtubule dynamic instability parameters in dyn2 siRNA cells revealed that neither the growth rate nor the shortening rate was significantly changed by dyn2 depletion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). This indicates that dyn2 depletion does not affect the microtubule polymerization or depolymerization mechanisms but rather increases the duration of microtubule pause. This implies that wild-type dyn2 increases the frequency of microtubule growth and/or shrinkage.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>Microtubule dynamic instability parameters</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameters</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control siRNA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dyn2 siRNA</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rate of growth (&#x000b5;m/min)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.1 &#x000b1; 6.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.9 &#x000b1; 4.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rate of shortening (&#x000b5;m/min)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.1 &#x000b1; 9.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.6 &#x000b1; 8.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of growth (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of pause (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">89.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of shortening (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>17 and 20 events were measured for control and dyn2 siRNA, respectively, and SD is shown.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Next, we investigated how the effect of dyn2 on microtubules contributes to cellular activities.

As controls, we also examined Golgi formation in K44A- and K558E-expressing cells, in which endocytosis is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Unlike expression of either K44A or K558E, 551&#x00394;3 expression induced Golgi fragmentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803153/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Thus, the Golgi fragmentation in dyn2 siRNA cells is not caused by the inhibition of dynamin-dependent endocytosis but is more likely the result of impaired organelle transport, which is dependent on normal microtubule dynamic instability. The regulation of microtubule stability by dyn2 seems to be independent of its GTPase activity because the K44A mutant had no effect on microtubule-dependent organelle transport (Fig. S3 B). Similarly, the role of dyn2 in centrosome cohesion does not require its GTP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that dyn2 can function as a structural protein independently of its GTPase activity.</p><p>How is microtubule-dependent transport impaired by dyn2 depletion or expression of the 551&#x00394;3 mutation? One possibility is that minus end&#x02013;oriented motor proteins are inhibited in these cells. Supporting this, inhibition of these motor proteins has been observed when dynamitin, a subunit of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex, is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Burkhardt et al., 1997</xref>). Alternatively, dyn2 depletion and 551&#x00394;3 expression may impair the capture of pre-Golgi intermediates onto microtubules. To examine these two possibilities, we analyzed the movement of the fragmented Golgi in dyn2-depleted HeLa cells. For this purpose, HeLa cells expressing <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (NAGT)&#x02013;GFP, a Golgi marker, were transfected with different dyn2 siRNA constructs, and Golgi fragmentation was induced by nocodazole treatment. The nocodazole was then washed out to allow microtubule polymerization, and the movement of the fragmented Golgi during the recovery phase was observed by live cell imaging. In control cells, the fragmented Golgi eventually moved toward the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803153/DC1">Video 2</ext-link>). However, in dyn2 siRNA cells, we did not observe perinuclear concentration of the fragmented Golgi, even after 30 min. Furthermore, tracking analysis revealed that movement of the fragmented Golgi in control siRNA cells repeatedly stopped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>), which might reflect a search and capture behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vaughan, 2005</xref>). However, in the dyn2 siRNA cells, such movement was rarely seen. Moreover, although the velocity of the fragmented Golgi in dyn2 siRNA cells was comparable with that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>), the total distance moved was reduced in the dyn2 siRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). These results suggest that, although movement along microtubules was not altered by dyn2 depletion, microtubule-mediated capture was inhibited. Because pre-Golgi elements are captured by interacting with EB1, which localizes on microtubule plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vaughan, 2005</xref>), the dyn2 depletion&#x02013;mediated reduction of EB1 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) may be responsible for the fragmentation of the Golgi complex. In dyn2 siRNA cells, EB1 was no longer localized in a punctate manner at the plus ends of microtubules, whereas the protein level was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>), demonstrating that dyn2 knockdown caused dislocation of EB1 from microtubule plus ends to the cytosol. It is unlikely that dyn2 directly acts on EB1 because dyn2 is localized along the entire length of the microtubules rather than restricted to the plus ends. However, it is plausible that the mislocalization of EB1 in dyn2 siRNA cells is a consequence of altered microtubule stability.</p><p>To date, dynamin has been found to function in vesicle fission in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Takei et al., 1995</xref>), in actin reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schafer, 2004</xref>), and in centrosome cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>). This study reveals yet another function, namely in dynamic instability of microtubules. We showed that this function of dyn2 is essential for microtubule-dependent membrane transport. It is unlikely that the accumulation of stable microtubules and the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus are caused by dysfunction of the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>) because we did not detect impairment of the centrosome in the dyn2 siRNA&#x02013;transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Decreased microtubule instability might impair capture of pre-Golgi organelles, which is necessary for the formation of the mature Golgi. Alternatively, dynamin might be involved in the maintenance of cargo attachment to the microtubules. Further examination is required to distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that different CMT mutants affect different membrane transport events. Thus, K558E affects endocytosis, whereas 551&#x00394;3 impairs microtubule-dependent transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). This is consistent with observations that suggest neuropathies, including CMT, are caused by defects in membrane transport steps such as endocytosis, axonal transport, or protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Suter and Scherer, 2003</xref>). Notably, all of the dyn2 mutations that are associated with CMT, including 551&#x00394;3 and K558E, are located in the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zuchner et al., 2005</xref>). The predicted structures of these mutant PH domains indicate that 551&#x00394;3 but not K558E impairs the proper formation of the &#x003b2;3/&#x003b2;4 loops, which is required for dyn2 dimerization. This implies that the decoration of microtubules induced by 551&#x00394;3, not by dyn2 depletion, may be caused by the abnormal polymerization activity of 551&#x00394;3 resulting from the loss of dyn2 dimerization. In other words, wild-type dyn2 may contribute to the correct bundling of microtubules through its polymerization activity. Interestingly, dynamin was identified previously as a microtubule-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shpetner and Vallee, 1989</xref>) that cross-links microtubules to form bundles in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Scaife and Margolis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Maeda et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shpetner and Vallee, 1992</xref>). Dynamin also increases its GTPase activity when it polymerizes around microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Warnock et al., 1997</xref>). However, the physiological significance of these observations was unclear. This study is the first indication that dyn2 plays a role in the regulation of dynamic instability of microtubules in vivo and that this function of dyn2 is essential for microtubule-dependent membrane transport. However, the fact that dyn2 localizes at the microtubule bundle in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson et al., 2002</xref>) and at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>) implies it has even more diverse microtubule-related functions, the elucidation of which will also require further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>All chemicals and reagents were of biochemical grade.
