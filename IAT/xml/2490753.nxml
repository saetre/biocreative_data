The NMR structure of YacG shows the presence of an unusual zinc-finger motif. YacG was predicted to be a part of DNA gyrase interactome based on protein&#x02013;protein interaction network. We demonstrate that YacG inhibits all the catalytic activities of DNA gyrase by preventing its DNA binding. Topoisomerase I and IV activities remain unaltered in the presence of YacG and its action appears to be restricted only to DNA gyrase. The inhibition of the enzyme activity is due to the binding of YacG to carboxyl terminal domain of GyrB.

However, even for the most intensively studied eubacteria, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a number of the open reading frames (ORFs) have unknown functions owing to their unrelatedness to other functionally well-characterized proteins. While loss of function mutational analysis has been successful in identifying protein functions in several cases, it fails miserably in determining the function of &#x02018;non essential&#x02019; genes. Further, with the advent of structural genomics, there has been a rapid increase in the repertoire of proteins whose structures are known but functions are still elusive. Predicting function from structure is a relatively young and exciting field but has its own limitations in defining the functions for proteins with novel and unusual structural motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Interaction network of protein complexes involved in diverse biological processes in <italic>E. coli</italic> was uncovered and validated by sequential rounds of tagging and purification. In this network, the interacting partners of protein complexes were purified by affinity chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. A zinc-finger protein, YacG of yet unknown function, was shown to be a member of DNA gyrase interactome in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The NMR structure of YacG revealed the presence of a unique zinc-finger motif in this protein and an unstructured tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). No function could be assigned to this protein from any studies so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>).</p><p>Amongst the enzymes responsible for maintaining the topological state of DNA in cells, DNA gyrase is unique in its ability to catalyze negative supercoiling of DNA in an ATP-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). A steady state level of negative supercoiling is required for chromosome condensation, transcription initiation and enzyme complex movement during replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The optimal level of intracellular activity of DNA gyrase is very crucial and strictly controlled for cell division, functioning and survival. In the crowded cellular confines, uncontrolled DNA gyrase activity could be disastrous to the cell. It is now apparent that certain endogenous proteins play a role in regulating DNA gyrase activity. For example, in case of thioredoxins (TrxA, TrxC) from <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> sp., a change in oxygen tension influences their redox-state, resulting in altered gyrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Recently, few other cellular proteins have been identified and shown to be inhibitors of DNA gyrase. These include GyrI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), MurI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and MfpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In the present study, we describe the function for YacG in specific inhibition of DNA gyrase. Our studies reveal that YacG inhibits the enzyme activity with a mechanism of action distinct from that of well characterized group of gyrase inhibitors, viz. quinolones and coumarins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL26 (DE3) was used for overexpression of YacG from pET15b construct. pTrc99C-<italic>yacG</italic> was generated and used for assessing the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of YacG overexpression in DH10B strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>.

DNA relaxation activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I was not affected in the presence of YacG, even at a very high concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Topoisomerase IV is the other eubacterial type II topoisomerase, which catalyses ATP-dependent relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Topoisomerase IV activity from <italic>E. coli</italic> was also unaltered in the presence of YacG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). These studies indicate that the action of YacG is restricted to DNA gyrase amongst the major cellular topoisomerases.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of inhibition by YacG</title><p>Since YacG inhibited all the three catalytic activities of DNA gyrase, it seems to target a step common to these reactions. During its catalytic cycle, gyrase remodels topology of DNA by passing one double-stranded DNA segment through a transient, enzyme-mediated break in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Thus the reaction involves a series of orchestrated steps initiated by the binding of the tetrameric (A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> complex) holoenzyme to DNA followed by cleavage, strand passage and religation. ATP hydrolysis is required for the enzyme turnover to begin the next round of supercoiling. To elucidate the mode of action by YacG, we tested its effect on the first step of the gyrase reaction, i.e. DNA binding by EMSAs. The amount of retarded gyrase&#x02013;DNA noncovalent complex was significantly reduced in the presence of YacG, with a concomitant increase in the free DNA species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). YacG did not bind DNA on its own, but could destabilize the preformed gyrase&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). GyrA subunit of the enzyme is primarily responsible for the DNA binding while GyrB possesses the ATPase activity. However, the intrinsic DNA binding by GyrA subunit alone was unhindered in the presence of YacG, upon prior incubation of GyrA and YacG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lanes 4 and 5). YacG did not abolish inter-subunit (GyrA&#x02013;GyrB) interaction (not shown). These studies reveal that YacG inhibits all the catalytic activities of DNA gyrase by preventing the holoenzyme&#x02013;DNA interaction. As a consequence, the subsequent steps in the gyrase reaction cycle <italic>viz</italic>. DNA cleavage are also affected (not shown). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>YacG prevents gyrase&#x02013;DNA interaction.

We carried out SPR, pull-down assays, proteolytic protection and gel filtration for this purpose. SPR analysis revealed a significant increase in the response units upon binding of GyrB to immobilized YacG thereby indicating a direct interaction between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Based on SPR data, we could obtain an apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) value of 350 nM. No interaction could be detected between YacG and GyrA (not shown). Limited proteolysis experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B further supported these findings. GyrB harbors two stable domains, a 43 kDa amino terminal domain (NTD) and a 47 kDa carboxyl terminal domain (CTD). Proteolysis of GyrB produces primarily two fragments, a 43 kDa NTD, and 25 kDa polypeptide generated from the 47 kDa CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Upon trypsin digestion of GyrB in the presence of YacG, 47 kDa CTD was protected, with a concomitant reduction in the intensity of the 25 kDa fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 3 and 5). Protection was not observed in the presence of MurI, another endogenous gyrase interacting protein, which does not bind to GyrB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). As expected, the cleavage pattern of GyrA was unaltered in the presence of YacG (not shown). These data suggest that YacG binding alters protease sensitivity and protects the CTD of GyrB. Since the full length GyrB and the 47 kDa CTD fragment of GyrB interacted with YacG, these proteins were also precipitated along with YacG in the pellet fraction in the pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lane 2). Similar pull-down assays with gyrase holoenzyme (A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> complex) revealed that YacG did not hamper the interaction between GyrA and GyrB subunits (data not shown). Gel filtration analysis also revealed a specific interaction between YacG and GyrB subunit of gyrase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn355/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Interaction between YacG and DNA gyrase subunits and its effect on ATPase activity.

However, YacG also inhibited intrinsic ATPase activity of GyrB, albeit to a much lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E).

These results indicate that the interaction of gyrase with YacG leads to the reduction in the negatively supercoiled status of the DNA and also a consequent inhibitory effect on cell growth. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>YacG overexpression leads to growth inhibition and relaxed DNA topology.

We demonstrate that YacG is an endogenous inhibitor of DNA gyrase. It physically interacts with the GyrB subunit and sequesters the enzyme away from its substrate DNA. The action of YacG is specific for gyrase. Other major cellular topoisomerases such as DNA topoisomerase I and topoisomerase IV are not inhibited by YacG.</p><p>The NMR structure of YacG revealed the presence of a novel sequence motif in the zinc-finger family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The unique consensus motif for the cysteine residues (-C-X2-C-X15-C-X3-C-) is conserved in all YacG homologues but absent in any other group of proteins. In this motif, zinc is coordinated by four cysteines residues, and the sequence pattern is similar to the characteristic &#x02018;rubredoxin knuckle&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). It has a similar architecture and Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordination to N-terminal Zn finger of GATA-1 (NF). Based on this structural similarity, YacG was thought to be involved in transcription either through protein&#x02013;protein interactions (e.g. NF) or by DNA binding (C-terminal Zn finger of GATA-1). However, the critical residues important for these activities are not conserved in YacG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and the physiological function of the protein remained elusive until the present study.</p><p>Identification of topoisomerase interacting proteins is an emerging area. YacG is a new member in the growing list of DNA gyrase modulatory proteins. From the detailed characterization presented here, it is evident that its mode of action has similarity to other chromosomally encoded gyrase inhibitors like GyrI, MurI and MfpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">8&#x02013;12</xref>). All these inhibitors essentially influence the enzyme activity by sequestering the enzyme away from DNA. None of them cause cytotoxicity, which usually arises as a result of DNA damage caused by accumulation of gyrase&#x02013;DNA covalent intermediate. Comparative analysis of these proteinaceous inhibitors, however, does not reveal a common motif or structural fold required for their ability to inhibit DNA gyrase. Further, some of these endogenous proteins have their own primary physiological function. For instance, in addition to its gyrase inhibitory property MurI is an integral component of cell wall biosynthesis machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, it appears that in at least few of the cases, their gyrase interaction function is of more recent origin.</p><p>At present, the physiological role of many of these inhibitors is not very apparent. In the intracellular milieu, one would expect the levels of gyrase and YacG to be vastly different. Gyrase is an integral house keeping function present at about 1000&#x02013;3000 molecules/cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In contrast, YacG is likely to be present at very low levels. The apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> observed in the present studies would indicate inhibition of only few gyrase molecules <italic>in vivo</italic> without having any adverse effects to the cell under normal cellular growth. However, under conditions when YacG is upregulated, its modulation of DNA gyrase activity might lead to important physiological consequences. The activity of DNA gyrase needs to be regulated at various stages of cell growth as uncontrolled gyrase activity can be disastrous for the cell. YacG and other such proteins could bind transiently to DNA gyrase to sequester it away under situations when gyrase activity needs to be checked and kept under control. Sequestration of DNA gyrase by these modulators might serve as a &#x02018;check point&#x02019; coordinating the cell division and DNA replication.</p><p>Finally, complete genome sequences of diverse bacteria have reinvigorated an effort to assign function to all the genes in any given organism. Until functions are assigned to the unknown ORFs, any organism's capabilities cannot be completely described. Thus, in this postgenome sequencing era, an immediate challenge would be to make best use of the large amount of high throughput data to determine functions for the currently uncharacterized proteins. Several approaches have been developed for determining the protein function using the information derived from sequence similarity, phylogenetic profiles and protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Assignment of function for YacG described in this study is an example for integration of data obtained from both proteomic and reductionist approach.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn355/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn355_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn355_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="gkn355_nar-00602-f-2008-File007.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="gkn355_nar-00602-f-2008-File008.jpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank J.
