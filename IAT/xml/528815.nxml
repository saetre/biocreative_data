The relatively small (&#x0223c;34 Mb) chromosomal genome of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and high efficiency of targeted gene disruption have enabled researchers to characterize many specific gene functions. However, the number of selectable markers in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is restricted, as is the ability to perform effective genetic crosses between strains. Thus, it has been difficult to create multiple mutations within an individual cell to study epistatic relationships among genes or potential redundancies between various pathways. We now describe a robust system for the production of multiple gene mutations in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> by recycling a single selectable marker, Blasticidin S resistance, using the Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> system. We confirm the effectiveness of the system by generating a single cell carrying four separate gene disruptions. Furthermore, the cells remain sensitive to transformation for additional targeted or random mutagenesis requiring Blasticidin selection and for functional expression studies of mutated or tagged proteins using other selectable markers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The eukaryote <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> has many advantages that make it amenable to molecular manipulation for the analyses of gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c2">2</xref>). The chromosomal genome of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is haploid and relatively small (&#x0223c;34 Mb), although its transcriptome contains &#x0223c;11&#x02009;000 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c2">2</xref>). Targeting mutations in non-essential genes by homologous recombination is often at a relatively high frequency (&#x0003e;20%) and methods for generating genome-wide mutations by insertional (REMI) mutagenesis and for recovering the targeted genes are also well developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c3">3</xref>). In addition, many transformation vectors exist for the temporal- or spatial-specific expression of mutated or tagged proteins. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> grow as individual cells, but initiate a multicellular developmental program upon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c2">2</xref>). Thus, growth and development are distinct and separable events, facilitating the isolation and maintenance of strains carrying gene mutations that are required for the development but not for the growth.</p><p><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> transformants can be selected using auxotrophy (uracil, thymidine) or antibiotic [neomycin (Neo, G418), Blasticidin S and hygromycin] resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c4">4</xref>). Auxotrophic selection requires cells with specific mutations and growth in specialized media. The G418 selection often yields cells carrying concatamerized, transforming DNA fragments and sometimes multiple insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c5">5</xref>). In contrast, Blasticidin-resistance (Bsr) selection is very efficient, tolerates no background growth in standard medium and generally results in cells carrying only single-copy integrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c6">6</xref>). Consequently, most targeted and REMI mutageneses in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> now utilize Bsr. However, since genetic crossing in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is inefficient, it is not a simple procedure to generate strains carrying multiple mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c7">7</xref>). Yet, such multiple mutated strains are critical for studying the interaction among various genes or for examining functional genetic redundancies. Furthermore, strains carrying multiple mutations must still be sensitive to further transformation for expression studies of tagged (e.g. GFP and RFP) or mutated proteins for the analyses of complex and dynamic processes. Finally, in the absence of additional selection procedures, it is not possible to utilize a REMI screen for genetic suppression of Bsr-generated gene disruptants.</p><p>To overcome these genetic limitations, we significantly simplified strategies developed for directed recombination&#x0002f;deletion between specific DNA sequences to facilitate the targeted disruption of multiple genes in a single cell. We have adapted the Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> recombination system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c9">9</xref>) for use in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> to permit the recycling of Bsr and the continuous generation of new targeted mutations. Briefly, a gene targeting construct was created that contains a <italic>Bsr</italic>-cassette flanked (floxed) by <italic>loxP</italic> recombination sites; translational stop codons in all six reading frames were also added outside the <italic>loxP</italic> sites. Transient expression of the Cre recombinase removes the Bsr expression cassette through intramolecular recombination but does not remove the translational stops. This event creates a nonsense mutation within the targeted gene in a Blasticidin-sensitive cell line. We have confirmed the molecular recombination events by sequence analyses and proved the robustness of the system by creating cell lines with multiple targeted mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>The floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> targeting vector pLRBLP</title><p>The <italic>loxP</italic> recombination site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f1">1</xref>A) consists of two highly conserved inverted repeats separated by a variable spacer region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c10">10</xref>). The spacer region determines the specificity of <italic>loxP</italic> recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c11">11</xref>). Only <italic>loxP</italic> sites separated by identical spacer sequences can recombine. The relative orientation of the spacer between two <italic>loxP</italic> sites determines the type of recombination event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c11">11</xref>). Intramolecular recombination between two <italic>loxP</italic> sites in the same orientation will circularize and delete the intervening sequences, leaving a single <italic>loxP</italic> site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c11">11</xref>).</p><p>Two <italic>loxP</italic> sites were engineered in the same orientation within the pBluescriptKS plasmid and six stop codons in all six reading frames were placed outside of the <italic>loxP</italic> sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f1">1</xref>B). Finally, the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> Bsr expression cassette (<italic>act15</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>Bsr</italic>) was inserted between the two <italic>loxP</italic> sites to create the floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> gene disruption vector pLPBLP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f1">1</xref>B). Transcriptional regulation of <italic>Bsr</italic> is under control of the <italic>Dictyostelium actin 15</italic> promoter and the <italic>Dictyostelium actin 8</italic> terminator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c6">6</xref>). The entire fragment is 1.5 kb and is flanked by SmaI sites, permitting the simple cloning into any gene of interest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f1">1</xref>B). Unique cloning sites are also present: KpnI-SalI-AccI-ClaI-HindIII-SmaI&#x02014;<italic>act15</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>Bsr</italic>&#x02014;PstI-SmaI-BamHI-SpeI-NotI</p><p>The pLPBLP vector has been deposited with the Dicty Stock Center for distribution (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dictybase.org/StockCenter/StockCenter.html">http://dictybase.org/StockCenter/StockCenter.html</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Transformation for homologous recombination</title><p>The floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> cassette of pLPBLP was used to engineer various gene-targeting disruption constructs by standard cloning procedures. The DNA-mediated transformation was with linear vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c4">4</xref>) and clonal selection (10&#x02013;14 days) used 10 &#x003bc;g&#x0002f;ml Blasticidin S (MP Biomedicals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c6">6</xref>). Genomic DNA was purified (High Pure PCR Template Kit; Roche), and targeted gene disruptions were preliminarily identified by PCR. Several PCRs were performed. One PCR design used a primer from within the <italic>Bsr</italic> cassette and another primer outside of the targeting fragment. Another PCR examined the presence of the wild-type or disrupted gene using primers that flanked the floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> insertion site. Southern blot hybridizations were used for absolute confirmation of gene disruption.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> Cre expression vector pDEX-NLS-cre</title><p>We used a Cre protein (NLS-cre) engineered with a nuclear localization signal to promote high efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic> recombination between <italic>loxP</italic> sites.

Approximately 10<sup>7</sup> growth-phase cells were washed at 0&#x000b0;C, once in 17 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 and once in electroporation buffer (EP; 50 mM sucrose, 10 mM Na-K-phosphate buffer, pH 6.1). The cell pellet was then resuspended in 700 &#x003bc;l EP and the suspension gently mixed with &#x0223c;35 &#x003bc;g pDEX-NLS-cre DNA at 0&#x000b0;C in a 4 mm electroporation cuvette. Electroporation was for 1 ms, at 1 kV and 10 uF with the Gene Pulser Xcell (Biorad); two pulses were applied at 5 s intervals. After electroporation, the cells were transferred to a 9 cm plastic petri dish and shaken at &#x0223c;40 r.p.m. for 15 min at 20&#x000b0;C. The suspension was adjusted to 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and shaking was continued for another 15 min. Finally, 12 ml axenic growth medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c14">14</xref>) was added, and the cells were allowed to recover for 24 h.</p><p>After the 24 h recovery period, the cells were placed in axenic medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c14">14</xref>) containing 10&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;g&#x0002f;ml of G418 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) to select for pDEX-NLS-cre transformants. Selection in G418 continued for 3&#x02013;10 days. The cells were then plated for clonal isolation by standard dilution. The clonal cell lines were subsequently picked in replica onto two different plates. The first was a standard SM agar plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c14">14</xref>) using growing <italic>Klebsiella aerogenes</italic> (<italic>K.a</italic>.) as the nutrient source. The second was a non-nutrient phosphate (30 ml) agar plate (17 mM Na&#x0002f;K-phosphate, pH 6.0 in 1.5% agar) layered with 500 &#x003bc;l of a concentrated <italic>K.a</italic>. suspension in Na&#x0002f;K-phosphate buffer and 120 &#x003bc;l of Blasticidin S at 10 mg&#x0002f;ml; the final concentration of Blasticidin S in the agar plate was 40 &#x003bc;g&#x0002f;ml. All <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells grow on SM <italic>K.a</italic>. plates, but only <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> that have retained the <italic>Bsr</italic> cassette grow rapidly in the presence of Blasticidin S. A WT parental cell was always used for growth control. This selection procedure allows for the rapid screening of hundreds of Cre transformants.</p><p>Cells not growing in Blasticidin S were replica plated into 24 well microtitre plates containing either axenic media, axenic media with Blasticidin S or axenic media with G418. Each transformation gave different frequencies for selective and optimized growth. Genomic DNA from Blasticidin- and G418-sensitive cell lines was analyzed by PCR, Southern blot hybridization and&#x0002f;or sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments to confirm Cre recombination and also the absence of both the <italic>Bsr</italic> and <italic>Neo</italic> expression cassettes. Usually, &#x0003e;95% of cells selected by growth criteria showed appropriate Cre recombination. This method was used to multiply target four diaphanous-related formin (drf) genes: <italic>drf1</italic> on chromosome 5, accession no. J812237; <italic>drf2</italic> on chromosome 4, accession no. AJ748258; <italic>drf3</italic> on chromosome 1, accession no. AJ812236; and <italic>drf4</italic> on chromosome 3, accession no. AJ812734.</p><p>As an alternative, one can bypass the entire G418 and Blasticidin S selections, and directly analyze clonal populations of cells after transient Cre expression. Following electroporation, the cells were clonally diluted into microtitre dishes at 0.5 cells&#x0002f;well and grown in the absence of Blasticidin S or G418 selection. While this strategy requires less time, it is also less efficient; in general, &#x0003c;5% of the colonies isolated may be pure Cre recombinants. This approach was used to multiply target DDB0183838 and DDB0184318 (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dictybase.org/">http://dictybase.org/</ext-link>), separated by 1.2 Mb on chromosome 6.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that we were unable to promote <italic>in vivo</italic> recombination between <italic>loxP</italic> sites by direct electroporation of Cre protein. Our approach was modeled after the success observed with restriction enzymes during REMI mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c3">3</xref>), but we did not exploit all possible experimental variations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Validation of Cre-mediated recombination</title><p>We created a disrupting gene construct of DDB0183838 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f1">1</xref>), transformed it into <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, selected cells for Bsr growth and isolated individual colonies. Genomic DNA was prepared from the clonal isolates and homologous recombination monitored by PCR using primers within the gene sequence that lay outside of the floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> insertion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f1">1</xref>C). The endogenous, WT control band was &#x0223c;450 bp, while the gene containing the floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> insert was &#x0223c;2000 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f2">2</xref>A). Southern blot hybridization was used to confirm gene disruptions and the absence of secondary sites of insertion. The frequency for this targeted disruption was &#x0223c;80%.</p><p>A Bsr knockout cell line was chosen and transformed transiently to express NLS-cre. The cells were then clonally diluted into microtitre dishes at 0.5 cells&#x0002f;well and grown in the absence of Blasticidin S or G418 selection. PCR was used to assess the loss of <italic>Bsr</italic> sequences via recombination between <italic>loxP</italic> sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f1">1</xref>D). The Cre-mediated recombinant fragment is &#x0223c;520 bp, 73 bp larger than the endogenous, WT 450 bp band (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f1">1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f2">2</xref>B). To confirm the specificity of the recombination event, we sub-cloned and sequenced the WT and Cre-generated fragments. As seen in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f1">1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f1">1</xref>D, there was an exact recombination between the <italic>loxP</italic> sites. The <italic>Bsr</italic> cassette was removed but the in-frame stop codons and a single <italic>loxP</italic> site remained. This created a nonsense mutation in the gene. The resulting cell line was unable to grow in either Blasticidin S or G418, indicating that neither <italic>Bsr</italic> of pLPBLP nor <italic>Neo</italic> of the Cre plasmids were integrated into the genome. This conclusion was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f2">2</xref>C). This simple Cre recombination and selection approach had an efficiency of &#x0223c;3% for the isolation of pure populations of Cre-recombined cells. An alternative approach using G418 selection (see Materials and Methods) and described below for <italic>drf</italic> gene targeting can increase this frequency to &#x0003e;95%.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of Bsr recycling</title><p>We next tested the efficacy of Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> for recycling of Blasticidin S selection. A second gene, DDB0184318, disruption fragment was prepared using pLPBLP. This was used to transform the Cre recombination, Blasticidin-sensitive cell line of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f2">2</xref>B. The frequency for the second site disruption was &#x0223c;20% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f3">3</xref>A). The same frequency was obtained using a WT, parental cell line. Secondary, Cre transformation of the double knockout cell line was able to drive recombination within the new floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> insertion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f3">3</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Highly efficient generation of multiple gene disruptions in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic></title><p>The <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> genome contains six <italic>drf</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c15">15</xref>). To test the robustness of the Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> system, we chose four <italic>drf</italic> genes (<italic>drf1</italic>, <italic>drf2</italic>, <italic>drf3</italic> and <italic>drf4</italic>) for targeted disruption through four alternating rounds of gene inactivation followed by <italic>Bsr</italic> deletion through transient expression of NLS-cre. As depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f4">4</xref>A and exemplified for <italic>drf1</italic>, each targeting vector contained the floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> cassette inserted between 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; sequences that were specific for each <italic>drf</italic> gene. After transformation with linearized constructs, Blasticidin-resistant, <italic>drf</italic> knockout mutants were identified by PCR using sequence-specific primers and genomic DNA of clonal isolates (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f4">4</xref>B). The floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> cassette of <italic>drf</italic>-null cells was deleted by transient transfection using pDEX-NLS-cre, initial growth in the presence of G418, and final screening on selective <italic>K.a</italic>. plates (see Materials and Methods). Genomic DNA from transformants that were sensitive to both Blasticidin S and G418 was assayed by PCR in the absence of the <italic>Bsr</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f4">4</xref>C and D) and <italic>Neo</italic> cassettes (see also Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f2">2</xref>C).</p><p>This strategy proved to be successful for the elimination of three additional <italic>drf</italic> genes in the same cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f4">4</xref>E). As a final step of confirmation, we analyzed the rearrangements of the four <italic>drf</italic> genes in the quadruple mutant. Each locus was amplified with U and D specific primers (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f4">4</xref>A), and their PCR products were compared with those obtained from WT genomic DNA. Since <italic>drf</italic> gene fragments were deleted during each of the targeted homologous recombination events (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh136f4">4</xref>A), the PCR products amplified from the mutant DNA were always smaller than those from WT.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have demonstrated a highly effective system to recycle a single selectable marker for the generation of multiple gene disruptions within a single cell. The technique described greatly surpasses the efficiencies of approaches that rely on parasexual genetics or fortuitous molecular events dictated by co-transformation for isolating <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> with multiple mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c16">16</xref>).</p><p>The difficulty to generate <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cell lines with multiple gene mutations has restricted the analyses of complex biochemical and genetic pathways and the identification of processes controlled by multigene families or functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c17">17</xref>). We believe that the described Bsr recycling approach largely overcomes this limitation. The cells deleted of <italic>Bsr</italic> are sensitive to additional rounds of gene disruption or to REMI mutagenic screening. In addition, the cells can be engineered for the regulated expression of specific protein variants, for global screening, for complementation expression or for gene interference by RNAi or antisense methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c20">20</xref>).</p><p>There are some potential engineering confines that should be considered when designing targeting constructs using the floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> system. Gene disruptions that carry the entire <italic>Bsr</italic> cassette usually do not produce a stable transcript or protein fragment. However, we frequently detect normal levels of mRNA expression after the floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> is removed via Cre recombination. Although the mRNA now encodes an in-frame nonsense codon that prevents the synthesis of a full-length protein, there is high probability for the production of truncated protein variants. The position of the engineered nonsense codon within an individual gene dictates the protein variant produced, and different protein truncations can cause distinct phenotypic effects. This feature can be used to an advantage if one wishes to examine the function of proteins with specific C-terminal truncations; otherwise floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> insertions should be designed near the 5&#x02032; end of the gene. Parental and Cre-recombined cells must always be compared to ensure that <italic>Bsr</italic> deletion (or Cre-transformation) has not created a dominant (or secondary) phenotype.</p><p>After each successful Cre recombination event, one <italic>loxP</italic> site will remain in the genome. If two <italic>loxP</italic>-targeted genes were located on the same chromosome, there is a theoretical potential for Cre-mediated recombination between the <italic>loxP</italic> sites of the two genes and thus, for deletion of the entire genomic region between them. However, since <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> has a haploid genome, large deletions will be lethal, making such recombinations unlikely to be a common occurrence. Indeed, we were able to successfully disrupt genes DDB0183838 and DDB0184318 that are located on the same chromosome, but separated by &#x0223c;1.2 Mb. While small deletions are possible, they will be readily identified during genomic mapping by the PCR or southern blot hybridizations that are required to confirm the desired, site-specific recombination event. Nonetheless, there are simple modifications that can be used to prevent recombination between genes. The spacer sequence of the <italic>loxP</italic> site conveys recombination specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c11">11</xref>). Thus, different floxed-<italic>Bsr</italic> cassettes will not recombine. Alternatively, the Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> system can be coupled with other recombination systems, such as Flp-<italic>FRT</italic> and &#x003c6;C31-<italic>att</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c9">9</xref>), for increased specificity and flexibility.</p><p>The Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> approach should also be easily adapted for many of the applications proven so effective for mouse genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c9">9</xref>). Gene constructs can be engineered that become disrupted only upon the conditional expression of Cre. Many <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> transformation vectors already exist that direct gene expression with specific developmental patterns. In addition, the expression can also be regulated by a tetracycline-responsive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c21">21</xref>). Thus, it should be possible to study the effects of gene loss at specific developmental stages or in specific cell types. We do not believe that high-level expression of Cre will cause deleterious biological effects in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> by inducing recombination within WT chromosomes. We have not observed any abnormal phenotypes upon the expression of Cre from a constitutive promoter (data not shown). Furthermore, sequence analysis of the entire <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> genome does not reveal any endogenous cryptic <italic>loxP</italic> sites, as are suggested to occur in genomes of higher complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c22">22</xref>).</p><p>Conditional Cre expression can also be used to provide an additional layer of transcriptional regulation during development. Recombination between <italic>loxP</italic> sites can be used to induce gene expression by directly fusing a promoter and gene target separated by a floxed inactivating sequence, or conversely, to promote gene repression by deleting an element essential for transcription.</p><p>The utility of Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> recombination is also not limited to Bsr recycling for gene inactivation. Once <italic>loxP</italic> sites have been inserted into a gene of interest, it now becomes a site for recombination with exogenous transforming DNA elements for gene replacement studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh136c11">11</xref>). The <italic>loxP</italic> constructs are thus facile targets for the creation of gene knockins for the expression of mutant or tagged protein variants or novel promoter&#x0002f;reporter fusions.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gnh136f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> A strategy for Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> recycling of the Bsr selectable marker.
