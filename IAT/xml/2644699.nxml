A <italic>hugZ </italic>deletion mutant was obtained by homologous recombination. This mutant strain showed poor growth when hemoglobin was provided as the source of iron, partly because of its failure to utilize hemoglobin efficiently.

Increasing evidence suggests that <italic>H. pylori </italic>has adapted particularly to the niche of human stomach. Genetic diversity is widespread among the clinical isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This polymorphism can be attributed mainly to the consequence of adaptive changes during colonization, which in turn imply that <italic>H. pylori </italic>has a specialized adaptation mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In our earlier study, we harvested several clinical strains of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, which initially grew weakly in Mongolian gerbils but subsequently adapted after 13 serial passages <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To elucidate the adaptive colonizing mechanisms of <italic>H. pylori </italic>in Mongolian gerbils further, we applied proteomic approaches to one representative <italic>H. pylori </italic>isolate. Fortunately, four adaptive colonization-associated proteins were identified, among which HugZ (heme iron utilization-related protein) was implicated in adaptive colonization by <italic>H. pylori </italic>for the first time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the exact physiological role of HugZ remains elusive.</p><p>Iron is regarded as an essential trace element in living organisms, including pathogenic bacteria. It has been suggested that acquisition of iron by <italic>H. pylori </italic>from the host environment is required for colonization, infection and resulting disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, intracellular bacterial iron is precisely regulated and maintained at an appropriate level. Most of the free iron ion in the host is complexed with high-affinity binding proteins such as transferrin in the serum and lactoferrin on mucosal surfaces, so the level of extracellular iron available in the host is extremely low. Consequently, bacterial pathogens including <italic>H. pylori </italic>must have developed some mechanism to compete for the limited host iron for their survival and infection cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>As we know, the siderophore is a common iron acquisition apparatus/system in many pathogens; it obtains iron from transferrin or lactoferrin in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Other bacteria are also capable of utilizing heme complexes as iron sources. Acquisition can be described as comprising the following steps: binding, uptake and degradation of heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Some pathogens (such as <italic>Campylobacter jejuni </italic>(<italic>C. jejuni</italic>), <italic>Vibrio cholerae </italic>and <italic>Yersinia entercolitica</italic>) have developed iron-dependent outer membrane receptors specific for heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Heme is transported through such receptors via a TonB-mediated gated pore mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], then a periplasmic heme binding protein transports it to the cytoplasmic membrane, where a classical permease/ATPase is thought to transport it actively into the cytoplasm. Once the heme is located within the cytoplasm, a heme oxygenase protein (e.g. hemO) can utilize it. Heme oxygenase is rate-limiting in the degradation process, catalyzing the NADPH-reductase-dependent cleavage of heme to biliverdin with the release of iron and carbon monoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In <italic>H. pylori</italic>, the mechanism of utilization of heme iron is not yet completely clear. Although several heme iron-repressible outer membrane proteins (IROMPs) might be involved in heme binding and/or uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] by <italic>H. pylori</italic>, we still do not know which component functions as the heme oxygenase. In this report, we present the functional identification of HugZ as a heme oxygenase activity in <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Our data imply that the release of iron from heme by HugZ may play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of <italic>H. pylori</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Production and evaluation of homogeneous <italic>H. pylori </italic>HugZ</title><p>Bioinformatics analysis suggested that a <italic>hugZ </italic>homologue exists in <italic>H. pylori</italic>, which is very similar to that in <italic>C. jejuni </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). To test its activity in iron acquisition, we prepared homogeneous <italic>H. pylori </italic>HugZ protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. Initially, soluble 6 &#x000d7; His-tagged HugZ protein was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system; expression in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>(<italic>E. coli</italic>) turned the LB medium green (data not shown), implying the presence of a reductase. This observation supports the hypothesis that catalytic turnover of Heme-HugZ triggers the accumulation of biliverdin, which is consistent with the expression profiles of prokaryotic/eukaryotic heme oxygenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The recombinant HugZ protein purified by a Chelating Fastflow XK1610 column (CV = 18 ml) yielded 50 mg/liter and showed about 95% purity on 15% SDS-PAGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), indicating high homogeneity.

HugZ binding to hemin-agarose beads strongly indicated that it has heme-binding activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Similarly, <italic>in vitro </italic>absorption spectroscopy suggested that HugZ is able to bind heme. As we expected, when HugZ was mixed with hemin, the spectrum of the complex showed a typical spectrographic curve with a prominent Soret peak at 411 nm, and a shoulder at 540 nm and a smaller peak at 580 nm, corresponding to the &#x003b2;- and &#x003b1;-porphyrin bands of the heme-HugZ complex respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). To quantify heme binding, HugZ solution (20 &#x003bc;M) was titrated with increasing amounts of hemin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The increase in absorption leveled off at approximately 20 &#x003bc;M heme, showing a 1:1 stoichiometry of heme to HugZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Absorption spectroscopy of hemin binding to recombinant HugZ</bold>.

Coupled oxidation involves the generation of peroxide by the heme protein and is prevented if catalase is present. Heme oxygenases catalyze the opening of the heme macro-cycle in the presence of an electron donor. Purified heme oxygenase has been shown not to release the product biliverdin readily in the absence of biliverdin reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, most studies involve single turnover assays, as was done here. In addition, the <italic>in vivo </italic>electron donor for bacterial heme oxygenases is not known, but ascorbate or NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase may be used for catalysis by the pure enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the first experiment, heme degradation catalyzed by HugZ was measured spectrophotometrically using human NADPH-CPR as the electron donor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). NADPH was added to the reaction mixture in 10 &#x003bc;M increments and the mixture was scanned from 350 to 800 nm after each addition. The Soret band decreased successively after addition of NADPH. Finally, the HugZ substrate-hemin was exhausted and the NADPH was not oxidized completely, so there was absorption at 340 nm due to NADPH. Heme degradation did not occur if HugZ, NADPH or CPR was omitted from the reaction mixture (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Degradation of the heme:HugZ complex in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and ascorbic acid</bold>.

Heme was degraded more rapidly with ascorbate than with human NADPH-CPR, and most of the decrease was complete by 20 min after the ascorbate was added. No degradation of heme was observed in the absence of HugZ or ascorbate (not shown). Collectively, these findings showed that HugZ catalyzes the enzymatic degradation of heme.</p></sec><sec><title>Biliverdin and CO produced by HugZ-catalyzed heme degradation</title><p>Biliverdin is the final product of heme degradation by heme oxygenases. When heme was degraded by HugZ, a broad absorbance peak in the 660-nm region became prominent, implying is the presence of biliverdin. To determine the kind of biliverdin formed, we subjected this product to HPLC analysis. HPLC chromatography of all four possible biliverdin isomers is shown for comparison (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The HPLC profiles of the products formed during HugZ-catalyzed heme degradation with ascorbate and NADPH gave a retention time and absorption spectrum identical to that of biliverdin IX&#x003b4;.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>HPLC detection of the product of the HugZ reaction with NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase</bold>.

Iron metabolism-related proteins play important roles in <italic>H. pylori </italic>infections. However, the iron-specific metabolic mechanism in <italic>H. pylori </italic>is still not well understood. Bacteria require iron to complete their life cycles and in particular for growth and infection. The limited availability of extra-cellular iron in the host, which is partly due to iron insolubility, restricts microbial growth greatly, so iron acquisition seems to be crucial for the survival of pathogens. Actually, it has been suggested that bacteria evolve sophisticated systems to compete for iron with their hosts. In general, heme is an important iron source in hosts and it can be utilized by most pathogens. Heme is degraded by heme oxygenase in the bacterial cytoplasm, releasing the iron.</p><p>Heme oxygenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation; it catalyzes reduction system-dependent cleavage of heme to biliverdin with the release of iron and carbon monoxide. It is reasonable to suppose that bacterial heme oxygenase releases the iron from heme for subsequent use by the invading pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Heme oxygenases are widespread among pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>C. jejuni </italic>and <italic>Y. pestis </italic>and play key roles in the growth and colonization of those pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Heme oxygenase mutants of <italic>Corynebacterium diphtheriae </italic>and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis </italic>were unable to utilize heme or hemoglobin as an iron source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Similarly, it has been suggested that heme oxygenase (Cj1613c) is necessary for growth in <italic>C. jejuni </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For <italic>H. pylori</italic>, the role of heme degradation in iron metabolism is relatively obscure. In this study, we identified a heme oxygenase called HugZ that is responsible for heme iron utilization in <italic>H. pylori</italic>. The heme oxygenase activity of HugZ was confirmed by the appearance of characteristic spectral changes following addition of ascorbic acid or a NADPH-CPR system as electron donor. HugZ binds to hemin <italic>in vitro </italic>at 1:1 and produces absorbance bands at 411, 540 and 580 nm, which are similar to those reported for other heme oxygenases such as ChuS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and Cj1613c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The formation of a broad absorbance band at 395 and 660 nm suggests that the end product of heme degradation is iron-free biliverdin rather than ferric biliverdin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>We demonstrated that the products of <italic>hugZ </italic>cleave heme to carbon monoxide and biliverdin IX&#x003b4;, which shows that the &#x003b4;-meso carbon bridge position in the heme precursor is eliminated by HugZ. As with various eukaryotic and prokaryotic heme oxygenases, overexpression of HugZ in <italic>E. coli </italic>can make the culture medium green owing to the accumulation of biliverdin. It is presumed that during the expression of those exogenous heme oxygenases in <italic>E. coli</italic>, reducing systems in the bacterium support the catalytic turnover of heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, several reduction systems including human CPR and ascorbic acid can support biliverdin production by purified recombinant HugZ <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results suggest that <italic>H. pylori </italic>probably has the same reduction partners for HugZ-heme oxygenase activity.</p><p>Further experiments showed that the <italic>H. pylori hugZ </italic>mutant exhibited poor growth, though wild type strains grew well when heme was added to iron-restricted BBF, indicating that the <italic>hugZ </italic>mutant cannot effectively utilize hemoglobin as a heme iron source, which confirmed that HugZ is a heme oxygenase.</p><p>In mammals, the primary function of heme oxygenases is to maintain iron homeostasis, whereas prokaryotic heme oxygenases help bacteria to take in iron from heme. Most bacterial heme oxygenases are regulated by the ferric uptake repressor (Fur). Fur requires iron to bind to target DNA sequences (Fur-boxes) and controls the expression of iron-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Merrell and Gancz <italic>et al</italic>. used a Microarray to analyze the expression of iron-regulated genes in <italic>H. pylori </italic>and reported that <italic>hp0318 </italic>(<italic>hugZ</italic>) is one of the genes induced by iron starvation; they presumed that a hypothetical Fur box located before <italic>hp0321 </italic>controls <italic>hp0318 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our real-time quantitative RT PCR results also support that the view that <italic>hugZ </italic>(<italic>hp0318</italic>) is down-regulated by iron. However, further studies are needed to determine whether the presumed Fur box controls the transcription of <italic>hugZ</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, these findings confirm that <italic>H. pylori </italic>HP0318 (HugZ) is a heme oxygenase.
