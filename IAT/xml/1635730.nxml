The biochemical basis and the kinetics of the binding between these two glycoproteins are not clearly understood. Here we have addressed this deficit and provide further evidence supporting the role of the MUC16-mesothelin interaction in facilitating cell-cell binding under conditions that mimic the peritoneal environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study we utilize recombinant-Fc tagged human mesothelin to measure the binding kinetics of this glycoprotein to MUC16 expressed on the ovarian tumor cell line OVCAR-3. OVCAR-3 derived sublines that did not express MUC16 showed no affinity for mesothelin. In a flow cytometry-based assay mesothelin binds with very high affinity to the MUC16 on the OVCAR-3 cells with an apparent K<sub>d </sub>of 5&#x02013;10 nM. Maximum interaction occurs within 5 mins of incubation of the recombinant mesothelin with the OVCAR-3 cells and significant binding is observed even after 10 sec. A five-fold molar excess of soluble MUC16 was unable to completely inhibit the binding of mesothelin to the OVCAR-3 cells. Oxidation of the MUC16 glycans, removal of its N-linked oligosaccharides, and treatment of the mucin with wheat germ agglutinin and erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin abrogates its binding to mesothelin. These observations suggest that at least a subset of the MUC16-asscociated N-glycans is required for binding to mesothelin. We also demonstrate that MUC16 positive ovarian tumor cells exhibit increased adherence to A431 cells transfected with mesothelin (A431-Meso<sup>+</sup>). Only minimal adhesion is observed between MUC16 knockdown cells and A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells. The binding between the MUC16 expressing ovarian tumor cells and the A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells occurs even in the presence of ascites from patients with ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The strong binding kinetics of the mesothelin-MUC16 interaction and the cell adhesion between ovarian tumor cells and A431-Meso+ even in the presence of peritoneal fluid strongly support the importance of these two glycoproteins in the peritoneal metastasis of ovarian tumors. The demonstration that N-linked glycans are essential for mediating mesothlein-MUC16 binding may lead to novel therapeutic targets to control the spread of ovarian carcinoma.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The mucin MUC16 carries the peptide epitope CA125, which is a prominent molecular marker for monitoring the progression and recurrence of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. MUC16 is a very large mucin with an average molecular weight between 2.5&#x02013;5 million Da [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The peptide backbone of MUC16 is composed of the N-terminal region, an extensive tandem repeat domain, and a C-terminal region with a short cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The tandem repeat, a hallmark of all mucins, is composed of 18&#x02013;60 repeats, each of which contains 156 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The N-terminal domain has been proposed to be made up of 13,000 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition to the extensive protein structure, MUC16 is also heavily glycosylated with both O-linked and N-linked oligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Enumeration of the basic structure of MUC16 has led to recent studies to define the biological properties of this mucin. The over expression of MUC16 by many tumors of epithelial origin suggest an important role for this mucin in tumorigenesis. We have demonstrated that MUC16 inhibits the cytolytic responses of human natural killer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. MUC16 also binds to galectin-1, a mammalian lectin that is expressed on human immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These studies suggest that one role of MUC16 is to prevent efficient anti-tumor immune responses.</p><p>Another postulated function of MUC16 is to facilitate cell-cell interactions. A recombinant fragment of MUC16 composed of the cytoplasmic region and a partial tandem repeat domain binds to mesothelin, a glycoprotein that is highly expressed by ovarian tumors and mesotheliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Mesothelin is normally expressed on the mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In a heterotypic cell adhesion assay, the epithelial ovarian tumor cells, OVCAR-3, bind to the mesothelin expressing murine endothelial-like cell line, LO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Addition of increasing concentrations of an anti-mesothelin antibody inhibited the binding between these cells. These experiments suggest that mesothelin may play an important role in the metastasis of the ovarian tumors within the peritoneum.</p><p>Mesothelin is a 40 kDa glycoprotein that is initially synthesized as a 70 kDa precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Proteolytic cleavage results in the release of a 32 kDa fragment called the megakaryocyte potentiating factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The 40 kDa fragment of this precursor is anchored to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol linkage and is referred to as mesothelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Initial experiments suggested a role for mesothelin in cell adhesion events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, since mesothelin knock-out mice do not exhibit any adverse pathology, the exact function of this molecule is not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Considering the potential importance of the mesothelin-MUC16 interaction in ovarian tumor metastasis within the peritoneum, we have performed additional studies to carefully define its molecular characteristics. The data presented conclusively shows that mesothelin binds to native MUC16 expressed by the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3 and also to MUC16 isolated from the peritoneal fluid of patients with EOC.</p><p>Here we provide firm evidence that N-linked oligosaccharides of MUC16 are required for the binding of this mucin to mesothelin. Kinetic analysis is provided to demonstrate that mesothelin-MUC16 binding is a high affinity interaction that increases cell adhesion between MUC16 and mesothelin expressing cells. The importance of this observation to the peritoneal metastasis of ovarian tumors is discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mesothelin binds to native MUC16</title><p>Although mesothelin has been previously shown in direct assays to bind a recombinant fragment of MUC16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], it was important to conclusively demonstrate this interaction with native forms of this mucin. MUC16 was partially purified, by size exclusion chromatography, from OVCAR-3 cell culture media and from the peritoneal fluid of EOC patients as described in our earlier report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These MUC16 samples showed strong binding to the recombinant mesothelin tagged with the Fc fragment of rabbit IgG (meso-Fc) in western blot overlay experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). The banding pattern observed after overlaying the membranes with meso-Fc was identical to that obtained in blots where the mucin was detected with the anti-MUC16 antibody, VK-8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We also determined that this observation was not an artifact of direct binding of the Fc portion to MUC16, as binding of purified rabbit Fc to the mucin could not be detected by western blotting (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Mesothelin binds to native MUC16</bold>.

A control blot (right panel) with MUC16 from patient #2 (100 U of CA125; lane 1) and OVCAR-3 (500 U of CA125; lane 2) and meso-Fc (Lane 3) was overlaid with secondary antibody only. (B) For comparison, MUC16 from OVCAR-3 (100 U of CA125) was detected by VK-8 antibody.

Arguably, meso-Fc could bind to other ligands on the OVCAR-3 surface in addition to MUC16. To determine the specificity of meso-Fc binding to MUC16 on the cell surface, we utilized stable sublines derived from the parental OVCAR-3 cell line that did not carry MUC16 on their cell surface. These MUC16 "Knock-down" cells, designated #7 and #9, express an intracellular scFv fragment of the VK-8 antibody that captures the nascent MUC16 molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby inhibiting the expression of this mucin on the cell surface (Pinard et al, manuscript submitted). The #7 and #9 MUC16 knock-down cells showed only minimal affinity for meso-Fc (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Control cells designated as #12, which express a scFv fragment of a non-specific murine IgG, exhibited strong binding to meso-Fc (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). These results indicated that MUC16 was the only ligand for meso-Fc on the OVCAR-3 cell surface. Similar results were obtained (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c&#x02013;e</xref>) when the binding of meso-Fc to these sublines was detected by using the anti-mesothelin antibody MB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Mesothelin primarily binds to MUC16 on the OVCAR-3cell surface</bold>.

Such an increased expression of MUC16 on the #9 cells correlated with enhanced meso-Fc binding to these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mesothelin binds to MUC16 with strong affinity</title><p>Since MUC16 was shown to bind to mesothelin on the surface of the OVCAR-3 cells, we utilized this specificity of binding to devise a flow cytometry based assay to define the affinity and kinetics of the mesothelin-MUC16 interaction. In the first experiment, the OVCAR-3 cells were incubated with increasing amounts of MUC16 for 1 h prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Meso-Fc binding to the OVCAR-3 cells was concentration dependent with an apparent dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of 5 nM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Since the cell surface expression of MUC16 increases with the amount of time that the OVCAR-3 cells are maintained in culture, their capacity to bind meso-Fc amplifies proportionately (data not shown). This effect results in slight variations in the binding kinetics of meso-Fc. On average, the K<sub>d </sub>values range between 5&#x02013;10 nM.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Kinetics of the mesothelin-MUC16 interaction</bold>.

Composite analysis of three independent experiments is shown in the panel on the right. Middle panel shows native expression of MUC16 on the OVCAR-3 cells used in this assay. (B) Time kinetics of meso-Fc (25 nM) binding to OVCAR-3 cells was determined by flow cytometry. After incubation with meso-Fc for the designated time intervals, the cell suspensions were diluted with 2 ml of buffer (a step that takes approximately 10 s) and analyzed. Raw flow cytometry data from one experiment is shown in panel on the left and composite analysis of two independent experiments is in the right panel. The middle panel shows expression of MUC16 on the OVCAR-3 cells used in this experiment.

Binding was analyzed by flow cytometry. Left panel shows raw data for one experiment and panel on right shows composite data of two independent assays. The middle panels show VK-8 binding to the OVCAR-3 cells used in this experiment in the presence (green) or absence (blue) of soluble MUC16 (100 nM).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-5-50-3"/></fig><p>We routinely incubated the OVCAR-3 cells with meso-Fc for 1 h to detect binding of this chimera to the cell surface. In a time course study we have shown, however, that the optimum binding of meso-Fc to the OVCAR-3 cell surface is achieved within 5 mins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Significant binding of meso-Fc was observed even after an approximately 10 s incubation of this chimera with the OVCAR-3 cells. Together these experiments suggest that the mesothelin-MUC16 binding is a very high affinity interaction that occurs with rapid kinetics.</p><p>Inhibition studies using soluble MUC16 at half the molar amount of meso-Fc reduced the binding of this chimera to the OVCAR-3 cells by approximately 80% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). However, residual binding of meso-Fc to the cell surface is always observed even when a 5-fold molar excess of MUC16 is used in these experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>N-linked oligosaccharides of MUC16 are required for mesothelin binding</title><p>Considering its mucinous nature we next investigated if mesothelin recognized the protein of the oligosaccharide chains of MUC16. Periodate treatment of MUC16 under conditions that selectively oxidize only the vicinal hydroxyl groups present on the C8&#x02013;C9 positions of terminal sialic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] had no effect on the binding of meso-Fc to the mucin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). This result was supported by the observation that MUC16, upon desialylation with neuraminidase, retained its ability to bind to meso-Fc (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). On the contrary, oxidation of the vicinal hydroxyl groups present on the terminal sialic acids as well as the internal monosaccharides of the entire glycan chains of MUC16 resulted in an almost complete loss of meso-Fc binding to MUC16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). MUC16 is extensively glycosylated with both O-linked and N-linked glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The N-linked oligosaccharides were selectively removed by treating MUC16 with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGaseF). Enzymatic removal of the N-linked glycans corresponded with a decrease in molecular weight of MUC16 as detected by western blot analysis (data not shown). PNGaseF treated MUC16 almost completely lost its ability to bind to meso-Fc (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Mesothelin recognizes oligosaccharides expressed on MUC16</bold>.

Since the lectins could potentially bind to oligosaccharide chains expressed on meso-Fc and hence complicate the analyses, we employed recombinant non-glycosylated mesothelin that was synthesized by bacterial cells. In western blot overlay experiments, the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) strongly inhibited the binding of bacterial mesothelin to MUC16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). Appreciable inhibition was also observed with the lectin erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E-PHA), however, concanavalin A (ConA) was unable to block this binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>).</p><p>The ConA ligand &#x003b1;-methyl mannopyranoside, does not inhibit the binding of meso-Fc to MUC16 in western blot overlay experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>) and neither do the WGA ligands N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetyllactosamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>).

To obtain quantitative data we performed a flow cytometry assay where the formation of heterotypic doublets was determined. The ovarian tumor cells and the A431 cells were labeled with CellTracker Green and CellTracker Blue dyes, respectively. Heterotypic doublet formation between the green and blue labeled cells was measured by flow cytometry. When the #12 and the A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells were co-incubated, 25% of the total live cells formed heterotypic doublets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional File 2</xref>). The extent of heterotypic doublet formation was only 1.3% between the #7 and the A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells. Very small numbers (0.8%) of doublets were observed between the #7 and the A431-Meso<sup>- </sup>cells. The #12 and the A431-Meso<sup>- </sup>combination produced approximately 8% doublets suggesting that MUC16 may mediate cell adhesion via mesothelin-independent mechanisms.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>MUC16 expressing ovarian tumor cells form conjugates with mesothelin positive cells</bold>.

We therefore determined if the heterotypic doublet formation could occur even in the presence of peritoneal fluid from EOC patients (#15 and #24). Although the presence of ascites reduced the heterotypic cell adhesion between the #12 and the A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells by approximately 33%, robust doublet formation was still observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional File 2</xref>). The ascites fluid from patients #15 and #24 had CA125 levels of 45,600 U/ml and 83,600 U/ml. These values for CA125 correspond to 7 and 13 nM concentration of MUC16, respectively (see Discussion). Since we routinely observe that the concentration of CA125 in the peritoneal fluid is between 20,000&#x02013;100,000 U/ml the ascites samples we have used in this study are highly representative.</p><p>Considering the relatively small effect of soluble MUC16 from the ascites on heterotypic doublet formation, we further investigated the ability of the A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells to bind soluble MUC16. In this experiment, the A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells were incubated with either purified MUC16 or with ascites from EOC patient #15. Following incubation for 1 h, the amount of MUC16 on the A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells was measured by flow cytometry. Only a slight increase in cell surface MUC16 was detected which was not proportional to the amount of mesothelin expressed on these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Soluble MUC16 has a lower affinity for mesothelin</bold>.

The mean of seven independent experiments indicated that the homotypic doublets for the #12 and the #7 cells were 35.2% and 26.7% (P &#x0003c; 0.0001) of the total live cells analyzed. The interaction of mesothelin and MUC16 may enhance the physical association of tumor cells and contribute to spheroid formation. These homotypic doublets were observed even in the presence of peritoneal fluid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells upon incubation with MUC16 did not exhibit any appreciable homotypic doublet formation and neither did they bind to meso-Fc (data not shown). This data is consistent with the observation that the A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells do not bind appreciable amounts of MUC16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>MUC16-Mesothelin binding increases spheroid formation in ovarian tumor cells</bold>.

Cell binding studies suggested that mesothelin-MUC16 interaction could facilitate peritoneal metastasis of ovarian tumors. This hypothesis is also supported by the observation that both mesothelin and MUC16 are co-localized in immunohistochemical studies of ovarian tumors. Understanding the importance of MUC16-mesothelin binding may lead to novel therapies to control the peritoneal spread of ovarian tumors. With this in mind, a high throughput assay has been developed to determine the ability of biological agents to inhibit ovarian tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>To this date, the biochemical basis of the MUC16-mesothelin binding is not clearly understood. Our data addresses this deficiency. Here, we have provided evidence that mesothelin has a very strong affinity for MUC16 with an apparent K<sub>d </sub>of approximately 5 nM. The binding of these two molecules occurs with rapid kinetics as demonstrated by our flow cytometry based assays. We have conclusively shown that mesothelin interacts with both soluble and cell surface associated forms of native MUC16.</p><p>For the first time, we demonstrate that the N-linked glycans of MUC16 are required for binding to mesothelin. In this context it is important to note that Rump et al have reported that inhibition of O-glycosylation of the OVCAR-3 cells reduced the binding of mesothelin to the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since no data was provided to support this observation it is not possible to directly compare the results of this study with our observations. The importance of MUC16 N-glycans in the binding to mesothelin suggests at least two possibilities. First, the removal of the oligosaccharides may result in perturbation of the mesothelin binding site on the MUC16 protein backbone. This suggestion is albeit difficult to conceptualize since the MUC16 used in our western blot overlay experiments was already denatured. The second possibility that is currently under investigation in our laboratory is that mesothelin acts as a lectin and directly binds to at least a subset of the MUC16 associated N-glycans. If true, the inhibition of the mesothelin-MUC16 binding by WGA and E-PHA suggests that polylactosamine or bisecting type N-linked glycans may be the potential ligands for mesothelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The weak inhibition of mesothelin binding to OVCAR-3 cells by ovomucoid and ovotransferrin supports the involvement of the bisecting type N-glycans. Another possibility is that appropriate presentation of oligosaccharide ligands is required for mesothelin binding. WGA and E-PHA binding sites are abundant on human erythrocytes (Gubbels and Patankar, unpublished results) and the #7 and #9 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>). Yet, meso-Fc has no affinity for these cells. We propose that precise positioning and/or expression of appropriate glycans in high density is required for mesothelin to bind to candidate glycoprotein partners. MUC16, as a mucin, is extensively glycosylated. These glycans are likely to be presented in a repeating array on the tandem repeat domain of MUC16 making it a very high affinity mesothelin ligand.</p><p>Exhaustive studies that involve glycomic analysis of mesothelin bound MUC16 fragments will be required to clearly define these oligosaccharide ligands. It should be noted however, that mesothelin does not carry any of the classical carbohydrate recognition domains that are found in a majority of the mammalian lectins. Thus if mesothelin directly binds to oligosaccharide ligands it may do so via an as yet unidentified carbohydrate binding peptide epitope.</p><p>High concentrations of soluble MUC16 are present in the peritoneal fluid of EOC patients ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; Patankar, Belisle, and Gubbels, unpublished observations). Since the soluble MUC16 may inhibit mesothelin-MUC16 binding, the proposal that this interaction facilitates peritoneal metastasis of ovarian tumors seems counter-intuitive. However, having analyzed more than 30 samples of ascites derived from individual EOC patients we have observed that the concentration of CA125 in this fluid ranges from 20,000&#x02013;100,000 U/ml. Since the most highly purified MUC16 samples have a CA125 specific activity of 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>U/mg of total protein and assuming that the average molecular weight of MUC16 is 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>Da, these values of CA125 in the ascites correspond to MUC16 concentrations of 1&#x02013;10 nM. Inhibition studies indicate that MUC16 even when used at 100 nM concentration was unable to completely block the binding of meso-Fc to the OVCAR-3 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Furthermore, there is a distinct possibility that soluble MUC16 may have a lower affinity for mesothelin than the cell surface associated counterpart of this mucin. This is highlighted by our demonstration that A431-Meso<sup>+ </sup>cells bind to only minor amounts of soluble MUC16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The proteolytic processing that occurs when the MUC16 is shed from the surface of the tumor cells or subsequent digestion of the N-linked glycans by glycosidases in the peritoneal fluid may alter the soluble MUC16 and make it a less effective ligand for mesothelin. The lower affinity of mesothelin for soluble MUC16 also makes it less likely that the mucin can act as a cross-linking agent by attaching to mesothelin expressed on the mesothelial and the ovarian tumor cells.</p><p>Binding of the tumor cells to the mesothelium via the mesothelin-MUC16 interaction may provide a necessary first step for metastasis. In this respect, the binding of mesothelin to the MUC16 glycans may be akin to the initial binding of leukocytes to the inflamed endothelium that is mediated by the selectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Tumor cell attachment to the mesothelium may by itself not provide the strong adhesive force required to maintain this heterotypic adhesion. Instead, initial binding via this mechanism may lead to recruitment of strong adhesive events mediated by CD44, &#x003b2;-1 integrins, and other cell adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>binding of ovarian cancer cells to the mesothelium is only partially inhibited by anti-CD44 and anti-&#x003b2;-1 integrin antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It remains to be demonstrated if simultaneous utilization of antibodies directed against mesothelin, CD44 and &#x003b2;-1 integrins will substantially inhibit binding of ovarian tumor cells to the mesothelium.</p><p>Mesothelin, like MUC16, is overexpressed by the ovarian tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Co-expression of both these molecules may lead to further recruitment of additional tumor cells to the site of metastasis. Thus, the tumor load at the site of secondary metastasis may not only increase due to the uncontrolled expansion of the cancer cells, but also by the binding of additional tumor cells that are sloughed off from the primary or secondary tumor sites. In this context it is also important to note that ovarian cancer cells form multicellular spheroids in the peritoneal fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our experiments demonstrating significantly higher homotypic adhesions between the #12 cells as compared to the MUC16 negative #7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) supports this proposal.</p><p>A model showing the role of mesothelin-MUC16 interaction in the peritoneal metastasis and ovarian tumor aggregate is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>. Granted, other mechanisms such as CD44 interactions are also important while studying the metastasis of ovarian tumors. However, since their relationship with the mesothelin-MUC16 interactions is not understood, these mechanisms are not depicted in the proposed model.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Model for peritoneal metastasis of ovarian tumors</bold>.
