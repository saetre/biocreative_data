Previous reports showed that the ability of <italic>Xist</italic> to trigger silencing is restricted to an early window in ES cell differentiation. Here we show that this window is also important for establishing methylation patterns on the potential inactive X chromosome. By immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments we show that histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27m3) and H4 lysine 20 monomethylation (H4K20m1) are associated with <italic>Xist</italic> expression in undifferentiated ES cells and mark the initiation of X inactivation. Both marks depend on <italic>Xist</italic> RNA localisation but are independent of silencing. Induction of <italic>Xist</italic> expression after the initiation window leads to a markedly reduced ability to induce H3K27m3, whereas expression before the restrictive time point allows efficient H3K27m3 establishment. Our data show that <italic>Xist</italic> expression early in ES cell differentiation establishes a chromosomal memory, which is maintained in the absence of silencing. One consequence of this memory is the ability to introduce H3K27m3 efficiently after the restrictive time point on the chromosome that has expressed <italic>Xist</italic> early. Our results suggest that this silencing-independent chromosomal memory has important implications for the maintenance of X inactivation, where previously self-perpetuating heterochromatin structures were viewed as the principal form of memory.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In female mammals, one X chromosome is inactivated.

X inactivation is a multistep process, in which the cell counts the number of X chromosomes, chooses one to be active, and silences all others. Initiation of silencing is triggered by accumulation of the 17-kb noncoding <italic>Xist</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Borsani1">Borsani et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Brockdorff2">Brockdorff et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Brown1">Brown et al. 1991</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>Xist</italic> RNA attaches to chromatin and spreads from its site of transcription in <italic>cis</italic> over the entire inactive X chromosome (Xi), mediating transcriptional repression. <italic>Xist</italic> is essential for initiation of silencing, but not for the maintenance of transcriptional repression on the Xi at later stages of cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Penny1">Penny et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Marahrens1">Marahrens et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Csankovszki1">Csankovszki et al. 2001</xref>). Presently, the molecular nature of the silencing mechanism is not known. Previous studies have shown that X-chromosome inactivation involves the progressive recruitment of a variety of different factors and posttranslational modifications of lysine residues in the amino termini of histones (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Brockdorff1">Brockdorff 2002</xref>). The current view is that <italic>Xist</italic> expression initiates the formation of heterochromatin on the Xi, which can be perpetuated by redundant silencing mechanisms at later stages. Consistent with this view, it has been shown that the Xi in mouse embryonic fibroblasts is kept inactive in the absence of <italic>Xist</italic> by redundant mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone H4 hypoacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Csankovszki1">Csankovszki et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>The Polycomb group proteins Ezh2 and Eed localise to the Xi in embryonic and extraembryonic tissues early in mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wang1">Wang et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Mak1">Mak et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Plath1">Plath et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Silva1">Silva et al. 2003</xref>). The human EZH2/EED and its homologous E(z)/ESC complex in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> show intrinsic histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) and lysine 27 (H3-K27) methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Cao1">Cao et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Czermin1">Czermin et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Kuzmichev1">Kuzmichev et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Muller1">Muller et al. 2002</xref>). Interestingly, H3-K27 methylation is one of the earliest chromosomal modifications on the Xi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Plath1">Plath et al. 2003</xref>), and the requirement of Eed for histone methylation on the Xi has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Silva1">Silva et al. 2003</xref>). However, analysis of Eed mutant embryos suggests that Eed is not required for initiation of silencing in trophoblast cells but is required for the maintenance of the Xi at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wang1">Wang et al. 2001</xref>). Although data are consistent with the interpretation that <italic>Xist</italic> RNA recruits the Ezh2/Eed complex, thereby introducing histone H3 methylation, the significance of H3-K27 methylation for chromosomal inactivation is unclear. In flies, methylation on H3-K27 facilitates the binding of Polycomb to amino-terminal fragments of histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Cao1">Cao et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Min1">Min et al. 2003</xref>). Polycomb recruitment to the Xi has not been observed, and current models suggest that H3-K27 methylation in X-chromosome inactivation is indepen-dent of classical Polycomb silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Mak1">Mak et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Silva1">Silva et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that chromosomal silencing can be recapitulated in embryonic stem (ES) cells by expressing <italic>Xist</italic> RNA from cDNA transgenes integrated into autosomes and the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz1">Wutz and Jaenisch 2000</xref>), and this allowed for an uncoupling of <italic>Xist</italic> regulation from cellular differentiation. In this transgenic system, <italic>Xist</italic> expression is under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter, which can be induced by the addition of doxycycline to the culture medium. We showed that <italic>Xist</italic> RNA localisation and silencing can be separated by introducing specific mutations in <italic>Xist</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz2">Wutz et al. 2002</xref>). Initiation of silencing depends on the repeat A sequence at the 5&#x02032; end of <italic>Xist.</italic> Deletion of this element results in an RNA that localises to chromatin and spreads over the chromosome, but does not trigger transcriptional repression. Initial silencing in ES cells is reversible and dependent on <italic>Xist</italic> expression. At a later stage in differentiation this silent state becomes irreversible and independent of <italic>Xist,</italic> corresponding to the maintenance phase of X inactivation. We also showed that <italic>Xist</italic> expression must be induced early in ES cell differentiation to cause transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz1">Wutz and Jaenisch 2000</xref>). Therefore, establishment of silencing is restricted to an initiation window in ES cell differentiation, and induction of <italic>Xist</italic> expression at a time point later than 24 h in differentiation no longer causes silencing. We found that <italic>Xist</italic> RNA loses its potential to initiate transcriptional repression roughly 24 h earlier in differentiation than the point at which silencing becomes irreversible. Notably, this left a gap of approximately one cell cycle in length between the initiation and maintenance phases. How silencing is maintained during this period and how the silent state becomes irreversible remained previously unexplained. In this report we perform kinetic measurements and quantification of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27m3), revealing a novel chromosomal memory that is established by <italic>Xist</italic> expression at an early time point in ES cell differentiation independent of transcriptional repression. Our analysis suggests that this chromosomal memory might have an important role in the transition from the initiation phase to the maintenance phase of X inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Profiling Histone Modification States at the Initiation of X Inactivation</title><p>We have previously reported that the initial steps of chromosomal silencing in mammalian X inactivation can be recapitulated in transgenic undifferentiated male ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz1">Wutz and Jaenisch 2000</xref>). Such ES cells are useful for studying the function of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA in the initiation of chromosomal silencing and for analysing the kinetics and relevance of chromosomal modifications. We aimed to delineate a pattern of histone methylation states that define the initial decision for facultative heterochromatin. To achieve this we performed immunofluorescence staining against the various modification states on histone H3 and H4 lysine residues in clone 36 ES cells, in which <italic>Xist</italic> expression can be induced from a transgene integrated on Chromosome 11 by addition of doxycycline to the culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz1">Wutz and Jaenisch 2000</xref>). We used highly specific antisera for a defined methylation state (mono-, di-, or tri-) at a particular lysine residue in the amino terminus of histone H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Peters2">Peters et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Perez-Burgos1">Perez-Burgos et al. 2004</xref>). Some cross reactivity of the H3K27m2 antiserum with H3K27m1 and H3K27m3, of the H3K4m3 antiserum with H3K4m2, and of the H4K20m2 antiserum with H4K20m1 and H4K20m3 was detected on peptide blots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>), but does not affect the conclusions drawn in this study. Our cytological experiments show a focal signal for H3K27m3 in the interphase nuclei of clone 36 ES cells upon <italic>Xist</italic> expression, which colocalises with Chromosome 11 in metaphase spreads and <italic>Xist</italic> RNA in interphase nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In cells grown in the absence of doxycycline, a diffuse nuclear signal was observed. H3-K27 mono- and dimethylation were equally present on the inactivated chromosome and other autosomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020171-t001">Table 1</xref>). Notably, we did not observe any specific enrichment for the H3K9m1, H3K9m2, or H3K9m3 signal on Chromosome 11 upon <italic>Xist</italic> induction (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">1</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">1</xref>G, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">S2</xref>). H3K9m3 and H3K27m1 colocalised strictly with constitutive heterochromatin at pericentric regions and the Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">Figure 1</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">1</xref>H). H3K4m2 and H3K4m3 gave banded signals on chromosome arms that were reduced but not entirely erased on the transgenic chromosome, when <italic>Xist</italic> expression was induced (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">S2J</xref>). The heterochromatic Y chromosome completely lacked both H3K4m2 and H3K4m3 in the same metaphase spread. Thus, we conclude that the reduction of H3K4m2 and H3K4m2 on the <italic>Xist</italic>-expressing chromosome is consistent with a state of transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Santos-Rosa1">Santos-Rosa et al. 2002</xref>) and with earlier reports that implicate H3-K4 hypomethylation early in X inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Heard1">Heard et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-OaNeill1">O'Neill et al. 2003</xref>). H3K4m1 was equally present on the <italic>Xist</italic>-expressing chromosome and other autosomes. Using antisera specific for methylation states of H4K20, we observed that H4K20m1 decorated Chromosome 11 upon <italic>Xist</italic> induction in undifferentiated clone 36 ES cells (in 46&#x00025; of interphase nuclei; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). H4K20m2 and H4K20m3 were not enriched on the <italic>Xist</italic>-expressing chromosome (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">S2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">S2I</xref>; G. Schotta and M. Lachner, unpublished data). We also investigated the acetylation state of histone H4 in these cells using a sheep polyclonal antiserum that preferentially recognises multiply acetylated H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Morrison1">Morrison and Jeppesen 2002</xref>). Using this antiserum, we detected partial hypoacetylation of Chromosome 11 in metaphase spreads of clone 36 ES cells that were induced to express <italic>Xist</italic> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">1</xref>F, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">S2K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">S2L</xref>). This observation is different from the global chromosome-wide hypoacetylation of H4 that was reported on the Xi later in differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Keohane1">Keohane et al. 1996</xref>) and might reflect the absence of active promoters. We also detected a degree of hypoacetylation when a silencing-defective <italic>Xist</italic> RNA was expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>), making it likely to be the consequence of cross talk with H4-K20 methylation, which is mutually exclusive at least with H4-K16 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Nishioka1">Nishioka et al. 2002</xref>). In conclusion, H3K27m3, H4K20m1, reduction of H3K4m2 and H3K4m3, and reduced multiple-lysine acetylation of histone H4 correlate with the inactive state of the chromosome in undifferentiated ES cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020171-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Further confirmation of the cytological findings comes from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using antibodies specific for H3K27m3, H4K20m1, H3K4m3, H3K4m2, and H3K9m2 in both undifferentiated and differentiated clone 36 ES cells in the presence or absence of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We observed enhanced H3K27m3 and H4K20m1 in the cells expressing <italic>Xist</italic> regardless of the differentiation state on three microsatellite sequences on Chromosome 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A control microsatellite on Chromosome 15 did not show this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g002">Figure 2</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g002">2</xref>L). Upon <italic>Xist</italic> expression, we also observed H3K27m3 on the puromycin marker gene cointegrated with the <italic>Xist</italic> transgene on Chromosome 11, compared to nearly undetectable levels in the uninduced sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). This increase in H3K27m3 was paralleled by a marked decrease in H3K4m2 and H3K4m3, but no increase in H4K20m1 could be observed at this locus in undifferentiated ES cells. Upon differentiation, an increase in the H4K20m1 signal was observed when <italic>Xist</italic> was expressed on all sequences on Chromosome 11. A control tubulin gene located on Chromosome 15 showed no significant change upon <italic>Xist</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g002">2</xref>K). These data show that H3K27m3 and H4K20m1 are elevated by <italic>Xist</italic> RNA expression on the transgenic chromosome, in agreement with our cytological analysis. However, regional differences are revealed by the higher resolution of the ChIP experiment, showing that the two modifications do not display a completely overlapping distribution on the chromosome. Differentiation of the ES cells resulted in increased H4K20m1 signals dependent on <italic>Xist</italic> expression. H3K9m2 was also elevated on two loci on Chromosome 11.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>H3K27m3 and H4K20m1 Are Triggered by <italic>Xist</italic> RNA Localisation and Are Independent of Silencing</title><p>In agreement with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Plath1">Plath et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Silva1">Silva et al. 2003</xref>), our results indicate that chromosome-wide histone H3K27m3 is efficiently triggered in undifferentiated ES cells and therefore is an early mark of X inactivation. We measured the kinetics of H3K27m3 following induction of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA expression in undifferentiated clone 36 ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3A</xref>). At 6, 12, and 24 h after induction 0&#x00025;, 12&#x00025;, and 37&#x00025; of the cells, respectively, showed a signal, and by 48 h a maximum of 70&#x00025; was reached. Furthermore, the recruitment of Ezh2 protein to the transgenic Chromosome 11 upon <italic>Xist</italic> expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">1</xref>K) is consistent with the idea that the Ezh2/Eed complex contains the enzymatic activity causing H3K27m3 in X inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Mak1">Mak et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Plath1">Plath et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Silva1">Silva et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>To identify the <italic>Xist</italic> sequences that are required for the binding of the Ezh2/Eed complex and to trigger H3K27m3, we examined a panel of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). In an earlier study we inserted <italic>Xist</italic> cDNA transgenes containing defined deletions into the <italic>Hprt</italic> gene locus on the single X chromosome in male mouse T20 ES cells and measured their ability to cause silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz2">Wutz et al. 2002</xref>). We used deletions spanning the entire RNA that eliminate relatively large parts of <italic>Xist</italic> to analyse H3K27m3 by immunofluorescence in ES cells after induction of transgenic <italic>Xist</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g003">Figure 3</xref>). H3K27m3 staining was observed for all <italic>Xist</italic> mutations tested, with the exception of the &#x00394;XSa deletion, where sequences required for localisation are deleted. The resulting Xist&#x00394;XSa RNA did not localise well to chromatin and showed consequently greatly diminished potential to silence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>). We interpret the absence of detectable H3K27m3 in this case as a consequence of the failure of the RNA to localise. All other mutants analysed, including that containing a &#x00394;XN deletion spanning a similar region, gave rise to RNA that localised well to chromatin and caused H3K27m3. A mutant with a deletion of repeat A (T20:&#x00394;SX ES cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g003">Figure 3</xref>), which localises to chromatin but does not cause silencing, was able to induce H3K27m3, suggesting that methylation can be established independent of silencing, a finding consistent with the results of an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Plath1">Plath et al. 2003</xref>). The expression of the silencing-deficient <italic>Xist</italic> RNA led to a significantly lower percentage of cells with H3K27m3 foci in interphase nuclei (3- to 4-fold reduction compared to wild-type <italic>Xist</italic> RNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Moreover, on metaphase chromosomes methylation appeared mostly as a single band (only 5&#x00025; showed a wild-type pattern; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Since the transgene is integrated in the <italic>Hprt</italic> locus on the X chromosome and the endogenous <italic>Xist</italic> gene is still present in this cell line, the possibility exists that the transgenic RNA might have stabilised the endogenous <italic>Xist</italic> RNA or vice versa to effect H3K27m3. To address this point we made use of another cell line in which repeat A was deleted from the endogenous <italic>Xist</italic> gene and an inducible promoter was inserted by homologous recombination (J1:Xist&#x00394;SX-tetOP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz2">Wutz et al. 2002</xref>). Induction of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA expression caused H3K27m3 on the single X chromosome in these cells, confirming that H3K27m3 can be established by <italic>Xist</italic> expression in complete absence of repeat A sequences. However, in undifferentiated ES cells, expression of the silencing-deficient <italic>Xist</italic> RNA led consistently to lower numbers of cells (30&#x00025;&#x02013;35&#x00025;) showing H3K27m3 staining compared to the wild-type <italic>Xist</italic> RNA (80&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g003">3</xref>C). Mono- and dimethylation of H3-K27 were not visibly elevated in J1:Xist&#x00394;SX-tetOP cells at the expense of the H3K27m3 signal (data not shown), suggesting that recruitment of the Ezh2/Eed complex was impaired in the absence of repeat A, and ruling out the possibility that repeat A would change the specificity of the complex to induce trimethylation activity. Consistent with this interpretation, Ezh2 was observed in only 9&#x00025; of the J1:Xist&#x00394;SX-tetOP ES cells compared to 76&#x00025; of the clone 36 ES cells (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">1</xref>K and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">S3D</xref>). We note that the lower methylation potential of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA lacking repeat A sequences was only observed in undifferentiated ES cells. When the cells were differentiated, methylation levels were elevated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3C</xref>). We further determined the role of H4K20m1 in silencing. We detected H4K20m1 upon induction of <italic>Xist</italic> expression in 14&#x00025; of the interphase nuclei in undifferentiated J1:Xist&#x00394;SX-tetOP ES cells, showing that H4K20m1 can be established in the absence of repeat A (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3D</xref>). We conclude that H3K27m3 and H4K20m1 are independent of and not sufficient for silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Efficient H3K27m3 Is Restricted to Early Stages of Differentiation</title><p><italic>Xist</italic>-mediated transcriptional silencing is restricted in ES cell differentiation in that the potential of <italic>Xist</italic> to initiate repression diminishes 48 h after differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz1">Wutz and Jaenisch 2000</xref>). We investigated whether the ability to establish H3K27m3 would be restricted to this initiation window in clone 36 ES cells. These cells carry a puromycin resistance gene <italic>(puro),</italic> which is cointegrated with the <italic>Xist</italic> cDNA transgene on Chromosome 11 and can be silenced by transgenic <italic>Xist</italic> expression. <italic>Xist</italic> expression was induced either from the beginning or at 24, 48, 72, 96, or 120 h after the onset of differentiation. The ability of <italic>Xist</italic> to initiate silencing at various time points was monitored by measuring <italic>puro</italic> expression, and H3K27m3 was analysed in parallel in all cultures at 12 d after differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). When <italic>Xist</italic> was induced within 24 h of differentiation, H3K27m3 was observed in a large fraction of the cells. Induction of <italic>Xist</italic> after 24 h led to significantly lower methylation levels (10&#x00025;&#x02013;15&#x00025; of cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The efficiency in H3K27m3 pattern establishment correlated at all time points with the potential of <italic>Xist</italic> to initiate silencing and Ezh2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Hence, an efficient H3K27m3 pattern was established in a time window that overlapped with the window for the initiation of <italic>Xist</italic>-mediated repression. We also determined the levels of Eed and Ezh2 protein during ES cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Our analysis shows that Eed levels are significantly reduced at day 3 of differentiation and Ezh2 levels diminish more gradually towards even later time points. This demonstrates that the ability of <italic>Xist</italic> to induce efficient H3K27m3 is restricted at a time when both Eed and Ezh2 proteins are detected in similar amounts, as in undifferentiated ES cells, suggesting that the efficiency of methylation is not a function of the protein levels.</p><p>To confirm this finding, we assayed the effect of induction of <italic>Xist</italic> expression on H3K27m3 in embryonic fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were isolated from male, day 13.5 embryos carrying an insertion of the doxycycline-inducible promoter in the endogenous <italic>Xist</italic> locus (Xist-tetOP allele) and a homozygous insertion of the tetracycline-responsive transactivator in the ROSA26 locus (ROSA26-nlsrtTA allele; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz2">Wutz et al. 2002</xref>; F. Savarese, unpublished data). In these fibroblasts, expression of the endogenous <italic>Xist</italic> RNA from the single male X chromosome could be induced in 80&#x00025; of the cells by addition of doxycycline (data not shown). In uninduced cultures and control male fibroblasts no H3K27m3 foci were detected by immunofluorescence in interphase nuclei. However, upon <italic>Xist</italic> induction 5&#x00025; (after 48 h of <italic>Xist</italic> induction) or 15&#x00025; (after 72 h) of the cells showed focal H3K27m3 staining (H4K20m1 was established, as well; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3G</xref>). In control female fibroblasts H3K27m3 staining was detected in 85&#x00025; of the cells. This shows that <italic>Xist</italic> induction in embryonic fibroblasts leads to H3-K27 methylation in a low percentage of cells. We further examined histological sections of male embryos carrying the inducible Xist-tetOP allele and the ROSA26-nlsrtTA allele. <italic>Xist</italic> expression was induced by feeding doxycycline in drinking water to the mothers for 3 d starting either from day 9.5 or day 13.5 of gestation. Embryos were dissected 3 d later, on day 12.5 and 16.5, respectively. In the sections, 74&#x00025; (day 12.5 embryos) and 52&#x00025; (day 16.5 embryos) of the cells expressed <italic>Xist,</italic> as determined by RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g004">4</xref>E). Focal H3K27m3 staining was detected in 61&#x00025; of the cells in sections of the day 12.5 embryos but in only 18&#x00025; of the day 16.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g004">4</xref>E), demonstrating a clear reduction in the number of cells showing H3K27m3 staining in response to <italic>Xist</italic> expression in the later-stage embryos. In summary, our data demonstrate that <italic>Xist</italic> has been able to effect H3K27m3 in all cell types tested. However, the efficiency of methylation is regulated in cellular differentiation and development. Our experiments show that <italic>Xist</italic> is not sufficient for efficient establishment of the H3K27m3 pattern in differentiated cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Reversibility of H3K27m3</title><p>Once efficient H3K27m3 is established by <italic>Xist</italic> expression in early ES cell differentiation, it can be maintained throughout differentiation. This would be consistent with the view that lysine methylation is a permanent epigenetic mark. To test whether H3K27m3 is stably maintained in the absence of continuous <italic>Xist</italic> expression, we tested H3K27m3 reversibility in undifferentiated clone 36 ES cells. <italic>Xist</italic> expression was induced from the transgenic Chromosome 11 in these cells for 3 days, and then the cells were washed and split into medium without doxycycline to shut off <italic>Xist</italic> expression. H3K27m3 levels and <italic>Xist</italic> RNA were determined by combined immunofluorescence RNA FISH at consecutive time points at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. High levels of H3K27m3 persisted until 24 h after <italic>Xist</italic> was turned off, but H3K27m3 disappeared by 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g005">Figures 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">S3B</xref>). Our data show that the <italic>Xist</italic> RNA signal disappeared by 12 h after the withdrawal of doxycycline, demonstrating that H3-K27 methylation is reversible in undifferentiated ES cells and is removed after a period of approximately two cell divisions following the turning off of <italic>Xist</italic> expression. We also analysed the reversibility of H4K20m1 and Ezh2 in undifferentiated clone 36 ES cells. The percentage of cells showing a signal went from 46&#x00025; and 70&#x00025; initially to 5&#x00025; and 11&#x00025; at 48 h after withdrawal of doxycycline for H4K20m1 and Ezh2, respectively.</p><p>To test whether H3K27m3 would become irreversible during ES cell differentiation, we turned off <italic>Xist</italic> expression in clone 36 ES cells at progressively later time points up to 6 d after initiation of differentiation. The H3K27m3 pattern was analysed in all cultures at day 12 of differentiation. In cells continuously expressing <italic>Xist</italic> during differentiation, methylation was detected in 60&#x00025; of the cells at day 12. If <italic>Xist</italic> expression was turned off at any time points in the course of differentiation, the percentage of cells showing H3K27m3 was reduced to less than 10&#x00025;, suggesting that methylation was reversible throughout differentiation and not stabilised (data not shown). We then analysed the kinetics of loss of methylation in differentiated ES cells. Clone 36 ES cells differentiated for 4 d in the presence of doxycycline were differentiated for 24, 48, and 72 more hours in the absence of doxycycline, and H3K27m3 was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Focal H3K27m3 staining was initially observed in 97&#x00025; of interphase nuclei and was reduced to 50&#x00025; and 25&#x00025; at 3 and 4 d, respectively, after <italic>Xist</italic> had been turned off. This shows that the decay of focal H3K27m3 was slower than in undifferentiated ES cells, possibly reflecting the slower cell cycle of differentiating cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Early <italic>Xist</italic> Expression Triggers a Chromosomal Memory Independent of Silencing</title><p>Detection of focal H3K27m3 staining persisted throughout ES cell differentiation when <italic>Xist</italic> was continuously expressed. Yet the methylation mark was reversible throughout ES cell differentiation, and <italic>Xist</italic> RNA could only establish an efficient methylation pattern during the initiation window early in ES cell differentiation. These observations could indicate that silencing enhances histone methylation in ES cell differentiation. To address this interpretation, we analysed the H3K27m3 pattern caused by expression of a mutant <italic>Xist</italic> RNA lacking repeat A, which cannot initiate silencing, in differentiating J1:Xist&#x00394;SX-tetOP ES cells. When these cells were differentiated in the presence of doxycycline, focal H3K27m3 staining was observed in 78&#x00025; of the cells at day 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This clearly indicated that methylation was maintained in a high number of these cells. Silencing is therefore dispensable for methylation in ES cell differentiation. Notably, we observed H3K27m3 staining in a high percentage of differentiated ES cells but in a significantly reduced percentage of undifferentiated ES cells expressing a silencing-defective <italic>Xist</italic> RNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g003">3</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">S3C</xref>). Silencing or repeat A sequences are therefore required to sustain high H3K27m3 levels specifically in undifferentiated ES cells but are dispensable upon differentiation.</p><p>To test whether continuous <italic>Xist</italic> expression was required for maintenance of efficient H3K27m3, we induced <italic>Xist</italic> expression from the transgenic Chromosome 11 in undifferentiated clone 36 cells and from the X chromosome in J1:Xist&#x00394;SX-tetOP ES cells for 3 d. The cells were then differentiated for 5 d in the presence of doxycycline followed by 5 and 7 d, respectively, without the inducer. At the end of this period H3K27m3 was analysed and could be detected in less than 20&#x00025; and 10&#x00025; of the cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Parallel cultures were differentiated for 5 d in the presence of doxycycline followed by 4 d in the absence of doxycycline, and then doxycycline was added back for 1 or 3 more days. In these cells, in which <italic>Xist</italic> had been induced early, H3K27m3 was restored and detectable in 50&#x00025;&#x02013;55&#x00025; of all cells. This level is significantly higher than the level in control cultures that had been induced de novo at day 6 or day 9 of differentiation (10&#x00025; of all cells). In cells that had been continuously differentiated in the presence of doxycycline, methylation was detected in 73&#x00025;&#x02013;78&#x00025; of the nuclei. Our data show that efficient methylation at late time points in differentiation did not require continuous <italic>Xist</italic> expression. Efficient remethylation occurred on a chromosome that had been exposed to <italic>Xist</italic> in early ES cell differentiation, consistent with the idea that <italic>Xist</italic> triggers a chromosomal change in early differentiation that is remembered until later time points to enhance H3K27m3 reestablishment. Importantly, the silencing-deficient <italic>Xist</italic> mutant RNA in J1:Xist&#x00394;SX-tetOP ES cells gave identical results, showing that this memory is established independent of silencing.</p><p>We further determined at which time point in differentiation the chromosomal memory is established. For this, clone 36 ES cells were differentiated for 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 h in the presence of doxycycline. Then <italic>Xist</italic> was turned off until day 8 of differentiation, when doxycycline was added back, and remethylation was assayed by immunofluorescence at day 13 in differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In this experiment a transition occurred in a 24-h interval around 60 h if <italic>Xist</italic> was expressed for more than 48 h early in differentiation, allowing for efficient remethylation, a result consistent with the establishment of the memory in this interval. When <italic>Xist</italic> was turned off earlier than 60 h, remethylation was observed in only 10&#x00025;&#x02013;30&#x00025; of the cells, demonstrating that the memory was not established. Turning off <italic>Xist</italic> at 72 h or later allowed remethylation in 85&#x00025; of the cells. We also analysed the transition from <italic>Xist</italic>-dependent reversible to irreversible silencing in this experiment by Northern analysis of <italic>puro</italic> expression from the transgenic chromosome in differentiated clone 36 ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). These data show that irreversible silencing was established in an interval between 48 and 72 h in ES cell differentiation, with <italic>puro</italic> expression levels dropping from 60&#x00025; to 15&#x00025; of the level in uninduced samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), in agreement with our initial report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz1">Wutz and Jaenisch 2000</xref>). The 24-h intervals for the transition can be explained by the asynchronous cell cycle states in the ES cell culture (doubling time, 21.4 h) at the time when differentiation was induced. We conclude that the establishment of the chromosomal memory is silencing independent and occurs at the time when X inactivation becomes irreversible and <italic>Xist</italic> independent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results identify H3K27m3 and H4K20m1 as specific modifications that mark the <italic>Xist</italic>-expressing chromosome in undifferentiated ES cells and contribute to the epigenetic histone code of the Xi (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020171-t001">Table 1</xref>). We did not observe an enrichment of H3K9m2 or H3K9m3 signals on the <italic>Xist</italic>-expressing chromosome, which has been reported by other studies. This could be a shortcoming of our transgenic system, but we also did not detect the H3K9m2 or H3K9m3 signals in female mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts (less than 2&#x00025; of the cells). We attribute the different observations in other studies to the various antisera used. We supply peptide blot analysis for our antisera that suggest that the antibodies are highly specific (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). This is also supported by the specific staining patterns in immunofluorescence experiments. The lysine 9 methylation signal observed in other studies could potentially be a result of cross reactivity with H3K27m3, a fact we can exclude for our H3K9 antibodies based on the staining pattern and peptide blots. Alternatively, our antibody might not recognise the H3K9m2 modification in the context of the chromosome. However, this is unlikely since the H3K9m3 signals for the pericentric regions and the Y chromosome are clearly identified. The H3K9m2 antiserum has been successfully used in ChIP analysis of the minor centromeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Yan1">Yan et al. 2003</xref>) and reacts with these repeats in immunofluorescence, but does not show cross reactivity to H3K27m3. This suggests that our reagent is able to detect the modification in both ChIP and immunofluo-rescence experiments. Using highly specific antisera, we failed to see a strong signal for H3K9m2 in either ChIP or immunofluorescence experiments (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">S2E</xref>). In our ChIP analysis two chromosomal loci showed an increase for H3K9m2 upon <italic>Xist</italic> expression in differentiated ES cells, suggesting some enrichment for H3K9m2. We take these data to indicate that H3K9m2 is not a prominent mark of X inactivation but might be enriched locally to some degree upon differentiation.</p><p>Using <italic>Xist</italic> alleles that express a mutated version of <italic>Xist,</italic> which has a deletion of repeat A sequences and is unable to cause silencing, we showed that both H3K27m3 and H4K20m1 were established in the absence of transcriptional repression. This demonstrates that neither modification is sufficient to trigger silencing.</p><p><italic>Xist</italic> expression led to rapid H3K27m3, which was complete after 1 to 2 d of <italic>Xist</italic> expression in both ES cells and differentiated cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g006">Figure 6</xref>, columns 1 and 2). This kinetics follows the localisation of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA, which accumulates between 4 and 12 h after doxycycline addition in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz1">Wutz and Jaenisch 2000</xref>), suggesting that H3K27m3 is an immediate effect. We have further shown that in undifferentiated ES cells no progressive accumulation of the histone modifications occurs over time by comparing the percentage of cells showing H3K27m3, H4K20m1, and Ezh2 staining after 3 and 10 d expressing either full-length <italic>Xist</italic> RNA or a silencing-deficient mutant lacking repeat A (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3C</xref>). We have shown that H3K27m3 is a reversible modification throughout ES cell differentiation and depends at all stages on <italic>Xist</italic> expression. In undifferentiated ES cells H3K27m3 disappeared 48 h after <italic>Xist</italic> expression was turned off, corresponding to about two cell divisions. The kinetics would be consistent with the idea that replication is involved in the replacement of methylated histones, albeit our data do not rule out an active enzymatic process of demethylation. Importantly, we have observed nearly unchanged methylation levels 24 h after <italic>Xist</italic> expression has been turned off (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3B</xref>). This could reflect the intrinsic stability of the trimethylation mark or the persistence of the Eed/Ezh2 complex, which can stably associate with metaphase chromosomes from which <italic>Xist</italic> RNA is displaced (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g001">Figure 1</xref>C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Mak1">Mak et al. 2002</xref>). The transient maintenance of H3K27m3 might be significant for the mechanism of X inactivation. It could explain our observation that the inactive state will be &#x0201c;locked in&#x0201d; roughly 24 h after <italic>Xist</italic> loses its ability to initiate silencing, it will be locked in at 72 h of ES cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wutz1">Wutz and Jaenisch 2000</xref>).</p><p>Efficient methylation is established only when <italic>Xist</italic> expression is induced early in ES cell differentiation. The window in which <italic>Xist</italic> causes efficient methylation overlaps precisely with the initiation window, in which transcriptional silencing can be initiated. Yet methylation is independent of initiation of silencing. This would be consistent with the notion that H3K27m3 is necessary but not sufficient for silencing. However, this is unlikely, as a previous report has shown that in Eed mutant embryos, initiation of silencing is normal, but a defect in the maintenance of the inactive state leads to reactivation at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Wang1">Wang et al. 2001</xref>). Lower levels of Ezh2 and Eed could explain the restriction on the ability of <italic>Xist</italic> to induce H3K27m3 efficiently in differentiated ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020171-Silva1">Silva et al. 2003</xref>). We do not favour this interpretation, as this restriction is observed at day 2 in differentiation, when Ezh2 and Eed protein levels are still high (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Our data further show that the ability to efficiently methylate a chromosome late in ES cell differentiation is a feature of the chromosome and not a function of the protein levels of Eed and Ezh2. This is also in line with our observation that chromosome-wide H3K27m3 in clone 36 ES cells, in which Eed messenger RNA was reduced to 10&#x00025;&#x02013;15&#x00025; of wild-type levels by stable RNAi, was still detected in 45&#x00025;&#x02013;60&#x00025; of cells compared to 80&#x00025; in control clone 36 cells (data not shown). Therefore, less abundant levels of Eed are sufficient to achieve efficient methylation. <italic>Xist</italic> induction later in ES cell differentiation or in cells of embryonic origin establishes H3K27m3 in only a small percentage of cells. The significance of H3K27m3 in this small number of cells is unclear at present.</p><p>The restriction of efficient methylation to early ES cell differentiation and the finding that methylation is reversible logically require that a chromosomal memory exists that enables H3K27m3 maintenance during differentiation. Previous models have suggested that a lock-in of X inactivation is based on chromosomal silencing, arguing that self-maintaining heterochromatin structures establish the principal form of memory. Our data clearly demonstrate that H3K27m3 is maintained in the absence of transcriptional repression, suggesting a chromosomal memory independent of silencing on the Xi. Using the inducible <italic>Xist</italic> expression system we have directly demonstrated the chromosomal memory (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g006">Figure 6</xref>). A chromosome that had been exposed to <italic>Xist</italic> and been H3-K27 trimethylated early could be remethylated later in differentiation, after a period where <italic>Xist</italic> was turned off and methylation decayed, with significantly greater efficiency than a chromosome that had not expressed <italic>Xist</italic> early (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We have further determined the time point in ES cell differentiation when the chromosomal memory is established and found that it overlaps with the transition from <italic>Xist</italic>-dependent and reversible silencing to irreversible silencing. These data place the establishment of the memory in a critical phase of X inactivation. We note that the establishment of efficient H3K27m3 in the initiation window and the implementation of the memory are separated by a gap of approximately one cell division in ES cell differentiation. This parallels the gap between initiation of silencing and the maintenance of the silenced state independent of <italic>Xist.</italic> Our kinetic measurements indicate that H3K27m3 would decay from the <italic>Xist</italic>-expressing chromosome after two cell divisions; therefore, H3K27m3 could bridge the gap (critical window). We suggest that <italic>Xist</italic> expression and H3K27m3 might be the signal to recruit a chromosomal memory mediating the lock-in of X inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In this model, silencing would be specified by separate signals depending on repeat A of <italic>Xist,</italic> which we predict would interact with the memory at the transition from reversible to irreversible and <italic>Xist</italic>-independent repression. In this regard we note that silencing or repeat A sequences enhance the efficiency of H3K27m3 in undifferentiated ES cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). However, there is no requirement for repeat A when ES cells are induced to differentiate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020171-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">S3C</xref>). This could point to interactions between the silencing machinery and the Ezh2/Eed methylation complex specifically in ES cells.</p><p>The molecular basis for the chromosomal memory is presently unknown. Our data rule out the possibility that continuous <italic>Xist</italic> RNA expression or silencing is required for maintenance of the chromosomal memory and suggest that H3K27m3 is also not involved. The latter interpretation has to be treated cautiously, as it depends on the sensitivity of our assay to detect H3K27m3. Formally it is conceivable that low levels of H3K27m3 undetected by our assay could remain on the chromosome. Presently, it is also unclear what the role of H4K20m1 is and to what extent it interacts with H3K27m3.
