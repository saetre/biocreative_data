The mechanism of action of these cofactors in unknown, although the &#x003c6;Rv1 system uses small simple substrates for both integration and excision, suggesting that directionality does not involve the remodeling of higher order macromolecular architectures (L. Bibb and G. F. Hatfull, unpublished data). </p><p>Here, we report the identification and characterization of an RDF that regulates the directionality of recombination by the Bxb1 integrase. This RDF (Bxb1 gp47) is unusual in that it is relatively large (255 aa), unrelated to all other RDFs, and likely has functions outside of recombination, since close relatives are present in other mycobacteriophages that utilize tyrosine integrase systems and for which all the recombination functions are defined. Bxb1 gp47 is a required accessory protein for excisive recombination both in vitro and in vivo, and is a potent inhibitor of integrative recombination in vitro. However, it does not have DNA-binding activity, only small simple excision substrates are required, and it does not function through remodeling of higher order structures. In contrast to other RDFs, Bxb1 gp47 appears to act via direct protein interactions with gpInt, but in a conformation-dependent manner that is determined by the specific DNA substrate bound by gpInt. Inhibition of integration is facilitated by stable association of gp47 with <italic>attB</italic>&#x02013;gpInt or <italic>attP</italic>&#x02013;gpInt complexes to prevent further participation in recombination, whereas excision is strongly stimulated without stable association to <italic>attL</italic>&#x02013;gpInt or <italic>attR</italic>-gpInt complexes and presumably involves transient but productive associations. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation of a Bxb1 DNA Segment Promoting Excisive Recombination</title><p>Using bioinformatic analysis of the Bxb1 genomic sequence, we have not been able to identify candidate proteins showing sequence similarity to previously identified RDFs; this is however not surprising as excises comprise a diverse group of proteins with little sequence conservation. In order to identify and characterize the Bxb1 recombination directionality factor a positive selection assay using a strain reflecting the organization of genes in a Bxb1 lysogen with respect to <italic>attL, attR,</italic> and <italic>int</italic> was established. A portion of the Bxb1 DNA containing <italic>attP</italic> and <italic>int</italic> was cloned into an integrative plasmid containing the hygromycin resistance cassette and the sucrose sensitivity cassette <italic>(sacB),</italic> and the resultant plasmid pPGA1 was electroporated into <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. smegmatis</named-content> mc <sup>2</sup>155. As described previously &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>int</italic> expression promotes integration of plasmid DNA into the host <italic>attB</italic> site leading to the formation of <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> flanking the <italic>hyg <sup>R</sup></italic> and <italic>sacB</italic> cassettes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The resulting strain, designated as the excision tester strain, is resistant to hygromycin and sensitive to sucrose. An excisive recombination event between <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> should result in removal (and subsequent loss) of the intervening DNA containing <italic>int, hyg,</italic> and <italic>sacB;</italic> the strain thus becomes <italic>Hyg <sup>S</sup></italic> and <italic>Suc <sup>R</sup></italic> and is able to grow in the presence of sucrose. </p><p>A genomic DNA library of phage Bxb1 was constructed in a vector (pPG1) containing <italic>oriE, oriM,</italic> and the <italic>kan <sup>R</sup></italic> marker. The frequency of excision of pPGA1 in the absence of phage sequences was determined by transforming the empty vector (pPG1) into the tester strain; the frequency of <italic>suc <sup>R</sup></italic> colonies was less than 0.05&#x00025;, indicating that the integrated DNA is stably maintained ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Transformation of a Bxb1 DNA library into the tester strain yielded approximately 10 <sup>4</sup><italic>Kan <sup>R</sup></italic> transformants of which 45 were resistant to sucrose. Sequencing the junctions of plasmid DNA recovered from 14 <italic>suc <sup>R</sup></italic> colonies revealed the presence of Bxb1 DNA spanning the coordinates 34,440&#x02013;37,520 bp; the region 35,845&#x02013;36,800bp was common to all 14 clones and included the previously annotated genes <italic>46</italic> and <italic>47</italic> ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Derivatives of one clone, pPGX1, containing genes <italic>49</italic>&#x02013; <italic>45,</italic> were constructed with truncations from each end and tested for the ability to generate <italic>suc <sup>R</sup></italic> colonies ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).

Efficient excision is observed when this segment is cloned in one orientation (pPGX6b) but not in the other (pPGX6a), presumably reflecting differences in gene expression levels. </p><p>To determine if sucrose resistance derives from site-specific excisive recombination, DNA from <italic>kan <sup>R</sup> suc <sup>R</sup></italic> colonies transformed with pPGX1 and pPGX6b, as well as from colonies transformed with vector pPG1, was examined by PCR for the presence of <italic>attB, attL,</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> (excisive recombination should restore <italic>attB</italic> and lead to a loss of the <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> sites).

The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing (unpublished data). These data verify that sucrose resistance is a consequence of site-specific recombination between <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> and that excision is dependent on a fragment of Bxb1 DNA. </p><p>To determine the requirement of Bxb1 gpInt in excision, a derivative of the tester strain lacking <italic>int</italic> was created; the integrative plasmid employed here contains only <italic>attP</italic> and was inserted into the <italic>attB</italic> site of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. smegmatis</named-content> mc <sup>2</sup>155 by a transient expression of gpInt.

Presumably Bxb1 gp47 and its related proteins play a role other than in site-specific recombination; given their location between DNA polymerase and DNA primase genes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), we speculate that they may also play a role in DNA replication. Phylogenetic analysis of the Bxb1 gp47-related proteins suggests that acquisition of a role in recombination was not a recent event, since the Bxz2 member of this family is more closely related to the homologs found in the tyrosine integrase phages L5, D29, and Che12 than to other phages encoding serine integrases ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). We note that although a dual function is unusual, there are several such examples among accessory proteins for site-specific recombination, including <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> PepA, ArgR, and ArcA &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, and phages P2 and HP1 Cox proteins &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>The observation that Bxb1 gp47 is unrelated to other RDFs (including the two previously described serine integrases for phages TP901 and &#x003c6;RV1), and that it is larger than all previously characterized RDFs (28 kDa, 255 aa) raises the question as to whether gp47 provides the excision activity, or whether excision function is conferred by the products of one or more other ORFs within this region. We note for example the involvement of three small ORFs in a contiguous DNA segment of the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> conjugative transposon CTnDOT that are required for excisive recombination &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. To address this question, we have used three approaches. First, the 835-bp segment of Bxb1 DNA within plasmid pPGX6b was truncated from both ends, and all truncations are inactive in excision ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Second, pPGX6b was randomly mutagenized by passage through the mutator strain XL1Red, and excision defective mutants were selected on media containing hygromycin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>). DNA from 20 mutants was isolated and sequenced, all of which contain mutations within frame 1 encoding gp47 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g004">4</xref>C); furthermore, every base change results in an amino acid (or nonsense) substitution in frame 1 (corresponding to gene <italic>47</italic>) whereas base changes in other frames contain those that are conservative and do not generate amino acid substitutions ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Of the 20 mutations, five generate nonsense codons in gene <italic>47,</italic> ten are changes in the first codon position, and the remaining five have changes in the second position; all 15 missense mutations result in an amino acid change in gp47. </p><p>Finally, to exclude the possibility of multiple ORFs encoding excision activity, two of the five nonsense mutations ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) in the coding frame of gene <italic>47</italic> were examined by suppressor analysis. The presence of a cognate opal or amber tRNA suppressor (modified tRNAs of mycobacteriophage L5 &#x0005b;C. Peebles and G. F. Hatfull, unpublished data&#x0005d;) was able to restore excision activity of gp47W85Op and gp47Q154Am, respectively; no excision was observed by the mutant gp47 when either a wild-type tRNA or a non-cognate suppressor tRNA was used ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Taken together, these results unequivocally demonstrate that gp47 is the protein responsible for stimulating excisive recombination. </p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Overexpression of gp47 and Establishment of an In Vitro Excisive Recombination Assay</title><p>Bxb1 gene <italic>47</italic> was cloned in the pET28 expression system such as to generate a fusion protein with an N-terminal His tag. Cells transformed with the resultant plasmid (pPGgp47) were grown to A <sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.4, and transformed cells were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. The expression profile before and after induction shows the presence of an approximately 32-kDa protein in the clarified lysate of cells transformed with pPGgp47 that is absent in the lysate of cells transformed with pET28a vector alone ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). However, most of the induced protein localizes in the insoluble fraction, and only a small proportion of the protein is soluble. Because renaturation of protein recovered from the insoluble fraction was unsuccessful, gp47 was partially purified (&#x002dc;75&#x00025; homogeneity) from the soluble fraction by passage through a Ni-NTA column ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). </p><p>RDFs typically inhibit integrative recombination as well as stimulate excisive recombination in vitro (e.g., &#x003bb; &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, P2 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, &#x003c6;Rv1 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;); since the substrates and reaction requirements for excision were not yet established, we first explored the ability of Bxb1 gp47 to inhibit integrative recombination. We have previously described an in vitro integrative recombination assay in which one of the partner DNAs is part of a supercoiled plasmid and the other is a short linear DNA &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Addition of purified gpInt catalyzes formation of a linear DNA product containing <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> that can be readily separated from both substrates by agarose gel electrophoresis. Addition of Bxb1 gp47 was observed to strongly inhibit integrative recombination, whereas a similar protein preparation extracted from control cells without Bxb1 gp47 did not ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Bxb1 gp47 is thus a potent inhibitor of Bxb1 integrative recombination. </p><p>Tyrosine recombinases utilize relatively large <italic>attP</italic> substrates with multiple binding sites for integrase and accessory factors leading to the formation of complex architectures at these sites&#x02014;their cognate RDFs function by influencing the formation or disruption of these nucleoprotein architectures at specific substrates. Although Bxb1 integration requires only short DNA substrates (38 bp in <italic>attB</italic> and 48 bp in <italic>attP</italic>) and does not require accessory proteins, we initially used relatively large (&#x0003e;300 bp) segments of <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> DNA to establish an in vitro excisive recombination assay in case either auxiliary Int-binding sites or Xis-binding sites are required for excision, as in the tyrosine integrase systems. Addition of purified gpInt and gp47 to a reaction in which one DNA is on a supercoiled plasmid and the other a short linear DNA results in the formation of a linear product, the amount of which increases with increasing concentration of gp47 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, panel a). No recombinant product is obtained when gpInt and a control extract is added (panel b); recombination also does not occur when only gp47 or gpInt is present or when only one of the recombining DNAs is present in the assay ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, panel c). </p><p>In order to determine the site requirements for excision, in vitro recombination was performed using large (&#x002dc;350 bp) <italic>attL</italic> or <italic>attR</italic> DNA in supercoiled plasmids and varying sizes of linear partner DNAs. Recombination takes place efficiently in vitro even when short (50 bp) partner DNA is used ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>D); the efficiency of the reaction remains unchanged even when <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> are both less than 60 bp ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>) demonstrating that like integration, excisive recombination uses short substrate DNA sequences (&#x02264;50 bp) and there is no requirement for accessory Int-binding sites in <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> for excisive recombination. DNase I footprinting confirms that gpInt protects a region of approximately 50 bp surrounding the cleavage site in both <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Since these substrates are too small to include additional Xis-binding sites, Bxb1 gp47 presumably either binds DNA within the core Int-binding region, or alternatively may not interact directly with DNA at all and influences the direction of the reaction solely through protein&#x02013;protein interactions with gpInt. </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>DNA-Binding Properties of gp47</title><p>The ability of gp47 to bind <italic>attP, attB, attL,</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> DNA was examined using native gel electrophoresis ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Although an approximately 50-bp segment of all four DNAs is sufficient for integration and excision &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; we initially used larger substrates (&#x002dc;350 bp) to study gp47 binding. Interestingly, gp47 does not show any detectable binding to any of the four <italic>att</italic> DNAs at any protein concentration using native gel electrophoresis ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g006">6</xref>B), and we have been unable to detect the binding of gp47 to <italic>att</italic> DNA using filter-binding assays (unpublished data). Thus, in contrast to all other characterized RDFs, Bxb1 gp47 does not have the ability to bind DNA. </p><p>Since Bxb1 gp47 does not bind DNA directly, we examined whether it is able to alter Int&#x02013;DNA complexes, presumably via protein&#x02013;protein interactions ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We have shown previously that Bxb1 gpInt forms a single well-defined protein&#x02013;DNA complex (Complex I) with each of the four <italic>att</italic> DNAs &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, when gp47 is included in binding reactions with either <italic>attP</italic> or <italic>attB,</italic> an additional slower migrating complex (Complex II) is observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). The presence of gp47 in Complex II was confirmed by the ability of &#x003b1;-His antibodies (recognizing the N-terminal hexahistidine tag of gp47) to supershift Complex II formed with <italic>attP</italic> or <italic>attB</italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). Association of gp47 with Int&#x02013; <italic>att</italic> complexes could conceivably be mediated by either protein&#x02013;protein interactions or by Int-dependent binding of gp47 to DNA, but the observation that Complex II forms with a smaller <italic>attB</italic> substrate (60 bp)&#x02014;most of which is involved in interactions with gpInt ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>)&#x02014;argues against the latter possibility. We therefore favor the idea that gp47 interacts with gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attP</italic> and gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attB</italic> complexes through protein&#x02013;protein interactions with gpInt, although interactions between gp47 and the DNA cannot be entirely ruled out (and we note that the 8 bp at the centers of all four sites are identical). Thus, in contrast to the architectural roles of Xis in the tyrosine integrase systems, gp47 presumably acts to inhibit integrative recombination by either stearically blocking synapsis of gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attP</italic> and gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attB</italic> complexes, or by changing the conformation of these complexes so that they either no longer synapse or synapse but cannot undergo strand exchange. </p><p>Curiously, supershifted complexes are not formed when gpInt and gp47 are added to approximately 350-bp <italic>attL</italic> or <italic>attR</italic> DNA substrates ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>B), although they are weakly formed with high concentrations of gp47 with shorter (60 bp) DNA substrates ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>). To address the trivial explanation that the reaction conditions are simply not permissible for excision (or Complex II formation), we performed similar reactions containing both <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> DNAs (unpublished data) and showed that recombination does indeed occur. Thus, under recombination-permissive conditions, gp47 associates only weakly or unstably with gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attL</italic> and gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attR</italic> complexes, in sharp contrast to its more stable association with <italic>attP</italic> and <italic>attB</italic> complexes. The nature of the gp47&#x02013;gpInt interaction is thus dependent on the specific DNA site to which gpInt is bound. </p><p>Interestingly, addition of &#x003b1;-His antiserum to reactions containing gpInt, gp47, and either <italic>attL</italic> or <italic>attR</italic> DNA generates a supershifted complex ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>D) consistent with the formation of weak or unstable complexes that can be stabilized by antibody binding. To exclude the possibility that a tertiary stable complex does form with <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR,</italic> but migrates with the same mobility as Complex I ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>), we have performed binding experiments with an MBP-gp47 fusion protein (unpublished data). Although this fusion protein does not support excision, it forms Complex II with both <italic>attP</italic> and <italic>attB</italic> DNAs that migrate considerable slower than with native gp47. Nevertheless, no Complex II is seen with MBP-gp47 and either <italic>attL</italic> or <italic>attR</italic> DNA (unpublished data). Finally, the order of addition of gp47 and the anti-His antibodies makes a significant difference to the amount of the supershifted complex ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>D) with <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR,</italic> in a manner that is not seen with <italic>attP</italic> or <italic>attB</italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). We conclude from these experiments that Bxb1 gp47 binds weakly to gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attL/R</italic> complexes and that the bound forms are unstable during gel electrophoresis. </p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>A Model for the Role of Bxb1 gp47 in the Control of Recombination Directionality</title><p>Bxb1 gp47 is an unusual RDF and modulates the directionality of integrase-mediated site-specific recombination by a mechanism that is quite distinct from that used by the tyrosine integrase systems. The data presented here show that gp47 does not act through direct DNA interactions, but by changing the ability of gpInt&#x02013;DNA complexes to participate further in the reaction pathway. The mechanism for the inhibition of integrative recombination may be relatively simple, involving the association of gp47 with gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attP</italic> and Int&#x02013; <italic>attB</italic> complexes&#x02014;via protein&#x02013;protein interactions&#x02014;and preventing them from productively associating. However, it is noteworthy that these proposed gp47&#x02013;gpInt interactions are qualitatively different, depending on the DNA substrate to which gpInt is bound. This is consistent with a model we have proposed previously &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d; suggesting that the conformations of gpInt&#x02013;DNA complexes are different depending on the specific DNA substrate that is bound, and that the compatibility of the various possible conformations plays a role in the selection of sites for productive synapsis. It is, however, interesting that gp47 associates with both <italic>attP</italic>- and <italic>attB</italic>-bound complexes since these two substrates are quite distinct in both their sequence and in their length requirements and likely adopt different conformations &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>How does Bxb1 gp47 promote excisive recombination without stably associating with gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attL/R</italic> complexes? There are three main possibilities. First, gp47 could enzymatically modify gpInt in a manner that confers the ability to perform excisive recombination. However, this explanation seems unlikely since titration experiments show that gp47 acts stoichiometrically and not enzymatically ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, unpublished data). Second, gp47 could act by shifting the dynamic equilibrium between a series of reversible reactions that usually favor integration. Thus, by binding to gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attB</italic> and &#x02013; <italic>attP</italic> complexes and preventing them from participating further in these reactions, <italic>attP</italic> and <italic>attB</italic> would eventually accumulate as products. Third, gp47 could associate with gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attL</italic> and gpInt&#x02013; <italic>attR</italic> complexes&#x02014;albeit with lower affinity and perhaps unstably, and stimulate either synapsis of <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> or the initiation of strand exchange. To distinguish between these latter two models, we have utilized a suicide <italic>attL</italic> substrate (similar to those described for the lambda system &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;) that promotes the accumulation of synaptic complexes containing cleaved substrates covalently joined to gpInt ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">7</xref>F). Formation of these complexes is strongly dependent on the presence of gp47 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>E), eliminating the simple equilibrium model and strongly supporting a role for gp47 generating productive synaptic complexes. </p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>We have demonstrated here that mycobacteriophage Bxb1 utilizes a novel RDF to regulate the directionality of recombination by its serine integrase. It is relatively large, does not bind to DNA, does not act by the remodeling of macromolecular architectures, and associates with Bxb1 gpInt in a DNA-dependent manner. Although it is not known what other functions gp47 might possess, its presence in other phages that use different integration systems, and its gene location within other replication functions, suggest that it may also act in DNA replication. While some recombination accessory proteins&#x02014;including the RDFs of phages P2 and HP1 (Cox)&#x02014;have dual functions &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040186-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, all of these act through DNA binding, so that although the biological roles may be quite distinct, the mechanisms are based on common DNA-binding specificities.

The positions of the tertiary complexes of gp47, gpInt, and DNA as well as the antibody supershifted complexes are indicated.</p><p>(E and F) Bxb1 gp47 is required for trapping a synaptic complex in excision. A suicide substrate version of <italic>attL</italic> DNA (5&#x02032; radiolabeled at both ends) was used that has a nick on the top strand positioned four bases to the 5&#x02032; side of the scissile bond. Bxb1 gpInt (72 nM) binds normally to this substrate to form Complex I (cmplx I), but when <italic>attR</italic> partner DNA (200 bp) and gp47 (3.56 &#x003bc;M) is added, no recombinant products are released. Instead, a prominent slow-moving complex is observed that absolutely requires Bxb1 gp47 for its formation. We have identified this as a synaptic complex using 2D-PAGE (F). In brief, a vertical gel slice was removed from the last lane in panel E, incubated with proteinase K and SDS, and then electrophoresed through a second dimension. Approximately 50&#x00025; of the radiolabeled DNAs in this complex correspond to <italic>attP</italic> recombinant product and 50&#x00025; correspond to a cleaved half-site. The bottom of the gel slice containing unbound <italic>attL</italic> DNA was removed prior to the second dimension of electrophoresis. Further details on the characterization of these suicide substrates will be described in future publications. </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040186.g007"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="n2" fn-type="other"><p>Citation: Ghosh P, Wasil LR, Hatfull GF (2006) Control of phage Bxb1 excision by a novel recombination directionality factor.
