In adult skin, growth potential is focused into a minor subpopulation of stem and progenitor cells, some located in hair follicles and others in sebaceous glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These have been shown to be particularly important to wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and also to the regenerative cycle of the hair follicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The growth potential of interfollicular keratinocytes resides in the progenitor population within the basal layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These cells are distributed into developmental fields, which divide laterally to become rapidly expanding transit amplifying cells, and differentiate after detachment from the basal lamina, migrating up into the stratified suprabasal layers of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Recently, some of the soluble factors that control progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation have been identified. Ectopic activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, in particular, has been shown to promote progenitor dysfunction in skin, as it does for other lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, transgenic mice engineered to have gain of function of Wnt signaling in basal keratinocytes, showed <italic>de novo </italic>hair follicle morphogenesis, follicular hyperplasia and tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway (mediated by &#x003b2;-catenin) is indeed highly oncogenic for a number of mammalian lineages, and there is gathering evidence that the underlying mechanism is the misregulation of stem cell compartments. While the role of Wnt signaling in follicular keratinocytes has been well established, its function in interfollicular keratinocyte regulation is unknown.</p><p>Wnt ligand expression (Wnt 4, 5a, 10b and 11) has been observed in interfollicular skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] (and MS and BLA-H, unpublished), together with a number of the other components of the Wnt signaling pathway, implying that this pathway may be involved in normal morphogenesis. Here, we tested the effect of mis-expression of the canonical Wnt ligand, Wnt1, on development of an organotypic culture model of interfollicular skin.</p><p>Our interfollicular organotypic culture model is based on a cell line that arose spontaneously from human foreskin keratinocytes (<underline>N</underline>ormal <underline>I</underline>mmortalized <underline>K</underline>eratinocytes; NIKs). These cells replicate all aspects of differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and are used therapeutically for grafting to human patients. They differentiate normally in culture as well, and resemble the pattern typical of primary keratinocyte cultures. NIKs are non-tumorigenic and have a stable, near-diploid karyotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. They grow in monolayer culture as undifferentiated, highly proliferative cells, but when transferred to organotypic culture on collagen gels containing human fibroblasts, they stratify, closely resembling their epidermal counterpart <italic>in vivo</italic>. Every molecular marker so far tested shows normal expression.</p><p>Our results were surprising. Unlike the proliferative response of follicular stem cells to ectopic Wnt signaling in vivo, interfollicular progenitor cells were induced to exit from the proliferative compartment and undergo terminal differentiation, suggesting that the response to Wnt signaling is highly dependent upon the keratinocyte cell context.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cultured human keratinocytes transduced with Wnt1 show reduced proliferation and an increase in cell size</title><p>Monolayer cultures of NIKS keratinocytes were transduced with either a <italic>Wnt1</italic>-IRES-<italic>lacZ </italic>retrovirus or a control virus, IRES-<italic>lacZ</italic>. Approximately 85% of NIKS cells were infected (determined by &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining). Both <italic>Wnt1</italic>-IRES-<italic>LacZ </italic>and IRES-<italic>LacZ </italic>transduced NIKS cell lines were expanded for eight passages. Prior to each experiment, the percentage of <italic>lacZ</italic>-expressing cells was re-assessed and found to be approximately constant. We measured the effect of Wnt1 expression on the proliferative capacity of keratinocyte monolayers, and found that it was reduced by 50% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In monolayer culture, keratinocytes undergo an attenuated differentiation program, generating a heterogeneous culture population that contains small, actively dividing cells, together with a proportion of large, terminally differentiated cells. In cultures of keratinocytes transduced with <italic>Wnt1</italic>-IRES-<italic>LacZ</italic>, there were many more large cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We quantified the area of transduced cells, and observed that there was a 20 fold increase in very large cells (&#x0003e;1000 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Wnt1 expression slows growth and increases cell size in monolayer cultures of NIKs cells</italic></bold>. The growth of NIKs cells transduced either with a control retrovirus (lacZ) or a Wnt1 expression vector (Wnt1-IRES-lacZ) was compared (A: total cell counts). When cultures were stained for lacZ expression (B), the number of large and very large cells expressing Wnt1 was greatly increased (C). Canonical Wnt signaling was measured as fold induction of a consensus TCF-&#x003b2;catenin reporter (TOP-FLASH) with respect to FOP-FLASH (a scrambled consensus reporter, all normalized for transfection efficiency as previously described). The TOP/FOP ratio was increased in NIKs cells by 2&#x000d7; when cells were incubated with soluble (crude) Wnt3A for 22 hours, and reduced if the cells were transfected with the canonical Wnt inhibitor, dkk1, prior to Wnt3A incubation (D). Cell strains stably transduced with retroviral constructs (LZ, lacZ control; W, Wnt1-lacZ test vector) were transfected with either FOP-FLASH or TOP-FLASH reporters (E). The Wnt1-expressing culture showed a significant increase in Wnt-dependent transactivation (n = 3), though less than the na&#x000ef;ve cultures treated with soluble Wnt3A (probably because of negative feedback).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-7-9-1"/></fig><p>Specific induction of TCF-&#x003b2;catenin-dependent transactivation in response to ectopic Wnt signaling was measured using the canonical TOP-FLASH reporter. (The fold induction of reporter expression is expressed as a ratio with respect to the control scrambled reporter, FOP-FLASH). To evaluate the induction of TOP-FLASH expression in NIKs cells, cultures were treated with soluble Wnt3A (a canonical Wnt ligand that shares all the properties of insoluble Wnt1 characterized so far; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). These cultures showed a 2&#x000d7; increase in Wnt reporter expression. This was reduced by co-expression of the canonical Wnt pathway inhibitor, dkk1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Transactivation of TOP-FLASH was increased in cell strains constitutively expressing Wnt-1 from the viral expression vector (W) compared to control virus (LZ) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p><p>Thus Wnt1 expression results in decreased cell proliferation and increased cell size, and suggests that Wnt signaling affects the balance between proliferation and differentiation. To test this proposal more rigorously, we transferred the cells to organotypic culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Interfollicular epidermis generated from Wnt1-IRES-LacZ keratinocyte populations shows precocious thickening of the stratum corneum and depletion of nucleated cells from the basal layer</title><p>Wnt1-IRES-<italic>LacZ </italic>and control IRES-<italic>LacZ </italic>NIKs cells were seeded at equal cell density onto dermal equivalents. NIKs cultures proliferate to form a continuous sheet of cells, and at confluence, cells begin to stratify as they undergo differentiation.

The arrows indicate the pattern of growth typical of these cultures, relying on progenitor cells to feed the basal transit amplifying population that differentiate upwards into the stratified layers.

We added Dkk1 to keratinocyte cultures in order to test whether the canonical Wnt pathway was responsible for the observed growth inhibition and precocious differentiation.

It is known that gain- or loss-of function of this pathway has profound effects on growth and differentiation for stem and progenitor cells in hair follicles and sebaceous glands in transgenic mice. Thus, in [K14-&#x00394;N&#x003b2; catenin] transgenic mice (expressing a non-degradable &#x003b2;-catenin Wnt signaling effector in basal keratinocytes) there was an increase in folliculogenesis, and ectopic proliferation of cells in stem cell compartments, leading eventually to tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Expression of &#x00394;N-Lef1 induced cysts and sebaceous tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Subtle manipulations in vivo have revealed that Wnt signaling reduces the threshold for activation of follicular stem cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These authors propose that the stem cell niche has a powerful inhibitory function, maintaining stem cell quiescence, and Wnt signaling overcomes this signal to initiate tissue growth.</p><p>Epidermal stem cells (though usually separate pools) are able to differentiate along any of the epidermal lineages (follicular, sebocyte and interfollicular), given the correct microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Misregulation of one stem cell compartment tends to generate complex phenotypes in the other lineages. Since there is no unambiguous way to dissociate the activity of the follicular and interfollicular compartments in transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], we have used an organotypic culture model of interfollicular skin to isolate the effects of Wnt signaling upon the interfollicular keratinocytes.</p><p>We have shown that the ectopic expression of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway shifts the balance of division and differentiation for interfollicular progenitor cells away from cell division towards precocious differentiation. If our culture model were accurate, we would predict that inhibition of Wnt signaling in basal cells of transgenic mice should increase growth and reduce differentiation. Indeed, hyperproliferation of interfollicular skin was observed in mice expressing the dominant negative transactivation inhibitor, &#x00394;N-Lef1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Similarly, transgenic mice expressing Tcf3 (described as a transactivation repressor) showed decreased expression of filaggrin and loricrin within the interfollicular epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We propose therefore that this culture model can be used to accurately model of interfollicular development.</p><p>The outcomes of Wnt signaling are known to be highly context-dependent. Here we show that although Wnt signaling has previously been shown to promote proliferation of follicular stem cells, it induces the differentiation of interfollicular progenitors. Wnt signaling is a classic morphogenic pathway known to regulate cell fate choices and differentiation during developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], for example those associated with imaginal disc formation. Thus, in ommatidial development, Wnt signaling is used early during specification, and later to promote differentiation and apoptosis of peripheral retinal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Within mammalian lineages, Wnt signaling has been shown to be key to opposite cellular growth/differentiation choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Wnt signaling promotes hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, and is used again later in the lineage to promote T cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Similarly, Wnt signaling promotes intestinal crypt stem cell division and accumulation, and later in the lineage induces maturation of Paneth cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Gain of function of Wnt signaling in neural crest cells generates sensory neurons at the expense of all other lineages, re-specifying cell fate and promoting differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Organotypic keratinocyte culture establishes a balance between basal cell renewal and differentiation resulting in the continued accumulation of fully differentiated squames in the stratum corneum over time. Upon transplantation of fully stratified organotypic cultures to athymic mice, the balance between basal cell renewal and differentiation becomes further normalized, supporting long term renewal of the interfollicular epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These early studies coupled with our findings suggest that basal progenitor compartment is maintained in organotypic keratinocyte cultures. Applying the paradigm derived from other differentiating lineages, we suggest that ectopic Wnt signaling accelerates the exit of cells from the basal progenitor compartment, rapidly reducing stem cell activity. We conclude that this organotypic culture model could be used to screen for molecular candidates that regulate the interfollicular stem/progenitors cell niche, a niche that maintains the renewal potential of skin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Culture of human keratinocytes</title><p>The spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line NIKS was grown either in monolayer culture on 3T3-fibroblasts, or in organotypic culture in keratinocyte growth media on a simulated dermal raft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] with the following modification: The dermal component was provided by Stratatech Corp.

Sections were blocked with 10% goat serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS, and incubated in primary antibodies for 30&#x02013;60 minutes at room temperature, washed, incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or biotinylated Universal antibody, VectaStain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, used as recommended). The immunohistochemical stain for Ki67 was developed using the Vectastain Elite ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescent stains were counterstained with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml Hoechst 33258, and immunohistochemical stains with Harris Hematoxylin for 50 sec. To assess the average area of individual cells in monolayer culture, NIH Image software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] was used to assess images captured using an inverted microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>NIKS: Near-diploid Immortal Keratinocytes</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MS complete this work as part of her PhD thesis; B.L.A-H co-mentored MS and provided resources; BL developed the materials and methods associated with testing gain and loss of function for Wnt signaling in epithelial cells, and advised MS on experimental design; CMA was co-mentor for MS, advising on strategy and interpretation, and wrote and submitted the manuscript.
