Rat kidneys were perfused in situ with solutions containing NHS-biotin, a cell-impermeant biotin derivative that attaches covalently to free amino groups on lysines. Membranes were solubilized and labeled proteins were isolated using neutravidin beads, and surface &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;ENaC subunits were assayed by immunoblot. Surface &#x003b1;ENaC was assessed by membrane fractionation. Most of the &#x003b3;ENaC at the surface was smaller in molecular mass than the full-length subunit, consistent with cleavage of this subunit in the extracellular moiety close to the first transmembrane domains. Insensitivity of the channels to trypsin, measured in principal cells of the cortical collecting duct by whole-cell patch-clamp recording, corroborated this finding. ENaC subunits could be detected at the surface under all physiological conditions. However increasing the levels of aldosterone in the animals by feeding a low-Na diet or infusing them directly with hormone via osmotic minipumps for 1 wk before surface labeling increased the expression of the subunits at the surface by two- to fivefold. Salt repletion of Na-deprived animals for 5 h decreased surface expression. Changes in the surface density of ENaC subunits contribute significantly to the regulation of Na transport in renal cells by mineralocorticoid hormone, but do not fully account for increased channel activity.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CCD, cortical collecting duct; ENaC, epithelial Na channel; NCC, Na-Cl cotransporter.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The epithelial Na channel (ENaC) mediates Na reabsorption in distal portions of the nephron including the connecting tubule and collecting duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garty and Palmer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kellenberger and Schild, 2002</xref>). These channels, and by extension distal nephron Na transport, are strongly regulated by the adrenal mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone, and this regulation is crucial for maintenance of Na balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Verrey et al., 2000</xref>). Genetic deletion or loss-of-function mutations in the channels leads to Na wasting and hypotension, while conversely, hyperactivity of the channels causes Na retention and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lifton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rossier et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance of this regulatory system, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not completely understood. Although aldosterone-dependent Na transport depends on changes in transcription and translation of specific genes and proteins, increased synthesis of channel subunits themselves account for at most a minor component of the overall response of the mammalian kidney to the hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asher et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masilamani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ergonul et al., 2006</xref>). Another possibility involves alterations in channel protein trafficking leading to increased surface expression of the subunits. Consistent with this idea, immunocytochemical studies showed redistribution of &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;ENaC protein from a diffuse intracellular to a more apical pattern in response to aldosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masilamani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loffing et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hager et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, one aldosterone-induced protein, SGK1, is thought to increase apical expression of ENaC by inhibition of ubiquitinylation and retrieval of protein from the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Debonneville et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Snyder et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Canessa and colleagues used biotinylation of membrane surface proteins to show that aldosterone increased the amount of ENaC protein in the apical membrane of the amphibian renal cell line A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez de la Rosa et al., 2002</xref>). This was apparently due to increased rates of channel delivery to the surface and correlated with parallel increases in subunit synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">May et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez de la Rosa et al., 2002</xref>) Similar measurements have not been made in mammalian renal cells, where at least in vivo the extent of regulation of the channels can be much greater while the role of channel biosynthesis is less important. We sought to fill this gap by adapting the biotinylation approach to the intact rat kidney. Here we show that aldosterone increases surface expression of ENaC subunits but that this may not account for the entire response to the hormone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal handling procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill-Cornell Medical College. Sprague-Dawley rats of either gender (Charles River Laboratories) were raised free of viral infections. Rats used for biotinylation experiments weighed 250&#x02013;300 g. Those used for electrophysiological experiments were smaller (150&#x02013;200 g). Animals were fed sodium-deficient rat diet (MP Biomedicals) or a modified diet that matches the low-Na diet but that contains 1% NaCl for 6&#x02013;8 d. Some animals were fed the 1% NaCl diet and implanted subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps (model 2002, Alza Corp.) for 6&#x02013;7 d to increase levels of circulating aldosterone. Aldosterone was dissolved in polyethyleneglycol 300 at 2 mg/ml to give a calculated infusion rate of 1 &#x003bc;g/h.</p></sec><sec><title>Biotinylation Procedure</title><p>For biotinylation of kidney cells rats were anesthetized with inactin (100 mg/Kg, i.p.) (Sigma-Aldrich) and the abdominal cavity was opened. The superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk were ligated. The aorta was cannulated below the renal arteries and later ligated above the celiac trunk. The left renal vein was punctured to allow fluid outflow. The kidneys were perfused by gravity at a rate of &#x0223c;10 ml/min with ice-cold solution. At this point the animal was killed by opening the chest and sectioning the cardiac apex. The rat was placed on an ice block and the kidneys were superfused with a steady stream of ice-cold PBS. Temperatures measured in the abdominal cavity were 7&#x02013;9&#x000b0;C. In some experiments urine was collected from the left ureter via a catheter. In other cases flow rates through the urethra were observed and were &#x0223c;0.2&#x02013;0.5 ml/min.</p><p>The kidneys were perfused for 10&#x02013;15 min with PBS containing heparin to clear the renal circulation of blood, then for 20&#x02013;25 min with biotinylation solution, and finally for 30 min with biotin-quenching solution to stop its reaction with the tissue. The biotinylation solution was PBS with 4.5 mM KCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-2-[biotinamido]ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-biotin, Pierce Chemical Co.). The quenching solution was PBS in which 25 mM TRIS-HCL, pH 8.0, replaced 25 mM NaCl.</p><p>The left kidney was removed on ice for further processing. In some cases the right kidney was also processed. The whole kidney was minced with a razor blade and homogenized with a tight-fitting Dounce in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors leupeptin (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) and PMSF (0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 <italic>g</italic> to separate intact cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 18,000 <italic>g</italic> for 6 h to sediment a total membrane fraction. This pellet was suspended in 2.5 ml lysis buffer, aliquoted, and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Aliquots of this fraction containing 3 mg protein were solubilized in 0.5 ml buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 3% Triton-X100. This concentration of detergent solubilized all the detectable ENaC protein in the samples. This was added to 0.8 ml of a 50% suspension of neutravidin beads (Pierce Chemical Co.) and kept overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with gentle rocking. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1% Triton X-100), twice with high-salt wash buffer (500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% triton X-100), and twice with no-salt wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The supernatant was decanted and protein bound to the beads was eluted in 60 &#x003bc;l 4&#x000d7; Laemmli sample buffer plus 25 &#x003bc;l of 0.5 M DTT for 15 min at 90&#x000b0;C. 10&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;l of the eluate was loaded onto polyacrylamide gels for separation by SDS-PAGE.</p><p>For biotinylation of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, 20&#x02013;30 oocytes injected with cRNA for &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3;ENaC were incubated in 10 ml biotinylation solution as described above, diluted with one part H<sub>2</sub>O to two parts solution, with or without biotin for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The oocytes were washed with biotinylation quenching solution also diluted with one part H<sub>2</sub>0 to two parts solution for 30 min. The oocytes were then suspended in 10 &#x003bc;l/ooctye of lysis buffer (as above for kidneys) with 1% Triton-X100, broken by trituration with a Pasteur pipette and homogenized in a small Dounce. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and the biotinylated proteins in the supernatnant were isolated with neutravidin beads as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Polyclonal antibodies against the &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; subunits of the rat ENaC were based on short peptide sequences in the amino terminus of &#x003b1;ENaC and the carboxy termini of &#x003b2;ENaC and &#x003b3;ENaC as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masilamani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ergonul et al., 2006</xref>).

Equal amounts of protein (40&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;g/sample) were solubilized at 70&#x000b0;C for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer and were resolved on 4&#x02013;12% bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically from unstained gels to PVDF membranes. After blocking with BSA, membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with primary antibodies against &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, or &#x003b3;ENaC subunits at 1:500 or 1:1,000 dilutions. Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was used as a secondary antibody. The sites of antibody&#x02013;antigen reaction were visualized with a chemiluminescence substrate (Western Breeze, Invitrogen) before exposure to x-ray film (Biomax ML, Kodak). Band densities were quantitated using a Quantity One densitometer and acquisition system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.).</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>For whole-cell clamp measurements, tubules were superfused with solutions prewarmed to 37&#x000b0;C containing (in mM) 135 Na methanesulfonate, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 glucose, 5 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH.

Our strategy was to label proteins in the apical membranes of the kidney epithelial cells using glomerular filtration to deliver biotin derivatives into the tubular lumen. For our purposes it was crucial to maintain cells at low temperature during exposure to biotin in order to prevent membrane protein trafficking. Preliminary experiments were therefore designed to see if the kidneys would maintain glomerular filtration while maintained at temperatures of &#x0003c;10&#x000b0;C. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, urine flow through one kidney could be maintained above 200 &#x003bc;l/min. This is comparable to the normal GFR of rat kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frindt et al., 2001</xref>) and is consistent with robust filtration and lack of significant fluid absorption under these conditions. It was also important to be able to alter the composition of the tubule fluid fairly quickly. We assessed this in the same preliminary experiments by adding and removing creatinine from the perfusate. This compound is freely filtered at the glomerulus and easily measured in the urine. As can be seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, nearly complete wash-in or washout of creatinine to or from the collected urine required &#x0223c;10 min of perfusion.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Urine flow and creatinine concentration in a kidney perfused at 5&#x000b0;C. Urine was collected from the left ureter. The perfusate initially contained 10 mg/dl creatinine, and the urine had a similar concentration. The perfusate was switched to a creatinine-free solution at <italic>t</italic> &#x0003d; 2 min and back to creatinine-containing solution at <italic>t</italic> &#x0003d; 32 min.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jgp1310617f01"></graphic></fig><p>To test whether the biotin compound actually reached the distal part of the nephron where the Na channels are located, we also measured the biotin content of the urine during perfusion with biotin label. With a starting concentration of 500 &#x003bc;g/ml in the perfusate, we found an average of 340 &#x003bc;g/ml in the collected urine. Although there is some retention of label by the blood vessels and tubules, a significant fraction of the starting concentration reaches the distal nephron and beyond. Thus we concluded that it was feasible to label distal nephron membrane proteins with this approach.</p><p>We used sulpho-NHS-SS-biotin to label these proteins. The compound has a molecular mass of 600 D, permitting free filtration at the glomerulus. The probe is assumed to be membrane impermeant due to the presence of the negatively charged sulphonate moiety. To confirm this we tested for biotinylation of intracellular membrane proteins, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The top panel illustrates staining of total kidney membranes as well as eluates from the neutravidin beads, which represents biotinylated protein, with an antibody directed against golgin (GM130), a membrane protein expressed in the cis-Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marra et al., 2001</xref>). A clear signal was observed in total membranes but not in the eluates. As a second negative control we assayed for calnexin, a membrane protein expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. The bottom panel of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows a blot with strong staining of total membranes. There was a much weaker signal seen in the eluates, and this signal was comparable in the eluates from kidneys perfused with or without biotin. This therefore represents a small nonspecific binding of the protein to the neutravidin beads, rather than biotinylation of the intracellular protein.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Absence of biotin labeling of intracellular membrane proteins. Kidneys were perfused with or without biotin. Lanes were loaded with 15 &#x003bc;g of total membrane protein or 20 &#x003bc;l of eluate from the neutravidin beads. Duplicate adjacent lanes represent separate material from each of two animals for each condition. The upper blot was stained with anti-golgin; the full length protein corresponds to the doublet of high apparent molecular mass. No staining of the eluates could be detected either with or without biotin. The lower blot was stained with anti-calnexin, which gave a very strong signal with the total membrane pool. Similar staining was observed with the eluates from kidneys perfused with or without biotin, indicating the absence of biotinylation of this protein. In these and subsequent blots, numbers to the right correspond to the positions of molecular mass standards in kD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jgp1310617f02"></graphic></fig><p>As positive controls for the technique, we assayed the eluates for three Na transport proteins expressed in the luminal membrane of different parts of the nephron. These transporters, although subject to regulation, are thought to be present in the membrane and active under most if not all conditions. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> illustrates detection of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) that is expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gamba, 2005</xref>). In total membrane proteins the anti-NCC antibody recognizes two proteins with apparent molecular masses of &#x0223c;130 and 260 kD. The bottom band is consistent with the monomeric form of the protein, while the top band presumably represents dimers. Previous studies have documented the existence of such dimers that persist under denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Jong et al., 2003</xref>). We did not see either band in blots of kidney medulla, consistent with the presumed distribution of the protein in cortical nephron segments (unpublished data). In the eluate, the putative dimer was the major form of the protein in the eluate while very little of the monomeric form was observed. No protein was detected in eluates from nonbiotinylated kidneys.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Biotinylation of plasma membrane proteins. Kidneys were perfused with or without biotin. Lanes were loaded with 45 &#x003bc;g of total membrane protein or 25 &#x003bc;l of eluate from the neutravidin beads. Top: Na/Cl cotransporter (NCC). In total membranes, the antibody reacted with proteins of apparent molecular masses of &#x0223c;130 and &#x0223c;260 kD, presumably reflecting monomeric and dimeric forms of the transporter. The material in the biotinylated eluate was mostly at the higher molecular mass. No staining was observed in the nonbiotinylated eluate. Middle: Na/K/2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2). Three bands were observed, with the major ones at &#x0223c;140 and &#x0223c;280 kD, again presumably reflecting monomeric and dimeric forms of the transporter. The sharper band at &#x0223c;110 kD may represent the nonglycosylated form of the protein. The eluate of the biotinylated kidneys contained primarily the 280-kD form. No staining could be detected in the eluate from the nonbiotinylated kidneys. Bottom: Na/H exchanger (NHE3). The total membrane fraction contained a predominant band at &#x0223c;80 kD. The eluate from the biotinylated kidneys also contained this presumably full-length form of the protein, and also had a species at &#x0223c;160 kD that may represent a dimer. No staining could be detected in the eluate from the nonbiotinylated kidneys. (Panel has been rearranged so that the lanes correspond to those of the top two panels.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jgp1310617f03"></graphic></fig><p>We also investigated the bumetanide-sensitive Na/K/2Cl cotransporter NKCC2, which is expressed on the luminal membrane of the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gamba, 2005</xref>). In total membranes again both a monomeric and a larger, possibly dimeric, form of the protein were present (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Previous studies provided evidence for dimerization of the related transporter NKCC1, although in this case the dimers were dissociated in the presence of SDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore-Hoon and Turner, 2000</xref>). Higher order multimers of NKCC2 were also detected in rat urine but not in the kidney itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKee et al., 2000</xref>). As with the NCC, the higher molecular mass species was the major form in the eluate, and the recovery was specific for the biotinylated kidneys.</p><p>Finally, we measured the labeling of the Na/H exchanger NHE3, which is present in the luminal membranes of the proximal tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Orlowski and Grinstein, 1997</xref>). In total kidney membrane fractions the antibody recognized a predominant band of 75 kD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). This protein, whose size is consistent with that of a monomeric transporter, was also detected in the eluates of biotinylated but not of nonbiotinylated kidneys. An additional band of approximately twice the size of the major one was also observed in this fraction. It could also represent a dimer of the exchanger protein but we know of no precedent for this. In conclusion, we were able to biotinylate three transport proteins known to be constitutively active in the luminal membranes of different nephron segments. The biotinylated fractions were qualitatively distinct from the total membrane pool in having a greatly enriched presence of the putative dimeric forms of the transporters.</p><p>We examined the expression of &#x003b1;ENaC in total kidney membranes from rats maintained on a low-Na diet and in biotin/neutravidin eluates as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ergonul et al., 2006</xref>), the anti-&#x003b1;ENaC antibody recognizes three bands. The one with the highest apparent molecular mass (85 kD) corresponds to the full-length form of the subunit. The small fragment that migrates at around 30 kD is thought to reflect proteolysis of the subunit in the N-terminal portion of extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ergonul et al., 2006</xref>). The origin of the intermediate band at &#x0223c;65 kD is not known. Only the small fragment shows up in the eluate, and it is present in roughly equal amounts in the biotinylated and nonbiotinylated tissue. This therefore mainly represents nonspecific interactions between the peptide and the neutravidin-coated beads. However, we believe that the absence of the full-length subunit from the eluate is significant. Biotinylation experiments with <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing ENaC indicate that the probe can interact with the 85-kD peptide, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>. Similar results have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2007</xref>). Our interpretation is that the absence of this band from the eluate of kidney tissue reflects the absence of the full-length form of the subunit in the apical membrane. If the subunit exists mainly in a cleaved form, then only the 30-kD fragment would be detectable with our antibody directed against the N terminus of the protein. We cannot rule out surface expression of full-length subunit that is undetected due to limited sensitivity of the method.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Biotinylation of &#x003b1;ENaC in kidneys and oocytes.

Bottom: The major peptide in ENaC-expressing oocytes is the full-length 90-kD form. Faint staining of material at this molecular mass was observed in the eluate of biotinylated but not of nonbiotinylated oocytes, showing that the protein can react with the biotin reagent. Similar results were obtained with three independent batches of oocytes. The 30-kD peptide could not be resolved due to nonspecific staining of an unidentified protein (not depicted).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jgp1310617f04"></graphic></fig><p>The surface expression of &#x003b2;ENaC from the same rats is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.

The same pattern is present in the eluate, although the amount of protein present is considerably less. The signal was weaker in the eluate, even though 40 &#x003bc;g of total membrane protein was loaded per lane, while the eluate contained material from &#x0223c;750 &#x003bc;g of total membranes. This indicates that a small fraction of the total protein was recovered from the neutravidin beads. This could indicate that most of the &#x003b2;ENaC is intracellular and inaccessible to the biotin probe. However we do not know the efficiency of biotinylation of the plasma membrane proteins, which can be significantly less than 100% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gottardi et al., 1995</xref>).

Our results suggest that both &#x003b1; and &#x003b3;ENaC are present mainly in cleaved forms in the apical membranes of the kidneys of Na-depleted rats. This predicts that native channels should not be strongly activated by trypsin. This prediction is tested as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. Panel A shows that addition of the enzyme at a concentration of 3 &#x003bc;g/ml to <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing all three ENaC subunits increased amiloride-sensitive current (I<sub>Na</sub>) by &#x0223c;2.5-fold within 2 min.

Although we cannot rule out a small activation by the protease (see below), most of the channels in the membrane on these tubules appears to be in a trypsin-insensitive form, consistent with the idea that they have previously been cleaved by endogenous proteases.

Studies of surface expression of epithelial cell membrane proteins have mainly used cultured cell lines in which access to either apical or basolateral cell membranes can be well controlled. In one case, freshly isolated renal tubules were used to measure the surface expression of the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ortiz, 2006</xref>). We show here the feasibility of using the entire kidney for such assays. There are no prohibitive technical barriers in this application, which offers several advantages. First, the approach uses native tissue and therefore avoids alterations that may occur in cells that have been grown in culture. Second, the tissue is intact and not subjected to mechanical and/or chemical stresses involved in isolation of cells or nephron fragments. Third, a large amount of tissue is biotinylated. A single kidney from a rat can be used for a large number of assays. Fourth, the entire nephron is biotinylated, permitting the examination of the responses of a number of different segments or transport systems to the same physiological stimulus.</p><p>There are also disadvantages and limitations to this approach. For one, a large volume of solution, typically &#x0223c;200 ml per experiment, is required to perfuse the kidney with the biotinylating reagents. The cost of these reagents can be an issue. In addition we are limited by the availability of antibodies against native proteins. For example, an antibody directed against the C terminus of &#x003b1;ENaC might have enabled us to study this subunit using the biotinylation approach. Finally, we could not label apical and basolateral membranes selectively.</p><p>Thus far we have used the technique only to study slow changes in kidney function that take place over hours or days. It is not yet clear if it can be applied to more rapid effects. Since such responses also tend to be rapidly reversible it would be necessary to cool the tissue and begin perfusion quickly to obtain a snapshot of the state of the surface expression of membrane proteins. Finally, we have until now only applied the approach to the rat. Adaptation to the mouse should in principle be possible but the surgical techniques would need to be miniaturized and would be more difficult.</p><p>Our results are generally similar to those of a previous investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez de la Rosa et al., 2002</xref>). That study reported approximately three- to fivefold increases in the surface expression of ENaC subunits in A6 cells from amphibian kidney after 6 h of aldosterone treatment. There are significant differences, however, between the two systems. In A6 cells the three ENaC subunits also increase in overall abundance by three- to fivefold, reflecting similar increases in their rates of translation and smaller, slower changes in rates of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">May et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez de la Rosa et al., 2002</xref>). In the rat kidney, only &#x003b1;ENaC protein increases in abundance in response to both Na depletion and aldosterone treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masilamani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ergonul et al., 2006</xref>), and these increases are modest. Thus the increases in surface expression are at least to some extent dissociated from increased protein synthesis.</p><p>Our results are in qualitative agreement with immunocytochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masilamani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loffing et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hager et al., 2001</xref>). In those studies, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;ENaC protein was observed to migrate from a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution to a more apical pattern after elevation of plasma aldosterone. The antibody staining pattern was observed at the light microscopic level and it was not possible to discriminate between protein actually in the apical membrane from that which was near the membrane.</p><p>The first major conclusion from this work is that &#x003b3;ENaC and probably also &#x003b1;ENaC subunits are present in the apical membrane mainly in proteolytically cleaved forms, particularly under conditions of high aldosterone. This was shown directly for &#x003b3;ENaC and inferred for &#x003b1;ENaC on the basis of the absence of the full-length form of the subunit. Previous work showed that the overall amounts of the cleaved forms correlated with the physiological activity of the channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masilamani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frindt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ergonul et al., 2006</xref>). The cleaved form of &#x003b3;ENaC appeared at the expense of the full-length form, while that of &#x003b1;ENaC increased in parallel with that of the full-length form. In heterologous expression systems, these subunits were shown to be cleaved by proteases that are plasma membrane&#x02013;anchored proteases such as CAP1-3 (prostasin), secreted, for instance neutraphil elastase, or Golgi associated including furin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vallet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vuagniaux et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore there is strong evidence in these systems that cleavage activates the channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caldwell et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2007</xref>). Our results do not reveal the subcellular site of cleavage in vivo or the enzyme responsible but they do suggest that the channels are mostly cleaved either before they reach the plasma membrane or soon after. However there is evidence for the presence of some full-length &#x003b3;ENaC at the surface under Na-replete conditions that disappears during Na depletion (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>).</p><p>The issue of aldosterone-dependent increases in the number of channels at the surface as opposed to hormone activation of surface-expressed channels has been long debated. Early work based on selective modification of surface proteins suggested that aldosterone could affect channels preexisting in the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palmer and Edelman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garty and Edelman, 1983</xref>). Hormone-dependent increases in channel open probability in A6 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kemendy et al., 1992</xref>) were consistent with this idea, although comparable changes were not observed in renal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">P&#x000e1;cha et al., 1993</xref>). More recent work has suggested aldosterone-dependent alteration in membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Debonneville et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Snyder et al., 2002</xref>). According to this idea, the aldosterone-induced protein SGK1 inhibits channel ubiquitylation and retrieval by suppressing its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2.</p><p>Our results suggest that trafficking of ENaC to the cell surface accounts for some but not all of the effects of aldosterone. Channel activity, measured as amiloride-sensitive current, is extremely low in the CCD of Na-replete animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">P&#x000e1;cha et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frindt et al., 2001</xref>). We estimated that these currents are &#x0003c;10 pA/cell at an electrical driving force of &#x02212;100 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frindt et al., 2001</xref>) compared with very large currents in tubules from Na-depleted or aldosterone-treated rats that can reach as high as 500 pA/cell in the CCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frindt et al., 2001</xref>) and 1,500 pA/cell in the CNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frindt and Palmer, 2004</xref>). In contrast, we find measurable expression of ENaC protein at the surface under all conditions, even when currents are undetectably small (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figs. 9</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figs.10</xref>, and <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figs.12</xref>). Put another way, Na depletion or aldosterone treatment produced two- to fivefold increases in surface expression but &#x0003e;50-fold increases in channel activity. This is consistent with activation of channels in the membrane.</p><p>This activation could in part result from increased cleavage of the &#x003b3;ENaC subunit, as noted above. Indeed, the largest increases in surface expression, up to ninefold, were measured for the 65-kD form of &#x003b3;ENaC (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>). Even this change, however, was smaller than that of the overall channel activity. This suggests that other activating pathways may also help to regulate this transport pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200809989_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200809989_1.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_131_6_jgp.200809989__JGP_200809989_FS1.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_131_6_jgp.200809989__JGP_200809989_FS1-01.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200809989_2.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_131_6_jgp.200809989__JGP_200809989_FS2.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_131_6_jgp.200809989__JGP_200809989_FS2-01.jpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Winnie Leung and Qusai Saleh for their help with Western blots and cell fractionation procedures, and David Finkelstein for performing the experiments with trypsin-stimulation of oocytes.</p><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant DK59659.</p><p>Haim Garty served as editor.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><citation citation-type="journal">Alvarez de la Rosa, D., H.
