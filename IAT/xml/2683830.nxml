Vsx2 is a repressor whose targets include transcription factors such as Vsx1, which is expressed in the progenitors of distinct non-Vsx2 bipolars, and the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Ath5, which restricts the fate of progenitors to retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells and photoreceptors fates.

These progenitors with restricted competence proliferate to a limited extent and then differentiate into six classes of neurons and one type of glia in a fairly conserved histogenetic order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Transcription factors, particularly of the Homeobox and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) families then regulate the generation of specific cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Factors that influence the multipotent state of retinal progenitors should be expressed in all early retinal progenitors. One such factor is the well-known transcription factor Pax6, which is critical for early eye formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The conditional inactivation of this gene later in development restricts the competence of retinal progenitors such that they differentiate only as amacrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], suggesting that <italic>Pax6 </italic>is part of a repertoire of genes that enables the multipotent retinal progenitor state. Another transcription factor expressed in all early progenitors is the homeodomain containing repressor Vsx2 (also called Chx10). Vsx2 is expressed early in all progenitors but later becomes restricted to bipolar neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the mouse, homozygous-null mutations in <italic>vsx2 </italic>cause microphthalmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but in these small eyes bipolar cell fate is severely impaired. The effects of Vsx2 on proliferation and bipolar cell fate are separable, as cell number, but not bipolar cell fate, can be rescued by knocking out the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The role of Vsx2 in bipolar cell fate is thought to be due to the fact that it represses genes involved in other fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], a concept consistent with the following three findings. First, postnatal knock down of Vsx2 leads to an increase of rods at the expense of bipolar cells, while misexpression causes the reverse phenotype: more bipolars, less rods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Second, when Vsx2 is converted to an activator, bipolar cell fate is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], suggesting that its repressive activity is required for bipolar cell fate. Third, Dorval <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] used yeast one hybrid, gel shift, and ChIP assays to show that Vsx2 interacts directly with the rhodopsin and other photoreceptor specific genes, including those encoding PCE-1 (rod arrestin/S-antigen) and the (red/green) cone opsin.</p><p>More recently, Vsx2 has also been shown to repress <italic>vsx1</italic>, which curiously belongs to the same paired-like class of homeobox genes and is also involved in bipolar cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Vsx2 binds to the <italic>vsx1 </italic>promoter and can repress the activity of a luciferase reporter under the control of this promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Zebrafish Vsx2 shares 99% homology in the homeodomain and 100% in the CVC domain with mouse/human Vsx2 (Chx10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], regions described to be essential for its DNA binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In zebrafish, Vsx2 is strongly expressed in proliferating cells throughout the retinal neuroepithelium and is upregulated at later stages (62 hours post-fertilization (hpf)) in the outer part of the inner nuclear layer (INL), where bipolar cells are normally localized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with antisense oligonucleotides to <italic>vsx2 </italic>RNA showed a concentration-dependent reduction in the size of the eyes, resembling mouse and human microphthalmia in <italic>vsx2 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, as in mouse, Vsx2 is likely to be involved in proliferation. We were interested in whether Vsx2 also has a role in the determination of bipolar cell fate in zebrafish.</p><p>We use transgenic zebrafish, where fluorescent proteins, expressed under the control of <italic>vsx2 </italic>regulatory regions, allow us to follow the fate of Vsx2-expressing progenitors <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that Vsx2 is present in all early RPCs, but turns off in most cells as retinogenesis proceeds, remaining on only in cells that become M&#x000fc;ller glia or a specific subtype of bipolar cells. The daughter cells that lose Vsx2 expression give rise to lineages for other retinal cell types. For example, we demonstrate that Vsx2 represses <italic>ath5</italic>, which, like Vsx1, is expressed only in cells that turn off Vsx2. This enables the Ath5 lineage, which includes retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), amacrine cells, horizontal cells and photoreceptors to proceed. Combined with previous findings and other data in this paper, we suggest that early Vsx2-positive cells are the multipotent RPCs of the retina. This multipotent state becomes more restricted as Vsx2 is selectively repressed, permitting the generation of a variety of lineage restricted RPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Vsx2:GFP is expressed first in all RPCs and then later in bipolar and M&#x000fc;ller cells in the developing zebrafish retina</title><p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo </italic>role of Vsx2 in the zebrafish retina, we used Tg(<italic>vsx2:GFP</italic>) and Tg(<italic>vsx2:dsRed</italic>) transgenic zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These transgenic lines have most of the regulatory regions of <italic>vsx2 </italic>driving the expression of cytoplasmic versions of these fluorescent proteins. To ensure that the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was faithfully reporting the activity of the endogenous <italic>vsx2 </italic>promoter, we compared the distribution and dynamics of the GFP monitored by fluorescence to the <italic>vsx2 </italic>RNA using <italic>in situ </italic>hybridisation in the developing retinas of Tg(<italic>vsx2:GFP</italic>) embryos. Consistent with a previous study, both <italic>vsx2 </italic>RNA andGFP are first detected in the optic primordium around 15/16 hpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. At 24 hpf, a time when the retina consists of a neuroepithelium, <italic>vsx2 </italic>expression spreads throughout the retina, consistent with its expression in most if not all RPCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, C</xref>). As retinal development progresses, some cells upregulate the expression of Vsx2:GFP, whilst others lose <italic>vsx2 </italic>RNA expression and GFP leading to a punctuate appearance of isolated labelled nuclei (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Vsx2 expression in the zebrafish retina</bold>. <bold>(A-G) </bold>Cryosections through the central retina of zebrafish embryos counterstained with DAPI (blue).

These cells can be identified as bipolars, as they have the morphology of bipolar cells with processes ending in the two plexiform layers. The vast majority of these remain negative for protein kinase C (PKC)&#x003b2;1, a marker for a subpopulation of bipolar cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), demonstrating that Vsx2:GFP cells do not account for all bipolar cells, although a few do express PKC by 120 hpf (data not shown). Cells with lower levels of GFP expression are also seen in the more middle region of the INL. These cells have longer processes reaching apically into the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and basally to the end of the ganglion cell layer (GCL), and they all express both Sox2 and glutamine synthetase, markers of M&#x000fc;ller glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore, Vsx2 is also maintained (albeit at lower levels) in M&#x000fc;ller cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F", G"</xref>, asterisks). Both the GFP and <italic>vsx2 </italic>RNA are also present in the ciliary margin at 72 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, D</xref>). In conclusion, similarly to the RNA, GFP expressed in the Tg(<italic>vsx2:GFP</italic>) line is present in all RPCs from around 16 hpf to around 28 hpf and later on becomes restricted to bipolar and M&#x000fc;ller cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Vsx1 and Vsx2 are expressed in distinct subsets of bipolar cells</title><p>Vsx1 is another homeobox protein of the paired-like class, and is also expressed in bipolar cells and is crucial for their differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We therefore examined Tg(<italic>vsx1:GFP</italic>) retinas, which express GFP under the control of <italic>vsx1 </italic>regulatory regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As with the Vsx2 transgenics, we found that the spatio-temporal expression pattern of GFP driven by the <italic>vsx1 </italic>regulatory sequences mirrors the expression of <italic>vsx1 </italic>RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;D</xref>). Vsx1:GFP is expressed in progenitors of the optic primordia, coming on slightly later though not as extensively as Vsx2, before being restricted to the INL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E&#x02013;I</xref>). Unlike Vsx2, however, no co-expression of Sox2 and Vsx1:GFP was observed in the differentiated retina, suggesting that M&#x000fc;ller cells do not express Vsx1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3L</xref>). Also unlike Vsx2, Vsx1 is expressed occasionally in amacrine cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H, I</xref>), some of which are positive for calretinin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K</xref>). Thus, Vsx1 and Vsx2 are expressed in distinct subpopulations of non-bipolar cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Vsx1 expression in the zebrafish retina</bold>.

To test if any bipolar cells expressed both Vsx1 and Vsx2, we crossed Tg(<italic>vsx2:dsRed</italic>) with Tg(<italic>vsx1:GFP</italic>) fish to create double transgenic embryos. At 96 hpf, zebrafish retinas of double trangenic GFP (Vsx1) or DsRed (Vsx2) cells were separated into distinct populations, as revealed by the lack of co-labelling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;C</xref>).

These two techniques gave similar results. Our morphological classification of the GFP expressing cells shows that Vsx1 is expressed in a vast variety of bipolar subtypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Based on soma position, axon terminal morphology and stratification, 17 different types of bipolar cells have been characterized in the zebrafish retina using DiOlistic techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. All of the described bipolar subtype cells were encountered in our sample of 514 Vsx1:GFP-positive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F, G</xref>). However, the frequency of two subtypes with axon terminals in the outer inner plexiform layer (IPL) and one with axon terminals in the inner IPL was found to be significantly lower (binomial test, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.005) than the frequency reported by Connaughton <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], suggesting that Vsx1 may not be expressed evenly in all bipolar subtypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). The same analysis on Vsx2:GFP bipolars showed that Vsx2-positive axon terminals are located in the inner half, which is also referred to as the ON sublamina of the IPL. Therefore, in contrast to Vsx1, Vsx2 is expressed in only one or two bipolar cell subtypes. Indeed, axon terminals were exclusively found between stratum 4 or 5 (based on six equal subdivisions of the IPL depth). Based on the regular spacing and consistent laminar stratification of Vsx2 terminals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E, H</xref>), we believe that these cells make up a single type, probably the S4 bipolar type, as it was one that occurred at a significantly lower frequency in our Vsx1 sample (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). Thus, Vsx2 bipolar cells are largely or entirely distinct from the Vsx1-positive ones. These results showing mutual exclusion in bipolar cells supports recent findings that Vsx2 acts as a repressor of <italic>vsx1 </italic>transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Vsx1 bipolar cells arise from progenitors that turn off Vsx2</title><p>To investigate how these two bipolar populations are generated, we made time-lapse movies on transgenic embryos. Vsx2-positive bipolar cells were seen to arise from Vsx2-positive progenitors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). After the last division of such a progenitor, Vsx2:GFP expression increases dramatically as the bipolar cells move to their final position in the INL and begin to differentiate. In double transgenic embryos, Tg(<italic>vsx2:dsRed</italic>;<italic>vsx1:GFP</italic>), red 'Vsx2-positive' bipolar cells generally arise from progenitors that are 'Vsx1-negative', that is, not green (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Vsx1 expressing bipolar cells, however, initially arise from progenitors that express Vsx2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, as soon as Vsx1 expression begins in these progenitors, Vsx2 expression decreases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).

Cells from such injected embryos were then transplanted into unlabelled wild-type embryos and imaged every 8 minutes for 40 hours from 30 hpf onwards. In these movies, individual Vsx2:GFP RPCs can be followed. Initially, all the transplanted cells expressed Vsx2:GFP and H2B:RFP. Some of these progenitors are then seen to diminish their GFP while keeping RFP as they go through cell division near the apical surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The resulting RFP descendents are also progenitors in that they undergo typical interkinetic nuclear migration and divide apically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The daughters of these RFP progenitors then become restricted to particular positions in the retina (red outlines in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Some of these come to reside in the GCL (presumably becoming ganglion cells), some take up residence in the INL, including the inner part of the INL (possibly amacrine cells), and some come to lie with photoreceptors in the ONL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). As the RFP is a nuclear marker, it did not allow us to determine cell type by morphology, but the fact that these nuclei are no longer going through interkinetic migration or dividing leads us to believe that these cells are differentiating into the various cell types other than Vsx2-positive bipolars or M&#x000fc;ller cells.

Ath5-positive progenitors generally divide once and one daughter of this division then becomes a ganglion cell, while the other daughter remains more apical, often becoming a photoreceptor. In Tg(<italic>ath5:GFP</italic>) embryos, one can see that half of the GFP-positive cells in the retina at 96 hpf are RGCs while the other half are a mixture of amacrine cells, horizontal cells and photoreceptors (both rods and cones) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], suggesting that Ath5 progenitors give rise to all these cell types. Ath5-positive bipolars and M&#x000fc;ller cells were rarely if ever seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], suggesting that these cell types arise from different lineages, which we now know to be the Vsx1 and Vsx2 lineages.</p><p>If Ath5 progenitors arise from Vsx2 progenitors, then we should expect to see Vsx2 downregulation coordinated with Ath5 upregulation in Tg(<italic>vsx2:GFP;ath5:GAP-RFP</italic>) double transgenics.

Taking into account the small degree of inaccuracy when subdividing the IPL (which may result in occasional misclassification of bipolar cells), and considering the even spacing and high frequency of the Vsx2 expressing bipolar cells, we must consider the possibility that Vsx2 is expressed in an entire population of the S4 bipolar cell subtype, which does not express Vsx1. S4 bipolar cells are one of 8 ON-type bipolar cell types. They have a single terminal bouton stratifying in the inner IPL. Their dendritic tree is of distal comb or flat morphology, suggestive of rod or mixed photoreceptor input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In other species, Vsx1 and Vsx2 are also expressed in mutually exclusive populations of bipolar cells. In the mouse, Vsx1 is expressed by different types of ON and OFF cone bipolar cells, whereas Vsx2 is expressed in other types of cone and rod bipolar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Consistently, Vsx1 mutations lead to a reduction in bipolar-specific immunohistochemical markers and to defects in OFF-bipolar (mice) or ON-bipolar (human) driven visual responses, with normal rod bipolar driven scotopic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>In our time-lapse movies of the development of Tg(<italic>vsx1:GFP; vsx2:dsRed</italic>), we see that Vsx1:GFP is turned on in a subset of cells that downregulate Vsx2:DsRed. This switch occurs early enough in the lineage that Vsx1:GFP cells remain dividing, consistent with the relatively late birthdates of bipolar cells. The Ath5 sublineage, which also derives from cells that turn off Vsx2, gives rise to RGCs and other cells that have earlier birthdates. This suggests a model of RPC fate restriction, in which progenitors become restricted in competence before their final cell divisions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">15</xref>). In this model, Vsx2-positive RPCs are fully multipotent RPCs that throw off distinct sublineages at different stages of development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">15</xref>). Some of these lineages, though arising earlier in development, have more proliferative potential than some other lineages that arise later. Indeed, Vsx1 expression comes on earlier in development than Ath5 expression, even though the birthdates of bipolar cells tend to be later than the birthdates of RGCs. Note that this model is somewhat different from the more standard model of retinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] in which there is progressive fate restriction in the fates of a single population of RPCs (although Vsx2-negative lineage-restricted progenitors still have to go through a temporal sequence of neurogenesis). The two models are essentially different because one suggests that all progenitors are the same and that they progressively change over time, whereas the other suggests that selected progenitors (that is, Vsx2-negative ones) become lineage-restricted at early stages. This new model of fate restriction through derepression may help explain why there are general trends rather than a strictly conserved order of histogenesis in the vertebrate retina. This model may also explain why cell cycle inhibition does not result in a greatly imbalanced cell fate distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]: if, for example, a Vsx1-positive bipolar lineage is specified early, then these cells might come out of the cell cycle early when the cell cycle is experimentally inhibited, but still become bipolars. Future time-lapse experiments may resolve such issues, but this will require triple or even quadruple colour transgenics where daughter cells of such progenitors, expressing markers of particular sublineages from the same parent Vsx2-positive cell, can be individually followed. It will also be important to understand why different Vsx2-negative progenitors turn on distinct lineage-specific transcription factors.</p><fig position="float" id="F15"><label>Figure 15</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed model for Vsx2 as a cell fate time regulator</bold>. We propose that Vsx2 expressed in progenitors represses genes required for differentiation of multiple lineages, including Vsx1- and Ath5-expressing cells, and possibly also represses itself. Only when Vsx2 is turned off can cells proceed to initially form progenitors that express Vsx1 and later Ath5 (arrows). These cells will continue differentiation in the previously described conserved histogenic order. We show a possible repression of Ath5, the first gene known to be directly involved in neural cell fate during retina development. Our data also support the idea of a repression of horizontal and amacrine fate genes, possibly through Foxn4 (dashed arrow).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-8104-4-14-15"/></fig><p>We tracked Vsx2 expression by following fluorescent proteins (that is, GFP or dsRed) under the control of the Vsx2 promoter, and we therefore expected that the perdurance of the GFP would obscure the downregulation of Vsx2 mRNA. However, we found an excellent match between Vsx2 mRNA and Vsx2:GFP expression. We were surprised that sudden holes appeared in what was once rather uniform GFP labelling when Ath5 or Vsx1 turned on, as though GFP itself was suddenly being degraded. The same happens for Vsx2:dsRed. We have no explanation for this, but such findings might indicate that with a state change, such as occurs when a multipotent progenitor becomes lineage restricted, many nonessential proteins may be targeted for degradation or elimination. What causes the sudden downregulation of Vsx2 mRNA or loss of Vsx2:GFP is not known, but such state changes will certainly be an interesting topic for future investigations.</p><p>Pax6 has also been implicated as a multipotency factor for retinal progenitors as, like Vsx2, it is initially expressed in all early progenitors and only later becomes restricted to certain cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Pax6 is essential for optic cup formation and so to investigate its role in RPC multipotency it was necessary to knock it out conditionally at late embryonic stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Results for such conditional knock-out mice revealed that without Pax6 all progenitors give rise to only a certain class of retinal cell, namely amacrine cells. How the absence of Pax6 reduces the competence of RPCs in this way or the mechanism by which Pax6 helps maintain the multipotent state is not clear, although from these results, a case can be made for a positive role for Pax6 in promoting multipotency. The fact that Vsx2 acts as a repressor for <italic>vsx1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], <italic>mitf </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and photoreceptor-specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] led us to think that Vsx2 may repress a variety of transcription factors that affect fate restriction or competence states of retinal progenitors. We therefore expected to find that Vsx2 downregulation would be correlated with the expression of other lineage factors. To test this hypothesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we crossed Tg(<italic>vsx2:GFP</italic>) with Tg(<italic>ath5:RFP</italic>) as Ath5 is expressed in a population of progenitors that divide once to generate RGCs and other cell types, including amacrine cells, horizontal cells and photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our results show that Ath5 is expressed only in RPCs that profoundly downregulate Vsx2. <italic>In vitro </italic>assays show that Vsx2 binds to the <italic>ath5 </italic>promoter region, suggesting that Vsx2 directly represses <italic>ath5</italic>. Consistent with this, we found that Ath5 expression is upregulated in Vsx2 morphants. Interestingly, we also found that Foxn4 expression is upregulated in Vsx2 morphants. Foxn4 is a winged helix/forkhead transcription factor expressed in proliferative progenitors that specifically give rise to amacrine and horizontal cells in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Foxn4 may thus also be a direct target of Vsx2 repression as suggested in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">15</xref>.</p><p>Zebrafish Vsx2 morphants have microphthalmia. This is consistent with the ocular retardation phenotype described previously in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We did not study retinal proliferation in this paper, but key studies by other groups have shown that the effect of Vsx2 on cell proliferation is separable from its effect on cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. When looked at in the context of the lineages studied here, Vsx2's effect on proliferation may be illuminating, for as committed progenitors downregulate Vsx2, they also downregulate cell cycle inhibitors, though probably indirectly. Thus, at the same time as they become restricted to particular lineages, progenitors lose proliferative potential. Cells in which Vsx2 stays on, however, retain proliferative potential, suggesting that Vsx2 cells may be more stem cell-like. M&#x000fc;ller cells are the only cells that seem to maintain <italic>vsx2 </italic>expression at the level it is expressed in multipotent RPCs. Our results may thus explain why M&#x000fc;ller cells can re-enter the cell cycle and produce various missing cell types in the damaged fish retina as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>All cells types, including PKC&#x003b2;1-positive cells and Vsx1 bipolar cells, are present in the retinas of Vsx2 morphants, although Vsx2:GFP (or Vsx2:Dsred) bipolars are reduced in number. In mice, there is a profound loss of bipolar cells in <italic>ocular retardation </italic>(<italic>vsx2</italic>) mutants. A possible explanation for this difference is that more bipolar cells in mice express Vsx2 than in fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Another, perhaps more likely possibility is that the morpholino gives an incomplete knock down of the Vsx2 protein, so the morphant phenotype is less severe than a mutant null phenotype. The importance of this result, however, may have more to do with the fact that Vsx2 is unnecessary for the differentiation of all other cell types, which fits with its proposed major role as an inhibitor of the specification of the progenitors of these cell types. In the absence of Vsx2, lineage determinants are derepressed, and so all cells, except perhaps those few bipolar cells that need to upregulate Vsx2, can continue to develop. lt would therefore be interesting to rescue cell proliferation in Vsx2 morphant fish, perhaps by knocking out p27 as in mice, and then ask whether the Vsx2:GFP bipolars that develop are of the S4 or S5 subtype.</p><p>If Vsx2 downregulation is required for the generation of committed progenitors, then it might be expected that misexpression of Vsx2 would interfere with the formation of all cell types except for bipolar cells and M&#x000fc;ller cells. But testing such a prediction was complicated by the fact that Vsx2 is a potent repressor of its own transcription. Moreover, Vsx2 misexpression at early stages interfered with optic vesicle formation. In short-term explants of E17 mouse retina, virally induced misexpression of Vsx2 led to the overproduction of M&#x000fc;ller cells and bipolar cells with a concomitant decrease in the number of photoreceptors and amacrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Livne-Bar <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] transfected retinal cells in live mice at P0, examined their retinas at maturity and also showed an increase in bipolars, but this time more at the expense of rod cells. In both cases, the misexpression began during the period when most ganglion cells, amacrine cells, horizontal cells and cones have already been generated. In our zebrafish experiments, early RNA driven misexpression of Vsx2 in cells transplanted to wild-type hosts also resulted in an increase of bipolar cells at the expense of amacrine cells, whilst the heatshock driven misexpression of Vsx2 at later stages also increased the proportion of bipolar cells, but this time at the expense of photoreceptors. Such results are concordant with the mouse data, and suggest that the timing of overexpression is critical to the phenotype, as we might expect if Vsx2 acts like a gate-keeper on lineages that arise at different times in retinogenesis.</p><p>Beside its specific effect on bipolar cell fates, and keeping cells proliferative, Vsx2 represses transcription factors involved in specifying the progenitors of other lineages. This latter function, which is highlighted in this paper, suggests that Vsx2-positive RPCs may act like multipotent retinal progenitors that produce distinct Vsx2-negative progenitors, each with limited competence and proliferative potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained and bred at 26.5&#x000b0;C, and embryos were raised at 28.5&#x000b0;C and staged as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] in hpf.
