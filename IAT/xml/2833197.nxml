In order for secretory proteins to fold properly, ER homeostasis must be maintained. ER homeostasis is defined by the dynamic balance between the ER protein load and the ER capacity to process this load. ER homeostasis can be perturbed by pathological processes such as hypoxia, glucose deprivation, viral infections, environmental toxins, inflammatory cytokines, and mutant protein expression, as well as by physiological processes such as aging. Disruption of ER homeostasis causes accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER. This condition is referred to as ER stress. Cells cope with ER stress by activating the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Ron1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Rutkowski1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The UPR is initiated by three ER transmembrane proteins: Inositol Requiring 1 (IRE1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6). These three master regulators sense and interpret protein folding conditions in the ER and translate this information across the ER membrane to regulate downstream effectors. These effectors have two distinct outputs, homeostatic and apoptotic. Homeostatic outputs are adaptive responses that function to attenuate ER stress and restore ER homeostasis. These responses include the attenuation of protein translation to reduce ER workload and prevent further accumulation of unfolded proteins, upregulation of molecular chaperones and protein processing enzymes to enhance the ER folding activity, and the increase in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components to promote clearance of unfolded proteins. When ER stress reaches a point where the cells cannot tolerate the load of unfolded proteins any more, apoptosis sets in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Ron1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that cells suffering from insufficient blood supplies experience ER stress. The ER needs energy and oxygen for the folding process, thus nutrient deprivation (low ATP production) and hypoxia caused by insufficient blood supply leads to inefficient protein folding and ER stress in cells, especially in cancer cells that grow and spread rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-RomeroRamirez1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Koumenis1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Drogat1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

To test this idea, we derived a reporter construct by cloning 1 kb upstream sequences of the mouse VEGFA transcription start site upstream of the luciferase gene. Ectopic XBP-1-p expression increased activity of VEGFA promoter-luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009575-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). In order to determine direct interaction of XBP1 with VEGFA, we did a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of the mouse VEGFA promoter. Mouse neuro2A cells either mock transfected or transfected with XBP-1-p, were treated with thapsigargin. ChIP analysis indicates that XBP-1-p was recruited to the mouse VEGFA promoter under ER stress conditions in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009575-g003">Figure 3J</xref>). XBP-1-p overexpression improves binding efficiency which is further increased by ER stress thus supporting the idea of dose-dependent upregulation of VEGFA transcription under ER stress.

Mammalian placenta is a vital secretory organ characterized by secretion of large amounts of diverse proteins like placental lactogens, proliferins and other growth factors required for the growing embryo. In mice, the placenta is formed by fusion of the embryo-derived allantois (i.e., umbilical cord) and the extra-embryonic chorion which derives from the polar trophectoderm overlying the embryo. Chorioallantoic attachment at embryonic day 8.5 causes chorionic trophoblast to differentiate into various layers of labyrinthine trophoblast cells. These labyrinthine trophoblast cells undergo extensive villus branching to form the labyrinth by embryonic day 10.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Rossant2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

It has been reported that hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, which have been shown to activate both IRE1&#x003b1; and PERK in this study, are involved in various stages of placental development, one of them being trophoblast differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Rossant1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Adelman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Genbacev1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggest that the generation of a fully functional labyrinthine trophoblast requires a coordinated action of downstream effectors regulated by IRE1&#x003b1; including VEGFA which is independent of HIF1&#x003b1; signaling.</p><p>Angiogenesis is crucial for sustaining tumors. IRE1&#x003b1; signaling is known to be essential for angiogenesis and growth of tumor cells through VEGFA induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-RomeroRamirez1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Drogat1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. PERK signaling also has been shown to be important for survival of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009575-Blais1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data show that the IRE1&#x003b1;-XBP-1, PERK-ATF4, and ATF6&#x003b1; pathways can independently regulate VEGFA mRNA expression under ER stress conditions via different regulatory regions of the VEGFA gene. Our results show that both VEGFA promoter as well as the intron is engaged simultaneously by UPR effectors under ER stress conditions. This tells us that coordinated activation of all three regulators is essential for proper upregulation of VEGFA mRNA expression. Inactivation or knockdown of any of these three master regulators impairs VEGFA upregulation under ER stress.</p><p>Many downstream target genes of the UPR are co-regulated by IRE1&#x003b1;, PERK, and ATF6&#x003b1;, ensuring the redundancy and robustness of this adaptive response. However, this biological design that mediates robustness also has drawbacks. In cancer cells, VEGFA induction mediated by the UPR is used to maintain abnormal ER homeostasis and help these cells to survive and proliferate under chronic ER stress conditions caused by nutrient deprivation and hypoxia. Thus, inhibiting IRE1&#x003b1;, PERK, and ATF6&#x003b1; is a promising novel therapeutic modality for cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Hepatocellular cell line, HepG2, and human prostate cancer cell line, PC3, were obtained from ATCC.
