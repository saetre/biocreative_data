This high duty ratio processive movement is thought to require a mechanism in which alternating stepping of the two head domains of the kinesin dimer is driven by alternating, overlapped cycles of ATP hydrolysis by the two heads. The R210K point mutation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin heavy chain was reported to disrupt the ability of the enzyme active site to catalyze ATP P-O bond cleavage. We expressed R210K homodimers as well as isolated R210K heads and confirmed that both are essentially inactive. We then co-expressed tagged R210K subunits with untagged wild-type subunits and affinity purified R210K/wild-type heterodimers together with the inactive R210K homodimers. In contrast to the R210K head or homodimer, the heterodimer was a highly active (&#x0003e;50% of wild-type) microtubule-stimulated ATPase, and the heterodimer displayed high duty ratio processive movement in single-molecule motility experiments. Thus, dimerization of a subunit containing the inactivating mutation with a functional subunit can complement the mutation; this must occur either by lowering or by bypassing kinetic barriers in the ATPase or mechanical cycles of the mutant head. The observations provide support for kinesin-1 gating mechanisms in which one head stimulates the rate of essential processes in the other.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="GM1">R01 GM043369-09</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="GM1">National Institute of General Medical Sciences : NIGMS</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Kinesin-1 and myosin V are the best characterized examples of motor enzyme molecules that move unidirectionally and continuously along the cytoskeletal filaments (microtubules and F-actin, respectively) that serve as their tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Each enzyme maintains a tight association with its track, undergoing tens or hundreds of catalytic turnovers without detaching from or sliding freely relative to it. Such &#x0201c;processive high duty ratio&#x0201d; movement allows individual isolated enzyme molecules to make forward progress even when opposed by substantial elastic loads. This property may be essential to the biological function of these enzymes as engines that propel subcellular organelles through the viscoelastic cytoplasm. Processive high duty ratio movement is thought to require that the actions of the two identical motor or &#x0201c;head&#x0201d; domains of the enzyme be coordinated so that at least one head is attached to the track at any given instant during movement. This head coordination hypothesis is consistent with observations that one-headed kinesin-1 constructs lack the ability to move processively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and with high duty ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The hypothesis is also consistent with demonstrations in two-headed molecules that catalytic turnover of the two heads is not independent, at least under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The combined results from a series of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) show that kinesin heads move by an alternating-sites hand-over-hand mechanism, in which the two heads alternately hydrolyze ATP and each head moves forward 16 nm along the microtubule in every other hydrolysis cycle. This results in net movement of the enzyme as a whole by 8 nm per cycle. Curiously, the two heads do not behave quite identically; the data suggest that even- and odd-numbered steps begin with different conformations of the domain that links the heads to the C-terminal coiled-coil and that even and odd cycles have different <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values under some circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In addition to defining the sequence of domain movements that underlie kinesin motility, the alternating-sites hand-over-hand mechanism provides an attractive hypothesis to explain the head coordination that is thought to be the responsible for the high duty ratio processive property of kinesin movement. In particular, it is widely accepted that such head coordination, and hence processive movement, is a consequence of the alternating ATP hydrolysis between the two heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Alternation of the ATPase cycles is enforced by the mechanical linkage of the two subunits through the neck linker domains. Specifically, the linkage is thought to mediate gating processes in which a step in the mechanochemical cycle of one head is slowed or blocked by the presence of the other head in particular states. Such inhibitory gating processes include i) blocking of ADP release by the &#x0201c;tethered&#x0201d; head until nucleoside triphosphate binds to the &#x0201c;bound&#x0201d; head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), and ii) slowing of ATP binding to the leading head when the neck linker in the trailing head is docked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Conversely, acceleration of trailing head detachment by mechanical strain transmitted from the leading head may represent an unusual stimulatory gating process, but there are disagreements concerning the magnitude and mechanistic significance of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To investigate possible additional stimulatory gating processes in kinesin, we prepared by co-expression a heterodimeric kinesin derivative in which one head has the wild-type sequence and the other has a single point mutation.

In contrast, microtubule association kinetics and nucleotide affinities of the mutant homodimer were similar to wild-type. Furthermore, nucleotide-stimulated ADP release was unimpaired in the R210K homodimer, evidence that machinery for head-head communication remains functional. To confirm and extend these earlier studies, we expressed and purified a similar mutant kinesin consisting of the N-terminal 401 amino acids of <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin with C-terminal biotin and six-histidine tags (K401-BIO-H6 R210K). K401 constructs lack the complete C-terminus of intact kinesin heavy chain, but contain at least 40 amino acids of the &#x003b1;-helical coiled-coil neck domain, a length sufficient to induce formation of stable dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). We also prepared a K340-BIO-H6 R210K construct that lacks this dimerization domain; that protein was homogeneously monomeric as expected (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The ATPase specific activities of both the mutant monomer and homodimer constructs were dramatically reduced relative to wild-type dimers (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, lines 4 and 2 vs. line 1). We further tested the ability of the mutant homodimers to move streptavidin-coated 150 nm diameter polystyrene beads along immobilized microtubules, using an experimental design in which wild-type homodimers show robust activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). No bead movement was detected at enzyme:bead mole ratios of 1:1, 10:1, or 100:1 (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and data not shown). At all ratios, bead-labeled mutant homodimers remained bound at fixed positions on microtubules in 1 mM ATP or in controls with no added nucleotide, but did not bind in controls with 1 mM ADP. These findings are consistent with observations in bulk experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) that linkage between nucleotide and microtubule binding is retained in the mutant.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Wild-Type/R210K Heterodimers</title><p id="P11">Having confirmed that R210K inactivates kinesin both in homodimers and in isolated heads, we made preparations containing heterodimers with one wild-type and one mutant subunit. Tagged mutant subunits (K401-BIO-H6 R210K) and untagged wild-type subunits (K401) were co-expressed and proteins that contained at least one tagged subunit were purified by affinity and ion exchange chromatography, yielding mutant/wild-type heterodimers mixed with the inactive mutant homodimers. Denaturing electrophoresis of the purified protein reveals two bands at the expected sizes of the tagged and untagged subunits (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The tagged:untagged molar concentration ratio estimated by densitometry was 1.6:1. That is close to the 2:1 ratio expected if the two types of subunits are expressed equally, subunits associate randomly, and untagged wild-type homodimers are fully removed during purification. Application of the purification protocol to control cells expressing only untagged K401 yielded no detectable protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, lane 4), confirming that the untagged homodimers are efficiently removed.</p><p id="P12">Sedimentation velocity measurements on the heterodimer sample demonstrate that it is uniformly dimeric, with sedimentation and diffusion coefficients indistinguishable from those of wild-type homodimers (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, the R210K mutation does not affect the oligomeric state of the construct nor significantly alter its overall shape, consistent with previous conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) that R210K causes a local structural alteration at the catalytic site, not a global folding defect.</p><p id="P13">If the kinesin mechanism <italic>requires</italic> that the heads alternate catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), a mutation which blocks ATP hydrolysis in one head of a mutant/wild-type heterodimer would be expected to prevent steady-state catalytic turnover of the wild-type head. Despite the fact that R210K heads are essentially inactive in both monomer and homodimer contexts, the heterodimer sample microtubule-stimulated ATPase specific activity is only ~2-fold reduced relative to that of wild-type homodimers (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The observed activity was not from the mutant homodimers present in the sample; that species is inactive (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nor can the activity be explained by postulating contamination of the heterodimer sample by wild-type homodimers, because the wild-type homodimer and heterodimer sample ATPase activities were observed to have quite different salt dependences: the wild-type homodimer ATPase decreased ~58-fold upon addition of 150 mM NaCl whereas heterodimer ATPase decreased by only ~8-fold.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Motility of Heterodimer Sample</title><p id="P14">Can ATP hydrolysis by the mutant/wild-type heterodimer drive processive movement of a single enzyme molecule along a microtubule? The heterodimer sample was mixed with streptavidin-coated beads at a 1:1 mole ratio of protein dimers to beads; in the motility experiment these beads moved processively and unidirectionally along microtubules, at a velocity ~9-fold slower than that of wild-type homodimers (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Video S1, and Video S2).</p><p id="P15">At the 1:1 dimer:bead ratio, most beads had &#x02264;1 enzyme molecule. Nonetheless, the frequency of heterodimer bead movements was roughly similar to that observed with wild-type homodimers (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This is strong evidence that processive movement can be generated by single heterodimers; it is not restricted to the extremely small subpopulation of beads with &#x0003e;1 enzyme molecule simultaneously interacting with the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The small (~2-fold) reduction in movement frequency in the heterodimer sample relative to wild-type homodimers is explained in large part by the fact that a significant fraction of molecules in the former are inactive mutant homodimers.</p><p id="P16">In principle, the heterodimer preparation might contain wild-type homodimers due to incomplete removal in the purification, homologous recombination between the plasmids, or by subunit exchange after purification. Two lines of evidence confirm that the observed motility is not from wild-type homodimers. First, no motility was seen in control experiments in which the streptavidin-coated beads were pre-treated with excess biotin before adding enzyme. This implies that the movements observed in the heterodimer sample arise from enzyme molecules specifically attached to the beads by a biotin-streptavidin linkage; the wild-type homodimers should lack the biotin tag. Second, movement in the heterodimer samples has different properties from that driven by wild-type homodimers, suggesting that the two arise from distinct enzyme species. Velocity distributions observed for wild-type homodimers and the heterodimers are nearly disjoint (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Also, the characteristic distance moved by each enzyme molecule (&#x0201c;run length&#x0201d;) was significantly lower for heterodimers, and the mean duration of the run (i.e., run length divided by mean velocity) was substantially larger (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In control experiments, we examined motility from equimolar mixtures of wild-type K401-BIO-H6 with the mutant/wild-type heterodimer sample or with mutant homodimers. In the former, the bead velocity distribution had two peaks, one at the wild-type velocity (~800 nm/s) and one at the heterodimer velocity (~95 nm/s). The latter had only a single peak at the wild-type velocity. These experiments demonstrate that movement of wild-type homodimers is not slowed by the simultaneous presence of heterodimers or mutant homodimers, confirming that contaminating wild-type homodimers do not cause the slow motility observed in the heterodimer sample.</p><p id="P18">Nanometer-scale tracking of single molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) was used to determine whether beads driven by the mutant/wild-type heterodimers moved unidirectionally. As is the case with wild-type homodimers, clear backwards displacements were rare (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). For each molecule tracked, the distribution of bead positions normal to the microtubule axis was narrow and movement was parallel to the axis. These observations demonstrate that the R210K/wild-type heterodimers, like wild-type homodimers, follow microtubule protofilament tracks and therefore must move processively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Protofilament tracking is confirmed by observation that in traces with sufficiently low movement velocity, movement occurred in discrete ~8 nm steps (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P19">A different heterodimer, R14A/wild-type, was shown to exhibit alternating long and short dwells between 8 nm steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), consistent with alternating movement by the two heads.

A larger and higher resolution data set would be required to quantitatively evaluate the extent of R210K/wild-type limping because limping measurements on weakly limping motors are subject to statistical bias as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P20">A high duty ratio motor enzyme can be defined as one that does not freely slide along or detach from its track during most or all of its catalytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).

Analogous effects have been seen with other motor enzymes: for both myosin II and Rep helicase, dimer-specific functions can be restored when a wild-type subunit associates with a non-functional mutant subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Since the R210K/wild-type kinesin heterodimer takes 8 nm steps, tracks microtubule protofilaments, and appears to limp, there is a strong likelihood that it moves by the same pattern of alternating hand-over-hand head movements as wild-type homodimers.</p><p id="P24">In the most widely accepted view of the kinesin catalytic cycle (see refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), the enzyme hydrolyzes ATP in the trailing head in a configuration in which the leading head is empty and both heads are bound to the microtubule (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, uppermost species). Klumpp et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) showed that the hydrolysis step is blocked by the R210K mutation. How is this kinetic barrier overcome in the R210K/wild-type heterodimer? In purely formal terms, the presence of the wild-type subunit can complement the kinetic defect in the R210K subunit either by acting directly to lower the kinetic barrier (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, orange) or by bypassing the barrier through an alternative movement mechanism (for example, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, violet). In the schemes shown, both possibilities result in hand-over-hand movement coupled to ATP hydrolysis. The key difference is that the former hydrolyzes one ATP per 8 nm step (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), like wild-type homodimers, while the latter hydrolyzes one ATP per two steps (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These two possibilities could in principle be distinguished by comparing the ATPase specific activity in bulk with the single-molecule movement velocity measured under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). However, approaches based on specific activity will not be reliable until the heterodimer mechanism is understood in enough detail that active site titatration methods can be used to make accurate measurements of the concentration of active heterodimer molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), and the extent to which heterodimer ATPase might be partially uncoupled from motility is assessed. Without such additional data, both barrier lowering and barrier bypass pathways remain as plausible explanations for the complementation of the R210K kinetic defect by heterodimerization with a wild-type subunit.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Precedents for Overcoming the R210K Kinetic Barrier in Heterodimers</title><p id="P25">All kinesin and myosin motor domains have an invariant arginine residue in the switch I motif at the position corresponding to R210 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). For myosin, there is extensive evidence (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) that the arginine side chain, together with a adjacent conserved glutamic acid side chain to which it forms a salt bridge when the nucleotide binding pocket is closed, play an essential role in nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis by precisely positioning a water molecule adjacent to the &#x003b3;-phosphate of ATP. A similar role has been proposed for R210 in kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In both families of enzymes, single point mutations at these positions abolish or greatly reduce microtubule- or actin-stimulated ATPase activity of isolated monomer heads (this report and refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Thus, available data suggest that mutations at R210 impair ATPase function primarily by local disruption of the active site geometry needed for catalysis. This view is supported by structural modeling which shows that the conservative R210K substitution is expected merely to subtly alter the network of H-bonds in the ATP-bound active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P26">If R210K causes only a subtle localized alteration in active site conformation, the barrier lowering pathway is a reasonable explanation for its near wild-type function. Specifically, one might hypothesize that when the mutant head is trailing (yellow head in the topmost state of <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), mechanical strain from the bound leading head transmitted through the neck linker might be sufficient to rearrange the structure of the active site and restore the hydrolytic activity that is absent in the R210K monomer, which lacks the internal mechanical strain of the two head bound state. There is ample precedent for mechanical strain transmitted through the neck linkers altering the kinetics of chemical processes within the heads; for example, this is thought to be the mechanism that prevents premature binding of ATP to the lead head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Conversely, the essential steps of the barrier bypass pathway shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> are also supported by precedents in the literature. This pathway (violet arrow) postulates detachment of the trailing mutant head (yellow) while it is in the strongly microtubule binding ATP state. This process is expected to be slower than detachment of an ADP bound trailing head as occurs in the wild-type kinesin mechanism (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, green box), but inhibitor studies suggest that it can occur at a substantial rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). The feasibility of the bypass pathway is supported by a computational model of R210K/wild-type heterodimer function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Also, the idea that a kinesin-1 heterodimer can function with only one catalytically active head parallels the recent revelation that the heterodimeric kinesin-14 Kar3/Vik1 functions as a motor despite the absence of catalytic activity in the Vik1 head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). However, the barrier bypass pathway proposed here, in which the inactive R210K head binds ATP only to release it later in the cycle, is probably not directly applicable to Kar3/Vik1 since the a structure of an isolated Vik1 head shows that the nucleotide binding pocket is absent in this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Failure to Overcome the Kinetic Barrier in R210K Homodimers</title><p id="P28">In the hypothesized scheme for heterodimer function, 8 nm steps occurring through the barrier lowering or bypass pathway alternate with steps occurring by the wild-type pathway (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, C</xref>). The implication is that since no such alternation can take place in the R210K <italic>homodimer</italic>, reactions of that enzyme should be restricted to the altered pathway in every step. Thus, the bypass pathway predicts no ATPase activity and no ATP-driven motility, in good agreement with the observed properties of the homodimer (this study and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In contrast, the barrier lowering pathway predicts that the homodimer will be functional as long as it can successfully enter the two head bound state shown at the top of <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>. Therefore, to explain the low activity of the homodimer in the barrier lowering scheme, it is necessary to make the additional assumption that the enzyme becomes trapped in a kinetically refractory state (e.g., an off-cycle one-head-bound species) from which it is unable to efficiently enter the catalytic cycle. This scenario is consistent with available data, but there is no independent evidence for such a state.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Implications for the Mechanism of Wild-Type Kinesin-1</title><p id="P29">High duty ratio processive movement by kinesin-1 requires coordination of the cycles of the two head domains. Most gating processes that have been demonstrated or proposed to enforce this coordination are inhibitory in nature. In both the slowing by internal mechanical strain of lead head ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and in the blockage of ADP release from the tethered head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), a reaction step that occurs readily in one-headed constructs is inhibited (in some parts of the mechanochemical cycle) as a consequence of the head-head linkage in the dimer. It is only in the hypothesized strain-induced dissociation of the trailing head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) that the partner head is proposed to have a stimulatory rather than inhibitory effect. The observations that the presence of the wild-type head in the R210K/wild-type heterodimer complements the kinetic defect in the mutant head provides a new example of such stimulatory subunit-subunit interactions and raises the possibility that additional stimulatory gating processes may exist in the mechanism of wild-type kinesin-1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="S16" sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Table</title><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Population distributions (<italic>g</italic>) of apparent sedimentation coefficients (<italic>s</italic>*) in sedimentation velocity experiments on the heterodimer (<italic>blue</italic>) and mutant monomer (<italic>purple</italic>) samples (<italic>left</italic>). <italic>Circles</italic> are measurements; <italic>lines</italic> are theoretical non-interacting single-species distributions using the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients (<italic>right</italic>, rows 1&#x02013;2) determined by fitting (see Materials and Methods).

In a single turnover cycle for wild-type kinesin homodimers (analogous to that shown in the green box, but with two identical heads), ATP is hydrolyzed in the trailing head from a state (<italic>top</italic>) in which both heads are bound to the microtubule. In the R210K/wild-type heterodimer, individual cycles with the mutant head in the leading position (not shown) alternate with individual cycles (<italic>green box</italic>) in which the wild-type head (<italic>red</italic>) is leading and the mutant head (<italic>yellow</italic>) is trailing. In these cycles where the R210K head is trailing, its pairing with a wild-type head in the heterodimer must enable it to evade the kinetic barrier to ATP hydrolysis (<italic>red &#x0201c;X&#x0201d;</italic>) present in isolated R210K monomers. Evasion could be accomplished by lowering the barrier (<italic>orange arrow</italic>), allowing the trailing mutant head to hydrolyze ATP much more rapidly in the heterodimer context than in the monomer context, or by bypassing the barrier via a pathway in which the trailing mutant head steps forward without accompanying hydrolysis of ATP. The mechanism of this putative bypass pathway might consist of ATP binding to the leading head, followed by stepping, followed by release of unhydrolyzed ATP from the (now leading) mutant head (<italic>violet arrow</italic>), but other arrangements of steps are also possible. (A possible alternative is that ATP remains continuously bound to the mutant head, as in the short runs seen in mixtures of ATP and an inhibitor in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>.) In the wild-type kinesin mechanism, the position of ADP-associated heads has been variously reported as microtubule-bound, tethered, or docked to the leading head (see discussion and citations in refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>); for simplicity, only the first of these possibilities is illustrated.

In these schemes, the first 8 nm step is assumed to proceed by the pathways shown as orange (B) or violet (C) arrows in panel A. The second step is assumed to proceed by the wild-type mechanism since the functions performed by the leading head (binding ATP and stimulating nucleotide release from the other head) are essentially unaffected by the R210K mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms72662f5"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>ATPase Activity and Motility of Kinesin Derivatives</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Enzyme Species <xref rid="TFN1" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATPase Activity <xref rid="TFN2" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref> (mean &#x000b1; S.D.)
