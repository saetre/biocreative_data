Therapeutics more effectively targeted to key events in atherosclerosis are required to reduce its risk. Details of the underlying molecular basis for atherosclerosis remain obscure. Some important leads have been revealed through studies of knockout mice. Development of atherosclerosis (induced by a variety of means) has been shown to be attenuated in mice made deficient in adhesion molecules like P- and E-selectins or deficient in the chemokine receptor CCR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002503-Boisvert1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002503-Johnson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

The mRNA values for the adhesion molecules/cofactors that were elevated in the apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were reduced in their transgenic counterparts that express very low levels of adrenal apoE. mRNA levels for CD44 declined from 2.5- to 1.9-fold, for VCAM-1 from 22.5- to 16.0-fold, for LFA-1 from 9.1- to 4.8-fold, and for MCP-1 from 6.0- to 2.8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002503-g002">fig. 2A</xref>). Expression of low levels of apoE suppresses the expression of mRNA of these key adhesion molecules in aortic arches and was atheroprotective. This suppression occurred even against a background of high plasma cholesterol (transgenic: 434.7&#x000b1;55.1 mg/dl, knockout: 380.5&#x000b1;70.6 mg/dl, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.55) which is equivalent between the two groups. Protection from formation of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice by very low levels of apoE occurs, although the suppression of the mRNA expression of the key molecules did not reach wild type levels. Cathepsin-B gene expression in apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> KO mice, for example, was higher than in wild-type mice (&#x0223c;1.5 fold). Expression of the apoE transgene, however, yields only a modest decline in cathepsin-B mRNA when compared to that of the WT mice. ICAM-1 and eNOS gene expression was found to display only minor differences among all three groups (KO, TG, and WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002503-g002">fig. 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>mRNA expression in aortic arches of 13-weeks old mice</title><p>A primary goal of this work was to extend the analysis of mRNA to mice in earlier stages of lesion formation, recognizing that the amounts of starting tissue become a technical challenge. To this end, we refined methods to measure mRNAs in aortic arches surgically removed from individual mice, rather than in preparations from pooled aortic arches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002503-g002">fig. 2A</xref>). We exploited the technology and pressed the analysis of lesion formation in progressively younger mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002503-g002">fig. 2B</xref>). At 13 weeks of age, apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed substantially elevated levels of mRNA for adhesion proteins CD44 (2.5-fold), ICAM-1 (1.7-fold), the adhesion ligand LFA-1 (2.9-fold), and MAC-1 (3.0-fold) in their aortic arches. Each of the other adhesion molecules/cofactors displayed mRNA levels in apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that were only slightly higher or equivalent to those prepared from aortic arches of the WT mice.</p><p>The expression by transgene (TG) of very low levels of adrenal-derived apoE in the 13-week old apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice again resulted in sharp reductions in the elevated mRNA levels of LFA-1, MAC-1, ICAM-1 MCP-1, VCAM-1 and Cox-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002503-g002">fig. 2B</xref>). Of interest, mRNA levels for VCAM-1, MCP-1, and Cox-2 in aortic arches of apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were suppressed by transgenic expression of very low apoE, reaching levels well below those observed in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002503-g002">fig. 2B</xref>). Expression of CD44 mRNA and cathespsin-B mRNA, in contrast, was largely unaffected by the transgenic expression of low levels of apoE in the apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. mRNA levels of eNOS in the apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice harboring the transgene (TG) were higher than either apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (KO) mice (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) or WT mice (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Again, as with the 8.5 month mice, the suppression is observed in the face of elevated plasma cholesterol (transgenic: 352.8&#x000b1;41.7 mg/dl, knockout: 266.4&#x000b1;46.9 mg/dl, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.29) as compared to the wild type, 119.0 mg/dl&#x000b1;27.6.</p><p>Expression of mRNAs for these key molecules also was examined in peripheral blood leukocytes. mRNA levels of the adhesion molecules/cofactors were investigated in peripheral leukocyte preparations to ascertain if mRNA levels in these circulating cells would mirror those observed in the aortic arches.

Furthermore, expression of MCP-1 mRNA was found to be elevated even earlier, at 10- and 13-weeks of age in apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Since levels of expression of MCP-1 mRNA appeared to increase with the age of the apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, MCP-1 may be playing a more important role in the later rather than early stages of atherosclerosis.
