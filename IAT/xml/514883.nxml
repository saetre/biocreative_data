In humans, they have been detected in skin, brain, blood, and cancer cells. Despite a broad distribution, mmBCFAs remain exotic in eukaryotes, where their origin and physiological roles are not understood. Here we report our study of the function and regulation of mmBCFAs in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> combining genetics, gas chromatography, and DNA microarray analysis. We show that <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> synthesizes mmBCFAs de novo and utilizes the long-chain fatty acid elongation enzymes ELO-5 and ELO-6 to produce two mmBCFAs, C15ISO and C17ISO. These mmBCFAs are essential for <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> growth and development, as suppression of their biosynthesis results in a growth arrest at the first larval stage. The arrest is reversible and can be overcome by feeding the arrested animals with mmBCFA supplements. We show not only that the levels of C15ISO and C17ISO affect the expression of several genes, but also that the activities of some of these genes affect biosynthesis of mmBCFAs, suggesting a potential feedback regulation.

In mammals, mmBCFAs have been detected in several tissues, including skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Aungst1">Aungst 1989</xref>), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Vernix caseosa</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Nicolaides1">Nicolaides and Apon 1976</xref>), harderian and sebaceous glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Nordstrom1">Nordstrom et al. 1986</xref>), hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Jones1">Jones and Rivett 1997</xref>), brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Ramsey1">Ramsey et al. 1977</xref>), blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Holman1">Holman et al. 1995</xref>), and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Hradec1">Hradec and Dufek 1994</xref>). The fact that mmBCFAs are present in a wide variety of organisms implies a conservation of the related metabolic enzymes and consequently important and perhaps unique functions for these molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Jones1">Jones and Rivett 1997</xref>). Nevertheless, their physiological roles and metabolic regulations have not been systematically studied and thus remain fragmentary. It was found that C21anteISO is the major covalently bound FA in mammalian hair fibers. A removal of this FA from its protein counterparts results in a loss of hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Jones1">Jones and Rivett 1997</xref>). Other studies indicated that C17anteISO esterified to cholesterol binds to and activates enzymes of protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Tuhackova1">Tuhackova and Hradec 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Hradec1">Hradec and Dufek 1994</xref>). A potential significance of mmBCFAs for human health is associated with a long-observed correlation between amounts of these FAs and disease conditions such as brain deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Ramsey1">Ramsey et al. 1977</xref>) and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Hradec1">Hradec and Dufek 1994</xref>). More recent studies have revealed a role of another mmBCFA, C15ISO, as a growth inhibitor of human cancer where it selectively induces apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Yang1">Yang et al. 2000</xref>). Given how important these FA molecules may be and how little is known about their biosynthesis and functions in eukaryotes, it is an opportune problem to study.</p><p>De novo synthesis of long-chain mmBCFAs described for bacteria is quite different from the biosynthesis of straight-chain FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Smith1">Smith and Kaneda 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Oku1">Oku and Kaneda 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Toal1">Toal et al. 1995</xref>). While the latter uses acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) as a primer condensing with a malonyl-CoA extender, branched-chain FA synthesis starts with the branched-chain CoA primers derived from the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. To synthesize branched-chain FAs, organisms must have a system for supplying branched-chain primers along with the enzymes utilizing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Smith1">Smith and Kaneda 1980</xref>). No such enzymes have been previously characterized in vivo for any eukaryotic organisms.</p><p>Here we describe our approach to characterize the biosynthesis and function of mmBCFAs using the free-living nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans.</italic> Combining genetic, molecular, and biochemical analyses, we show that the worm is not only able to synthesize mmBCFAs de novo but is also absolutely dependent on these FA species for its growth and development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> Synthesizes Branched-Chain FAs De Novo and Uses Two FA Elongation Enzymes to Produce C15ISO and C17ISO</title><p>In characterizing FA elongation in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> we identified eight sequences homologous to the yeast long-chain FA elongation enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Kniazeva1">Kniazeva et al. 2003</xref>). To test for their possible functions in vivo, we applied RNAi to the corresponding genes, followed by an analysis of FA composition in whole animals using gas chromatography (GC). RNAi treatment of four genes&#x02014;<italic>elo-3</italic> (D2024.3), <italic>elo-4</italic> (C40H1.4), <italic>elo-7</italic> (F56H11.3), and <italic>elo-8</italic> (Y47D3A.30)&#x02014;did not produce any notable phenotypes, whereas suppression of <italic>elo-1</italic> (F56H11.4) and <italic>elo-2</italic> (F11E6.5) affected the elongation of straight long-chain saturated and polyunsaturated FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Beaudoin1">Beaudoin et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Kniazeva1">Kniazeva et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, the RNAi treatment of the two remaining genes, <italic>elo-5</italic> (F41H10.7) and <italic>elo-6</italic> (F41H10.8), affected the levels of branched-chain FA. Transcriptional reporter constructs (<italic>elo-5Prom</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>elo-6Prom</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic>) indicated that both genes are expressed in the gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

These results indicate that ELO-5 might be involved in the biosynthesis of C15ISO and possibly also C17ISO, whereas ELO-6 may function in elongating C15ISO to C17ISO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g003">3</xref>D). To our best knowledge, these are the first enzymes that have been shown to be involved in long-chain mmBCFA biosynthesis in a nonbacterial in vivo system and the first enzymes of the long-chain FA elongation family related to mmBCFA production.</p><p>In bacteria, mmBCFA biosynthesis utilizes branched-chain &#x003b1;-keto-acids of leucine, isoleucine, and valine to produce mmBCFA acyl-CoA primers that substitute for acetyl-CoAs in conventional FA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Oku1">Oku and Kaneda 1988</xref>). Key enzymes engaged in synthesizing the mmBCFA acyl-CoA primers are branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT) and the branched-chain &#x003b1;-keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The elongation of the mmBCFA backbone is then carried out by fatty acid synthetase (FAS).</p><p>The ability of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> to grow on the chemically defined axenic medium CbMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Lu1">Lu and Goetsch 1993</xref>), which lacks the potential mmBCFA precursors, has suggested that the animals can synthesize mmBCFA de novo. If so, a disruption of the BCKAD complex could affect mmBCFA levels. We identified a predicted <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> protein, Y39E4A.3, with significant sequence homology to the E1 alpha subunit of BCKAD (Y39E4A.3 scores expect value 8e-50 on 57&#x00025; of the length with the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content> BCKAD and 1.4e-134 on 88.4&#x00025; of the length with the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Homo sapiens</named-content> BCKADs). RNAi of Y39E4A.3 led to a significant decrease in C15ISO and C17ISO production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g004">4</xref>C). RNAi suppression of another predicted component of the BCKAD complex, pyruvate dehydrogenase (T05H10.6), resulted in a similar decrease in C15ISO and C17ISO (unpublished data), indicating a role for the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> BCKAD protein in long-chain mmBCFA biosynthesis. Thus, <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> appears to use the same initial reactions to produce mmBCFAs as bacterial cells. In addition, the worm uses enzymes of the FA elongation family, ELO-5 and ELO-6, to complete the pathway.</p><p>A connection between BCKAD functions and mmBCFA quantities has been previously reported in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Jones2">Jones et al. 1996</xref>). Normally hair fibers are densely covered with C21anteISO, which contributes about 38.2&#x00025; to the total hair FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Jones1">Jones and Rivett 1997</xref>). It was observed that patients with maple syrup urine disease, which is caused by an inherited mutation in the BCKAD gene, had a drastically reduced level of mmBCFAs in their hair. Together, these data suggest that long-chain mmBCFA biosynthesis could be similar in bacteria, <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and human.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Blocking ELO-5 Function Causes Growth and Developmental Defects</title><p>While the suppression of <italic>elo-6</italic> activity by feeding double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to wild-type animals did not cause obvious morphological or growth defects, the suppression of <italic>elo-5</italic> resulted in more pronounced phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Worms originating from wild-type eggs laid on the <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic> plates displayed no obvious growth or morphological abnormality until the second day of adulthood, when they developed an egg-laying defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Eggs of the next generation hatched on time but the progeny arrested at the first of the four larval stages (L1). The small larvae maintained morphological integrity and could survive on a plate for up to 3&#x02013;4 d. The arrest was only observed in progeny of parents exposed to <italic>elo-5</italic> RNAi at the L1 stage.</p><p>When parental animals were subjected to <italic>elo-5</italic> RNAi at later larval stages (L2&#x02013;L4), their progeny did not arrest in L1 but continued to develop into adulthood. These animals had no obvious defects in locomotion, pharyngeal pumping, intestinal contractions, chemotaxis response, touch sensitivity, or general anatomy (unpublished data). However, the growing worms became progressively sick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g005">Figure 5</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g005">5</xref>F). The gonads appeared normal at the L4 and early adult stages, but after fertilization of one to ten oocytes, oogenesis became impaired. Gonad degeneration began with a pronounced vacuolization in the midsection of the gonad followed by the appearance of disorganized clumps of nuclei in the proximal part. An egg-laying defect became apparent and only a few progeny arose from these worms, which then arrested at L1. The development of the <italic>elo-5</italic> RNAi phenotypes is likely due to a gradual elimination of the ELO-5&#x02013;associated functions. Our data suggest that these functions are crucial for larval growth and development.</p><p>We also obtained a likely null mutant of the <italic>elo-5</italic> gene, <italic>elo-5(gk208),</italic> which has a 245-bp deletion eliminating the predicted first exon (Genome Science Center, BC Cancer Research Center, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). This allele phenocopies the L1 arrest phenotype of the <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic> animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>A Deficiency of C15ISO and C17ISO FAs Is Solely Responsible for the Defects Caused by <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic></title><p>We reasoned that if the defects observed in the <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic> animals resulted directly from the deficiency of C15ISO and C17ISO, then feeding these worms with C15ISO and C17ISO should mask a shortage of endogenous C15ISO and C17ISO and permit the animals to grow normally. As predicted, the C17ISO and C17anteISO supplements rescued the <italic>elo-5</italic> RNAi defects (in 52 of 60 and 58 of 60 plates, respectively). A partial rescue was observed on the plates supplemented with C15ISO and C15anteISO (23 of 38 and 20 of 28 plates, respectively). Corroborating results were obtained when homozygous <italic>elo-5(gk208)</italic> animals supplied with C17ISO grew normally. In sharp contrast, neither saturated or mono- or polyunsaturated FA molecules (C16:0, C16:1 n7, C17:0, C18:3 n6), mmBCFAs with shorter or longer backbones (C13ISO, C18ISO, C19ISO), nor polymethyl branched phytanic acid were able to rescue or reduce defects (0 of 30 plates in each experiment). Therefore, we have determined that only dietary 17-carbon mmBCFAs are competent to bypass the biochemical defect caused by loss of ELO-5 function.</p><p>GC analysis of FA composition in <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic> worms grown on supplemented plates revealed that only C17ISO and C17anteISO are significantly incorporated into lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g006">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g006">6</xref>C). Because the addition of C15ISO did not result in elongation to C17ISO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), we wanted to determine whether ELO-6 was capable of extending an FA backbone in the absence of ELO-5, or whether the supplied free FA molecules could enter a different metabolic pathway, for instance, a degradation pathway. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we added mmBCFA-producing bacteria on top of the <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic> feeding <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> strain (HT115), which lacks mmBCFAs. This mmBCFA-producing strain was identified by chance; we noticed that in the presence of a certain bacterial contaminant the animals could overcome the <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic> effects. Using a rapid bacterial identification method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Lane1">Lane et al. 1985</xref>), we determined the contaminant to be <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.</italic> GC analysis revealed that this bacterial strain produced a high quantity of C15ISO and C15anteISO but not 17-carbon mmBCFAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). GC analysis of <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic> animals fed with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. maltophilia</named-content> indicated that they not only accumulated bacterial C15ISO and C15anteISO but also efficiently elongated these FA species to C17ISO and C17anteISO, which are absent in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. maltophilia</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g006">6</xref>E). This suggested that elongation from C15ISO to C17ISO mmBCFA was not impaired in the <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic> animals. Therefore, ELO-6 function remains intact in <italic>elo-5(RNAi).</italic> Apparently, C15ISO added to the plates could not be utilized by ELO-6 whereas C15ISO-CoA and/or C15anteISO-CoA originating from the bacterial food could, suggesting that free and esterified mmBCFAs were likely to enter alternative pathways.</p><p>The essential roles of C15ISO and C17ISO were also supported through an examination of the <italic>elo-5(gk208)</italic> deletion mutant.

Indeed, C17ISO and C17anteISO could effectively release L1 larvae from the developmental arrest; about 50&#x00025; of 2-d-arrested and 1&#x00025; of 4-d-old L1 were rescued to full growth and proliferation. Since C17anteISO could not be detected in the laboratory animals under normal conditions of culturing, C17ISO appeared to be the principal molecule conveying the ELO-5 function. Therefore, the L1 arrest of the C17ISO-depleted worms is both completely penetrant and reversible, indicating that C17ISO plays a critical role in growth and development at the L1 stage.</p><p>The analysis of the FA levels of staged worms revealed that the C17ISO level increases gradually from a relatively low level at L1 to its peak in gravid adults containing eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Based on the analysis of green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs (unpublished data) and in situ hybridization data (results from NextDB by Y. Kohara, Tokyo, Japan), neither <italic>elo-5</italic> nor <italic>elo-6</italic> is significantly expressed in eggs or L1. Therefore, C17ISO likely accumulates in embryos during oogenesis. It may be directly transported from gut to gonads, since both ELO-5 and ELO-6 were expressed mainly in the gut and since feeding C17ISO rescued the <italic>elo-5</italic> mutant phenotypes. When RNAi-mediated disruption of <italic>elo-5</italic> occurs at the L1 stage of a parent and consequently blocks C17ISO synthesis from that stage on, the eggs and L1 animals of the next generation are expected to contain a critically low concentration of C17ISO, halting further development. Because the arrested L1 can be rescued by a dietary supply of the mmBCFA, the deficiency is not likely to cause critical defects during the embryonic and early postembryonic periods.</p><p>If <italic>elo-5</italic> RNAi is applied to the parent worms at or after the L2 larval stage, when the amount of C17ISO has already been elevated and/or the RNAi effect is less penetrant, the progeny may receive sufficient C17ISO to pass the L1 arrest stage. The resulting animals, however, become visibly unhealthy at the L4 and adult stages as mentioned earlier, suggesting that C17ISO also plays a role in late developmental stages.</p><p>Based on these results, we propose a relationship between the amounts of C17ISO and developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020257-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). In this model, the level of C17ISO is monitored at the first larval stage and the decision is made whether to proceed or pause in development. The analysis of GC data from staged animals has also indicated that the variation of the C17ISO level is correlated with only two other FA species, suggesting a potential compensatory and coregulatory mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The C17ISO Level Correlates with the Levels of Two Other FAs during Development</title><p>FA homeostasis implies that relative amounts of various FA species are coordinated and balanced for optimal performance.

A correlation between C17ISO and linoleic acid may also suggest a similar regulation of biosynthesis of the two molecules.</p><p>The changes in the FA composition associated with a decrease in C15ISO and C17ISO indicate that the metabolism of straight-chain FA species is responsive to the mmBCFA levels and suggest a cross regulation.

C27H6.2 is homologous to RuvB/TIP49a/Pontin52, an evolutionarily conserved protein essential for growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Kanemaki1">Kanemaki et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Bauer1">Bauer et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Qiu1">Qiu et al. 1998</xref>). Its mammalian ortholog acts as a transcriptional cofactor that binds to &#x003b2;-catenin, TATA-box binding protein, and likely to a number of other diverse transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020257-Bauer1">Bauer et al. 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Two mmBCFAs are normally detected in <italic>C. elegans:</italic> C15ISO and C17ISO. A deficiency of these FAs is lethal and cannot be compensated by any other FA present, indicating their crucial importance for growth and development. There are two sources of C15ISO and C17ISO available for worms. First, they possess a system for mmBCFA biosynthesis that includes two FA elongation enzymes, ELO-5 and ELO-6, which are regulated at least in part by the nematode homolog of SREBP-1c <italic>(lpd-1).</italic> Second, worms may obtain mmBCFAs from their diet (bacteria). Therefore, <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> is able to produce, activate, transport, and utilize mmBCFAs and is vitally dependent on this system.</p><p>The level of C15ISO and C17ISO in eggs appears to be critical for growth and development, as animals depleted of C15ISO or C17ISO completely arrest at the L1 stage. The uniformity and reversibility of the arrest would be consistent with a regulatory role in growth and development for these mmBCFAs or for more complex lipid molecules containing them. However, it cannot be ruled out that the arrest is due to the failure of a metabolic or structural function that is essential for growth and development at the first larval stage. In addition, C15ISO and C17ISO may directly or indirectly regulate genes involved in FA homeostasis. Consistent with this, their deficiency triggers a large alteration in gene expression that may reflect a complex feedback mechanism. Among the potentially responsive genes are transcription factors and metabolic genes.</p><p>Ubiquitous and unattended mmBCFAs come forth as physiologically important molecules that regulate essential functions in eukaryotes. Many interesting questions regarding mmBCFAs remain to be addressed. What are the other components of the mmBCFA biosynthetic machinery? What are the components of their transport system? Does an organism have a mechanism by which the mmBCFA level is measured? What are the signaling pathways involved in the mmBCFA responses? How do mmBCFAs exert their physiological function? Do mmBCFAs act alone or as parts of more complex lipids? How are mmBCFAs synthesized in mammals? Lastly, what are the specific physiological functions of mmBCFAs in mammals? Both genetic and biochemical approaches will be taken to address these questions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title/><sec id="s3a1"><title>RNA interference by feeding</title><p>The RNAi feeding vectors were either made in our laboratory using Taq PCR and cloning genomic fragments into a double T7 vector, pPD129.36 (gift of A.
