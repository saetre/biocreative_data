Mutations in GLIS3 cause the syndrome of neonatal diabetes and congenital hypothyroidism (NDH). Our aim was to examine the role of Glis3 in &#x003b2; cells, specifically with regard to regulation of insulin gene transcription. We demonstrate that insulin 2 (Ins2) mRNA expression in rat insulinoma 832/13 cells is markedly increased by wild-type Glis3 overexpression, but not by the NDH1 mutant. Furthermore, expression of both Ins1 and Ins2 mRNA is downregulated when Glis3 is knocked down by siRNA. Glis3 binds to the Ins2 promoter in the cell, detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Deletion analysis of Ins2 promoter identifies a sequence (5&#x02032;-GTCCCCTGCTGTGAA-3&#x02032;) from &#x02212;255 to &#x02212;241 as the Glis3 response element and binding occur specifically via the Glis3 zinc finger region as revealed by mobility shift assays. Moreover, Glis3 physically and functionally interacts with Pdx1, MafA and NeuroD1 to modulate Ins2 promoter activity. Glis3 also may indirectly affect insulin promoter activity through upregulation of MafA and downregulation of Nkx6-1. This study uncovers a role of Glis3 for regulation of insulin gene expression and expands our understanding of its role in the &#x003b2; cell.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>GLI and GLI-similar (Glis) transcription factors are two closely related subfamilies of Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like zinc finger (ZF) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). These factors contain five zinc fingers in tandem for DNA binding. The Glis subfamily is comprised of three members Glis1 to 3. Glis proteins contain both repressor and activator domains, suggesting that they may function as positive and negative regulators of gene transcription. During embryonic development, Glis proteins are expressed in a spatially and temporally specific manner, suggesting that they may play key roles in normal organogenesis. Glis1 is involved in the aberrant differentiation observed in psoriatic epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Glis2 is highly expressed in the kidney, and loss of Glis2 causes nephronophthisis in humans and mice through increased apoptosis and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Glis2 has also been shown to be involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Glis3 is highly expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme during embryonic development and in the uterus, pancreas and kidney of adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). It was also shown to bind to the promoter of fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) and promote osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> assays indicate that all five ZF motifs appear essential for the binding of Glis3 to DNA, and the fourth ZF is also involved in the nuclear localization of Glis3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The C-terminal region of the protein contains a strong transactivation domain, and its deletion abolishes transcriptional activity. A recent report identified a consensus binding site for Glis3 to be (G/C)TGGGGGGT(A/C) using a DNA-binding site selection strategy that combines PCR and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, this sequence was isolated by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and has not been identified in any endogenous Glis3 responsive promoters thus far.</p><p>Linkage analysis revealed that mutations in GLIS3 are responsible for the syndrome of neonatal diabetes and congenital hypothyroidism (NDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Glis3 mRNA is present in human and mouse pancreas from early developmental stages through adulthood, with higher expression in &#x003b2; cells than in other pancreatic islet or exocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, the functional role of Glis3 in &#x003b2; cells has not been explored. Pancreatic islet development, &#x003b2;-cell maintenance and insulin gene transcription are dependent on multiple islet-enriched transcription factors, including Pdx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>), MafA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>), Pax6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and BETA 2/NeuroD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Rat insulin promoter analyses have localized binding of these factors to four promoter regions, C2 (Pax6), A3 (Pdx1), C1 (MafA) and E1 (BETA2/NeuroD1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Other factors known to be involved in insulin gene transcription include Nkx6-1 and Pax4, both of which may have a repressive role. Study of these factors has provided insights into the machinery of insulin gene regulation and the pathogenesis of diabetes. As Glis3 is highly expressed in pancreatic islets and mutations in GLIS3 cause neonatal diabetes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), we hypothesized that this factor may regulate insulin gene expression. In this study, we found that Glis3 binds to a cis-acting element (Glis3 response element, Glis3RE) in the rat insulin 2 promoter (RIP) and stimulates its transcription activity. Furthermore, Glis3 interacts with &#x003b2;-cell-specific transcription factors&#x02014;Pdx1, MafA and NeuroD1&#x02014;and can interact with these in a synergistic manner to increase insulin promoter activity. In addition, Glis3 also regulates the expression of a number of &#x003b2; cell transcription factors, such as MafA, Nkx6-1 and Pax6. These findings constitute the first evidence that Glis3 regulates insulin gene expression in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA constructs</title><p>Using the known coding sequence of mouse Glis3 gene (Genbank accession number NM_175459), we constructed Glis3 cDNA and a Glis3 mutant cDNA (Glis3-NDH1) that corresponds to the sequence in a family with neonatal diabetes and congenital hypothyroidism (NDH1) syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) by PCR mutagenesis, inserting a C nucleotide at 2930 of wild-type Glis3. The mutant Glis3-NDH1 protein terminates prematurely at aa 844 compared to the full-length protein of 935 aa.</p><p>The Glis3 cDNAs as well as control yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were amplified by using PCR and cloned into the retroviral vector pSRQT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Additional constructs were generated for transient transfection by using a human elongation factor 1&#x003b1; (BOS) promoter-driven expression vector pBOS-MCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). SR&#x003b1;-Secreted Alkaline Phosphate (SEAP) construct was kindly provided by Dr David Spencer (Department of Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine). The coding sequences of mouse Glis3, Glis3-NDH1, MafA, Pdx1 and NeuroD1 were ligated downstream of a c-myc tag. We constructed a luciferase (Luc) reporter by ligation downstream of the rat insulin 2 promoter (RIP) from &#x02212;696 to +8 into pGL3-basic (Promega) or pGluc-basic (New England Biolabs) to generate RIP-Luc and RIP-Gluc constructs. Serial deletions of RIP were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGL3-basic.

Deleting sequences from &#x02212;280 to &#x02212;255 had little additional effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, first two constructs), suggesting that the critical region was between &#x02212;255 and &#x02212;241. To define the <italic>cis</italic>-acting element further, we generated five mutant constructs (&#x02212;255 M1 to M5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) within this 15-bp region, all of which (&#x02212;255M1-M5RIP) were associated with a marked reduction in reporter activity, compared to the &#x02212;255RIP wild-type construct, suggesting that this entire region was required for Glis3 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Sequence alignment of insulin promoters from mouse, rat and human indicates that this region is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), consistent with an important role as the Glis3 response element (Glis3RE). We then ligated five copies of the rat or human Glis3RE sequence to the RIP TATA box [(Glis3RE)<sub>5</sub>-Luc] and found that both rat and human Glis3RE constructs were activated by c-myc-Glis3, but not c-myc-Glis3-NDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). These results demonstrate that the 15-bp region G(T/C)CCCC(T/A)GCTGTGA(A/G) in the rat ins2 and human insulin promoters functionally interacts with Glis3 and is crucial to promoter activity. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Identification of Glis3 DNA-binding sequence in RIP region.

We next examined if Glis3 affected the expression of key &#x003b2;-cell-specific transcription factors. Quantitative PCR showed that the mRNA expression of MafA was significantly upregulated while Nkx6-1 and Pax6 were significantly downregulated in Glis3 stably overexpressing cells as compared to YFP-expressing control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A); Glis3-NDH1 had no effect on the expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A).

Because all of these factors directly regulate insulin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), it appears that Glis3 also has an indirect role in the regulation of the insulin promoter through its effects on the mRNA levels, and possibly protein levels, of these &#x003b2;-cell-specific factors. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Glis3 regulates islet-enriched transcription factors expression.

It is highly expressed in human pancreatic &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and mouse islets and rat insulinoma 832/13 cells. The recent discovery that mutations in the GLIS3 gene are responsible for neonatal diabetes and congenital hypothyroidism (NDH) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) motivated us to focus on the function of this factor in &#x003b2; cells.</p><p>In this study, we showed that Glis3 overexpression in rat 832/13 insulinoma cells markedly upregulated Ins2 gene expression. However, both Ins1 and Ins2 were downregulated when endogenous Glis3 was knocked down by siRNA, suggesting that it is involved directly or indirectly in the regulation of both genes. Our data demonstrated that Glis3 is able to directly bind the Glis3RE sequence of the rat Ins2 promoter using ChIP and EMSA, so it likely has a direct effect. The lack of response of Ins1 to Glis3 overexpression may indicate that its expression levels are already near or at maximum in 832/13 cells and an increase in Glis3 levels cannot further enhance Ins1 expression. A similar phenomenon was noted previously for the lack of activation of mouse Ins1, Ins2 and Pdx1 expression by MafB overexpression in &#x003b2;TC3 cells even though it binds to the promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). We cannot identify a Glis3RE sequence in the rat Ins1 promoter region. However, Glis3 can increase MafA mRNA expression and as it is known that MafA is capable of activating Ins1 promoter, we speculate that, although the Ins1 promoter is not directly bound by Glis3, Glis3 has effects on other &#x003b2; cell transcription factors which may in turn influence Ins1 expression.</p><p>We also showed that Glis3 expression stimulated the rat insulin 2 promoter (RIP-Gluc) in both NIH3T3 cells and 832/13 cells and mapped the regulatory region required for Glis3 activation to a 15-bp sequence (&#x02212;255 to &#x02212;241) of the promoter. The site GTCCCCTGCTGTGAA shares 100% homology with a similar region of the mouse Ins2 promoter, and is 80% conserved with a sequence from the human insulin promoter. We showed that Glis3 binds to this sequence and can activate the transcription of both human and rodent (Glis3RE)<sub>5</sub>-TATA box constructs, confirming its place as a <italic>bona fide</italic> Glis3 binding and transcription activation site. By ChIP analysis, we confirmed that Glis3 was able to bind to the region of interest in the endogenous Ins2 promoter in 832/13 cells as well.</p><p>The sequence we identified differs from the 11 bp consensus identified by Beak <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) (G/C)TGGGGGGGT(A/C) using PCR amplification of random oligonucleotide sequences. Their consensus binds to Glis3 with high affinity and can mediate transcription activation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, it is an artificial binding sequence that has not been identified as of yet in any 5&#x02032; regulatory regions. A computer search also failed to find any matching homologous sequences in the rat Ins2 promoter (&#x02212;696/+8). The FGF18 promoter contains a Glis3-binding site with the sequence AACCCCCAAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We found a similar sequence AACCCCCAG at &#x02212;7 to +1 of RIP. However, deletion analysis showed that the proximal promoter region (&#x02212;75/+1) of RIP is minimally activated by co-transfected Glis3 and this sequence overlaps the transcription initiation site +1, making it unlikely that this region is involved in Glis3-activated gene transcription. The Glis3RE (&#x02212;269 to &#x02212;255) identified in this paper partially overlaps with a previously characterized element (GAGACATTTGCCCCCAGCTGT) known as a <underline>n</underline>egative <underline>r</underline>egulatory <underline>e</underline>lement (NRE, &#x02212;279 to &#x02212;258) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) that lies within the glucose sensing Z element (&#x02212;292 to &#x02212;243) of the human insulin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>The human NDH1 mutation of GLIS3 contains a single base insertion at nucleotide 2067. It encodes a mutant protein that is truncated at its C-terminus at aa 844 due to a translation frameshift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The mechanism by which this mutation causes NDH has not been elucidated. Our analysis shows that the analogous mutation of the mouse Glis3 abrogates the transcription activity of the factor, consistent with localization of the activation domain at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Furthermore, Glis3-NDH1 acts as a dominant negative factor when expressed together with wild-type Glis3 in insulinoma cells and NIH3T3 cells. The putative mechanism is that Glis3-NDH1 binds to DNA and competes with the wild-type Glis3, but cannot activate transcription. We speculate that the NDH1 mutant protein might profoundly affect wild-type Glis3 function during early pancreas development.</p><p>In addition to direct effects on insulin promoter activity, we showed that Glis3 is capable of interacting with other key &#x003b2;-cell-specific transcription factors. MafA is a crucial factor for the assembly and function of the insulin gene transcription complex. Previous studies have shown that Pdx1, MafA and NeuroD1 synergistically activate the insulin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). Our present results show that Glis3 physically interacts with Pdx1, MafA and NeuroD1 in co-precipitation experiments. In addition, Glis3 shows cooperative interactions with Pdx1, MafA and NeuroD1 for insulin promoter activation. These results lead us to conclude that Glis3 modulates insulin gene expression, both directly through binding to the insulin promoter and indirectly by modulating the activity of other &#x003b2;-cell-enriched transcription factors.</p><p>Manipulation of Glis3 levels through stable overexpression or siRNA knock-down also affected the levels of several other Glis3 target genes in &#x003b2; cells, including MafA, Nkx6-1 and Pax6. Therefore, Glis3 also may modulate insulin gene transcription indirectly through changes in the levels of these factors. The mRNA expression of MafA was upregulated in Glis3-overexpressing cells, and downregulated in Glis3-knockdown cells, suggesting that MafA could be a Glis3 target gene. Nkx6-1 is initially expressed broadly in the developing pancreatic bud, but eventually is restricted exclusively to &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). It has been shown that Nkx6-1 can repress insulin promoter activity in &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Nkx6-1 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated by Glis3 overexpression, and upregulated in cells treated with Glis3 siRNA. Thus, Nkx6-1 could be another mediator of Glis3 action in &#x003b2; cells. Pax6 works through the C2 element of the rat Ins1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Similar to Nkx6-1, Pax6 was decreased in Glis3-overexpressing &#x003b2; cells and increased in Glis3-knockdown cells. We only find that Glis3-NDH1 inhibits wild-type Glis3 when co-expressed during transient transfection. We do not see Glis3-NDH1 inhibition of MafA expression or stimulation of expression of Nkx6-1 and Pax-6 when overexpressed in 832/13 cells. Whether authentic Glis3RE sequences are present in the 5&#x02032; regulatory regions of the genes for the affected factors and will require further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that Glis3 regulates insulin gene transcription in a cell line derived from &#x003b2; cells. Furthermore, we have identified a 15-bp sequence of the Ins2 promoter required for Glis3 binding, and this sequence is highly conserved among mouse, rat and human, underscoring its role in insulin gene regulation. Our data indicate that Glis3 can act in concert with other known insulin gene transactivators, such as Pdx1, MafA and NeuroD1. Finally, Glis3 expression also may modulate insulin gene transcription by effects on the levels of other &#x003b2;-cell-enriched transcription factors such as MafA, Nkx6-1 and Pax6.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp122/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>US <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</grant-sponsor> grant <grant-num>DK-68037</grant-num> (to L.C.); the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center (P30DK079638); the Rutherford Chair from St Luke's Episcopal Hospital; T.T. &#x00026; W.F.
