The recombinant ST0753 protein exhibited RNase H activity in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. The protein expressed in an RNase H-deficient mutant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain functioned to suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype associated with the lack of RNase H. The <italic>in vitro</italic> characteristics of the gene's RNase H activity were similar to those of <italic>Halobacterium</italic> RNase HI, the first archaeal Type 1 RNase H to be characterized.

The result of gel filtration column chromatography showed this double-stranded RNA-dependent RNase (dsRNase) activity was coincident with <italic>S.tokodaii</italic> RNase HI. A site-directed mutagenesis study of essential amino acids for RNase H activity indicated that this activity also affected dsRNase activity. A single amino acid replacement of Asp-125 by Asn resulted in loss of dsRNase activity but not RNase H activity, suggesting that amino acid residues required for dsRNase activity seemed slightly different from those of RNase H activity. Some reverse transcriptases from retroelements can cleave double-stranded RNA, and this activity requires the RNase H domain.

Based on differences in their amino acid sequences, RNases H are classified into two types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c3">3</xref>). Type 1 enzymes are <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase HI orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c4">4</xref>), and Type 2 enzymes are <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HII orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c5">5</xref>). Type 1 RNases H also include retroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs), because these RTs contain amino acid sequences and structures showing high similarity to <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI as a domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c6">6</xref>). The RNase H domain of RT is required to convert the single-stranded retroviral RNA genome into double-stranded DNA, and is therefore essential for retroviral proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c7">7</xref>). On the other hand, various studies suggest that cellular RNases H are involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c12">12</xref>). Furthermore, as deletion of the Type 1 RNase H-encoding gene results in embryonic lethality in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c13">13</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c14">14</xref>), the former being due to an inability to amplify mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c13">13</xref>), cellular RNases H are also required for development. However, the physiological functions of cellular RNases H that contain both Type 1 and Type 2 are not yet completely understood. The genomes of all organisms have one to a few RNase H genes, and it has been reported that most archaea have a single Type 2 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c3">3</xref>). Therefore, the Type 2 enzymes are thought to be the more universal RNase H type. Recently, the first archaeal Type 1 RNase H gene was identified from the <italic>Halobacterium</italic> sp. NRC-1 genome, and its encoded protein was characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>). The <italic>Halobacterium</italic> Type 1 RNase H (Halo-RNase HI) exhibits RNase H activity both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Its unique characteristics&#x02014;the lack of a basic protrusion region in the primary structure, cleavage at the RNA&#x02013;DNA junction and activity in the absence of His residue&#x02014;are more similar to those of the RNase H domain of retroviral RT than to those of cellular Type 1 RNase H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>). Halo-RNase HI homologs are found also in two other archaeal genomes: the ST0753 gene from <italic>Sulfolobus tokodaii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c16">16</xref>) and the PAE1792 gene from <italic>Pyrobaculum aerophilum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c17">17</xref>). These three archaeal RNase HI homologs show significant amino acid sequence similarities to each other. However, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f1">1</xref>, Halo-RNase HI and PAE1792 possess an N-terminal extension and a C-terminal extension, respectively, but ST0753 lacks both. Because the RNase H activities of ST0753 and PAE1792 have not been reported, it is unclear whether the differences in their primary structures affect their activities, or even whether they encode active enzymes. In the present study, therefore, we analyzed the ST0753 gene from <italic>S.tokodaii</italic> in order to gain more information on archaeal RNase HI.</p><p>The ST0753 gene was cloned and the recombinant ST0753 protein overexpressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> was purified and analyzed. As expected, the recombinant protein exhibited RNase H activity both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Surprisingly, however, the protein cleaved not only an RNA strand of RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrid but also a double-strand of RNA. In this report, we show that this double-stranded RNA-dependent RNase (dsRNase) activity results from the ST0753 (Sto-RNase HI) protein, and assess the involvement of various conserved amino acid residues in hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells, plasmids and materials</title><p>The <italic>S.tokodaii</italic> strain 7 genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c16">16</xref>) was kindly donated by Professor A.

This solution was applied to a column (4 ml) of P-11 (Whatman) equilibrated with TE buffer, and proteins were eluted from the column by linearly increasing the NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.5 M. The protein fractions at an NaCl concentration of 0.3 M were pooled and dialyzed against 5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The dialyzed solution was applied to a column (4 ml) of hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HT gel (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA) equilibrated with 5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), followed by elution from the column by a linear gradient of sodium phosphate from 5 to 200 mM. Fractions containing the protein were combined (at approximately 140 mM sodium phosphate), concentrated, dialyzed against TE buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT, and used for further analyses.</p><p>The protein concentration was determined by measuring UV absorption using <italic>A</italic><sub>280</sub><sup>0.1%</sup> values of 0.97 for Sto-RNase HI, which was calculated from &#x0025b; values of 1576 M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for Tyr and 5225 M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for Trp at 280 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage reactions</title><p>The 5&#x02032; end-labeled 12 b RNA (5&#x02032;-cggagaugacgg-3&#x02032;) and the 3&#x02032; end-labeled 18 b RNA9-DNA (5&#x02032;-uugcaugccTGCAGGTCG-3&#x02032;), and their complementary DNAs were chemically synthesized by Proligo (Paris, France).

Although the ST0753 protein was annotated as a hypothetical protein, it shows 32% amino acid sequence identity to a newly identified archaeal RNase HI from <italic>Halobacterium</italic> sp. NRC-1 (Halo-RNase HI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f1">1</xref>). However, the ST0753 protein lacks amino acid sequences that would correspond to an N-terminal extension of Halo-RNase HI. Among the five active site residues&#x02014;Asp-10, Glu-48, Asp-70, His-124 and Asp-134&#x02014;identified in <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c18">18</xref>), only four acidic residues were conserved in the ST0753. Although this protein contains no His residue in its amino acid sequence, we expected it to exhibit RNase H activity, based on our previous report that His residues were not important for the catalytic function of Halo-RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>).</p><p>To obtain the ST0753 protein in an amount sufficient for enzymatic and biochemical analyses, expression in <italic>E.coli</italic> MIC2067(DE3) was used thereby eliminating any contribution of RNases HI and HII. The protein was purified to homogeneity as described in Materials and Methods. As shown later, the protein exhibits RNase H activity both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and in consideration of its amino acid sequence similarity to Halo-RNase HI, we hereafter refer to the ST0753 gene as <italic>S.tokodaii rnhA</italic> (<italic>Sto-rnhA</italic>) and to its encoding protein as RNase HI (Sto-RNase HI).</p></sec><sec><title>RNase H activity of Sto-RNase HI</title><p>To examine whether or not Sto-RNase HI shows RNase H activity, the purified proteins were incubated with a 12-bp oligomeric RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrid. Sto-RNase HI cleaved an RNA strand of the 12-bp RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrid at multiple sites only in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Co<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, but not in the presence of Cu<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, or in the absence of divalent metal ions. The level of Sto-RNase HI activity peaked at concentrations of 1 mM for MnCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CoCl<sub>2</sub>, and at a concentration of 100 mM for NiCl<sub>2</sub> (data not shown). The cleavage patterns are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f2">2</xref>A. Sto-RNase HI preferred MnCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> to CoCl<sub>2</sub> and NiCl<sub>2</sub>, with shorter reaction products resulted from multiple cleavages in the presence of MnCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f2">2</xref>A). The cleavage activity of Sto-RNase HI increased exponentially as the pH increased from 6 to 10 (data not shown). However, the standard cleavage reaction was performed at a pH of 8.5 in the presence of 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> or MnCl<sub>2</sub>, because at a higher pH range, the solubility of divalent metal ions decreases and RNA&#x0002f;DNA substrates might become destabilized. In Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh917tb2">2</xref>, the specific activities of Sto-RNase HI in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> are compared with those of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI and another archaeal Type 1 RNase H, Halo-RNase HI. In the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, the specific activity of the Sto-RNase HI was 3.6-fold higher and 11-fold lower than those of Halo-RNase HI and <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI, respectively. In the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, the specific activities of these three enzymes were almost the same.</p><p>Halo-RNase HI can cleave an RNA&#x02013;DNA junction (a junction between the 3&#x02032; side of RNA and the 5&#x02032; side of DNA) of an RNA&#x02013;DNA&#x0002f;DNA oligomeric substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>). To check whether or not Sto-RNase HI can also cleave the RNA&#x02013;DNA junction, the same substrate, RNA9&#x02013;DNA&#x0002f;DNA, was examined for Sto-RNase HI. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f3">3</xref>, the Sto-RNase HI cleaved the RNA&#x02013;DNA junction of the substrate, in a manner similar to that of Halo-RNase HI, while <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme could not cleave it as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>). This implies that the cleavage of the RNA&#x02013;DNA junction might be a common feature of archaeal Type 1 RNases H. It also suggests that Sto-RNase HI might involve in the removal of RNA primers from the Okazaki fragment as described for Halo-RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Double-stranded RNA cleavage</title><p>A series of 12mers of single-stranded RNA and DNA, double-stranded RNA and DNA, and RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrid labeled at the 5&#x02032; end of the DNA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh917tb1">1</xref>) were incubated with the enzyme in the presence of 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> or MnCl<sub>2</sub>. Sto-RNase HI did not cleave any of the substrates in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. However, the enzyme cleaved the double-stranded RNA in the presence of MnCl<sub>2</sub> as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f2">2</xref>B. This double-stranded RNA-dependent RNase (dsRNase) activity was always detected for the purified Sto-RNase HI protein in several separate experiments. The cleavage patterns of the RNA&#x0002f;RNA duplex in the presence of 1 mM CoCl<sub>2</sub> or 100 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub> indicated that the duplex was degraded not only in the presence of MnCl<sub>2</sub> but also in that of CoCl<sub>2</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f2">2</xref>B).</p><p>To prove an association between Sto-RNase HI and dsRNase activity, the purified protein was further fractionated by gel filtration column chromatography.

It was established by perfect association of the dsRNase activity to the Sto-RNase HI enzyme during gel filtration and results of site-directed mutagenesis. The RNase H activity was observed in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Co<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, whereas the dsRNase activity was observed only in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Co<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f2">2</xref>). The dsRNase activity was approximately 10- to 100-fold lower than the RNase H activity in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f4">4</xref>). All reported cellular RNases H that contain both Type 1 and Type 2 enzymes, which specifically cleave the RNA strand of RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrids. Therefore, the Sto-RNase HI is the first cellular RNase H that has been found to have dsRNase activity.</p><p>Despite amino acid sequence similarity with Sto-RNase HI, Halo-RNase HI, the first characterized archaeal Type 1 RNase H, does not cleave an RNA&#x0002f;RNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>). The most remarkable difference between the two archaeal enzymes is the N-terminal extension of Halo-RNase HI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f1">1</xref>). Enzymatic characteristics&#x02014;the divalent metal ion preference, activity&#x02013;pH profile, specific activity and RNA&#x02013;DNA junction cleavage&#x02014;of RNase H activity of Sto-RNase HI were similar to those of Halo-RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>), suggesting that the N-terminal extension of Halo-RNase HI might not be critical for RNase H activity. On the other hand, a failure to express the recombinant N-terminal deletion mutant of Halo-RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>) prevents examining the influence of the N-terminus of Halo-RNase HI on the dsRNase activity. At present, we have not identified what factors are responsible for this difference between the two enzymes. To clarify the factors, further site-directed mutagenesis and structural analyses need to be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Catalytic mechanisms</title><p>In <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI, one histidine and four acidic residues&#x02014;Asp-10, Glu-48, Asp-70, His-124 and Asp-134, constitute the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c18">18</xref>), and catalytic mechanisms in one Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c29">29</xref>), one Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c30">30</xref>) and two Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c30">30</xref>) have been proposed. These five residues are highly conserved in Type 1 RNases H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c3">3</xref>), and biochemical studies with <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI and HIV-1 RT have indicated that only the first three acidic residues are critical for catalysis of RNase H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c34">34</xref>). The results of site-directed mutagenesis suggest that RNase H catalyses of Sto-RNase HI would be similar to those proposed in other Type 1 RNases H. A possible involvement of Asp-125 in RNase H catalysis cannot be ruled out despite the result in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f5">5</xref>B, since corresponding Asp in <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI and HIV-1 RT is dispensable under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c34">34</xref>). On the other hand, the absence of a His in the Sto-RNase HI indicates a different source for activation of an attacking H<sub>2</sub>O molecule from that suggested for <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c18">18</xref>). It agrees with Halo-RNase HI, which has no functional His for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>).</p><p>The Sto-RNase HI mutant proteins, D7N, E52Q and D76N, lost both RNase H and dsRNase activities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f5">5</xref>A), suggesting that the first three conserved acidic residues were also important for dsRNase activity. On the other hand, the mutant protein D125N lost only the dsRNase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f5">5</xref>B). Amino acid residues required for dsRNase activity seems to be slightly different from those for RNase H activity. Why, then, this fourth conserved acidic residue Asp-125 is critical for only the dsRNase activity? <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI contains two Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c35">35</xref>). Of the two Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding sites, site 1 is formed by Asp-10, Glu-48 and Asp-70, and site 2 is formed by Asp-70 and Asp-134 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c35">35</xref>). According to an activation&#x0002f;attenuation model, binding of one Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion at site 1 is required for enzyme activation and binding of a second Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion at site 2 is inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c36">36</xref>). Replacing Asp-134 of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI with Asn results in a loss of this Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c30">30</xref>), probably due to the deficiency of site 2. These observations on <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI bring us an idea that Sto-RNase HI might require two Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions to exhibit its dsRNase activity. Therefore, the mutant protein D125N might show no dsRNase activity because of inability to bind the second Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion at site 2. If so, an optimal MnCl<sub>2</sub> concentration for dsRNase activity will be higher than that of 1 mM for RNase H activity. However, it has not been clearly demonstrated, because Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is not fully soluble under the standard reaction condition of alkaline pH at such a high concentration (&#x0003e;10 mM). Furthermore, the optimal MnCl<sub>2</sub> concentration for RNase H activity of Sto-RNase HI is 1000-fold higher than that for <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c30">30</xref>), suggesting that the binding affinity of a Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion to site 1 of Sto-RNase HI might be much lower than that of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI. This low affinity also makes it harder to confirm the Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent activation&#x0002f;attenuation in Sto-RNase HI. In <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI, a second Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion does not bind at site 2, probably because the binding affinity of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is much lower than that of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c30">30</xref>). If it is also true for Sto-RNase HI, the binding affinities of second metal ions may explain why the enzyme exhibits the dsRNase activity in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and does not in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p><p>There is an interesting report on an RNase H domain of RT from Ty3 retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c37">37</xref>). In the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, site 2 inability mutants show more specific cleavages than wild type does, similarly to wild type in Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c37">37</xref>). Therefore, amino acid residues constituting site 2, in one-metal form, have been guessed to interact with substrate to ensure that the RNA strand of RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrid is positioned appropriately for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c37">37</xref>). Probably, in two-metal form, it is unlikely that the residues would involve in positioning the substrate because of a second metal ion binding. Based on these interpretations, in Sto-RNase HI, relaxed substrate-positioning (or recognition) in two-metal form might be expected to allow an RNA&#x0002f;RNA duplex exposed to catalysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation with the RNase H domain of RT</title><p>Interestingly, the RTs of retroviruses, HIV-1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), as well as retrotransposon Tf1, degrade RNA of the RNA&#x0002f;RNA duplex in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and the activity called RNase H<sup>&#x0002a;</sup> is derived from the RNase H domain of the RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c42">42</xref>). This <italic>in vitro</italic> RNase H<sup>&#x0002a;</sup> activity for HIV-1 RT was shown to be 30-fold lower than the cleavage activity against RNA of RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c40">40</xref>). The preference for metals and the relative activity of dsRNase against RNase H of RT are similar to those characterized in Sto-RNase HI. Although it is unclear whether RNase H<sup>&#x0002a;</sup> activity has a role in the retroviral life cycle or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c41">41</xref>), the activity of retrotransposon Tf1 RT has been proposed to generate a primer for copying the genomic RNA by cleaving the end of the double-stranded RNA in the self-primed reverse transcription model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c43">43</xref>). However, since Sto-RNase HI exists independently as an active RNase H enzyme, not as a domain of RT in the genome, it seems unlikely that the dsRNase activity of Sto-RNase HI is connected with reverse transcription in <italic>S.tokodaii</italic> cells. The physiological functions of the dsRNase, and even the RNase H activities of Sto-RNase HI remain to be determined.</p><p>The second metal ion binding site (site 2) inability mutations are lethal for transposition of Ty3 retrotransposon on account of a failure to support DNA strand transfer and release of the polypurine tract from RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c37">37</xref>). It allows us wondering about participation of dsRNase activity in the transposition event, because RTs of retroelements often exhibit dsRNase activity although the activity of Ty3 RT has not been reported yet.</p></sec><sec><title>Sto-RNase HI homologs and their origin</title><p>As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh917tb3">3</xref>, archaeal Type 1 RNase H-like genes are found in various organisms, and some of them show RNase H activity.

The basic protrusion region is found to be important for substrate binding in <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c44">44</xref>), but not essential for RNase H activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c45">45</xref>). In fact, the RNase H domains of RTs of HIV and the Gypsy family of retrotransposons lack the basic protrusion region but show RNase H activity. This basic protrusion deletion is a major primary structural feature characterized in many RTs.</p><p>Archaeal enzyme can cleave the RNA&#x02013;DNA junction of the Okazaki fragment-like substrate, just as HIV-1 RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c46">46</xref>) and Ty3 RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c37">37</xref>) can. Furthermore, Sto-RNase HI exhibits a dsRNase activity possessed by the RTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c42">42</xref>). These common features between archaeal RNase HI and the RNase H of the retroelement lead us to conjecture that archaeal Type 1 RNases H might be derived by the horizontal gene transfer through the RT of a retroelement. The phylogenetic tree of active Type 1 RNases H is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh917f6">6</xref>. Although the archaeal RNase HI homologs, listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh917tb3">3</xref>, cannot be proposed to be closely related to the RTs, they do construct the different cluster from bacterial RNase HI and eukaryotic RNase H1. It is worth noting that Sto-RNase HI and Halo-RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c15">15</xref>) are active, while only the RNase H domain of RT of the retroelement is inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh917c48">48</xref>). Therefore, analyses of the Sto-RNase HI as a model for the RNase H of retroelements, especially HIV-1, will provide much useful information on the inhibition of RNase H of HIV-1 for AIDS therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_19_5809__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_19_5809__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh917f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Multiple alignments of Type 1 RNases H.
