The trajectory of the CST from the cortex to the spinal cord involves a succession of choice points (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), each of which is controlled independently, often by different sets of molecules (comprehensively reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of the corticospinal tract (CST) trajectory. The course of the CST is shown in <bold>(a) </bold>a sagittal view of the mouse brain (black line) and in <bold>(b) </bold>a three-dimensional schematic of the medulla (red line). (a) The CST begins in the motor cortex (mcx), where layer V neurons project axons through the internal capsule (ic) and cerebral peduncles (cp) to the level of the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB), just rostral to the pontine nuclei (pn), where they turn medially and ventrally to project along the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata (mo) as the pyramidal tracts. Within the caudal medulla the CST is surrounded laterally and dorsally by the inferior olives (not shown but visible in Figures 2d and 6). (b) At the boundary between the medulla and the spinal cord CST axons turn dorsally and cross the midline, forming the pyramidal decussation and subsequently project caudally into the dorsal funiculus (df).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-8104-3-34-1"/></fig><p>Genetic analyses have revealed a number of specific choice points that are particularly vulnerable to genetic lesions, most probably because they involve sudden deviations in trajectory, crossing borders between embryonic compartments or departure from larger nerve pathways. For example, defects in the guidance of corticofugal projections, including CST axons, have been observed in various mutants in the initial projections from the cortex across the pallial-subpallial boundary (<italic>Celsr3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], <italic>Frizzled-3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], <italic>Pax6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]), within the internal capsule (<italic>Ctip2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]) and across the telencephalic-diencephalic border into the cerebral peduncles (<italic>Nkx2-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], <italic>Slits </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], <italic>Robos </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). <italic>Ctip2 </italic>mutants also display defects in CST projections more caudally, at the level of the pons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A number of other mutants cause defects in CST projections in the hindbrain, especially at the junction of the medulla and spinal cord, where they form the pyramidal decussation. At this point, CST axons, which have been extending caudally in a ventral position near the midline, project dorsally and across the midline (forming an X, hence 'decus', from the Roman numeral) to join the dorsal funiculus, where they resume their caudal course. A variety of defects in CST projections at this region are observed in mutants of <italic>L1CAM </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], <italic>EphA4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], <italic>NCAM </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and <italic>netrin-1 </italic>or netrin receptor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Such defects are often, though not always, associated with hypoplasia of the CST, presumably due to secondary degeneration of mistargeted axons.</p><p>Understanding the molecular control of CST guidance is of clinical importance in two ways. First, a number of hereditary neurological disorders involve aberrant development and/or progressive degeneration of the CST, which generally results in spastic paraplegia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. For example, in L1 syndrome, caused by mutations in <italic>L1CAM </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], spasticity is due to CST hypoplasia, which is probably a result of a CST guidance defect at the pyramidal decussation, as seen in L1-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Joubert syndrome, which can be caused by mutations in five known genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], is also characterised by a failure of CST axons to decussate normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, a recent study suggests that CST development may be compromised in adolescent-onset schizophrenia, which commonly involves motor symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Second, the elucidation of the developmental programme controlling CST axon guidance is highly relevant to the development of strategies to promote regeneration of spinal nerves following injury or degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus, guidance molecules with known functions in CST development have later been reported to improve CST regeneration after their manipulation in animal models for spinal cord injury, including L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and EphA4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Semaphorins have been implicated in the control of multiple aspects of neural development, including cell migration, axon guidance, dendritogenesis and many others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Though secreted class 3 semaphorins have been better studied, transmembrane semaphorins, especially of class 6, have attracted recent interest with the discoveries that they are important mediators <italic>in vivo </italic>of axon guidance and cell migration in many different parts of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. These functions seem to be mediated by direct and specific binding to members of the PlxnA subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. There is good evidence that these transmembrane semaphorins and their invertebrate orthologues can also function as receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Analyses of <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants have highlighted the important role of this molecule in cell migration and axon guidance in many parts of the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and the complicated, context-dependent nature of its interactions with PlxnA2 and PlxnA4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>Here, we identify defects in CST axon guidance in <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants at the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB) and in navigation over the pontine nuclei that dramatically affect how many axons arrive to the hindbrain and spinal cord. We also observe defects in the caudal medulla where many axons spread laterally, resulting in a failure to decussate. The latter role seems to be mediated by the known Sema6A receptor PlxnA4, but the former appears independent of this and of the other known receptor, PlxnA2, and may depend on early expression of Sema6A on CST axons themselves. These data identify Sema6A as a major contributor to the guidance of CST axons at multiple choice points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Hypoplasia and misrouting of the corticospinal tract in adult <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants</title><p>Mutants in <italic>Sema6A </italic>were generated in a gene trap screen and have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].

In contrast, in many <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants (four out of nine) the CST was not visible as the medullar pyramids macroscopically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). In other mutants (five out of nine), the pyramids remained visible macroscopically, that is, they appeared as a tight bundle at the surface, but their size was reduced to various degrees between animals as well as between pyramids on either side of individuals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Moderate to severe hypoplasia and misrouting of the corticospinal tract (CST) in adult <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants. <bold>(a-c) </bold>Macroscopic view of the ventral medulla in adult <italic>Sema6A</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>Sema6A</italic><sup>-/- </sup>animals.

In the <italic>Sema6A</italic><sup>+/- </sup>brain (a, d, g, j), the pyramidal tracts run close to the midline at the ventral surface of the medulla (black arrowhead in (a, d)) and disappear from macroscopic view at the level of the decussation, where they turn dorsally (black arrow in (g)) to enter the dorsal funiculus (white arrowhead in (j)). The middle column (b, e, h, k) shows an example of a <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutant with severe hypoplasia of the CST. In these severe cases the CST is not visible as the medullar pyramids macroscopically (b). Within the medulla the few remaining axons do not run at the surface but deeper, embedded within the inferior olive (black arrowhead in (e)). These fibres mostly decussate correctly (black arrow in (h)) and enter the dorsal funiculus of the spinal cord (white arrowhead in (k)). The right column (c, f, i, l) shows another mutant where the size of the pyramids is reduced to different degrees on either side, but remains visible macroscopically as a tight bundle at the surface (black arrowheads in (c, f)). At the caudal olive the majority of axons track away from the midline and are midway towards the lateral border at the level of the decussation (black arrowheads in (c); asterisks, green arrowheads in (i)). Here they do not decussate but proceed down the spinal cord in a ventrolateral position (asterisks in (l)). A small portion of CST axons that remain close to the midline up to the level of decussation cross contralaterally and dorsally (black arrow in (i)).

In adults, Sema6A, and thus PLAP, is strongly expressed in oligodendrocytes. Therefore, staining for PLAP labels all myelinated fibres in adults with one or both mutant alleles. The stainings confirmed a wide range in severity of CST size reduction and showed a reasonably smooth distribution in severity across the mutants analysed, including those that had no macroscopically visible CST. In addition, PLAP stainings revealed defects of the remaining CST axons. Instead of running at the surface of the medulla as a tightly fasciculated bundle as seen in <italic>Sema6A</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d, g, j</xref>), they were often split into several bundles that ran either normally at the surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>) or aberrantly deeper within the medulla (that is, at the rostrocaudal level of the inferior olive, they are embedded within the olive; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>, arrowhead). More strikingly, at the caudal olive a variable proportion of the remaining CST axons projected away from the midline towards the ventrolateral spinal cord (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2i</xref>; but also detectable macroscopically when the CST remained visible at the surface, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>, arrowheads). Such axons failed to decussate and instead proceeded down the spinal cord in a ventrolateral position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2l</xref>, asterisk).

Another possibility is that hypoplasia of the tract at the level of the medulla is due to fewer axons reaching that point in the first place; that is, that there is an additional choice point along the CST trajectory at which axons are misguided and fail to proceed down the spinal cord. To test these ideas we traced the CST during its development, that is, at postnatal day (P)4, when the majority of CST axons have just arrived in the spinal cord.</p><p>Placement of small crystals of the lipophilic dye DiI into the motor cortex of P4 post-mortem brains effectively labelled the descending CST (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

In the ventral projection over the pontine nuclei the tract appeared split into a couple of bundles.

At this stage, CST axons stain positively for PLAP in Sema6A gene trap embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a, a'</xref>). This is far prior to the onset of myelination, demonstrating that neurons that give rise to the CST normally express Sema6A in late embryogenesis. To examine the distribution of the Sema6A protein itself, we performed immunohistochemistry on sections from E17.5 and P1 brains, using a commercially available polyclonal antibody against murine Sema6A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b&#x02013;q</xref>), which we proved to be specific for Sema6A by comparing stainings on wild-type and Sema6A mutant brain sections (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). At E17.5, we observed Sema6A-immunopositive corticofugal fibres at the level of the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>), and positive CST axons at the level of the MHB and pons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Sema6A was also expressed in the MHB region by the pontine nuclei (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c&#x02013;h</xref>).

Although both PlxnA2 and PlxnA4 are expressed by neurons in deep layer V of motor cortex (the origin of the CST), <italic>PlxnA2 </italic>mutants do not show any defects in the CST. <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>mutants show the same phenotype as <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants in the caudal medulla but neither <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>single nor <italic>PlxnA2;PlxnA4 </italic>double mutants show a defect at the MHB. Expression data suggest that the defect at the MHB may reflect a requirement for expression of Sema6A on CST axons themselves at early embryonic stages. They also implicate the inferior olives as an important source of guidance cues, which act to constrain the CST axons near the midline of the medulla where they can respond to cues for decussation. This model has implications for the interpretation of CST defects observed in other mutants, which we discuss below.</p><sec><title>Guidance at the mid-hindbrain boundary</title><p>The phenotypes observed in <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants identify the MHB as a major choice point, or series of choice points, for CST axons. In fact, CST axons must perform rather complicated manoeuvres to successfully navigate this region and reach the hindbrain. First, exiting the cerebral peduncle at the caudal end of the midbrain, the CST turns sharply from a longitudinal direction towards the midline. Before reaching the midline, it must subsequently turn from this transverse direction ventrally to course over the pons. In parallel, the CST must partially defasciculate to allow collateral branching into the pons while retaining directional projection to reach and refasciculate at the ventral surface of the medulla and form the pyramids. Defects in each of these events can be observed in <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants, thus identifying Sema6A as the first guidance molecule controlling CST trajectory at the MHB. Mutations in <italic>Ctip2</italic>, which encodes a transcription factor expressed in CST neurons, also result in defects at the MHB, where the tract is disorganised and defasciculated, with many axons failing to turn ventrally at the pons and no axons extending past the pons by P0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. While these phenotypes reinforce the notion of this region as a complicated point in the trajectory of CST axons, they are somewhat distinct from those observed in <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants.</p><p>We see a number of possible scenarios to explain the phenotypes observed. First, Sema6A could act directly in this region in canonical fashion as a repulsive ligand to constrain CST projections to an appropriate channel. This fits generally with the observation that Sema6A expression in this region seems to surround the CST. However, some of the phenotypes, such as midline crossing, are not obviously consistent with this model, given the absence of prominent midline expression of Sema6A. The apparent lack of involvement of the known Plxn receptors might also argue against it. Second, Sema6A could act as an attractive or permissive cue at this level. CST axons project in apposition to a number of pontine nuclei that are strongly Sema6A-positive. Changing responsiveness to guidance cues at different points of an axon's trajectory is a common mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], which has been observed directly with semaphorins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. The importance of Sema6A expression in pontine nuclei is, however, called into question by analyses of mutants in <italic>Netrin-1 </italic>or its receptor, <italic>deleted in colorectal cancer </italic>(<italic>DCC</italic>). In these mice, the pontine nuclei and pontine reticular nuclei fail to condense due to defects in cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. While these mice show defects in CST guidance in the hindbrain (see below) they do not show any defects in CST guidance at the MHB. These findings suggest that the phenotype at the MHB in <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants may instead be due to a lack of Sema6A expression on CST axons themselves during late embryogenesis. Sema6A could act in CST axons as a receptor for some unknown ligand in surrounding cells or, acting either as a ligand or a receptor (or both), could mediate axon-axon interactions that are important for proper guidance at this level. The orthologous <italic>Drosophila </italic>gene <italic>Sema-1a </italic>appears to function in such a fashion in motor axon guidance by setting an appropriate level of fasciculation between motor axons, allowing them to respond to guidance cues at specific choice points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p><p>Our analyses at early postnatal stages indicate that the defects at this point are the most likely cause of the CST hypoplasia observed in adult <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants. This is based on several observations: first, in none of the traced mutants did we see a gross difference in the number of CST axons arriving to the MHB at early postnatal stages. Although smaller defects within the forebrain might have been left undetected, we consider this possibility unlikely to be able to account for the significant hypoplasia observed. Second, many CST axons take widely divergent routes at this point and fail to enter the hindbrain. The failure to connect with appropriate targets is likely to result in the degeneration of these axons, which are not detected at later stages, and consequently the death of layer V cells themselves. Indeed, we do not observe any obvious derailed PLAP-stained CST fibres in the MHB region of adult <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutant brains (data not shown). Third, <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>mutant mice show similar defects as <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants in the caudal medulla, but no defects at the MHB and no hypoplasia of the CST. The later defect within the caudal medulla, which is shared between <italic>Sema6A </italic>and <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>mutants, is thus unlikely to contribute to the observed hypoplasia in <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants. In fact, many axons that adopt a ventrolateral route within the hindbrain and spinal cord in <italic>Sema6A </italic>and <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>mutants persist into adulthood, and have in <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants been independently shown to contact appropriate targets in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Guidance within the medulla</title><p>Of the axons that make it to the pyramidal decussation point in <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants, some decussate normally and join the dorsal funiculus, while many take up an abnormal ventrolateral position and continue to project caudally on the ipislateral side. The relative proportions of axons that show this phenotype is somewhat variable, in both <italic>Sema6A </italic>and <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>mutants. Whether this reflects stochastic variation or some molecular distinction between subtypes of axons is not clear. The CST is thought to be pioneered by a small number of axons, with the majority of axons following these, possibly responding more to fasciculation cues on the surface of these axons than to guidance cues in the environment. Small variations in the number of pioneer axons adopting either of the alternative routes might thus be passively transmitted to the follower axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. While the phenotype is most apparent at the decussation itself, in fact the CST axons begin to spread laterally before this point, that is, at the level of the inferior olive. Sema6A is no longer detected on CST axons at this stage but is strongly expressed in the inferior olives, while PlxnA4 is expressed by the CST neurons. This suggests that Sema6A may normally act as a repulsive cue in the olives to constrain CST axons near the midline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Failure to turn dorsally and cross the midline at the normal decussation point may thus be indirect and simply reflect the fact that these axons are no longer situated in a position to respond to the normal medial cues that promote decussation.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>A model for corticospinal tract (CST) guidance at the inferior olive (io) and decussation. CST axons (blue) express PlxnA4. At the level of the olive they are constrained medially in wild-type animals by the expression of Sema6A (cyan, top left). (Note that the olives also express PlxnA4.) Further caudally, this allows the CST axons to respond to cues for decussation (bottom left). In <italic>Sema6A </italic>or <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>mutants (right) the CST axons are not constrained by the inferior olives and a proportion of axons adopt a more lateral position or extend within the olives themselves (top right).

Those that remain near the midline may decussate normally.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-8104-3-34-10"/></fig><p>A very similar phenotype has been reported in a number of mutants affecting Netrin signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In <italic>Unc5c </italic>(formerly <italic>Unc5h3</italic>) mutants, a reduced decussation is observed, with a substantial proportion of axons projecting ventrolaterally. This is preceded in the hindbrain by a lateral broadening of the descending CST, rostral to the level of the decussation. The CST eventually splits into two distinct domains, one close to the midline, which decussates, and one more lateral, which continues to project ipsilaterally. Mutants in <italic>netrin-1 </italic>and a viable mutant of <italic>DCC </italic>show similar phenotypes. These were interpreted as evidence for a direct role of Netrin-1, which is expressed at the midline in the region of the decussation, as a guidance factor for CST axons at this choice point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the involvement of Unc5c, which normally mediates repulsion from sources of Netrin-1, complicates this interpretation. Our results suggest an alternative model, which is that the decussation defect in CST guidance is secondary to the profound defect in the migration of inferior olivary neurons observed in these mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. This would be consistent with the lateral broadening of the CST prior to the decussation point in these mutants. Our data suggest that the CST is normally actively hemmed in by the inferior olive, molecularly mediated by Sema6A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). If this structure is not formed properly, or if it lacks Sema6A expression, then CST axons will spread laterally and will not decussate properly. (Notably, the olive forms normally in <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants.) Interestingly, defects in the formation of the inferior olivary nuclei have also been noted in Joubert syndrome, where pyramidal decussation of the CST also fails to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>A similar phenotype is observed in <italic>NCAM </italic>mutants, where a proportion of CST axons adopts a ventrolateral position, while the rest project dorsally and either cross the midline normally or join the ipsilateral dorsal funiculus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this case, the laterally misrouted axons are detectable at early postnatal stages but do not persist in adults. The cellular basis of this phenotype is not entirely clear; it could involve a disruption of the homophilic fasciculation of follower axons on pioneers or the involvement of NCAM in mediating responses to other guidance cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. In addition, the integrity of the olive in <italic>NCAM </italic>mutants has not been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of plexins</title><p>Sema6A has two known binding partners, PlxnA2 and PlxnA4, which have been shown to act as receptors for Sema6A or as antagonists to Sema6A in different contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].

Sema6A is expressed on CST axons at early stages but is not detected at perinatal stages, when CST axons are navigating through the hindbrain. At these stages it is expressed more selectively in upper layer V of M1. Analyses of <italic>PlxnA2 </italic>and <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>mutants suggest that PlxnA4 is the important player in the guidance of CST axons, while PlxnA2 has no essential function. <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>mutants show a qualitatively identical phenotype to <italic>Sema6A </italic>mutants at the level of the pyramidal decussation, although more axons reach that point in <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>mutants as they do not show any defects at the MHB. An abolished interaction of PlxnA4 and Sema6A is thus sufficient to explain the defect at the decussation choice point. The expression patterns of these molecules favour a classic mode of action in this context; that is, Sema6A acts as a guidance ligand for the receptor PlxnA4. Interestingly, an overlapping role for PlxnA3 in this process has also been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. These authors observed the presence of ventrolaterally projecting CST axons at low penetrance in either <italic>PlxnA3 </italic>or <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>single mutants but at very high penetrance in double mutants. However, PlxnA3 has not been shown to bind Sema6A directly.</p><p>Plexins are also well known co-receptors for secreted semaphorins, which have been indirectly implicated in CST axon guidance. As mentioned above, ablation of <italic>L1 </italic>in mice results in a failure of CST axons to decussate at the caudal medulla and, after correct contralateral or aberrant ipsilateral entry into the dorsal funiculus, to extend down the spinal cord beyond cervical levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In cortical slice cultures, wild-type but not L1-deficient cortical axons are repelled by Sema3A secreted from the ventral spinal cord and this repulsion requires formation of a co-receptor of L1 and neuropillin-1 (<italic>in cis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. In line with this idea, mice expressing L1 with a deleted homophilic binding site that leaves binding to neuropilin-1 intact show a normal CST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. However, direct involvement of Sema3A in CST guidance has not been demonstrated. In fact, recent analyses of <italic>Sema3A </italic>mutant mice did not reveal any CST guidance defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], indicating the involvement of other molecules in L1-mediated CST guidance at the pyramidal decussation. A lack of defects in <italic>neuropilin-1 </italic>mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] also suggests that transmembrane, rather than secreted semaphorins, may be the major players <italic>in vivo </italic>in CST guidance and that the phenotypes of <italic>Plxn </italic>mutants at this choice point reflect their role in direct signalling from transmembrane semaphorins.</p><p>The fact that neither the <italic>PlxnA2 </italic>nor the <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>single mutants have a CST defect at the MHB suggests either that Sema6A interacts with some other molecule at this choice point or that PlxnA4 and PlxnA2 compensate for each other. Analyses of double mutants of <italic>PlxnA2 </italic>and <italic>PlxnA4 </italic>did not reveal any additional defects at the MHB, however. <italic>PlxnA3;PlxnA4 </italic>double mutants also do not show any defect at the MHB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Though we can not rule out the possible involvement of PlxnA1 at this point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], or of additional redundancy between plexins, it seems most likely that the function of Sema6A at this choice point, whether due to expression on the CST axons and/or in the surrounding region, is either homophilic or involves an as yet unknown interacting partner.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings identify Sema6A as a major contributor to the guidance of CST axons at multiple choice points. They highlight the active nature of guidance at the MHB and pons and the possible importance of the inferior olive as a source of guidance information in the hindbrain. PlxnA4 is implicated as a receptor for Sema6A in the hindbrain but the functions of Sema6A at the MHB appear independent of its known interactors, and may be mediated by Sema6A expression in CST axons themselves at this stage. Finally, the involvement of Sema6A in the guidance of CST axons during development has implications for therapeutic approaches to stimulate regeneration of spinal nerves. In particular, the strong expression of Sema6A by oligodendrocytes may contribute substantially to the growth-inhibitory environment of the adult spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals and histology</title><p><italic>Sema6A </italic>mutant mice were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].
