However, NASP shares a high degree of sequence similarity with the N1/N2 family of proteins, whose members are H3/H4-specific histone chaperones. To resolve this paradox, we have performed a detailed and quantitative analysis of the binding specificity of human NASP. Our results confirm that NASP can interact with histone H1 and that this interaction occurs with high affinity. In addition, multiple <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, including native gel electrophoresis, traditional and affinity chromatography assays and surface plasmon resonance, all indicate that NASP also forms distinct, high specificity complexes with histones H3 and H4. The interaction between NASP and histones H3 and H4 is functional as NASP is active in <italic>in vitro</italic> chromatin assembly assays using histone substrates depleted of H1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is packaged into a highly ordered and regulated structure known as chromatin. The principal repeating element of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of &#x0223c;147 bp of DNA wrapped around the histone proteins: H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. The transit of histone proteins throughout the cell and their subsequent deposition into chromatin is facilitated by a collection of proteins known as histone chaperones.</p><p>Histone chaperones can be grouped into a large number of families based on sequence similarity. These include the nucleoplasmin, N1/N2, CAF-1, HIR, NAP1, Asf1, Rbap46/48, Rsf-1, FACT, nucleolin and Arp families of proteins. The defining characteristic of histone chaperones is their ability to bind histone proteins and they are often highly specific with regard to these interactions. For example, chaperones such as CAF-1 and Asf1 specifically interact with complexes of histones H3 and H4, while other chaperones like nucleoplasmin and nucleolin interact with complexes of histones H2A and H2B. Histone chaperones facilitate a number of events relevant to histone biology such as their storage, transport, deposition and eviction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>).</p><p>The N1/N2 family of histone chaperones was originally identified in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). In <italic>X. laevis</italic>, N1/N2 associates with core histones H3 and H4, providing a mechanism for the storage of these histones in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, N1/N2 also participates in mediating nucleosome assembly. The N1/N2 family was thought to be restricted to cells of the animal lineage but a potential homolog, Hif1p, was recently identified in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as an H3/H4-specific histone chaperone that associates with a nuclear form of the Hat1p/Hat2p type B histone acetyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>A N1/N2 family member has also recently been identified in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Sim3 was isolated in a screen looking for mutants that disrupted the transcriptional silencing of a marker gene placed in the central core of an <italic>S. pombe</italic> centromere. Intriguingly, Sim3 was found to be important for the localization of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A at <italic>S. pombe</italic> centromeres. In addition, Sim3 was found to physically associate with both CENP-A and histone H3.</p><p>Mammalian cells contain an N1/N2 homolog termed NASP (nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein). In mammals, NASP is present in two differentially spliced isoforms. The longer form of the protein is known as testicular NASP (tNASP) and is expressed in the testis, embryonic tissues and some transformed cells. The second form is somatic NASP (sNASP) which is found in all dividing cells. NASP plays an essential role in mammals as demonstrated by the early embryonic lethality of a mouse knockout model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In addition, genetic studies in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> indicate that the NASP homolog in this organism plays a key role in development and may act as a transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Curiously, although NASP is clearly a member of the N1/N2 family, it has been described in the literature as a linker histone-specific chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15">,12&#x02013;15</xref>). As the binding specificity of histone chaperones is a critical aspect of their function, we have used multiple methods to explore the biochemical properties of this protein. <italic>In vitro</italic> binding experiments using purified proteins demonstrate that sNASP binds specifically to both histone H1 and histones H3 and H4. The binding of sNASP with histones H1 and H3/H4 displays altered binding kinetics that results in high affinity as indicated by sub-micromolar dissociation constants for both interactions. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that NASP retained this spectrum of interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, the interaction of sNASP with histones H3 and H4 was functional as sNASP was active in <italic>in vitro</italic> chromatin assembly assays that use only core histones.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of recombinant sNASP</title><p>The human sNASP ORF (Invitrogen) was transferred into the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expression vector pDEST-17, which adds an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 6His tag.

One liter cultures were grown to mid-log phase and sNASP expression was induced for 2 h. The cells were harvested and the pellets were resuspended in 30 ml start buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl) and lysed by sonication. Phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (0.5 mM) and protease inhibitor cocktail [(1:100), Sigma, St. Louis, MO] were also added to buffers. Cell lysate was aliquoted into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 10 000 r.p.m. for 10 min. The supernatant was applied to a Ni<sup>2+</sup> charged HiTrap Chelating HP column (5 ml). After washing with 20 mM imidazole and 50 mM imidazole, respectively, the recombinant sNASP was eluted with 500 mM imidazole and confirmed by western blot with anti-6His antibody.

The column was then washed extensively with wash buffers (20 mM sodium phosphate pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl 100 mM imidazole and 20 mM sodium phosphate pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole, respectively). A total of 0.1% of NP-40 was added to the wash buffer to minimize nonspecific binding between histones and the matrix of the column.

Similar NASP binding kinetics were observed over the H1 or H3/H4 tetramer-coupled surfaces using either buffer system. Nonspecific binding was not observed when NASP was injected over the underivatized flow cell 1. There were no mass transport effects seen during the association phase during NASP injections. Two-fold serial dilutions of 4&#x02013;5 NASP concentrations determined the binding kinetics to the histones. Each 250 &#x003bc;l protein/buffer injection was followed by a 500 s dissociation period. The surface was regenerated for subsequent runs with 15 &#x003bc;l injections of 3 M NaCl and 4 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Sensorgrams were pooled, trimmed and subtracted using BIAevaluation 4.1. A buffer sensorgram was subtracted from each NASP sensorgram before data analysis [double referencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>)]. The NASP:histone binding kinetics fit well to a simple Langmuir biomolecular reaction model defined by a single on- and off-rate constant.

In addition, sNASP and N1/N2 have a shared domain structure that is also conserved in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> histone chaperone Hif1p (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Each of these proteins contains a large central domain that is highly enriched in acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid). This acidic domain is flanked by tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) repeats with one repeat NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal to the acidic domain and two repeats COOH-terminal. Given the sequence and domain conservation between these proteins, we re-examined the histone-binding specificity of sNASP to determine whether it shares the H3/H4 specificity of N1/N2 and Hif1p or whether it specifically interacts solely histone H1, as reported in the literature. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Native gel electrophoresis of sNASP:histone complexes.

In these experiments, specific complexes were detected between sNASP and histone H1 in the form of discreet bands that were only observed following the incubation of sNASP with linker histones. Conversely, when sNASP was incubated with histones H3 and H4, it was retained in the wells of the native gel leading to the interpretation that sNASP forms nonspecific aggregates with histones H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>We have re-examined the use of native gel electrophoresis to monitor the interaction of sNASP with histones. For these assays, recombinant human sNASP (which contains an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 6His tag) was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified by Ni<sup>2+</sup> chelate chromatography. Recombinant sNASP was incubated with a mixture of histones isolated from chicken erythrocytes that included both the core and linker histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 7 and 15). Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that sNASP formed two distinct complexes with the histones, which had reduced mobility relative to free sNASP.</p><p>To determine whether these complexes were the result of interactions between sNASP and histones H1 or H3/H4, sNASP was incubated with either histone H1 or H3/H4 complexes separately. For these experiments, chicken erythrocyte histone H1 was separated from histones H3 and H4 by Ni<sup>2+</sup> chelating chromatography, taking advantage of the fact that these histones display varying degrees of nonspecific interaction with column resins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The sNASP was mixed with increasing amounts of either histone H3/H4 complexes or histone H1, and the mixtures resolved by native gel electrophoresis. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, sNASP formed complexes with both histones H3/H4 and histone H1 (lanes 1&#x02013;6 and lanes 9&#x02013;14, respectively). While both H1 and H3/H4 were able to form complexes with sNASP, the interaction between sNASP and histone H1 occurred at lower histone concentrations suggesting that the binding of sNASP to H1 occurred with higher affinity. Surprisingly, the mobility of both the sNASP:H1 and sNASP:H3/H4 complexes was similar to the mobility of the complexes observed when sNASP was incubated with the complete histone mixture. This is likely due to the relatively low resolution afforded by native gel electrophoresis that separates macromolecules based on multiple characteristics such as size, shape and charge.</p></sec><sec><title>sNASP forms a stable complex with histones H3 and H4</title><p>We employed gel filtration chromatography to obtain a more detailed and higher resolution picture of the interaction between sNASP and histones. In the absence of sNASP, the core histones eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular weight of &#x0223c;50 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Histone H1 eluted in two peaks with the first peak having an apparent molecular weight of &#x0223c;150 kDa and the second peak coeluting with the core histones suggesting that histone H1 may interact with the core histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Following incubation with sNASP, if any of the histones form a complex with this chaperone, they should coelute from the gel filtration column with sNASP with a larger apparent molecular weight. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, histones H3 and H4 perfectly coeluted with sNASP as a complex with an apparent molecular weight of &#x0223c;350 kDa. Histone H1 did not copurify with sNASP and eluted as a single peak of &#x0223c;150 KDa apparent molecular weight. Interestingly, in the presence of sNASP, histone H1 did not coelute with the core histones suggesting that the interaction between histone H1 and the core histones may have been mediated by histones H3/H4. Importantly, the observation that sNASP does not interact with histones H2A, H2B or H1 in this assay indicated that the binding of sNASP to histones is not due to nonspecific interactions based solely on electrostatic attraction. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>sNASP forms a stable complex with histones H3 and H4.

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, these fractions contain complexes that have electrophoretic mobilities identical to those seen when the sNASP/histone mixtures were directly resolved by native gels. A number of important observations can be made from this result. First, the sNASP:H3/H4-specific bands observed by native gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) reflect the presence of <italic>bona fide</italic>, stable complexes. Second, the differences in electrophoretic mobility observed for the sNASP:H3/H4-specific bands during native gel electrophoresis are indicative of complexes with different apparent molecular weights as the complexes that give rise to these bands elute from the gel filtration column with distinct, but overlapping, profiles. The precise nature of these complexes is not clear but may be related to the observation that sNASP can exist as both a monomer and a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Finally, the sNASP that elutes from the gel filtration column is predominantly associated with histones H3 and H4 as there is no free sNASP detected by native gel electrophoresis. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Correlation between sNASP:H3/H4 complexes detected by gel filtration chromatography and native gel electrophoresis.

Recombinant sNASP (which has an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 6His tag), was incubated with a preparation of chicken erythrocyte histones that contained both the core and linker histones. Following incubation, the sNASP/histone mixture was applied to a Ni<sup>2+</sup> chelate column. Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing (with buffer containing 0.1 M imidazole) and the bound proteins eluted using buffer containing 0.5 M imidazole. As expected, the 6His-tagged sNASP bound to the column and was present in the elution fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Histones H3 and H4 were not present in the wash fractions and coeluted with sNASP. Histones H2A, H2B and H1 were all found in the wash fractions and were not detected in the elution fractions. When the histones were applied to the Ni<sup>2+</sup> chelate column in the absence of sNASP, all of the histones, including H3 and H4 were found in the wash fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>This result supports the previous observations of a specific interaction between sNASP and histones H3 and H4. However, neither this assay nor the gel filtration chromatography provided evidence for an interaction between sNASP and histone H1. The lack of interaction between sNASP and histone H1 in these assays may be due to a number of factors. First, these assays contained mixtures of the core and linker histones. It may be that binding of sNASP to H3/H4 is preferred and the formation of the sNASP:H3/H4 complex precludes the interaction between sNASP and histone H1. Alternatively, the use of histones derived from chicken erythrocytes may have influenced the results as there is greater sequence identity between chicken and mammals for the core histones than for the linker histones. We tested these possibilities by directly assessing the ability of sNASP to interact with purified bovine histone H1. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, when purified bovine histone H1 was combined with 6His-tagged sNASP, in the absence of other histones, and applied to a Ni<sup>2+</sup> chelate column, all of the histone H1 was found in the wash fractions. In addition, no detectable histone H1 coeluted from the Ni<sup>2+</sup> chelate column with sNASP. This result suggests that the lack of interaction between sNASP and histone H1 is not due to competition or the sequence divergence of chicken histone H1. Hence, while an interaction between sNASP and histone H1 is clearly detectable by native gel electrophoresis, it is not observed using chromatography-based assays. One explanation, which is difficult to rule out, is that the nature of the nonspecific interactions that are seen between histone H1 and column resins prevent the formation of sNASP/histone H1 complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>sNASP interacts primarily with histone H3</title><p>To further characterize sNASP as a histone H3/H4-specific chaperone, we tested the ability of sNASP bind individually to histone H3 and H4.

NASP was purified from mouse myeloma cell extracts using an anti-NASP antibody affinity column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Proteins bound to NASP were then eluted from the column and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. The presence of histone H1, as well as the absence of core histones, was determined by comparison of the retention times of the NASP-associated proteins to the retention times of histone standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Anti-NASP antibody columns were also used to isolate NASP from mouse testis lystes and HeLa cell lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In each case, histone H1 was identified as eluting from the column with NASP by western blot analysis. However, these samples were not probed for the presence of core histones.</p><p>While these experiments did not identify an <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction between NASP and histones H3/H4, other <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence supports an interaction between these proteins. Tagami and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) used epitope tags to affinity purify complexes associated with human histones H3.1 and H3.3. While some histone chaperones, such as CAF-1 and HIRA, selectively associated with only one H3 variant, other chaperones, including Asf1 and NASP, were found complexed with both forms of H3. As histone H1 was not reported to be a component of these complexes, these results indicate that a fraction of the soluble histone H3 in mammalian cells is associated with NASP.</p><p>We have used coimmunoprecipitation to evaluate whether the interactions between NASP and histones seen <italic>in vitro</italic> are also found <italic>in vivo</italic>. For these experiments, antibodies were raised in rabbits using purified recombinant sNASP as antigen. Rabbit anti-NASP antibody was conjugated with coupling gel and incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extract. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted. Western blots were then used to determine the presence of specific histones. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, the antibody immunoprecipitated both sNASP and tNASP.

To determine whether sNASP:H3/H4 complexes were also functional, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> chromatin assembly assay that monitors the formation of nucleosomes through the introduction of supercoils into a relaxed circular plasmid DNA. For these assays, we used a preparation of chicken erythrocyte histones that had been purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography to remove histone H1 (data not shown). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, recombinant sNASP was unable to assemble nucleosomes using purified chicken erythrocyte core histones (compare lanes 3 and 5). As demonstrated previously, recombinant yeast Hif1p is also unable to function alone in the assembly of core histones and requires the presence of factor(s) in yeast cytosolic extracts [see lanes 4, 7&#x02013;9 and ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>)]. Therefore, we tested whether sNASP could function in a similar manner and replace Hif1p in these assembly reactions. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> (compare lane 7 to lanes 10&#x02013;12), sNASP promotes very robust chromatin assembly in the presence of core histones and a yeast cytosolic extract. These results make two important points. First, the interaction between sNASP and histones H3 and H4 is a productive one that can lead to histone deposition. Hence, sNASP can function as a core histone assembly factor. Second, the similarity in chromatin assembly activity demonstrated by sNASP and Hif1p supports the hypothesis that Hif1p is a functional ortholog of the N1/N2 family of histone chaperones in yeast. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Recombinant sNASP can assemble core histones into chromatin.

As a histone chaperone, the most fundamental activity of NASP is its histone-binding specificity. The experiments presented here indicate that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, sNASP forms specific, high-affinity complexes with both histone H1 and histones H3/H4. In addition, the interaction of sNASP with histone H3/H4 complexes is functional as sNASP is able to function in the assembly of core histones onto DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results are entirely consistent with the high degree of primary sequence and domain structure conservation observed between NASP and members of the N1/N2 family of histones chaperones, which have been demonstrated to interact specifically with histones H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Our quantitative analysis of the binding of sNASP to histone H1 and histone H3/H4 complexes indicated that sNASP interacts with both sets of histone proteins with high affinity. The dissociation constants that we have observed, 13.8 nM and 237 nM for H1 and H3/H4, respectively, are comparable to those seen for the binding of the histone chaperone p55 to histone H4 and significantly lower than those reported for most other histone-binding proteins (typically in the 1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M range) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27 B28 B29 B30">24&#x02013;30</xref>).</p><p>The effect of sNASP on <italic>in vitro</italic> plasmid supercoiling assays suggests that sNASP is not merely a histone-binding protein but that it is also a chromatin assembly factor. The requirement of an extract in these assays indicates that, under the conditions tested, sNASP is not able to generate stable nucleosomes by itself. Whether sNASP hands off histones to other factors that directly assemble nucleosomes or whether sNASP is more directly involved in mediating the histone/DNA interaction remains to be determined.</p><p>The activity of sNASP in <italic>in vitro</italic> chromatin assembly assays also sheds light on the yeast histone chaperone Hif1p. Despite a low level of primary sequence similarity, Hif1p was suggested to be a fungal ortholog of the N1/N2 family of histone chaperones based on a conserved domain structure and common histone-binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The ability of sNASP to functionally substitute for the yeast protein Hif1p in chromatin assays strongly supports this hypothesis that these proteins share a common function.</p><p>An interesting issue raised by our results involves the functional significance of a histone chaperone that can bind both histone H1 and histone H3/H4 complexes. One intriguing possibility suggests a potential link between the acetylation of newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 and the deposition of histone H1. Subsequent to their synthesis, histones H3 and H4 are rapidly acetylated on their NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal tails by type B histone acetyltransferases. Following deposition of these histones, these modifications are removed during chromatin maturation. While the acetylation of newly synthesized H3 and H4 is an evolutionarily conserved event, the function of this modification is not known. One potential role is suggested by the observation that preventing the deacetylation of H3 and H4 following chromatin assembly prevents association of histone H1 with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33">31&#x02013;33</xref>). Thus, the assembly of histone H1 may be regulated by the modification state of histones H3 and H4. Combined with the finding that Hif1p is found associated with the type B histone acetyltransferase Hat1p in yeast nuclei, these observations suggest that histone chaperones such as sNASP and Hif1p may coordinate, either spatially or temporally, the assembly of histone H1 onto nucleosomes containing the proper modification state on histones H3 and H4.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>GM62970</grant-num> to M.R.P.).
