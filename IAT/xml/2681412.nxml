Indeed, in Europe alone more than 340 000 death per annum are attributable to this cancer, but this disease is by large preventable. There is concluding evidence for tobacco smoke to be the primary cause of lung cancer and more than 4,800 compounds have been identified in the particulate and gas phases of cigarette smoke. Major lung carcinogens in smoke include some of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo<italic>&#x0005b;a&#x0005d;</italic>pyrene, as well as tobacco-specific <italic>N</italic>-nitrosamines. Although a lot of evidence supports the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, the molecular events associated with early stages of disease remain somewhat elusive. A diverse range of genetic abnormalities are seen in different stages of lung cancer, some of which may be employed as markers of disease progression; others may have a direct role in lung cancer etiology in the context of gene-environment interactions. Characterisation of the cancer genome in lung adenocarcinoma was the subject of a recent study and several reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Weir1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Thomas1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Granville1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Specifically, eighty percent of the lung cancers are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whereas the remains 20&#x00025; are small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Survival of patients diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor; over the last decades the 5-year survival rate remained less than 15&#x00025;. Survival of lung cancer is, however, strongly associated with the stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. Indeed, 5- year survival rates range from 5&#x00025; for patients with stage IV lesions to 70&#x00025; at stage I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Nesbitt1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Such encouraging outlooks have lead to renewed interest in the search and validation of biomarkers of disease to allow monitoring of individuals at risk for developing lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Minna1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Most frequently, diagnosis of lung cancer is at a late stage of disease with its classification being based on morphological appearance and immunohistological methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Fong1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. An identification of patients at risk for developing cancer at early stages of disease would have a big impact on overall survival. Notably, there has been significant progress in an understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer, which includes an identification of genetic and epigenetic events in cancer subgroups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Balsara1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The molecular perturbations associated with early stages of lung cancer are, however, unknown as are the gene regulatory networks forcing dysplastic cells into malignant transformation.</p><p>Previous studies had defined atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) as a preinvasive lesion that progresses from low to high grade dysplasia to invasive adenocarcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Kerr1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Strikingly, the genetic events associated with dysplasia and its progression into invasive carcinomas remains uncertain. Specifically, with low grade dysplasia the architectural and cytological changes of the cell are minimal, while with high grade dysplasia gross cytological irregularities become obvious with larger, columnar cells, cytoplasmic pleomorphism, large hyperchromatic nuclei, uneven chromatin structure and higher mitotic rates. Although these morphological changes are well recognized, the underlying molecular alterations are at best poorly understood. Through the use of refined experimental models new insight into the molecular events associated with dysplasia and its progression into cancers can be obtained.</p><p>Here we report findings with a transgenic mouse model, where targeted overexpression of c-RAF to respiratory epithelium resulted in lung cancer development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Kerkhoff1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. A serum and lung adenocarcinoma proteome map of the SP-C/c-raf transgenic line was recently published by us <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Rtters1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Chatterji1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We also published the molecular organisation of the c-raf promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Borlak1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, the raf family (a-raf, b-raf and c-raf) of proteins code for serine/threonine kinases, originally isolated as a viral oncogene contributing to cellular transformation and are one of the best characterized Ras effectors to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Morrison1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. RAF directly phosphorylates and activates MEK via two conserved serine residues in the kinase activation loop of MEK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Alessi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Activated MEK then directly phosphorylates a conserved tyrosine and threonine residue in the kinase activation loop of ERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Payne1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The MAPK pathway is deregulated in many human malignancies through aberrant signaling upstream of the protein and by activating mutations of the protein itself, both of which induce a proliferative advantage. Indeed, mutations of the K-ras gene have been identified in up to 30&#x00025; of lung adenocarcinomas and have been considered as a poor prognostic factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Inoue1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> underscoring the important role of this pathway in human lung cancer.</p><p>As of today, the genetic events associated with dysplasia are basically unknown. We therefore aimed for an identification of preneoplastic changes in a c-raf-1 lung cancer disease model. In our study, we used predominately 5 month old mice to gain information at an early stage of tumor development where isolated foci of transformed cells in distinct areas of the lung are visible. By use of laser microdissection pressure catapulting (LMPC) dysplastic cells in well defined lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-EmmertBuck1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> could be isolated. Dysplastic lesions were than compared with transgenic but otherwise normal cells or tumor cells. We applied gene expression profiling to determine differentially expressed genes as to identify the gene regulatory networks associated with dysplasia. Overall, our study revealed interesting and novel genes and pathways that may contribute to the early stages of lung cancer development many of which are worthy for their exploration as candidate biomarkers and for molecular imaging of early stages of disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Histological changes</title><p>Animals at the age of 5 month displayed morphological changes typical for dysplasia.

These networks describe functional relationships among gene products based on findings presented in peer-reviewed biological pathways. Taken collectively, 12 and 16 networks could be defined for the comparison dysplasia vs transgenic and dysplasia vs non-transgenic cells. Based on pathway analysis the top 2 and top 3 networks reached a score of 25 or higher and contained 15 or more genes in the comparison dysplasia vs transgenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005637-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and dysplasia vs non-transgenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005637-g006">Figure 6</xref>), respectively. This demonstrates the extensive relationship and interaction between the significantly regulated genes in dysplasia. These networks were associated with the following pathways: cellular growth and proliferation, cell-to-cell signalling and interaction, cancer, lipid metabolism, development, cellular movement amongst others (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005637.s004">Figure S1</xref>). In the following, we describe prominent examples. Cancer cells may produce their own growth factors to stimulate proliferation in neighbouring or parental cells (paracrine vs autocrine loops). We thus searched for genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation and found in the case of dyspalsia 18 genes to be up-regulated ranging between 3.6 to 23.5-fold as compared to transgenic but morphologically unaltered lung tissue. Likewise 36 genes were up-regulated between 4.7 to 482.2-fold when compared to non-transgenic lung tissue. In particular, the Areg (amphiregulin) and Ereg (epiregulin) ligands, both members of the EGF-pathway, were highly significantly over expressed. These molecules play pivotal roles in an activation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase to foster proliferation and motility. Overexpressions of these EGF-ligands are observed in a wide variety of human cancers, including breast, prostate and lung cancer.</p><fig id="pone-0005637-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005637.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Ingenuity networks: dysplasia versus transgenic mice.</title><p>Ingenuity networks generated by mapping the focus genes that were differentially expressed between dysplasia and transgenic unaltered lung tissue.

Indeed, expression of cell adhesion molecules is programmed during development to provide positional and migratory information for cells. Disruption of these adhesion events leads to increased cell motility and potential invasiveness trough remodelling of the extra cellular matrix.</p><p>We found genes coding for tight junction proteins to be regulated. Identification of the molecular components of the tight junction evidenced that, in addition to their structural functions, these proteins play central roles in regulating cellular proliferation and differentiation. Under normal conditions, tight junctions act to segregate a growth factor within the apical membrane compartment away from its receptor in the basolateral membrane compartment, thereby precluding receptor activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Vermeer1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The disruption of tight junctions in adjacent healthy cells permits the growth factor to bind and activate its receptor, thereby inducing cellular proliferation and migration. In dysplasia the claudins Cldn2, Cldn4 and Cldn8 were significantly up-regulated, their expression ranged from 4.6&#x02013;13.31-fold and 4.9&#x02013;122.38-fold, when transgenic but healthy and non-transgenic lung tissue were compared, respectively. Overexpression of these tight junction proteins suggest remodelling of tight junctions.</p><p>Next to claudins, we observed up-regulation of gap junction proteins in dysplasia by 11 and 9-fold as well (Gja3, gap junction protein alpha-3 and Gjb4, gap junction protein beta-4). Alteration in gap junctional intercellular communication results in the inability of cells to receive apoptotic, growth suppressing or differentiation signals from their neighbours. Specifically, connexins, a family of 20 trans-membrane proteins in humans, comprise the main subunits of gap junctions; &#x02013; these specialised clusters of intercellular channels allow adjacent cells to directly share ions and hydrophilic molecules of up to &#x0223c;1 KDa in size. Gap junctional intercellular communication is thought to control tissue homeostasis and to coordinate cellular processes such as proliferation, migration and differentiation. Disruption of gap junctional intercellular communication or mutations in connexins is associated with several human diseases. Notably, gap junction expression is often up-regulated in hyperplastic tissues.</p><p>Furthermore, lipid metabolism is altered in cancer, including loss of body fat early in tumor growth, induction of hyperlipidemia and changes in a variety of serum lipid and lipoprotein fractions. Thus, cancer patients were found to have higher rates of fat oxidation when compared with healthy individuals with equal weight loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Hyltander1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Yam1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. We examined genes involved in lipid metabolism and found up to 13 genes in dysplasia to be up-regulated ranging from 3.6&#x02013;28.1-fold and 4.4&#x02013;148.4-fold when unaltered transgenic and non-transgenic lung tissue was compared with dysplastic cells. In particular Apoa1 (apolipoproteinA-1) the major apoprotein of High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) was significantly over expressed. Apoa1 is a cofactor for Lcat (lecithin-cholesterin-acetyltransferase), which is responsible for the formation of most cholesterol esters in plasma. Apoa1 also promotes efflux of cholesterol, phospholipids, sphingomyelin, sterol and phosphatidylcholin from cells and is involved in transport of cholesterol ester. Recently, it has been observed that the HDL complex is capable of suppressing lymphocyte function, particularly in the host resistance to tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Thomas2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this regard we also found changes in the expression of cell surface glycolipids in dysplastic cells as compared to unaltered transgenic or to non-transgenic lung tissue. For example, Sult2b1 (sulfotransferase family 2b, member 1) was significantly over expressed. This enzyme catalyzes the sulphate conjugation of pregnenolone and cholesterol. Moreover, St8sia6 (St8 alpha-n-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 6), an enzyme which synthesize sialylglycoconjugates of glycolipids was significantly up-regulated, as well. These changes may result in new surface antigens and glycolipids in addition to altered cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix communication followed by decreased adhesiveness and invasiveness through normal tissue barriers.</p><p>Further evidence for changes in glycosylation patterns during transformation of normal cells into malignant ones stems form the up-regulation of B4galt6 (UDP-GAL:Beta-GlcNAc Beta-1,4-Galactosyltransferase, polypeptide 6), Fut2 (Fucosyltransferase 2), Gpc6 (Glypican6) and Orm1 (orosomucoid1) as observed in dysplastic cells. The synthesis of new carbohydrate chains in dysplastic cells are due to activation of glycosyltransferase such as B4galt6, which catalyzes the reaction UDP-galactose and N-acetylglucosamine for the production of galactose beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine. Strikingly, these carbohydrates are absent or have low activity in normal cells. Moreover, the secretor enzyme Fut2, an <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-1,2-fucosyltransferase, is responsible for the transfer of fucose in an <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-1,2 linkage to form the terminal H type 1 structure. The extra fucosylations that appear on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids are associated with several pathological processes, such as tumor metastasis, inflammation and bacterial adhesion.</p><p>As the expression of glycoproteins is increased in many cancers, it was of no surprise that Orm1 was 11.1-fold overexpressed in dysplastic cells. Orosomucoid 1 belongs to a group of highly glycosylated glycoproteins and appears to function in modulating the activity of the immune system. Furthermore, we found glypican 6 to be induced (9.9-fold). Notably, this protein belongs to a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparin sulphate proteoglycans. It is known that proteoglycans are high-molecular-weight glycoproteins and interact via their multiple binding domains with many other structural macromolecules. They are bound together with extracellular matrix components and act as cell adhesion factors by promoting organization of actin filaments in the cell cytoskeleton. Proteoglycans have been shown to undergo alterations during malignant transformation resulting in disrupted interaction between the extra cellular matrix and the transformed cells to simplify the invasion into the surrounding tissue.</p><p>We further investigated genes involved in developmental processes and found 8 genes to be 3.6&#x02013;15.4-fold up-regulated in dysplasia as compared to transgenic lung tissue. Notably, 22 genes were 5.4&#x02013;148.4-fold up-regulated in dysplasia as compared to non-transgenic lung tissue.</p><p>In particular Hnf4&#x003b1; (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha), Foxa3 (forkhead box gene A3) and Foxp2 (forkhead box gene P2) were significantly over expressed in dysplasia (4.5&#x02013;12.8-fold). These genes codes for proteins that belong to a family of winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding domain transcription factors and are expressed in defined neural, intestinal, and cardiovascular cell types during embryogenesis and differentiation of epithelium. Hnf4&#x003b1; plays a key role in a transcriptional hierarchy and controls the expression of other transcription factors such as Hnf1 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Rufibach1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, hundreds of genes are targeted by Hnf4&#x003b1;. Since many of those genes contain more than one Hnf4&#x003b1; binding site, these genes can be grouped into several different categories, according to function, such as nutrient transport and metabolism, blood maintenance, immune function, cellular differentiation and growth factors. The best characterized Hnf4&#x003b1; target genes are those involved in lipid transport (e.g., apolipoprotein genes) and glucose metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Niehof1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

An important finding of our study was that about 10&#x00025; of the differentially expressed genes regulated by &#x02265;2 fold are already known to be associated with lung cancer.</p><p>Specifically, in dysplasia genes coding for nucleic acid metabolism or cell cycle regulation were unchanged but two EGF-ligands, namely amphi- and epiregulin were highly significantly up-regulated. These ligands enable autocrine loops to foster undue EGF-signaling. Notably, Areg (amphiregulin) is a 252-amino acid transmembrane glycoprotein and consist of two major soluble forms of 78 and 84 amino acids, respectively. Areg was originally isolated from conditioned medium of the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and was found to be a heparin-binding growth factor. Areg promotes neoplastic growth in mammary epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Johnson1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Li1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and was shown to function in an autocrine manner to drive the proliferation of malignantly transformed cells of colon, breast, cervix, prostate, and pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Wang1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. This ligand of the EGF tyrosine kinase is commonly over expressed in cancers of human colon, stomach, breast, and pancreas, in which the level of Areg correlates with tumor progression and poor patient survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Bavik1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Sehgal1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Ebert1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Woodworth1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, it was shown in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer that the survival time of amphiregulin-negative patients treated with gefitinib was significantly longer than that of amphiregulin-positive patients. Therefore, an increase in serum amphiregulin can be viewed as a predictor of resistance to gefitinib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Ishikawa1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our data indicate that Areg secreted from dysplastic cells are in an autocrine loop to foster malignant transformation.</p><p>A further growth factor strongly induced in dysplasia is Ereg (epiregulin).

Specifically, the cell surface membrane proteins play an important role in the behaviour of cells to allow for communication with other cells, cell movement and migration, adherence to other cells or structures and recognition by the immune system. Alterations of the plasma membrane in malignant cells may thus be inferred from a variety of properties that characterize their growth and behaviour.</p><p>Our study is suggestive for changes in the glycosylation patterns and in cell surface glycolipids. Changes in glycosylation can include the presence of new carbohydrate structures that are not detected in the normal epithelial cells and/or short carbohydrate chains usually masked by larger epitopes. For example, we found St8sia6 to be up-regulated in dysplasia. St8sia6 (alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase VI) belongs to a family of sialyltransferases that synthesize sialylglycoconjugates. The most frequently described aberrant glycosylation in cancer cells include the synthesis of highly branched and heavily sialyted glycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Warren1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of the negative electric charge of sialic acid at the terminal non-reducing end of glycoprotein oligosaccharides, it plays a key role in mediating biological recognition events, including those responsible for metastasis. Next, we found an overexpression of B4galt6 (UDP-GAL:Beta-GlcNAc Beta-1,4-Galactosyltransferase, polypeptide 6). This enzyme is involved in the production of GlcNAc (galactose beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine). GlcNAc is the first sugar residue to be linked to serine or threonine and serves as acceptor for the elongation with further GlcNAc molecules. The resulting branched structure may be elongated by the sequential addition of galactose, fucose and sialic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Hakomori1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Changes of the glycosylation pattern in dysplasia enables further variability in molecular assembly of membranes and offers a wide range of flexibility in response to cellular environment. Their detection on the cancer cell surface may provide useful diagnostic or prognostic information but until now is incompletely understood and therefore requires further elucidation.</p><p>Changes in the expression pattern of cell-adhesion molecules and components of intercellular junctions are related to loss of epithelial organization, proper cell layer and tissue polarity. With regard to adhesion molecules, we found up-regulation of Chl1 (cell adhesion molecule with homology to L1CAM), a member of the L1 gene family of neural cell adhesion molecules, and of several claudins as exemplified by the up-regulation of Cldn2 (claudin2), Cldn4 (claudin4), and Cldn8 (claudin8), which are important components of the tight junctions. Adhesion properties greatly impacts cell-to-cell interaction and growth of cancer cells.</p><p>In this regard, the cytoskeleton, which represents a complex of interconnected fibrillar elements, has been determined as an important factor in mediating adhesion-independent and dependent signalling. During morphogenesis, they determine cell shape and polarity, and promote stable cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions through their interactions with cadherins and integrins, respectively. Surprisingly, in dysplastic cells we did not identify regulation of genes involved in the cytoskeleton.</p><p>Instead, we identified changes in cell to cell communication. In our study Gjb3 (gap junction membrane channel protein beta 3) and Gjb4 (gap junction membrane channel protein beta 4) were significantly up-regulated. It was shown that the gap junctional intercellular communication is a form of cell&#x02013;to-cell signalling thereby mediating the exchange of small molecules between neighbouring cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Mennecier1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The regulation of connexins and gap junctions is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, while their induction in cancer cells leads to reversal of the cancer phenotype, induction of differentiation, and regulation of cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Pointis1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We also focused on genes coding for surfactant lipids in respiratory epithelium. Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that reduces surface tension at the air&#x02013;liquid interface and prevents alveolar collapse during respiration. Four surfactant proteins (SP) with unique properties have been identified. SP-A and SP-D are relatively hydrophilic proteins and contribute to innate defence of the lung and surfactant homeostasis. SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic proteins that enhance surface-active properties of surfactant phospholipid films <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Mason1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. In dysplastic epithelium we could not detect regulated genes coding for surfactant proteins. However, nearly all of the genes grouped under lipid metabolism that have been previously linked to transport and secretion of lipid were regulated. For example, Apoa1 (apolipoprotein A-I) is known to be the major protein moiety of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and is mainly produced in the liver and the intestine but is also produced in vitro by some differentiated cell lines established from human colorectal tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Reisher1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We found Apoa1 (apolipoprotein A-1), Adcyap1 (adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1), Ltb4dh (leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase), Fst (follistatin), Inhbb (inhibin beta-B), Clu (clusterin), Hnf4&#x003b1; (hepatic nuclear factor 4, alpha), Prokr1 (prokineticin receptor 1), Pla2g1b (phospholipase A2, group IB), Sult2b1 (sulfotransferase family, cytosolic, 2B, member 1), St8sia6 (ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 6), Cyp1b1 (cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily b, polypeptide 1) and the Pthlh (parathyroid hormone-like peptide) to be regulated with inferred roles in lipid metabolism.</p><p>For example, Adcyap1 (adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1) is a member of the secretin/glucagons/vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) family of peptides. It has been localized by immunohistochemistry to the central nervous system, digestive tract and was shown to exhibit a variety of biological activities. It is involved in synthesis of sulfatides, glycolipid, sphingolipid and plays a role in the accumulation of estrogen and progesterone. It was also reported that Adcyap1 can regulate the proliferation and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Wolman1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> and was shown to be overexpressed in neuroblastoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Isobe1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> and breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-GarciaFernandez1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

This protein belongs to a group of endoderm-related developmental factors that are members of the forkhead box (Fox) superfamily of transcription factors. They were first discovered by their ability to bind to promoters of liver specific genes encoding &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin and transthyretin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Jackson1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Foxa genes are regulated in early mouse embryo development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Zaret1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref> and are responsible, at least in part, for metabolic regulation.

This protein is a member of the new subfamily of winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding domain transcription factor. It could be shown that Foxp2 are expressed in the lung restricted to the distal epithelium and may regulate lung epithelial-specific gene transcription during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Shen1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. Foxp2 has been characterized as a transcriptional repressor. All the known Fox genes that were implicated in regulating lung expression were characterized as transcriptional activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Shu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding suggests that Foxp2 plays a role in the balance of transcriptional activation and repression that is involved in regulating epithelial cell identity and development of the lung. These processes are also crucial for the transdifferentiation of alveolar type I to type II epithelial cells, which are responsible for gas exchange and surfactant protein expression essential for lung function.</p><p>Additionally, we have confirmed the up-regulation of Areg, Ereg, Hnf4&#x003b1;, Foxa3 and Foxp2 by immunohistochemical staining. The immunostaining showed a distinct pattern of immunoreactivity in dysplastic cells with no staining in unaltered transgenic cells. For example, immunohistochemical staining of Areg showed a cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in dysplastic cells but not each cell expressed this molecule equally strong.</p><p>In dysplasia, however, we could not evidence altered transcriptional networks of the MAPK pathway and we did not observe regulated genes coding for cell cycle or nucleotide metabolism. Both processes are highly active in tumor cells but do not play a big role in dysplastic cells prior to malignant transformation. In this context we found two EGF ligands, Areg and Ereg to be specifically up-regulated in dysplasia. While amphiregulin binds exclusively to EGFR epiregulin binds to HER4 and mediates aberrant activation of this receptor. Indeed, exaggerated EGF tyrosine kinase activity is a probable cause for lung cancer. We now evidence de novo expression of two ligands of EGFR in dysplasia that are frequently over expressed in cancers. We did, however, not observe increased transcript expression of the cancer stem cell markers CD44, CD133 and the epithelial cell adhesion molecule EpCAM. This may support the notion that dysplasia is a facultative cancer where additional events need to occur that enable malignant transformation. Taken collectively, the whole genome expression data provided important information in the multistage process of lung cancer. Our study revealed interesting novel candidate genes and pathways that dissected the programme of respiratory epithelium from transgenic into dysplasia and eventually lung cancer. In the second part of our study we report the additional genetic events that take place from dysplasia to malignantly transformed cells and thus provide a molecular rational for the multistage process in lung cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>SP-C/c-raf model</title><p>Animals were kept according to the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and SP-C/c-raf transgenic mice were obtained from the laboratory of Prof. Ulf Rapp (University of W&#x000fc;rzburg, Germany), who bred the mice in the C57BL/6/DBA/2 hybrid background. We kept the SP-C/c-raf transgenic mice in the C57BL/6 background for at least five generations.</p><p>Lung samples were derived from 5 SP-C/c-raf mice (aged 5&#x02013;10 months); dysplastic and unaltered lung tissue were always isolated from the same dysplasia-bearing transgenic mouse (aged 5&#x02013;7 months). Endogenous normal lung tissue was studied of 5 non-transgenic mice (aged 7&#x02013;10 months). The non-transgenic littermates (wild-type) served as control for transgenic effects.</p><p>Mice were sacrificed and the lung tissues were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further analysis.</p><p>The histopathological diagnosis was based on routinely processed hematoxylin-eosin stains.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Microdissection (LMPC &#x02013; Laser Microbeam Microdissection and Laser Pressure Catapulting)</title><p>From each frozen lung tissue 10-&#x000b5;m thick sections were prepared and transferred on polyethylene napthalate foil-covered slides (Zeiss, P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies GmbH, Bernried, Germany).</p><p>The sections were fixed in methanol/acetic acid and stained in hematoxylin. The desired cells were microdissected using the PALM MicroLaser systems (Zeiss, P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies GmbH, Bernried, Germany) and collected in an adhesive cap (Zeiss, P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies GmbH, Bernried, Germany). Microdissected cells were resuspended in a guanidine isothiocyanate-containing buffer (RLT buffer from RNeasy MikroKit, Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA, USA) with 10 &#x000b5;l/ml &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol to ensure isolation of intact RNA. Approximately an area of 6&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> were pooled from a specific layer of interest in the same animal and used for RNA extraction.</p><p>Following microdissection, total RNA-extraction was performed with the RNeasy Micro Kit (RNeasy MicroKit Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction.

Quality control of cRNA was performed using a bioanalyzer (Agilent 2001 Biosizing, Agilent Technologies). Following fragmentation, labeled cRNA of each sample was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip&#x000ae; Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays covering over 34.000 genes and stained according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Quantification, normalization and statistical analysis</title><p>Array data was normalized using scaling or per-chip normalization to adjust the total or average intensity of each array to be approximately the same.</p><p>Microarray chips were analyzed by the GCOS (GeneChip Operating Software) from Affymetrix with the default settings except that the target signal was set to 500 and used to generate a microarray quality control and data report. CEL files exported from GCOS were uploaded into ArrayTrack software (National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. FDA, Jefferson, AR, USA (NCTR/FDA)) and normalized using Total Intensity Normalization after subtracting backgrounds for data management and analysis. ArrayTrack software includes some tools common to other bioinformatics software (e.g., ANOVA, T-test and SAM).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>SAM</title><p>To compare the normalized data from dysplasia, normal lung tissue from transgenic mouse, tumor cells and non-transgenic of different mice, we used the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) algorithm (ArrayTrack), which contains a sliding scale for false discovery rate (FDR) of significantly up- and down-regulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005637-Tusher1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. All data were permuted 100 cycles by using the two classes, unpaired data mode of the algorithm. As cut-off for significance an estimated FDR of 0.001 was chosen.

The following incubation steps were accomplished: 2 times 3 minutes in 96&#x00025; ethanol, 2 times 2 minutes in 70&#x00025; Ethanol, and 2 minutes in Aqua dest. The pre-treated slices were heated in a autoclave for 15 min in citrate buffer submitted of an antigen retrieval before the colouring first. For blocking endogenous peroxidase activity the slices covered for 30 minutes with 3&#x00025; hydrogen peroxide/Methanol peroxidase blocking solution. After a wash step, the slices were incubated with the primary polyclonal anti-body against AREG, EREG, HNF4&#x003b1;, FOXA3 and FOXP2 (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Biotechnologys Inc., CA, USA) for 45 minutes. After washing, a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase detection kit (Envision DAKO, Hamburg, Germany) containing 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine solution as substrate was used for immunohistochemical staining according to the manufacturer's instructions.
