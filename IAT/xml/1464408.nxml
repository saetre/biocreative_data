In human RAD51D we examined the requirement for these motifs in interactions with XRCC2 and RAD51C, and for survival of cells in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Ectopic expression of wild-type human RAD51D or mutants having a non-functional A or B motif was used to test for complementation of a <italic>rad51d</italic> knockout hamster CHO cell line. Although A-motif mutants complement very efficiently, B-motif mutants do not. Consistent with these results, experiments using the yeast two- and three-hybrid systems show that the interactions between RAD51D and its XRCC2 and RAD51C partners also require a functional RAD51D B motif, but not motif A. Similarly, hamster Xrcc2 is unable to bind to the non-complementing human RAD51D B-motif mutants in co-immunoprecipitation assays. We conclude that a functional Walker B motif, but not A motif, is necessary for RAD51D's interactions with other paralogs and for efficient HRR. We present a model in which ATPase sites are formed in a bipartite manner between RAD51D and other RAD51 paralogs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent a severe form of DNA damage that can lead to mutations and cell death if repaired incorrectly. Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to repair DSBs, including the high fidelity process of homologous recombinational repair (HRR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), which contributes significantly to the repair of DSBs in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), such as those generated at the replication fork during interstrand crosslink (ICL) removal. In vertebrates, HRR is highly conserved and mediated by the bacterial RecA ortholog, the Rad51 recombinase and five Rad51 paralogs (XRCC2, XRCC3, Rad51B, Rad51C and Rad51D). Though the biochemical functions of these paralogs in HRR are not well understood, they have been proposed to function in early steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and in late steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) of recombination. The Rad51 paralogs are necessary for cellular resistance to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), have no functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and share limited sequence homology with Rad51 and with each other [&#x0223c;20% identity; reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>)]. The regions of highest sequence homology are the putative ATP-binding domains: the conserved Walker A and Walker B motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>In human cells, several RAD51 paralog complexes have been identified, among them the RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 heterotetramer, and three heterodimers: RAD51B-RAD51C, RAD51D-XRCC2 and RAD51C-XRCC3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The RAD51B-RAD51C and RAD51D-XRCC2 complexes were shown to bind to single- and double-stranded DNA and to hydrolyze ATP, an activity enhanced by DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The heterotetramer also exhibited ATPase activity and preferentially bound to Y-shaped DNA and synthetic Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>The Walker ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) consists of two separate motifs, A and B, crucial components of the nucleotide-binding site. The lysine residue in the GKT/S box of the Walker A motif is essential for ATP-binding and contacts the &#x003b3;-phosphate of the nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The highly conserved aspartate/glutamate of the Walker B motif forms hydrogen bonds with the threonine/serine of the GKT/S box and with a bound water molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) and facilitates nucleotide hydrolysis.</p><p>In human RAD51, non-conservative (no ATP binding) K133A substitution in the Walker A motif did not rescue the Rad51-deficient lethality of chicken DT40 cells while the conservative (ATP binding, but no hydrolysis) K133R substitution only gave a partially defective phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, human RAD51-K133R showed an increased stability of presynaptic filament formation and enhanced homologous pairing activity compared to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), but in a dominant-negative approach, expression of human RAD51-K133R in a mouse embryonic stem cell line specifically inhibited homology-directed DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). In the Walker B motif of human RAD51, mutation in the highly conserved aspartate (D222A), but not V221A or S223A, was shown to eliminate protein function in the DT40 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). For the human RAD51 paralogs, mutations within the Walker A motif of RAD51C and XRCC3 were shown to greatly reduce cellular resistance to ICLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), but mutation in the Walker A motif in XRCC2 had little effect on complementing ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Substitution of the conserved aspartate residue in the Walker B motif of human XRCC3 (D213N) resulted in increased spontaneous apoptosis and complete loss of gene-complementing activity for cell survival to ICL damage in the CHO <italic>xrcc3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Evidence suggests that nucleotide binding and hydrolysis play important roles in the formation of RAD51 paralog complexes. For example, in XRCC3, the inability to hydrolyze bound ATP (i.e. a Walker A GRT substitution) blocks the interaction with RAD51C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). A study of the paralog interactions of mouse Rad51D Walker A mutants has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), and these results are discussed later.</p><p>In this study, Walker-motif mutants of RAD51D were tested for their ability to complement the MMC sensitivity of CHO <italic>rad51d</italic> knockout cells [hereafter written as <italic>rad51d</italic> cells; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)]. Surprisingly, RAD51D mutants of the GKT box of the Walker A motif rescued the MMC sensitivity of <italic>RAD51D</italic> cells, whereas B-motif mutants did not complement. In addition, whereas A-motif mutations had little effect on the interaction of rad51d with binding partners XRCC2 and RAD51C, mutations in the B-motif disrupted these interactions. These results constitute the novel finding of a differential requirement for the Walker A and B motifs of a human ATPase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Parental CHO cells (strain AA8) and 51D1Lox and 51D1 (<italic>rad51d</italic>) derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) were grown in monolayer or suspension cultures in MEM-alpha medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, seven of these clones stably expressed the transgene.

We found that stable expression of either mutant protein largely complemented MMC sensitivity of <italic>rad51d</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and B). The degree of MMC resistance of the high-expressing lines (GRT6 and GAT4) was similar to that of AA8 cells and <italic>rad51d</italic> cells expressing wild-type RAD51D (WT2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For the low-expressing lines (GRT2, GRT3 and GAT2), complementation was less complete [&#x0223c;2- to 3-fold lower, as determined from the D<sub>37</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>)]. However, these lower expressing lines were clearly no more sensitive to MMC than parental 51D1Lox cells that express reduced levels of hamster Rad51D [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)].</p></sec><sec><title>No complementation of <italic>rad51d</italic> cells by ectopic expression of RAD51D Walker B-motif ATPase mutants</title><p>Since we observed almost no abnormality in cellular phenotype for the Walker A-motif mutations, we hypothesized that the Walker B motif may predominately determine the function of RAD51D. To test this possibility, we mutated the highly conserved aspartate (D206) to alanine (D206A; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). For comparison purposes, we also made the previously uncharacterized V203E substitution within motif B of RAD51D. This valine was chosen for mutagenesis as it is conserved among the human RAD51 paralogs RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D and XRCC3, and in mouse and hamster Rad51D. Both expression constructs (<italic>V203E</italic> and <italic>D206A</italic>) were separately transfected into <italic>rad51d</italic> cells, and cells were selected in the continuous presence of either hygromycin alone or hygromycin plus increasing concentrations of MMC. The extent of complementation for expression of <italic>all RAD51D</italic> constructs was assessed by comparing the number of colonies arising in hygromycin and MMC to the number of colonies arising in hygromycin alone. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, ectopic expression of either RAD51D-V203E or RAD51D-D206A does not result in complementation of MMC sensitivity of <italic>rad51d</italic> cells measured by colony formation. Conversely, in this same method of analysis, expression of wild-type RAD51D, or the Walker A box mutants RAD51D-K113R and RAD51D-K113A resulted in high MMC resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) albeit expression of either K113R or K113A did not fully protect against killing. Whether these latter modest reductions are biochemically significant is unclear since the expression levels of the A-motif mutant proteins could be slightly lower than that of wild-type. As with the A-motif mutants, both B-motif mutants are expressed stably in <italic>rad51d</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inability of RAD51D Walker B mutants to interact with XRCC2 in the yeast two-hybrid system</title><p>As RAD51D B-motif mutants are unable to repair MMC-induced DNA damage, we investigated whether disruptions occur in the interactions between RAD51D and its known paralog partners. To do so, we employed the yeast two- and three-hybrid systems and tested whether mutant RAD51D would be able to interact with either XRCC2 or RAD51C. Each of the described forms of RAD51D (wild-type, K113R, K113A, V203E and D206A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using previously described vectors carrying wild-type <italic>RAD51D</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). First, each RAD51D protein was tested for binding to wild-type XRCC2 in both orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The average strength of the RAD51D-K113R:XRCC2 interactions was 75 or 57% of the wild-type RAD51D:XRCC2 interaction (dependent on the orientation of the Gal4-fusion), and the average strength of RAD51D-K113A:XRCC2 interactions was very close to wild-type levels (100 and 90%, depending on the orientation tested; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, both B-motif mutants displayed greatly reduced interaction with XRCC2 in either fusion orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The average strength of the RAD51D-V203E:XRCC2 interactions was determined to be at 1 and 3% of the wild-type interaction, and the average strength of the RAD51D-D206A:XRCC2 interactions was at 3 and 11% of the wild-type interaction (depending on the orientation tested). To ensure that the RAD51D mutants are produced in amounts adequate to detect positive protein interactions in the yeast <italic>two</italic>-hybrid system, we tested the protein expression levels for Gal4-RAD51D and its mutant forms by immunoblotting of total protein extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As for the wild-type, all mutant forms of the Gal-RAD51D fusions were produced at high levels in yeast. Although K113R, V203E and D206A were repeatedly expressed at slightly lower levels than the wild-type and K113A, the failure of XRCC2 to interact with V203E and D206A is not due to the unavailability of these mutant proteins in yeast. For example, even though K113R and V203E are expressed at similar levels, they differ greatly in their ability to interact with XRCC2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inability of RAD51D Walker B mutants to interact with RAD51C in the yeast three-hybrid system</title><p>The interaction between human RAD51D and RAD51C, when tested in the yeast <italic>two</italic>-hybrid system, is comparatively weak, making it difficult to quantitatively assess protein&#x02013;protein interactions that potentially are reduced even further. However, co-expression of RAD51B, in a non-fused form, has been shown previously to greatly enhance the strength of the RAD51D:RAD51C interaction in a yeast three-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> a stable RAD51D-RAD51C heterodimer has not been discovered, whereas RAD51D and RAD51C were shown to be part of the heterotetramer that also contains RAD51B and XRCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). For these reasons, we used the yeast three-hybrid system to assess the ability of either wild-type or mutant RAD51D to interact with RAD51C when RAD51B is co-expressed. We found that the average strength of interactions between Walker A K113R and RAD51C was reduced to 60% of the wild-type level, and the average strength of interactions between Walker A K113A and RAD51C was at 67% of the wild-type interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, the interactions between RAD51D Walker B mutants and RAD51C were virtually eliminated, not differing from the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>No co-immunoprecipitation of RAD51D Walker B mutants with hamster Xrcc2</title><p>To investigate <italic>in vivo</italic> complex formation between wild-type or mutant human RAD51D and hamster Xrcc2, we performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation in extracts from <italic>rad51d</italic> clones that stably express the ectopic proteins at similar levels. We found that hamster Xrcc2 is present specifically in anti-RAD51D immunoprecipitated complexes from clone WT2 (which overexpresses wild-type RAD51D) and not immunoprecipitated using IgG control antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, CHO cells appear to express two isoforms of Xrcc2 (as indicated by the double arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>&#x02013;C) that both bind to RAD51D. The faster migrating isoform displays the same mobility as recombinant human XRCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), while the second isoform appears to be larger and migrates with a shift that corresponds to a 2&#x02013;3 kD difference in molecular weight. It is likely, but not clear yet, that this larger form of hamster Xrcc2 may be a modified version of the protein. We also have observed both isoforms of Xrcc2 in V79 hamster cells but not in mouse mammary epithelial cells (data not shown). Importantly, Xrcc2 was present in anti-RAD51D immunoprecipitated complexes from <italic>rad51d</italic> cells overexpressing A-motif mutants (K113R and K113A), but absent in anti-RAD51D immunoprecipitated complexes from B-motif mutants (D206A and V203E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Although reproducibly at lower levels compared to the wild-type expressing line (WT2; here: GKT), Xrcc2 was always present in anti-RAD51D immunoprecipitated complexes from clones GAT4 and GRT6, which overexpress Walker A K113A and K113R mutant protein, respectively. Anti-RAD51D immunoprecipitated complexes from parental AA8 and <italic>rad51d</italic> cells contained neither RAD51D nor Xrcc2, demonstrating the inability of the anti-RAD51D antibody to recognize the hamster Rad51D protein in AA8 cells and the absence of human RAD51D in <italic>rad51d</italic> cells.</p><p>In reciprocal experiments we analyzed anti-Xrcc2 immunoprecipitated complexes from all cell lines for the presence of RAD51D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We found that the amounts of endogenous Xrcc2 directly precipitated by anti-XRCC2 antibody varied greatly among all cell lines tested (even though their expression levels for ectopic RAD51D were comparable; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Only small amounts of Xrcc2 were precipitated from extracts of <italic>rad51d</italic> cells and <italic>rad51d</italic> cells expressing Walker B-motif mutants D206A or V203E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Significantly larger amounts of Xrcc2 were precipitated from cells overexpressing wild-type RAD51D, K113R or K113A and from AA8 cells. (Note: for AA8 cells only 1/16 of the amount of the precipitated complex was loaded onto the gel, relative to all other cell lines). We reproducibly detected wild-type RAD51D (here: GKT), K113R and K113A in anti-Xrcc2 immunoprecipitated complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lower panel). Not surprisingly, only small amounts of Walker B mutant proteins were present in anti-Xrcc2 complexes from <italic>rad51d</italic> cells overexpressing either V203E or D206A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In sum, these results show that ectopically expressed wild-type RAD51D, or RAD51D with mutations in the Walker A motif, formed a stable complex with hamster Xrcc2. Conversely, motif-B mutants, although expressed at similar levels, had reduced levels of hamster Xrcc2, probably due to the inability to stabilize this protein as a RAD51D-Xrcc2 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Greatly impaired interaction of XRCC2-K54A and RAD51D in the yeast two-hybrid system</title><p>As we observed little decrease in interaction between RAD51D A-motif mutants and Xrcc2/XRCC2 both <italic>in vivo</italic> and in the yeast two-hybrid system, we hypothesized that XRCC2's Walker A motif participates in nucleotide-binding within the XRCC2-RAD51D heterodimer. Interestingly, a newly identified Rad51 paralog in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, Rlp1, having homology to human XRCC2 shows a conserved Walker A motif but no clearly defined Walker B motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Therefore, we made the conservative K54R and non-conservative K54A substitutions in the Walker A motif of XRCC2, using previously described yeast two-hybrid plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), and assayed their interaction with wild-type RAD51D, RAD51D-K113R or RAD51D-K113A qualitatively and in both orientations by X-Gal filter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and B, respectively). XRCC2-K54A was greatly impaired in binding to wild-type RAD51D and mutant RAD51D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and B, respectively; light blue and white colonies). However, XRCC2-K54R was able to interact with wild-type RAD51D and both motif-A mutants of RAD51D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and B, respectively). In addition, we introduced L148S or D149A amino acid substitutions within the Walker B motif of XRCC2 and assessed whether these XRCC2 mutants could interact with wild-type RAD51D in the yeast two-hybrid system. Both XRCC2-L148S and XRCC2-D149A were impaired in binding to wild-type RAD51D, although B-motif mutants of XRCC2 appeared to be less detrimental to the XRCC2:RAD51D interaction than B-motif mutants of RAD51D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To our knowledge we have described the first human ATPase with disparate requirements for two highly conserved Walker A/B motifs, both of which are generally crucial components of the nucleotide-binding site. Because of the complete loss of RAD51D function caused by amino acid substitution within its conserved B motif, the contrasting finding, of normal biological function for GKT substitutions within the A motif, was quite unexpected. Moreover, a recent study of mouse Rad51D using <italic>rad51d</italic> mouse cells, in which only A-motif mutants were examined, reached the opposite conclusion, &#x02018;that conservation of Walker Motif A is required for a physiological role of RAD51D&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Relative to the wild-type control, these authors reported &#x0223c;90% decrease in cell survival after exposure to MMC for K113R and K113A mutants in bulk transfected cell populations. However, these investigators did not perform standard MMC dose-response measurements to calculate the dose-reduction factor of cell sensitivity associated with the mouse Rad51D mutant forms. Since we also observed a slightly increased sensitivity to MMC (calculated by dose-reduction factor) under some conditions for both acute and chronic exposures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), the only discrepancy between our survival data and theirs is the <italic>extent</italic> of reduced complementation by the A-motif mutants.</p><p>In addition, Gruver <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) reported moderately impaired interactions of mouse Rad51D A-motif mutants with Xrcc2, but strongly impaired interactions with Rad51C in the yeast two-hybrid system. Although we also found greatly impaired interactions between the human RAD51D Walker A mutants and RAD51C in yeast two-hybrid experiments when monitored qualitatively (data not shown), in the yeast three-hybrid system we found that these interactions were only moderately affected when tested in the presence of RAD51B. As discussed in the Results above, we believe that the yeast three-hybrid system more closely reflects the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction context.</p><p>Similar to our finding of gross defects associated with the B-motif D206A mutant of RAD51D, human XRCC3 substitution at the corresponding aspartate (D213N) dramatically reduced MMC resistance when expressed in hamster <italic>xrcc3</italic> irs1SF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). As suggested by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), substitution of this highly conserved aspartate likely disrupts ATP binding and/or hydrolysis activity. Nonetheless, XRCC3 does behave differently from RAD51D in that both Walker motifs are critical for XRCC3's function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).</p><p>We presented evidence that alterations in the Walker B motif of RAD51D (V203E or D206A substitutions) greatly impair RAD51D-XRCC2 complex formation. Co-immunoprecipitation clearly shows that, in the presence of these non-complementing RAD51D mutant proteins, there is much less hamster Xrcc2 protein than under conditions where complementing RAD51D (i.e. wild-type or motif-A mutants) is available. It is important to note from these experiments that the <italic>rad51d</italic> knockout cell line itself (i.e. untransfected) also expresses greatly reduced levels of endogenous Xrcc2 protein when compared to its AA8 parent line, which expresses wild-type hamster Rad51D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Our findings are consistent with several studies showing the stabilization of RAD51 paralogs by each other <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>), but our data additionally demonstrate that the ability to interact directly is required for this stabilization. In addition, neither Walker B-motif mutant is able to interact with the RAD51B:RAD51C heterodimer in the yeast three-hybrid system.</p><p>The loss of RAD51D-XRCC2 and RAD51D-RAD51C interactions by disruption of nucleotide binding (V203E or D206A substitutions) raises the question of which biochemical defect (nucleotide binding or protein&#x02013;protein interaction) is responsible for the cellular phenotype of high sensitivity to MMC. Our preferred view is that the role of the ATPase activity that is blocked by the V203E and D206A substitutions is to mediate a conformational change that promotes tight binding of RAD51D with XRCC2 and/or RAD51C. In this model ATPase site integrity and protein interaction are inseparable.</p><p>Reiterative changes in protein conformation are important for the assembly of multi-subunit protein complexes that function in DNA repair [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>)]. Rad51 family members induce these conformational changes, necessary to fulfill protein function, by binding and hydrolysis of ATP [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>)]. X-ray crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>) and electron microscopy reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>) of several Rad51 homologs have provided evidence that ATP-binding occurs at the subunit interface by contacting several highly conserved residues on neighboring subunits. We surmise that human RAD51D, through its Walker B motif, may rely on the A motif of another RAD51 paralog to form an active ATPase.</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that RAD51D must form a complex with XRCC2 and/or RAD51C to maintain cellular resistance to MMC. We showed that both interactions require a normal RAD51D Walker B motif, but not an intact A motif. We speculate that the binding of ATP to RAD51D occurs through its Walker B box as part of a bipartite nucleotide-binding site interacting with XRCC2 and/or RAD51C, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, the B motif of RAD51D interacts with the A motif of XRCC2. We showed that mutations in either of these motifs block the interaction; disruption of the XRCC2 A motif via K54A substitution (but not K54R substitution) greatly diminishes its binding to RAD51D in the yeast two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and B). One published observation is inconsistent with the idea that the RAD51D-XRCC2 interaction is important for efficient DNA repair. In that study, the XRCC2 A-motif K45A mutant showed only modest decrements in MMC resistance in irs1 V79 cells transfected with mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) (although western blotting of these transfectants was not used to standardize the expressed XRCC2 protein levels). Moreover, in our yeast two-hybrid studies amino acid substitutions within the Walker B motif of XRCC2, though clearly affecting the XRCC2:RAD51D interaction, appear to be less deleterious to XRCC2:RAD51D complex formation in comparison with the RAD51D B-motif mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> depicts an ATPase site composed of the B motif of RAD51D and the A motif of RAD51C. Similar to our results for the B motif of RAD51D, mutations in the A motif of RAD51C also cause 80&#x02013;100% loss of DNA repair efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Although RAD51D-RAD51C interactions were not examined in that study, we found a severe RAD51D:RAD51C interaction defect in the yeast three-hybrid system for the RAD51D B-motif mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we provide evidence that the Walker B motif of human RAD51D is critically important for complex formation with other RAD51 paralogs and for cellular resistance to ICLs. Since both Walker B-motif substitutions (V203E and D206A) yielded a similar phenotype, we propose that these substitutions not only abrogate ATP hydrolysis, but also simultaneously prevent one or more critical interaction(s) and conformational changes underlying RAD51D's participation in complexes, whose integrity is necessary for recombinational repair.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Drs M.-S.
