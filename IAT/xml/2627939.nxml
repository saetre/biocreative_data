Tumors can also form in telomerase-deficient mice; however, the genetic mechanism responsible for tumor growth without telomerase is unknown. In yeast, several different recombination pathways maintain telomeres in the absence of telomerase&#x02014;some result in telomere maintenance with minimal effects on telomere length. To examine non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance in mammalian cells, we used primary cells and lymphomas from telomerase-deficient mice (mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; and E&#x003bc;myc&#x0002b;mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212;) and CAST/EiJ mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. These cells were analyzed using pq-ratio analysis, telomere length distribution outliers, CO-FISH, Q-FISH, and multicolor FISH to detect subtelomeric recombination. Telomere length was maintained during long-term growth <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Long telomeres, characteristic of human ALT cells, were not observed in either late passage or mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; tumor cells; instead, we observed only minimal changes in telomere length. Telomere length variation and subtelomeric recombination were frequent in cells with short telomeres, indicating that length maintenance is due to telomeric recombination. We also detected telomere length changes in primary mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells that had short telomeres. Using mouse mTR&#x0002b;/&#x02212; and human hTERT&#x0002b;/&#x02212; primary cells with short telomeres, we found frequent length changes indicative of recombination. We conclude that telomere maintenance by non-telomerase mechanisms, including recombination, occurs in primary cells and is initiated by short telomeres, even in the presence of telomerase. Most intriguing, our data indicate that some non-telomerase telomere maintenance mechanisms occur without a significant increase in telomere length.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Telomeres shorten with each cell division and are normally maintained by telomerase. Tumor cells typically up-regulate telomerase to maintain telomeres during rapid growth; however, some tumors lack telomerase and utilize alternative mechanisms to maintain the telomeres. Studies in yeast indicate that recombination contributes to telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase. To examine whether recombination contributes to non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance in mouse and human cells, we utilized mouse primary and tumor cells, which were genetically deleted for telomerase. In addition, we assayed human primary cells that had short telomeres due to reduced telomerase activity. Our data indicate that cells with short telomeres have an increased level of telomere recombination, which can occur in telomeric or subtelomeric regions. We also found that, in addition to tumor cells, primary cells can utilize non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance. Lastly, we found that, unlike human telomerase negative tumors, some mechanisms of telomere maintenance do not result in dramatic telomere lengthening. Thus, mammalian cells likely utilize several different non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance. These findings will be useful for understanding the process of telomere lengthening in various types of human tumors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Telomere length is maintained by the ribonucleoprotein complex telomerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Greider1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice lack telomerase activity, no phenotype is observed in the first generation, due to the long telomeres observed in laboratory mouse strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Blasco1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Kipling1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. When mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice are bred, progressive telomere shortening occurs in successive generations. Early generation, mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212;G1, mice are obtained by crossing mTR&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice. Crossing the knockouts through successive generations results in mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; G2&#x02013;G6 generations. Late generation mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; G4&#x02013;G6 mice have short telomeres and show loss of fertility due to germ cell apoptosis. Wild-derived mouse strains such as CAST/EiJ have significantly shorter telomere length distributions, similar to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Hemann1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, telomere shortening and consequent loss of tissue renewal capacity occurs in CAST/EiJ mice even in the presence of telomerase, and provides the opportunity to examine the effects of short telomeres in the presence of telomerase.</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that ALT occurs by DNA recombination in human tumors and immortalized cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Bryan2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. First, the initial description of ALT demonstrated that the telomeres are exceptionally long and heterogeneous in human tumors and immortalized cell lines which lack telomerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Bryan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, telomere lengths in ALT cells fluctuate during proliferation, and this fluctuation can be detected by examining the change in the telomere lengths at the p- and q-arm of the Y-chromosome in a rapidly growing culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Bryan2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Murnane1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Finally, human ALT tumors show frequent telomere sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCEs), that are detectable using chromosome orientation FISH (CO-FISH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Bailey1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-LondonoVallejo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Evidence that recombination contributes to telomere length maintenance was initially discovered in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.

The telomeres of Type I survivors are short and the cells have amplified Y&#x02032; sequence. They are likely generated by Rad51-dependent break-induced replication (BIR). Type II survivors grow much more rapidly than Type I survivors. They have elongated telomere sequence tracts, require Rad59, Rad50 and other components of the MRX complex, and are predominately generated by Rad51-independent BIR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Le1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-McEachern1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

In mouse and human cells the T-SCE assay, which is frequently used to measure telomere recombination, will not detect recombination by BIR mechanisms. Further, T-SCEs are exchanges and thus will not result in net telomere elongation as occurs in BIR. Thus we sought to use other assays to examine telomere recombination in telomerase null mouse cells.</p><p>To examine the role of short telomeres during telomere recombination in mammalian cells we assayed cells using pq-ratios, outliers, CO-FISH, and Q-FISH from two different strains of telomerase deficient (mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice. We found that late passage CAST/EiJ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and E&#x003bc;myc&#x0002b;mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; lymphomas with short telomeres, exhibit telomere maintenance with minimal changes to the overall length distribution. Consistent with telomere recombination, we observed an increase in pq-ratio changes and outliers in mouse cells with increasing numbers of short telomeres. We directly showed that subtelomeric recombination is increased in cells with elevated pq-ratio changes. These pq-ratio changes were seen associated with short telomeres even in telomerase positive cells, suggesting that telomerase itself does not protect against recombination. Our data suggest that, several distinct recombination-based mechanisms can contribute to telomere maintenance in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6J mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; and CAST/EiJ mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; were generated as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Blasco1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Hao1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

We examined whether short telomeres may initiate the non-telomerase maintenance mechanisms operating in these cells. We utilized a previously described pq-ratio assay, which can account for different types of telomere recombination mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Perrem1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This assay is based on the Q-FISH assay, which quantitates the telomere length on metaphase spreads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Zijlmans1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. As cells divide in culture, both telomeres of a given chromosome should shorten by similar amounts. This results in a near constant telomere ratio at the p and q arms for each individual chromosome in a population of growing cells. However, if recombination occurs, it will alter the length of at least one telomere by a random amount. Thus the ratio of the telomere signal on the two ends of a chromosome that underwent recombination will differ from the other copies of that chromosome in the population. For pq-ratio analysis, we initially calculated the pq-ratio for mouse chromosome 1 in a population of growing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000357.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Cells expressing telomerase had few changes in the telomere ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000357.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Similar to human ALT cell lines, we observed that mouse tumor cells lacking telomerase were increased for changes in the pq-ratios <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Perrem1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000357.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Given that this analysis of a single chromosome could be expanded to examine the changes within the entire set of chromosomes of a given metaphase, we proceeded by examining the pq-ratio of every chromosome in a minimum of ten different metaphases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000357-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000357.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

Metaphase spreads were examined for telomere length using Q-FISH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000357.s001">Figure S1 D and E</xref>). Late generation mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212;G4 mice had significantly shorter telomeres than mTR&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; or early generation mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212;G1 mice. We next examined the pq-ratios from metaphase spreads from a population of growing cells and plotted the ratio for each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000357-g002">Figure 2A&#x02013;F</xref>). To quantitate the changes in the pq-ratios, we focused on the percent of chromosomes that had a pq-ratio change of greater than 5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000357-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). In mTR&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; bone marrow the pq-ratios seldom changed from a value near 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000357-g002">Figure 2A, B, and G</xref>).

To directly test whether recombination is occurring in these cells, we developed a subtelomeric recombination assay. We examined the mouse genome sequence for unique loci contained in subtelomeric regions, and identified a terminal BAC clone located at H4 on mouse chromosome 2, which also contained subtelomeric sequences directly adjacent to telomere repeats in the genome. We initially hybridized this sequence to mTR&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells to confirm the copy number of this subtelomeric BAC clone and found the clone hybridized to only two chromosomal termini in wildtype bone marrow metaphase spreads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000357-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We reasoned that if recombination in the telomeric region occurs in the subtelomeric regions, as it does in yeast, amplification and transfer of this sequence to the telomeres of other chromosomes would occur. To determine the frequency of this sequence amplification and transfer, we hybridized metaphase spreads with both the BAC clone and a chromosome 2 specific paint probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000357-g004">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

This subtelomeric amplification and transfer of a unique locus to additional chromosomes correlated directly with increased changes in the pq-ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000357-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that BIR could account for both processes.</p><fig id="pgen-1000357-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000357.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Subtelomeric recombination is frequent in E&#x003bc;myc&#x0002b;mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212;G5 tumors.</title><p>Multicolor FISH using a BAC that maps to the subtelomeric region (green) of mouse chromosome 2 hybridized to metaphase spreads.

The transfer of this unique subtelomeric locus from mouse chromosome 2 to different chromosomes is consistent the possibility of a BIR-like mechanism.</p><p>While T-SCEs are typically used as the main measure of telomere recombination in human ALT cells, it is important to note that BIR pathways would not be detected by the CO-FISH method. Although we did detect T-SCE in the bone marrow cells, the number of T-SCEs did not explain the frequency of telomere length variations, indicating others mechanisms must also play a role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Benetti1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Wang1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, CO-FISH is limited when telomeres are very short, since T-SCEs at short telomeres are very difficult to detect due to the resolution of the telomere probe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Wang2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, some of the accumulating changes in pq-ratios may also arise as a consequence of stalled replication forks that might be accompanied with dysfunctional telomeres. In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, deletion of Taz1, the ortholog of the telomere binding proteins TRF1 and TRF2, can result in replication fork stalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Miller1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Karlseder1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest that dysfunctional telomeres due to the immediate loss of telomere end binding proteins in mammalian cells may result in replication fork stalling, however such intermediates would be predicted to invoke recombination. Thus using pq-ratio and outlier analysis allows detection of various types of recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Non-Telomerase Mechanisms for Telomere Maintenance in Mouse Cells Have a Minimal Effect on Overall Telomere Length</title><p>The use of ALT for telomere maintenance in human cells has characteristically been associated with a dramatic lengthening of telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Bryan3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we find in many instances telomere maintenance can occur without extensive telomere elongation. In E&#x003bc;myc&#x0002b;mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; G6 transgenic mice, short telomeres dramatically limit tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Feldser1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in a few mice, tumors somehow overcome the short telomeres and continue to grow. When these E&#x003bc;myc&#x0002b;mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; tumors were transferred serially through several mice the telomere length was not significantly changed indicating that these tumor cells must utilize non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere length maintenance. However, in sharp contrast to many ALT cell lines, telomeres from these mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells did not exhibit a dramatic telomere lengthening. This result of telomere maintenance without significant telomere elongation is very similar to what is seen in Type I survivors in yeast. In Type I survivors the telomeres are very short and yet they are maintained following many doublings and exemplify that not all telomere recombination mechanisms result in dramatic telomere lengthening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000357-Chen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast the telomere repeat tracts in Type II survivors are dramatically longer than in wildtype cells. Both Type I and Type II survivors can be generated in a population of cells. Yet due to the growth advantage of Type II survivors in liquid culture, only Type II survivors are seen following extensive growth. The difference between human ALT tumor cell lines and the mouse tumor cells shown here suggests that there may be multiple pathways for recombination in mammals as there are in yeast. One type may predominate in human ALT tumors and immortalized cells and another type may be more favored in primary human cells and mouse cells. Future studies will provide insight into the mechanism of the different pathways and their requirement for the growth of tumors in the absence of telomerase.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000357.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Q-FISH analysis on various mTR&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells.
