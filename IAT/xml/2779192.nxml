While inappropriate over-expression of the progranulin gene has been associated with many cancers, haploinsufficiency leads to atrophy of the frontotemporal lobes and development of a form of dementia (frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin positive inclusions, FTLD-U) associated with the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions. Recent reports indicate that progranulin has neurotrophic effects, which, if confirmed would make progranulin the only neuroprotective growth factor that has been associated genetically with a neurological disease in humans. Preliminary studies indicated high progranulin gene expression in spinal cord motor neurons. However, it is uncertain what the role of Progranulin is in normal or diseased motor neuron function. We have investigated progranulin gene expression and subcellular localization in cultured mouse embryonic motor neurons and examined the effect of progranulin over-expression and knockdown in the NSC-34 immortalized motor neuron cell line upon proliferation and survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>In situ </italic>hybridisation and immunohistochemical techniques revealed that the <italic>progranulin </italic>gene is highly expressed by motor neurons within the mouse spinal cord and in primary cultures of dissociated mouse embryonic spinal cord-dorsal root ganglia. Confocal microscopy coupled to immunocytochemistry together with the use of a progranulin-green fluorescent protein fusion construct revealed progranulin to be located within compartments of the secretory pathway including the Golgi apparatus. Stable transfection of the human <italic>progranulin </italic>gene into the NSC-34 motor neuron cell line stimulates the appearance of dendritic structures and provides sufficient trophic stimulus to survive serum deprivation for long periods (up to two months). This is mediated at least in part through an anti-apoptotic mechanism. Control cells, while expressing basal levels of progranulin do not survive in serum free conditions. Knockdown of progranulin expression using shRNA technology further reduced cell survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Neurons are among the most long-lived cells in the body and are subject to low levels of toxic challenges throughout life. We have demonstrated that progranulin is abundantly expressed in motor neurons and is cytoprotective over prolonged periods when over-expressed in a neuronal cell line. This work highlights the importance of progranulin as neuroprotective growth factor and may represent a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases including motor neuron disease.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The granulin-epithelin precursor, progranulin (PGRN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], also called proepithelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], PC-cell-derived growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], or acrogranin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], is a secreted glycoprotein that promotes mitosis, survival, and migration in many cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recent work demonstrates that haploinsufficiency of the <italic>PGRN </italic>gene causes a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) that is associated with the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Several studies have shown that ubiquitinated Tar-DNA Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) is a component of inclusion bodies in both FTLD-U and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] although other ubiquitinated proteins are also present in these inclusion bodies in ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. TDP-43 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in axotomized motor neurons which is consistent with a role for TDP43 in the normal response of motor neurons to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The depletion of PGRN in H4 gliomas results in the activation of caspase-3 and the accumulation of cleaved TDP-43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This is suggestive of a functional relationship between the loss of PGRN and mobilization of TDP-43, although this conclusion has been challenged by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. While PGRN is secreted by many cell types it has been suggested that in neurons its subcellular distribution resembles that of mitochondria or lysosomal-endosomal markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>PGRN is synthesised in neurons in many brain regions including the cerebral cortex, in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, it is widely distributed in the developing central nervous system and the dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia within the peripheral nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The roles of PGRN in normal neuronal function and development, in either the central or peripheral nervous systems are poorly understood. It is known, however, that PGRN contributes to normal brain development since it regulates the male-specific differentiation of the neonatal hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, in culture, PGRN stimulates the proliferation of PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], as well as the estrogen-dependent growth of hippocampal neurospheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and may be neurotrophic for cortical and motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The signalling pathways associated with PGRN in neurons are unknown, but in non-neuronal cell types it activates growth factor-related signal transduction pathways including the phosphorylation of shc, p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase B/AKT, and the p70<sup>S6 </sup>kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and, by so doing, contributes to carcinogenesis in numerous tumour types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. PGRN is involved in wound repair and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and plays an important role in early embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The ability of PGRN to regulate critical proliferative, survival and motility signals in a diverse range of non-neuronal cell types suggests that it may support similar functions in nerve cells.</p><p><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization experiments (see below) revealed that motor neurons express a high level of PGRN, suggesting a significant role for PGRN in the biology of the motor neuron. The significance of PGRN in healthy and diseased motor neurons is, however, unclear. PGRN expression was markedly up-regulated in spinal cord tissue from patients who had ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. While this was probably due to gliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], increased immunoreactive staining for PGRN has been reported both in motor neurons and glial cells in spinal cord and brainstem tissue sections derived from ALS patients relative to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, PGRN expression is increased in the lumbar cord motor neurons from murine models of familial ALS that is caused by mutations in <italic>superoxide dismutase 1 </italic>(<italic>SOD1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. <italic>PGRN </italic>was one of only 21 genes with dysregulated motor neuron expression in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G37R </italic></sup>and <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G85R </italic></sup>mice at the onset of the disease, as judged by weight loss but before the detection of overt neurological symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The <italic>PGRN </italic>gene was also up-regulated in SOD<sup>G93A </sup>mice, but late in the disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In contrast, a decrease in PGRN expression was noted in the NSC-34 neuronal cell line engineered to express SOD<sup>G93A </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. It has been suggested that the <italic>PGRN </italic>gene may be a modulator of disease progression in ALS since a correlation between genetic variations in <italic>PGRN </italic>and the age of onset or survival of patients with ALS has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This observation was not, however, reproduced by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In some patients FTLD may be accompanied by motor neuron disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], but mutations in <italic>PGRN </italic>are infrequent in patients with ALS-FTLD defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], and for those that have been reported it is uncertain whether or not they are pathogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p><p>Growth factors, in particular vascular endothelial growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] and insulin-like growth factor-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], have shown promise as neuroprotective agents in murine models of familial ALS and if PGRN is neurotrophic for motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] it could also have therapeutic potential in ALS. Given the uncertainty of whether or not PGRN contributes to motor neuron function and survival, we sought first to characterize the expression of PGRN in the healthy brain, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia, and then to investigate its possible biological activities in an immortalized motor neuron cell model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PGRN is expressed within multiple neuronal cell populations of the mouse brain and spinal cord</title><p>The expression pattern of PGRN has been described in the adult brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], but not in the remainder of the nervous system.

Specificity of the immunoreactivity was validated by antigen competition using murine PGRN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). PGRN is primarily found in the cell body with a punctate distribution within the cytoplasm. However, PGRN expression was also prominent within the axons of neurons. PGRN was not observed within the nucleus as defined by TDP43 immunofluorescence, nor was it present within mitochondria using Cytochrome C immunofluorescence as the mitochondrial marker (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B-a,b</xref>). Interestingly, PGRN immunostaining did not colocalize with calreticulin, a calcium-binding chaperone that facilitates transit of correctly folded proteins and is a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). PGRN expression was also apparently absent from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) as indicated by the marker GM130 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). This finding was surprising, since the biosynthetic precursor to PGRN carries a signal peptide, the structural cue for passage through the secretory pathway. PGRN did not colocalize with another secreted protein, chromogranin A, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>); however, the size of PGRN vesicles appeared to be of a similar dimension to that of the chromogranin A-containing vesicles. PGRN did appear to have limited colocalization with synaptophysin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>), which is a protein of the synaptic vesicle exocytosis pathway although at the resolution available we cannot exclude the possibility that this is due to a non-specific overlay effect. Few lysosomes, if any were positive for PGRN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>).

Given the disparity between the apparent absence of PGRN immunoreactivity in the ER and Golgi apparatus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) but the presence in PGRN of the structural hallmarks for a protein that should enter the ER and Golgi apparatus including a signal peptide, glycosylation and disulfide bridging it was essential to re-evaluate the localization of PGRN using an independent technique. Lacking an extensive selection of commercial anti-PGRN antibodies validated for use in immuno-staining available at the time, we developed a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PGRN construct to investigate PGRN subcellular localization further. This construct, consisting of an enhanced GFP (eGFP) tag fused to the carboxyl-terminus of the human PGRN gene (named pEGFP-N1-hPGRN), was transiently transfected into NSC-34 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). 48 hours after transfection, confocal microscopy of the cells demonstrated successful transfection, and a granule-like appearance for the Green Fluorescent Protein signal that was very different from that of control empty eGFP vector-transfected cells in which eGFP vector expression was more nuclear (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8c</xref>). The pEGFP-N1-hPGRN expressing cells demonstrated clear colocalization of EGFP-PGRN within the TGN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>). Furthermore, PGRN distribution was distinct from that of the mitochondria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>). The presence of the eGFP-tagged PGRN in the Golgi apparatus is not secondary to PGRN over-expression since when we over-expressed untagged PGRN in NSC34 cells, as with the primary motor neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), no untagged-PGRN immunoreactivity was detected in the Golgi apparatus (data not shown).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>pEGFP-N1-hPGRN cloning construct</bold>. The human PGRN cDNA (hpgrn) was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid using EcoR1 and Sal1 restriction enzyme digestion sites.

While mutations of <italic>PGRN </italic>do not appear to cause ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], recent work suggests that PGRN is neurotrophic for spinal cord motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Here we confirmed that PGRN mRNA and protein is expressed in mouse spinal motor neurons, both <italic>in situ </italic>and in primary culture (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Other spinal cord neurons, and spinal cord microglia also express PGRN. The expression in microglia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), which also has been seen in the brains of Alzheimer's patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], is of interest, given that microgliosis accompanies motor neuron degeneration. Recent evidence demonstrates that in peripheral inflammation, PGRN inhibits the activity of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and it is possible that PGRN may also regulate inflammatory processes in the spinal cord.</p><p>Cells of different origins handle PGRN in different ways. Whereas epithelial cells appear to secrete PGRN constitutively, innate immune cells including neutrophils process this growth factor to yield 6 kDa granulin peptides that are stored within granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Similarly, PGRN is stored within the acrosomes of guinea pig spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which are vesicular storage structures. In addition, yeast-two hybrid studies have identified PGRN as a potential partner for nuclear proteins such as cyclin-T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>], adding a further level of complexity to the localization and roles of PGRN.</p><p>The subcellular localization and fate of PGRN in neurons has not been previously defined. PGRN appears to be a strong candidate for entry into the ER/Golgi pathways since the PGRN gene encodes a signal sequence for co-translational entry into the ER, it is rich in disulfide bridges and N-glycosylation sites both of which form during transit through the ER and Golgi compartments. However, it has been suggested that in nerve cells PGRN may localize with either mitochondria or endosomal-lysosomal-like structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which, if correct has profound implications with respect to the mechanism of action of PGRN. It was therefore important to clarify the sub-cellular compartmentalization of PGRN in nerve cells.</p><p>Punctate PGRN immunofluorescence was observed within the cell bodies and in the axons of primary motor neurons in culture, but not in their nuclei (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). We were unable to detect any co-localization of PGRN with mitochondria in primary motor neurons in culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B, b</xref>). However, we were also unable to detect immunoreactive PGRN in the ER or Golgi apparatus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a, b</xref>). The absence of PGRN immunoreactivity in the ER/Golgi system despite the structural arguments that suggests it would be likely to enter the secretory pathway, may reflect a genuine dissociation of localization. Given the structural features of mature PGRN this may also be a misleading result due, for example, to low PGRN concentrations in the ER/Golgi resulting from rapid transfer through the secretory pathway. Alternatively the PGRN antibody may not react with immature protein as it transits through the ER/Golgi processing pathways. The monoclonal antibody was raised against recombinant mouse PGRN. It is not known whether it would detect an immature form of the protein, namely the conformation of PGRN found in the ER/Golgi compartment before N-glycosylation and formation of disulfide bridges have been completed. To avoid some of these possible confounding issues we employed an alternate strategy that was independent of immunolocalization to examine the localization of PGRN within neuronal cells. NSC-34 motor neuron-like cells were transfected with a PGRN-eGFP fusion protein (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) or with an eGFP control alone. The eGFP control exhibited green immunofluorescence that concentrated mostly in the nucleus. In contrast PGRN-eGFP exhibited a punctuate fluorescence in the cell body and axons, but not the nucleus, in a pattern that was also observed for intrinsic PGRN. The PGRN-eGFP fusion protein co-localized with GM130, a marker for the trans-Golgi apparatus, but not with a mitochondrial marker (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). We conclude, therefore that neuronal PGRN enters the ER/Golgi secretory pathway.</p><p>There are three major exit pathways from the Golgi apparatus; namely, to the lysosome, to the regulated secretory pathway, which is characterized by dense core secretory granules often containing neuropeptides, or to the constitutive secretory pathway. We detected only limited colocalization of PGRN with lysosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>), suggesting that this is at most only a minor destination for PGRN. The vesicle-like PGRN structures in the motor neurons did not colocalize with chromogranin A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>), indicating that PGRN does not enter the regulated secretory pathway. There was, however, evidence of some co-localization between PGRN and synaptophysin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>), although further investigation using higher resolution techniques are necessary to confirm this. PGRN is unlikely to be secreted primarily from synaptic junctions since it did not co-localize with the SNAP-25 marker for neurotransmitter vesicle docking and release sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). The use of the NSC-34 PGRN-eGFP system in conjunction with confocal microscopy of primary motor neuron cultures may be useful in defining some aspects of PGRN secretion by neurons.</p><p>We used the NSC-34 cell line to investigate the effects of PGRN upon cell growth and survival. Using species-specific reverse-transcription PCR, the expression of human PGRN was confirmed in the NSC-34/PGRN cells, and there was no compensatory alteration in the expression of the murine PGRN mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>). PGRN elicited a change in the appearance of the NSC-34 cells, causing a more flattened cell shape and more prominent neuritic extensions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Serum deprivation was employed as an apoptotic challenge. Upon more prolonged incubation in serum-free medium the number of NSC-34/vector cells declined, becoming statistically significantly different from NSC-34/PGRN between days 12 and 15 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12A</xref>). This was due to reduction in apoptosis in NSC-34/PGRN cells since the number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly lower in cultures of NSC-34/PGRN cells compared to cultures of NSC-34/vector cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12C</xref>). The overall cell number did not significantly increase in NSC34 cell deprived of serum and, except at the earliest time points, the percentage of BrdU positive cells was not significantly changed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12B</xref>), suggesting that PGRN is cytoprotective rather than proliferative for NSC-34 cells in the absence of serum. The ability of exogenous PGRN to increase the survival of NSC-34 cells was confirmed by incubating the wild type NSC-34 cells with purified PGRN in serum free medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12D</xref>). In other non-neuronal cells, such as dermal fibroblasts, PGRN is strongly protective against acidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>], suggesting that it may play a widespread role in protecting cells against metabolic shocks in their microenvironment.</p><p>In order to assess the effect of reduced endogenous PGRN expression upon proliferation, NSC-34 cells were stably transfected with shRNA for PGRN and validated in terms of RNA and protein expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13A, B, C</xref>). In the presence of 10% serum, the NSC-34 cells actively proliferate. Under these conditions the reduction of PGRN mRNA expression using shRNA silencing decreased cell proliferation by about 50% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14A</xref>), but had no significant effect on apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14C</xref>). PGRN added back to the culture medium prevented the inhibition of proliferation brought about by PGRN shRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14B</xref>). This confirms the specificity of PGRN shRNA and suggests that PGRN acts primarily through an extracellular mechanism. Therefore, PGRN supports both cell survival (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>) and proliferation of NCS-34 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>) and these activities can be functionally separated depending on growth conditions.</p><p>The enhanced synthesis of PGRN provided prolonged trophic support for NSC-34 cells in the absence of serum for periods of at least 60 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11D</xref>). The extended serum-free cultures continued to show a mixed population of rounded and more-differentiated cells, however neuron-like cells were maintained throughout. In these cultures the projections became highly elongated, and were dynamic structures that displayed structural rearrangement over a period of a few hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref>). PGRN may promote neurite extension in cortical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and in short-term NSC34-PGRN cultures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>), however we cannot exclude the possibility that the extended length of projections in the long-term serum-deprived NSC-34/PGRN cultures may be due to improved overall cellular health rather than the direct stimulation of neurite outgrowth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Primary motor neuron cultures and the NSC-34 cell line provide useful models in which to investigate the cell biology, function and mode of action of PGRN in neurons. We have demonstrated that PGRN is highly expressed in normal spinal cord neurons, and that it enters the ER/Golgi secretory pathway. Over-expression of PGRN in NSC-34 cells was able to substitute for serum as a trophic support for periods of up to 2 months. Purified PGRN added to the medium of serum-deprived NSC34 cells also decreased the rate of cell death. PGRN knockdown inhibited NSC34 cell proliferation in the presence of serum. This work supports the hypothesis that PGRN is neurotrophic and its actions are mediated by extracellular mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization</title><p>ISH was conducted as described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] with slight modification.
