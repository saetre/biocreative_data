How self-reactive T cells are kept functionally inactive is, however, unknown. In this study, we show that early growth response gene 2 (Egr-2), a zinc-finger transcription factor, is expressed in CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells and controls their proliferation and activation. In the absence of Egr-2, CD44<sup>high</sup>, but not CD44<sup>low</sup> T cells, are hyperreactive and hyperproliferative in vivo. The accumulation of activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells leads to the development of a late onset lupuslike autoimmune disease characterized by the accumulation of interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; and interleukin (IL)-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens, massive infiltration of T cells into multiple organs and glomerulonephritis. We found that the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1 was impaired in Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells, whereas the expression of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 in response to T cell receptor ligation was significantly increased, suggesting that Egr-2 activates the expression of genes involved in the negative regulation of T cell proliferation and inflammation. These results demonstrate that Egr-2 is an intrinsic regulator of effector T cells and controls the expansion of self-reactive T cells and development of autoimmune disease.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: APC, allophycocyanin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; cKO, conditional KO; ds, double stranded; Egr-2, early growth response gene 2.</p></fn><fn><p>B.

The outcome of a T cell response to antigen stimulation is regulated by the interplay and complex interaction of positive (stimulatory) and negative (inhibitory) pathways. In optimal immune responses, antigen and costimulatory molecules from activated antigen-presenting cells induce strong mitogenic signals in naive T cells, leading to proliferation and differentiation of effector T cells. However, under tolerant or homeostatic conditions, such as the lack of costimulatory signals or self-antigen stimulation, T cells either do not respond or undergo homeostatic proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The molecular pathways controlling the different responses after TCR engagement are largely unknown.</p><p>Recently, we and others have found that Egr-2 is induced in tolerant T cells in response to antigen stimulation in vivo or TCR ligation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Egr-2 is a member of a family of zinc finger proteins, which consists of four members, Egr-1, -2, -3, and -4, and has been found to play a critical role in hindbrain development and myelination of the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Together with Egr-1 and -3, Egr-2 is expressed in thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) and in mature T cells upon TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). RNA interference (RNAi)&#x02013;mediated knockdown of Egr-2 in an established T cell line rendered the cells less susceptible to anergy induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), whereas overexpression of Egr-2 reduced T cell activation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) indicating that Egr-2 regulates genes involved in the suppression of T cell activation. However, the function of Egr-2 in T cells in vivo has not been studied, as Egr-2 KO mice die perinatally because of defects in hindbrain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that Egr-2 is expressed in effector phenotype T cells in the absence of obvious antigen stimulation in vivo. To assess the function of Egr-2 in T cells in vivo, we established Egr-2 conditional KOs (Egr-2 cKO), in which the Egr-2 gene was deleted specifically in CD2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes. The Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells did not show altered primary activation, but were hyperproliferative in response to prolonged stimulation and exhibited a Th1 and Th17 bias leading to the development of a lupuslike syndrome in older mice. Defective expression of p21cip1 was detected in CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells from Egr-2 cKO mice, and Egr-2 was found to interact directly with the promoter of p21cip1 in vivo. In addition, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 were highly induced in Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells, and accumulation of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013; and IL-17&#x02013;producing cells was associated with massive infiltration of T cells in multiple organs. Our results demonstrate that Egr-2 is important for controlling the self-tolerance of T cells and preventing autoimmunity through activation of negative regulators of cell proliferation and by controlling proinflammatory cytokine expression.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Egr-2 negatively regulates the proliferation of activated T cells, but not naive T cells</title><p>In previous studies, we and others found that Egr-2 can be induced in tolerant T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). To study the function of Egr-2 in T cells in vivo, we established Egr-2 cKO by crossing hCD2 promoter-cre transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) with Egr-2-flox/flox mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Egr-2 WT alleles, floxed alleles, and the presence of the hCD2-cre transgene were determined by PCR (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080187/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080187/DC1</ext-link>). Egr-2 was completely deleted from T cells in Egr-2 cKO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, expression of Egr-2 was still detected in B cells from Egr-2 cKO mice (Fig. S1), which is consistent with the weak activity of the CD2 promoter in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Enhanced proliferative responses of Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells to sustained IL-2 stimulation.</bold> hCD2-Cre/Egr-2 floxed mice were identified by PCR with primer pairs specific for iCre, WT Egr-2, and floxed Egr-2 (Fig. S1). (A) The expression of Egr-2 in T cells from spleens of Egr-2 cKO and WT mice before and after TCR ligation in vitro was examined by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. The relative expression of Egr-2 mRNA was measured after normalizing against &#x003b2;-actin. (B) Proliferation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from spleens of Egr-2 cKO and WT mice was analyzed in response to anti-CD3/CD28&#x02013;coated beads or uncoated beads as a control.

The data are representative of three to five experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052295f01"></graphic></fig><p>The deletion of Egr-2 did not alter the development of the major thymocyte subsets, regulatory T cells, and major subgroups of peripheral T and B cells (Figs.

However, after primary stimulation, under the condition of sustained IL-2 exposure, Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells started to proliferate much faster than T cells from Egr-2-flox/flox mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). To exclude possible effects of the Cre transgene on T cell activation, T cells from hCD2 promoter-cre transgenic mice were also used for stimulation and showed the same responses as T cells from Egr-2-flox/flox mice (unpublished data), which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Thus, Egr-2-flox/flox mice were used as a WT control.</p><p>The enhanced proliferation of T cells from Egr-2 cKO mice did not result from alteration of IL-2 signaling, as indicated by a normal level of STAT5 activation in Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells in response to TCR ligation (Fig. S4).

Collectively, these data suggest that Egr-2 does not affect TCR signaling or apoptosis induction, but instead controls the subsequent expansion of activated T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Egr-2 is expressed in CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells and is required for controlling the proliferation and activation of T cells in vivo</title><p>The hyperproliferation of Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells in response to sustained, but not primary, stimulation suggests that Egr-2 deficiency may have more profound effects on T cells that have differentiated to an effector phenotype, rather than naive T cells in vivo. In the absence of antigen immunization, CD44<sup>high</sup> effector phenotype T cells are predominantly the result of exposure to environmental antigen, such as gut flora, or to certain self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Therefore, the responses of CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells have to be controlled to prevent the development of autoimmune or hypersensitivity reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). To investigate Egr-2 expression in CD44<sup>high</sup> and CD44<sup>low</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD44<sup>low</sup> T cells were isolated from spleens of WT mice by FACS. Egr-2 transcripts were highly expressed in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells in contrast to the minimal expression in the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>low</sup> population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Furthermore, Egr-2 protein was only detected in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). These results demonstrate that Egr-2 is expressed in effector phenotype T cells in vivo. To investigate the effect of Egr-2 deficiency on CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells, we examined their population at 3, 8, and 15 mo of age and their proliferative potential in WT and Egr-2 cKO mice. The percentage of CD44<sup>high</sup> CD62L<sup>low</sup> cells, which is characteristic of effector phenotype T cells, was normal at 3 mo, but increased at 8 mo in Egr-2 cKO mice compared with age-matched WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). At 15 mo of age, all of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from spleens of Egr-2 cKO mice were CD44<sup>high</sup> and CD62L<sup>low</sup> in contrast to 21% of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In contrast to the dramatic accumulation of CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells in Egr-2 cKO mice, B cells, NK cells, and macrophages were similar in both mouse types (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080187/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080187/DC1</ext-link>). To assess the proliferative potential of these cells in vivo in the absence of experimental immunization, 8-mo-old mice were fed BrdU for 9 d, and then splenic T cells were analyzed for BrdU incorporation. 29.5% of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> and 21.5% of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells from Egr-2 cKO mice had incorporated BrdU (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In contrast, the percentage of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> cells that had incorporated BrdU from WT mice was 14.1 and 12.1%, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Less than 5% of CD44<sup>low</sup> T cells incorporated BrdU, and the proportion of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>low</sup> T cells was similar in Egr-2 cKO and WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). One possible explanation for the hyperproliferation of CD44<sup>high</sup> cells is that naive CD44<sup>low</sup> T cells have impaired survival in the absence of Egr-2, and that the resulting lymphopenia induces hyperproliferation of CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells. To exclude this possibility, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from 7-mo-old mice were labeled with CFSE and adoptively transferred into WT mice. Consistent with the increase of CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells in vivo, CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells from Egr-2 cKO mice proliferated more than CD44<sup>high</sup> cells from WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), indicating that hyperproliferation of CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells from Egr-2 cKO mice is driven by an intrinsic mechanism.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Egr-2 expression and CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells in vivo.</bold> (A) CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD44<sup>low</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells were sorted from splenocytes of WT mice at 8 mo of age by FACS.

The absence of Egr-2 resulted in hyperproliferation and accumulation of activated CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells, suggesting that Egr-2 cKO mice may be more susceptible to autoimmune disease. However, we did not observe any early onset autoimmunity such as diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease in Egr-2 cKO mice younger than 10 mo of age. However, after 1 yr, Egr-2 cKO mice started to show hair loss and became less active. By 15 mo of age, more than half of the Egr-2 cKO mice had died (12 out of 20 mice), whereas no death was observed in age-matched WT mice. In contrast to age-matched WT mice, the majority of the surviving Egr-2 cKO mice exhibited features of systemic lupuslike autoimmune disease. The mice displayed hair loss and skin lesions and an accumulation of inflammatory mononuclear cells in various tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). Importantly, the majority of the infiltrated mononuclear cells were T cells with a smaller proportion of B cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). After 12 mo, Egr-2 cKO mice showed signs of severe glomerulonephritis with high levels of proteinuria (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>), glomerular alterations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>), and inflammatory cell infiltrates into the kidneys (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Kidney histology revealed deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli of Egr-2 cKO mice, but not WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Although the clinical symptoms of lupuslike disease were only observed in mice older than 12 mo, the glomerular IgG deposits and proteinuria could be detected after 8 mo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). We did not observe a difference between the two genders in susceptibility to disease development. To further investigate the lupuslike autoimmunity observed in Egr-2 cKO mice, total serum Ig and Ig subclass distribution was measured in WT and Egr-2 cKO mice aged between 6 and 12 mo. Total serum Ig in Egr-2 cKO mice was increased compared with age matched WT mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Importantly, among the Ig subclasses, only IgG2a was significantly increased in the sera of Egr-2 cKO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>), indicating a Th1-driven response. Crucially, both anti&#x02013;double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and -histone autoantibodies were detected in Egr-2 cKO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The titer of autoantibodies against dsDNA and histone increased with age and was closely associated with the accumulation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In Egr-2 cKO mice aged 2&#x02013;3 mo, both the percentage of CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells in the spleen and the level of anti-dsDNA and -histone autoantibodies were normal. A low level of autoantibodies was detected after 6 mo, and this increased with age, reaching a very high level in 12-mo-old mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>), mirroring the progressive accumulation of activated effector T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

The p21cip1 promoter contains a GAGGGGGCG site with G residues at the 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9 positions that were shown to be important contacts in the crystal structure of DNA-bound Egr-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), which is the closest homologue to Egr-2 in terms of primary structure. To determine whether Egr-2 binds to this potential site, nuclear proteins were extracted from unstimulated and anti-CD3&#x02013;stimulated MF2.2D9 T cells. Egr-2 was detected only after TCR stimulation of MF2.2D9 cells. Nuclear proteins derived from TCR-stimulated, but not unstimulated, MF2.2D9 cells bound to an oligonucleotide corresponding to this site and the specific interaction was confirmed by a supershift induced by anti&#x02013;Egr-2 antibody, but not Egr-3 antibody (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>). The slow migration of oligonucleotide&#x02013;Egr-2 complexes suggests that Egr-2 may complex with additional factors. To assess whether Egr-2 protein associates with the proximal regions of the mouse p21cip1 promoter in Egr-2&#x02013;expressing MF2.2D9 T cells in vivo, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using MF2.2D9 T cells transduced with Egr-2 or GFP control retrovirus.

To examine the role of Egr-2 in regulation of effector T cell function, we assessed the expression of cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-4, and IL-17, in Egr-2&#x02013;deficient and WT CD4 T cells after TCR ligation. These cytokines are signatures for T cell activation, Th1, Th2, and Th17 differentiation, respectively. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were isolated from spleens of 3-mo-old mice to avoid complications from the increased percentage of CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells in older Egr-2 cKO mice. Consistent with the normal primary responses in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), IL-2 was up-regulated normally in Egr-2 cKO cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>). However, the expression of IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-17A, and IL-17F in Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells was much higher than WT (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Although IFN-&#x003b3; was increased approximately twofold in Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells, the increase in IL-17 was most significant with a four- to fivefold increase compared with WT. Interestingly, IL-4 was reduced in Egr-2&#x02013;deficient CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>). To investigate the relevance of proinflammatory cytokines to the development of autoimmune disease, IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013; and IL-17&#x02013;producing T cells, which are the hallmarks of Th1 and Th17, respectively, were analyzed in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from different ages.

Loss of Egr-2 expression leads to the accumulation of CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells, enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, increased Th1 and Th17 differentiation, and development of a late onset lupuslike autoimmune disease.</p><p>We and others have previously found that Egr-2 is induced in tolerant T cells after TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). We have now found that Egr-2 is normally expressed in CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells, and that Egr-2 deficiency results in a massive accumulation of these cells. CD44<sup>high</sup> is a marker for effector or memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells in WT mice raised in a clean environment are presumably generated in response to commensal antigens, gut flora, or self-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In contrast to the resting CD44<sup>low</sup> naive T cells, CD44<sup>high</sup> cells undergo slow and intermittent proliferation in response to homeostatic stimuli such as self-antigen and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), and also it has been found that CD44<sup>high</sup> memory T cells are intrinsically more sensitive than CD44<sup>low</sup> naive cells to stimulation through the TCR&#x02013;CD8 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). The expression of Egr-2 in CD44<sup>high</sup> cells may be induced from homeostatic responses to serve as a feedback mechanism to control the proliferation and activation of CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells. The development of systemic autoimmune responses in Egr-2 cKO mice demonstrates the importance of such controls.</p><p>Several findings in predisposed mice appear to support the notion that primary or secondary homeostatic lymphocyte perturbations, such as in MRL/lpr and p21cip1 KO mice of C57BL/6 background, contribute to the pathogenesis of spontaneous lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). These findings suggest that uncontrolled T cell proliferation can lead to T cell expansion and generation of effector cells to self-antigens, resulting in the development of lupuslike systemic autoimmune diseases. Our results indicate that Egr-2 is an intrinsic regulator that controls not only proliferation but also inflammation of effector T cells, and also inhibits the development of lupuslike autoimmune diseases. The accumulation of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013; and IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in Egr-2 cKO mice suggests the possibility that the activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are effector inflammatory T cells primed by self-antigen, and that the loss of tolerance in Egr-2 cKO mice leads to the expansion of these cells and autoimmune responses.</p><p>We found that the cell cycle inhibitor p21cip1 is a direct target gene of Egr-2. Egr-2 deficiency results in defective expression of p21cip1 in CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells. Most of the reports from p21cip1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have shown enhanced T cell activation, proliferation, and autoimmune manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), which are largely consistent with Egr-2 cKO mice. However, a study in the BXSB atypical lupus model showed that p21cip1 deletion increased apoptosis of activated T cells and decreased disease incidence in male mice suggesting that p21cip1 regulates proliferative responses by blocking apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). However, the increased apoptosis in response to TCR stimulation suggests a differential effect of p21cip1 in the activation and proliferative responses of T cells. In a recent study in C57BL/6 mice, p21cip1 deletion only enhanced T cell proliferation at a late stage of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), which is consistent with our findings in Egr-2 cKO mice of C57BL/6 background. Collectively, these studies indicate that p21cip1 is involved in the regulation of effector T cell proliferation, but plays only a part of the tolerance program, and its function in lupus development is dependent on the genetic predisposition. Indeed, in addition to the altered expression of p21cip1, enhanced differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells in Egr-2 cKO mice was found. Although we do not yet know how Egr-2 regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, the accumulation of Th1 and Th17 cells can directly result in infiltration of T cells into multiple organs and inflammatory autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). These results have not been reported in p21cip1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>The increased expression of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 in Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells after TCR ligation suggests that Egr-2 may be involved in the control of inflammatory cytokines in effector T cells. Such control may not only be important to prevent inflammatory reactions of autoreactive T cells but also for the reduction of immunopathology during a productive immune response. Although both Th1 and Th17 are observed in most autoimmune models, the mechanisms mediating Th1 and Th17 differentiation in vitro are distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), whereas the in vivo mechanisms are still unknown. NFAT has been found to induce IFN-&#x003b3; expression and activate the IL-17 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Egr-2 is one of the NFAT target genes in T cells. Therefore, the expression of Egr-2 could act as negative feedback loop to control IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 expression in response to TCR stimulation. Although we did not find altered activation of NFAT in Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells from aged mice (unpublished data), the possibility that Egr-2 physically interacts with NFAT and inhibits its activity has yet to be analyzed. The reduced production of Th2 cytokines could either result from enhanced Th1 and Th17 differentiation or direct regulation by Egr-2; future investigations will further examine these hypotheses.</p><p>Both Egr-2 and -3 are expressed in double-negative thymocytes, and defective expression of Egr-3 leads to the accumulation of double-negative thymocytes and reduction of DP thymocytes in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), indicating that Egr-3 is involved in thymocyte development before thymocyte selection. However, we did not find a similar phenotype in the thymus of Egr-2 cKO mice, suggesting that either Egr-2 function at this stage is redundant or that Cre-mediated deletion was incomplete at this stage. T cell lines overexpressing Egr-2 or -3 show an up-regulation of Cbl-b and reduced production of IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). This finding led to the hypothesis that the mechanism for Egr-2 in maintaining T cell tolerance would be down-regulation of TCR signaling. However, we could not detect differences between Egr-2&#x02013;deficient and WT naive T cells in the major TCR signaling pathways, such as AP1, NF-&#x003ba;B, NFAT, and MAP kinase, after TCR stimulation in vitro (Fig. S4 and not depicted). In addition, we did not observe hyperproliferation of naive Egr-2 cKO T cells in response to primary TCR stimulation. This normal response to TCR engagement could be caused by functional compensation by Egr-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Nevertheless, the continuously proliferating T cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) and preactivated primary T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) used in these studies share some features of the hyperactive CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells in Egr-2 cKO mice. Therefore, the negative regulation of T cell activation in these reports is consistent with the hyperproliferation and activation of Egr-2&#x02013;deficient T cells in vivo.</p><p>Egr-2 has been found to induce FasL expression in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).

However, Egr-2 deficiency did not alter expression of FasL in T cells or apoptosis in either young or old mice, and CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells were not detected in spleen of old Egr-2 cKO mice (Fig. S5), suggesting distinct mechanisms for lupuslike disease in Egr-2 cKO and MRL/lpr mice. Recently, reduced expression of Egr-2 and -3 has been found in T cells from BALB/c mice after induction of lupuslike disease by an anti-DNA antibody, and the decreased expression was associated with increased IFN-&#x003b3; secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), suggesting that Egr molecules are involved in the maintenance of self-tolerance.</p><p>Although antinuclear antibodies are hallmarks of systemic lupus, the mechanisms responsible for the breakdown of self-tolerance are still unknown. One of the characteristics of the autoimmune disorder in lupus patients is Th1-mediated inflammation with a high level of IFN-&#x003b3; production and increased serum IgG2a antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), both of which we have observed in aged Egr-2 cKO mice. In addition, a massive increase in IL-17 production in activated T cells and an increased percentage of Th17 cells in Egr-2 cKO mice were observed. Th17 plays an important role in the development of lupuslike disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). These results suggest that autoimmune disorders can result from a loss of control of effector T cell expansion and inflammatory activation, and that this control is mediated by genes regulated by Egr-2.</p><p>Peripheral T cells are tolerant to self-antigens, which is achieved by limiting the expansion and activation of self-reactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). In addition to the function of regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), several intrinsic mechanisms have been discovered that either induce T cell anergy or limit T cell expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), such as the GRAIL E3 ligase, which is induced in anergic T cells and inhibits IL-2 expression by targeting TCR signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In addition, control of T cell growth and regulation of apoptosis are also important mechanisms to maintain self-tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Egr-2 has been found to regulate expression of an E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), and now we show that Egr-2 directly activates p21cip1 expression in CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells and is involved in the control of Th1 and Th17 differentiation. Our data demonstrate that Egr-2 is an intrinsic regulator of effector T cells and is essential for the control of their proliferation and inflammatory activation in the absence of overt antigen stimulation. The fact that Egr-2 is expressed in effector, but not in naive T cells, and controls their proliferation in vivo without interfering with their responses to optimal TCR stimulation provides insight into how the threshold for T cell activation is regulated, thus enabling the activation and expansion of effector T cells only in response to optimal antigen stimulation and limiting the expansion of hypersensitive or potentially autoreactive cells. The development of systemic autoimmune disease in Egr-2 cKO mice with characteristics of human lupus makes this a good model for further studies into the mechanisms of lupus development and could potentially yield novel therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Generation of conditional Egr-2 knock-out mice.</title><p>Egr-2 cKO mice were generated by crossing floxed Egr-2 mice (obtained from P.
