Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family, serves as a neurotrophic molecular and plays a significant role in the brain. We generated mice in which HB-EGF activity is disrupted specifically in the ventral forebrain. These knockout mice showed (a) behavioral abnormalities similar to those described in psychiatric disorders, which were ameliorated by typical or atypical antipsychotics, (b) altered dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, (c) decreases in spine density in neurons of the prefrontal cortex, (d) reductions in the protein levels of the NR1 subunit of the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and post-synaptic protein-95 (PSD-95), (e) decreases in the EGF receptor, and in the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) signal cascade. These results suggest the alterations affecting HB-EGF signaling could comprise a contributing factor in psychiatric disorder.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family of growth factors that includes EGF, transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b1;, amphiregulin, betacelulin, and neuregulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Higashiyama1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Barnard1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

For these reasons, HB-EGF may be an important contributor to neural development.</p><p>Abnormal development of the brain is implicated in the etiology and/or pathology of various psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Rapoport1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, bipolar disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Nasrallah1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Cicchetti1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, among others. Similarly, psychiatric patients can display abnormalities in the expression of cytokines and neurotrophic factors. For instance, the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression are specifically elevated in the hippocampus and cingulated cortex of schizophrenic patient, while conversely, its receptor, trkB protein, is reduced in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. EGF protein levels have been found to be lower in the prefrontal cortex and striatum of schizophrenic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Futamura1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

All of these findings indicate that the EGF signal cascade may contribute to the pathology of a number of psychiatric diseases. On the other hand, since peptides other than authentic EGF (e.g., TGF-&#x003b1; and HB-EGF) are expressed at much higher levels than EGF itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Hayase1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that HB-EGF serves as a major physiologic ligand for the EGF receptor within the central nervous system.</p><p>At the present time, little is known about the relationship between HB-EGF and psychiatric disorders. In the current study, therefore, we have generated HB-EGF conditional knockout (KO) mice that exhibit disruption of HB-EGF activity specifically in the ventral forebrain. We have compared the neurobehavioral and molecular biological characteristics of these mice with those of control mice and have demonstrated that the HB-EGF KO mice exhibit behavioral and biological abnormalities similar to those described in various psychiatric disorders. These results strongly suggest that alterations in HB-EGF signaling contribute to the pathogenesis of mental illness.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of HB-EGF KO mice</title><p>Since a homozygous null mutation of the <italic>Hb-egf</italic> gene causes lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Iwamoto1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, in order to investigate the role of HB-EGF in the (adult/postnatal) brain, we generated ventral forebrain specific HB-EGF KO mice using a Cre-lox-mediated conditional gene KO approach with Six3 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Furuta1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

First, we studied the behavior of HB-EGF KO and control mice in their cages to measure locomotor activity. HB-EGF KO and control mice displayed a normal circadian rhythm (i.e., their activity was reduced during the light phase &#x0005b;8 A.M. to 8 P.M.&#x0005d; and then increased markedly at the beginning of the dark phase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007461-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>).

During the first 0&#x02013;3 hr of the test, HB-EGF KO mice were also more active than control mice, indicating that HB-EGF KO mice are also hyperactive in a novel environment. To test the involvement of dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal systems in the increased locomotor activity, we examined the effects of a potent dopamine (DA) receptor antagonist, haloperidol, and a DA/serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonist, risperidone and clozapine, in HB-EGF KO mice. Haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) ameliorated the hyperlocomotion of HB-EGF KO mice both in dark and light phases (P&#x0003c;0.05 vs. vehicle-treated HB-EGF KO mice in each phases). On the other hand, clozapine reduced the locomotor activity of HB-EGF KO mice only in light phase.

Moreover, PPI deficit observed in HB-EGF KO mice were significantly reversed by atypical antipsychotics, risperidone and clozapine (P&#x0003c;0.05 vs. vehicle-treated HB-EGF KO mice), but not by a typical neuroleptic haloperidol (P&#x0003e;0.05).

During a 10 min social interaction test in a novel environment, the mean duration per contact was significantly less in HB-EGF KO mice than in control mice, indicating that HB-EGF KO mice spent significantly less time engaging in social contact (P&#x0003c;0.05 vs. control mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007461-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>).

The KO mice also showed decreased expression of the NR1, PSD-95, p-CaMKII, and PAK families, and these signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic structure and function in the developing cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Ultanir1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Ehrlich1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the morphological changes observed in dendritic spines may have been a result of the observed decreases in the expression of the NR1, PSD-95, p-CaMKII, and PAK families. These in turn may have led to the abnormalities in behavior and monoamine levels seen in the KO mice.</p><p>Additionally, current evidence indicates that cytokines and growth factors can strongly influence neural phenotypic differentiation and subsequent neural function. Some studies have indicated a potential link between impaired EGF signaling and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Futamura1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Futamura2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the present study, we detected a decrease in p-EGF receptor protein and subsequent activation of ERK signaling in the prefrontal cortex of HB-EGF KO mice (vs. control mice). Consistent with our results, a previous study (using the same line of mice with loxP-flanked <italic>Hb-egf</italic> cDNA) demonstrated that a mutation of the <italic>Hb-egf</italic> gene was associated with decreases in the activation of EGF receptor and ERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Mine1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>MAPKs, also known as ERKs, operate in a signaling cascade that regulates various cellular processes (such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell cycle progression). ERKs are recognized as being important signaling components in learning and memory and in regulating dendritic spine density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Satoh1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Current evidence indicates that continued exposure to clozapine stimulates p-ERKs, mediated by the EGF receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Pereira1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Down-regulation of EGF receptor signaling, induced by mutation of the <italic>Hb-egf</italic> gene, could affect synaptic plasticity by regulating NDMA relating proteins, and this would lead to the abnormal behaviors observed in HB-EGF KO mice.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that HB-EGF KO mice exhibited the behavioral abnormalities reflected in a comprehensive spectrum of psychomotor and cognitive dysfunctions, similar to many psychiatric disorders. Based on the observations from the current study, we proposed a role for HB-EGF in determining monoaminergic neural system and synaptic plasticity. Many psychiatric disorders are multifactorial, reflecting longitudinal and complex interactions of causative agents, including genetic and environmental factors. These findings indicate that the HB-EGF signaling may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of a number of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of HB-EGF KO mice using a gene targeting Cre-loxP and PCR</title><p>The targeting strategy has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007461-Iwamoto1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.
