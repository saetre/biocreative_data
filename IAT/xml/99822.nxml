The telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex consists of two essential components, a reverse transcriptase and an RNA molecule that provides the template for telomeric repeat synthesis. A common secondary structure of vertebrate telomerase RNA has been proposed based on a phylogenetic comparative analysis of 35 sequences. Here we report the identification of an additional essential base-paired region in the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain of mammalian telomerase RNA, termed P6.1. Mouse telomerase RNAs with mutations that disrupted base pairings in the P6.1 helix were unable to reconstitute telomerase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, an RNA mutant with compensatory mutations that restored base pairings in the P6.1 helix restored telomerase activity. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution system stable base pairing of the P6.1 stem was required for the RNA&#x02013;protein interaction between the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain and the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein. Interestingly, two RNA mutations, one that extends the P6.1 stem and one that alters the conserved nucleotides of the L6.1 loop, allowed RNA&#x02013;protein binding but significantly impaired telomerase activity. These data establish the presence of the P6.1 stem&#x02013;loop and its importance for the assembly and enzymatic activity of the mammalian telomerase complex.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that maintains telomere length by adding telomeric sequence repeats onto telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c2">2</xref>). Telomerase consists of two essential core components, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c3">3</xref>) and the telomerase RNA. The RNA component of telomerase contains a short template element that determines the sequence of telomere repeats added onto chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c5">5</xref>). Telomerase RNA genes have been isolated from a variety of organisms. The sizes and sequences of telomerase RNA vary dramatically among mammals (300&#x02013;500 nt), yeast (&#x0223c;1300 nt) and ciliates (150&#x02013;200 nt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c10">10</xref>). Telomerase RNAs cloned from 20 different ciliates have a conserved secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c12">12</xref>). A common secondary structure of vertebrate telomerase RNA was proposed based on a phylogenetic comparative analysis of 35 telomerase RNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c10">10</xref>). Although there is no obvious sequence homology, the structure of vertebrate telomerase RNA displays a significant architectural homology to the ciliate RNA structure.</p><p>The conserved structural elements of telomerase RNA are likely to be involved in telomerase function. There are four highly conserved structural domains in the vertebrate telomerase RNA: the pseudoknot, the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain, the box H&#x0002f;ACA domain and the CR7 domain (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f1">1</xref>).

The pseudoknot domain contains both a pseudoknot structural element and the template region for synthesis of telomere repeats. The CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain contains a stem&#x02013;loop structure formed by two sequence-conserved regions (CRs), CR4 and CR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c10">10</xref>). Although the function of this essential CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain is still largely unknown, our data, as well as previous evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c18">18</xref>), indicate that a stable structure of the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain is essential for telomerase activity.</p><p>In the previously proposed secondary structure of vertebrate telomerase RNA, the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain comprises an internal loop, J5&#x0002f;6 and J6&#x0002f;5, with a number of highly conserved nucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f1">1</xref>A). Although a potential paired region within this internal loop was suggested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f1">1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c15">15</xref>), phylogenetic comparison did not support this base pairing because of the lack of sequence co-variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c10">10</xref>). To determine whether this putative helix exists, we generated mutations that either disrupt or restore the base pairings in this helix and analyzed the telomerase activity of the mutant RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>. In one mutant (mTR-m1), 4 nt, <sub>254</sub>AGAG<sub>257</sub> on one side of the putative helix were changed to <sub>254</sub>UCUC<sub>257</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f2">2</xref>A). In a second mutant (mTR-m2), 4 nt on the other side of the helix were changed to <sub>263</sub>GAGA<sub>266</sub>. Both mutations disrupt the potential base pairing of the putative P6.1 helix. A third mutation (mTR-m3) that combined the first two, <sub>254</sub>UCUC<sub>257</sub>&#x0002f;<sub>263</sub>GAGA<sub>266</sub>, was made to restore the base-pairing ability, although the sequence of the stem was altered.</p><p>To test the ability of mTR mutants to reconstitute functional telomerase <italic>in vivo</italic>, plasmids that contained a genomic copy of the mTR gene with different mutations were transfected into mTR<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c21">21</xref>). Telomerase activity from the transfected cells was determined by the TRAP assay (see Materials and Methods). Both mTR-m1 and mTR-m2 abolished the ability to reconstitute telomerase activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f2">2</xref>A, lanes 11, 12, 14 and 15). In contrast, the third mutant mTR-m3, which restored the base pairings in the P6.1 helix, restored telomerase activity to wild-type levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f2">2</xref>A, lanes 17 and 18). Northern analysis showed that the mutant telomerase RNAs were expressed at similar levels in the transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f2">2</xref>B). This result establishes that the p6.1 helix exists and is essential for telomerase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Previous work showed that deletion of the CR5 region (nt&#x000a0;254&#x02013;266), which includes the P6.1 stem&#x02013;loop, resulted in a lack of telomerase activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and the mutant RNA detected was larger than predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c14">14</xref>). It was proposed that the larger size of that mutant RNA might be due to abnormal RNA processing. However, in our study the P6.1 stem RNA mutants mTR-m1 (<sub>254</sub>UCUC<sub>257</sub>) and mTR-m2 (<sub>263</sub>GAGA<sub>266</sub>) were the same size as the wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f2">2</xref>B, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that they were processed normally <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is unclear why abnormal RNA processing occurred only in the P6.1 deletion mutant and not in the mutants that disrupt base pairing of this region. It is possible that deletion of the P6.1 helix may have caused a deleterious effect on the structure of other RNA domains, such as the box H&#x0002f;ACA domain, which has been shown to be important for RNA stability and possibly RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Although the P6.1 base-paired sequences are absolutely conserved among all 35 vertebrate RNAs sequenced, it is the base pairing of helix P6.1, and not the sequence, that is important, as an altered sequence of the helix exhibits a normal level of telomerase activity. The sequence conservation seen in the 35 vertebrate species may have been a consequence of the way these sequences were cloned. Most of the genes were isolated through a PCR cloning strategy that amplified a region of the RNA gene using primers targeting two sequence-conserved regions, the CR2 and CR5 regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c10">10</xref>). Therefore, the apparent sequence conservation in the CR5 region was most likely due to the fact that only genes with a conserved sequence in this region were amplified. Genomic DNAs from a number of species failed to generate PCR amplification products of telomerase RNA genes using primers targeting the CR2 and CR5 regions (J.-L.Chen and C.W.Greider, unpublished observation) and were not pursued further. These genes may possess sequence variation in the CR2 and CR5 regions. A larger sequence collection from different species will be required to detect any sequence co-variation within these two regions.</p><p>To further understand the functional role of the P6.1 stem&#x02013;loop structure, we reconstituted the mTR&#x02013;protein complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. Two separate RNA fragments, one containing the pseudoknot domain and one containing the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain, are required and sufficient for reconstituting telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c17">17</xref>). We took advantage of this minimal reconstitution system to examine the effect of mutations in the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain on <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme activity. The mTERT protein was tagged with the HA epitope at the C-terminus and expressed by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The expressed protein was assembled with two RNA fragments of mTR, the pseudoknot fragment (nt 1&#x02013;146) containing the pseudoknot domain and template and the CR4&#x02013;CR5 fragment (nt&#x000a0;200&#x02013;278) containing the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain and L6 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>A). Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf123c15">15</xref>), both the pseudoknot and CR4&#x02013;CR5 RNAs are capable of binding TERT independently and both are required to reconstitute telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>B and D, lanes 1&#x02013;4).</p><p>To assess the importance of the P6.1 stem&#x02013;loop in the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain, five CR4&#x02013;CR5 RNA fragments with different mutations in the P6.1 stem&#x02013;loop were assayed for their ability to bind TERT and reconstitute telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>A). These mutant RNAs are designated CR4&#x02013;CR5-m1 to CR4&#x02013;CR5-m5, rather than mTR-m1 to mTR-m5, as the CR4&#x02013;CR5 RNA fragment from position 200 to 278 was used in the <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>A). In addition to the three mutants (CR4&#x02013;CR5-m1 to CR4&#x02013;CR5-m3) with mutations in the P6.1 stem region, two more RNA mutants were generated. One mutant (CR4&#x02013;CR5-m4) contains a 4 bp extension of the P6.1 stem. The other mutant (CR4&#x02013;CR5-m5) has two point mutations in the L6.1 loop, U259A and G261C, at residues that are completely conserved in 35 vertebrate species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>A). <italic>In vitro</italic> reconstituted telomerase complex was immunoprecipitated with agarose beads conjugated with anti-HA antibodies. The immunopurified telomerase complexes were assayed for telomerase activity by TRAP and assayed for RNA&#x02013;protein interaction by northern analysis. Consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results described above, both of the RNA fragments with mutations that disrupted the P6.1 stem (CR4&#x02013;CR5-m1 and CR4&#x02013;CR5-m2) showed no telomerase activity when assembled together with the pseudoknot domain RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>D, lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, both the CR4&#x02013;CR5-m1 and CR4&#x02013;CR5-m2 RNA fragments failed to bind to TERT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6), while the wild-type CR4&#x02013;CR5 and the CR4&#x02013;CR5-m3 RNAs were able to bind the TERT protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>B, lanes 4 and 7) and reconstituted normal telomerase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>D, lanes 4 and 7). This result indicates that a stable P6.1 stem is required for binding to TERT and reconstituting telomerase activity.</p><p>In contrast to the mutants that disrupted the P6.1 stem, the CR4&#x02013;CR5-m4 and CR4&#x02013;CR5-m5 RNAs exhibited normal binding to TERT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>B, lanes 8 and 9). However, the CR4&#x02013;CR5-m4 RNA failed to reconstitute detectable telomerase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>D, lane 8). The extension of the P6.1 stem in the CR4&#x02013;CR5-m4 RNA may have distorted the spatial position and orientation of the conserved L6.1 loop. A similar result was found for the CR4&#x02013;CR5-m5 mutant; the point mutations at the two conserved nucleotides (259U and 261G) in the L6.1 loop significantly reduced telomerase activity while binding to TERT was unaffected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf123f3">3</xref>B and D, lane 9). The sequence alteration of the conserved loop 6.1 (PyUNGN) may disrupt an important RNA&#x02013;RNA or RNA&#x02013;protein contact and disturb the functional conformation at or near the catalytic site of telomerase. The inability of both CR4&#x02013;CR5-m4 and CR4&#x02013;CR5-m5 to fully reconstitute telomerase activity while maintaining TERT binding suggests that this loop may be involved in enzymatic catalysis.</p><p>The results described here support a helical structure, P6.1, in the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain of mammalian telomerase RNA, which is important for telomerase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. While the P6.1 stem is required for assembly of the CR4&#x02013;CR5 domain of telomerase RNA with TERT, the L6.1 loop is important for catalytic activity of the telomerase enzyme complex. Further structural and functional studies will be necessary to understand the detailed roles of this crucial stem&#x02013;loop structure in the assembly of and catalysis by the telomerase complex.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf123f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Proposed secondary structure of the mTR.
