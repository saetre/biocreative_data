E-cadherin, an important mediator of cell-cell adhesions, has been shown to be cleaved by &#x003b3;-secretase. This cleavage releases a fragment of E-cadherin, E-cadherin C-terminal fragment 2 (E-cad/CTF2), into the cytosol. Here, we study the fate and function of this fragment. First, we show that coexpression of the cadherin-binding protein, p120 catenin (p120), enhances the nuclear translocation of E-cad/CTF2. By knocking down p120 with short interfering RNA, we also demonstrate that p120 is necessary for the nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2. Furthermore, p120 enhances and is required for the specific binding of E-cad/CTF2 to DNA. Finally, we show that E-cad/CTF2 can regulate the p120-Kaiso-mediated signaling pathway in the nucleus. These data indicate a novel role for cleaved E-cadherin in the nucleus.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by <grant-sponsor>Medical Research Council</grant-sponsor> funding to the <grant-sponsor>Cell Biology Unit</grant-sponsor>.

Formation of tight and compact cell-cell adhesions suppresses free cell movement and provides cells with a positional cue for the establishment of cell polarity. In addition to the structural roles, it has been long known that cell-cell contacts play an important role in various signal transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). In other words, through cell-cell contacts, cells can exchange a variety of information with their neighbors to behave properly in their community.</p><p>Cadherins are a family of transmembrane cell-cell adhesion proteins that can be subdivided into several groups including classical cadherins and protocadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Classical cadherins, of which E-cadherin is the best characterized, play a crucial role in mediating cell-cell contacts at adherens junctions. The extracellular domains of classical cadherins form homophilic ligations. The cytoplasmic domain of cadherin includes two cadherin homology (CH)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">2</xref> domains: CH2 domain (located at the membrane proximal region) and CH3 domain (located at the distal region). These domains are conserved between classical cadherins. The CH2 and CH3 domains of cadherins interact with p120-catenin (p120) and &#x003b2;-catenin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Furthermore, the CH2 domain of E-cadherin also interacts with Hakai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>).</p><p>Cadherins, especially classical cadherins, have been shown to be involved in several signaling pathways regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms whereby cadherins regulate varied cellular processes are not fully understood. The cytoplasmic domain of cadherins does not possess any intrinsic enzymatic activity that could directly mediate signaling pathways in the cytosol. However, cadherin-binding proteins, especially &#x003b2;-catenin and p120, have been shown to localize in the nucleus and play a key role in signal transduction. The crucial role of &#x003b2;-catenin in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway has been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). When cells are stimulated with Wnt, &#x003b2;-catenin is translocated into the nucleus where it binds a transcription factor, T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor-1 (TCF/LEF-1), and acts as a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that p120 also has a functional role in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). A transcriptional repressor Kaiso has been characterized as a p120-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). The interaction with p120 prevents Kaiso from binding to DNA and thus suppresses the repressor activity of Kaiso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). The Kaiso-p120 complex was recently shown to regulate both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Although the functional roles of cadherin-binding proteins in the nucleus have been intensively studied, it is not clear whether the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin itself has a signaling role in the nucleus.</p><p>Cadherin-based cell-cell contacts are dynamically regulated. Cadherin at cell-cell contacts can be down-regulated by transcriptional repression and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Moreover, cadherins are proteolytically cleaved by a number of proteases including extracellular metalloproteases, &#x003b3;-secretase, and caspase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). &#x003b3;-Secretase cleavage of several transmembrane molecules following initial cleavage by metalloproteases has emerged as a common mechanism for signaling to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). This is best characterized in Notch signaling where the &#x003b3;-secretase-cleaved intracellular Notch fragment translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). In recent years, a similar mechanism has also been described for amyloid precursor protein, ErbB4, CD44 as well as N-cadherin and &#x003b3;-protocadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). For all these transmembrane molecules, intracellular domain fragments resulting from &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage are translocated to the nucleus and have signaling functions. In particular, &#x003b3;-secretase-mediated cleavage of N-cadherin in neural crest cells, induced by bone morphogenic protein 4, leads to nuclear translocation of the released cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). The cytoplasmic domain of &#x003b3;-protocadherins also localizes in the nucleus and activates the promoter of &#x003b3;-<italic>protocadherin</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). However, no signaling function for the cleaved cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin has been described.</p><p>In this study, we show that the intracellular domain of E-cadherin released by &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage can localize in the nucleus and that this localization is specifically enhanced by p120. p120 also promotes the interaction of E-cadherin with DNA. We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin in the nucleus modulates the p120-Kaiso-mediated signaling pathway. Finally, we present data suggesting a possible role of nuclear E-cadherin in the regulation of apoptosis.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Antibodies, Plasmids, and Materials</italic>&#x02014;Antibodies against E-cadherin, p120, N-cadherin, GM130, BiP/GRP78, and Lamp-1 were purchased from BD Biosciences.

Both were cloned into the NotI/BamHI sites of the pcDNA vector. To construct pcDNA-E-cad/CTF2(AAA), the cDNA of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin was amplified by PCR from pLK-E-cadherin(<sup>762</sup>AAA<sup>764</sup>) using the same primers as used to construct pcDNA-E-cad/CTF2. To construct pcDNA-E-cad/CTF2(RRRR), all lysine residues were replaced for arginine by site-directed mutagenesis using pcDNA-E-cad/CTF2 as a template.

A431 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 &#x000b0;C and ambient air supplemented with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. MDCK, MCF-7, COS-1, and L fibroblast cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. HEK293 cells were transfected as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). MDCK cells stably expressing E-cadherin-myc were produced and cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). To obtain L fibroblast cell lines stably expressing NLS-tagged E-cad/CTF2, cells were transfected with pcDNA4/TO/GFP-E-cad/CTF2-NLS, and stably transfected cells were selected in medium containing 400 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> zeocin (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). Images were captured using an Orca camera (Hamamatsu) and Openlab software (Improvision). To obtain epifluorescence images, we used a Zeiss Axipoplan2 microscope using a 40 &#x000d7; 1.3 oil immersion objective at room temperature (Zeiss). Images were captured using a C4742-95 digital camera (Hamamatsu) and Openlab software (Improvision). Confocal images were obtained with a Bio-Rad confocal mounted on a Nikon Optiphot 2 microscope using a 60 &#x000d7; 1.4 oil immersion objective at room temperature, or a Leica SPE confocal microscope with a 63 &#x000d7; 1.3 oil immersion objective at room temperature. Images were acquired using Laser Sharp software (Bio-Rad) or the Leica Application Suite, respectively. Merged images were split using Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Brightness and contrast were adjusted using Photoshop CS (Adobe). The ratio of nucleus/cytoplasm fluorescence intensity in confocal images were analyzed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse Rhodamine Red-X, goat anti-rabbit Cy2, and goat anti-rat Cy2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). To visualize nuclei we used Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen).</p><p>Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). To obtain total cell lysates, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing 5 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> leupeptin, 50 m<sc>m</sc> phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7.2 trypsin inhibitor units ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> of aprotinin, and 10 m<sc>m</sc><italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide. The suspended cells were directly boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To ensure equal loading, the protein concentration of lysates was quantified using the DC Protein Assay reagent from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) and measured on a VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Densitometric analyses were performed with the Bio-Rad image acquisition system (Gel Doc 170) and Epson Expression 1680 Pro Scanner (Seiko Epson, Amsterdam, Netherlands), and Quantity One (Bio-Rad). The upsmear bands of E-cad/CTF2 shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> were not observed in some experiments (<italic>e.g.</italic> supplemental Fig. S2<italic>B</italic>). It is highly likely that despite the addition of <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide to inhibit de-ubiquitination, the de-modification of E-cad/CTF2 occurs very actively after lysing the cells, as the modified bands were frequently lost when the lysates were kept for a longer period.</p><p>For DNA-cellulose binding assays, cell lysates (100 &#x003bc;g of protein) and/or purified GST or GST-E-cad/CTF2 protein (75 ng) were used in DNA-cellulose assays and competition assays as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>).

Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Turner Designs TD-20/20 luminometer. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase activity was measured using the &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) and the VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).</p><p><italic>Statistical Analysis</italic>&#x02014;Student's <italic>t</italic> tests assuming equal or unequal variance and a two-tailed distribution were performed for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p><italic>Treatment with Staurosporine Induces</italic> &#x003b3;<italic>-Secretase-mediated Cleavage of E-cadherin in Epithelial Cells</italic>&#x02014;First, we examined the proteolytic cleavage of E-cadherin in several epithelial cell lines. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), treatment of the human epithelial cell line A431 with staurosporine lead to the production of cytoplasmic cleavage products, E-cadherin C-terminal fragment 2 (E-cad/CTF2) (33 kDa) and E-cadherin C-terminal fragment 3 (E-cad/CTF3) (29 kDa) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Staurosporine is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C and other protein kinases, which strongly induces apoptosis. E-Cad/CTF2 was also observed in the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 and MDCK cells after treatment with staurosporine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>).

E-Cad/CTF2 is the result of &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage, which occurs following removal of the extracellular region by metalloproteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). The resulting E-cad/CTF2 fragment represents the entire intracellular domain of E-cadherin. As expected, we observed that treatment with &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor X specifically blocked staurosporine-induced production of E-cad/CTF2 in all three cell lines and lead to an accumulation of its precursor E-cad/CTF1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>&#x003b3;-Secretase-mediated cleavage of E-cadherin in epithelial cells.</bold><italic>A,</italic> staurosporine induces &#x003b3;-secretase-mediated cleavage of E-cadherin in epithelial cell lines.

We first expressed HA-tagged E-cad/CTF2 in epithelial cells and examined its subcellular localization. When HA-E-cad/CTF2 alone is expressed in MDCK cells, it was mainly localized in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Interestingly, we found that coexpression of p120 enhanced the nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). To quantify this effect of p120, we measured the ratio of pixel intensity within defined regions of the nucleus and cytoplasm. The quantification results showed that coexpression of p120 significantly increased the amount of E-cad/CTF2 in the nucleus (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.002) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>right</italic>). A similar effect of p120 on the nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2 was observed in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>) and MCF-7 cells (supplemental Fig. S1).</p><p>Next we examined whether the cytoplasmic domain is processed from full-length E-cadherin and is translocated to the nucleus. Because the available antibodies against the intracellular region of E-cadherin are not suitable for immunostaining, we used MDCK cells expressing exogenous full-length E-cadherin with a C-terminal myc tag. When E-cadherin-myc alone was expressed, myc immunostaining was mainly observed at cell-cell contacts, which was not affected by coexpression of p120 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>first</italic> and <italic>second panels</italic>). We next investigated whether the cleaved C terminus of E-cadherin localizes in the nucleus in this system. As staurosporine treatment induced nuclear fragmentation, we transiently expressed a metalloprotease ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) 10, which cleaves E-cadherin producing E-cad/CTF1, which can be further cleaved to produce E-cad/CTF2 (supplemental Fig. S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Upon expression of ADAM10, myc staining was decreased at cell-cell contacts, becoming predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, and cells became more spread and flattened (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>third panel</italic>). The effect of ADAM10 expression on E-cadherin localization was quantified by counting the percentage of cells showing myc staining in the cytoplasm. Expression of ADAM10 lead to cytoplasmic staining in &#x0223c;60% of cells, compared with 10% in mock-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Neither coexpression of p120 nor treatment with &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor X significantly influenced this effect of ADAM10 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>), suggesting that ADAM10 disrupted E-cadherin-based cell-cell contacts independently of p120 and &#x003b3;-secretase. Furthermore, we analyzed the nuclear myc staining in the cells that lost cell-cell contact staining upon expression of ADAM10. Notably, we found that coexpression of p120 with ADAM10 substantially increased nuclear myc staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A</italic>, <italic>fourth panel</italic>, and <italic>C</italic></xref>). The nuclear myc staining induced by coexpression of ADAM10 and p120 was blocked by treatment with &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor X (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A, fifth panel</italic>, and <italic>C</italic></xref>), suggesting that the nuclear localization of the C terminus of E-cadherin is dependent on &#x003b3;-secretase-mediated processing of E-cad/CTF1. Collectively, data in Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> indicate that the &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage product of E-cadherin, E-cad/CTF2, can localize in the nucleus of epithelial cells and that this localization is enhanced by p120.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Nuclear localization of the cleaved C terminus of E-cadherin.</bold><italic>A</italic>, p120 induces nuclear localization of the C terminus of E-cadherin in ADAM10-transfected cells.

First, we confirmed that coexpression of p120 increased the amount of E-cad/CTF2 in the nuclear fraction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>), without affecting the amount of nuclei in this fraction (supplemental Fig. S3<italic>B</italic>). Interestingly, we found that p120 expression frequently induced higher molecular weight modifications of E-cad/CTF2 that were also sometimes observed in the nuclear fraction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d; for details). We next transfected siRNA oligos against p120 to examine the involvement of endogenous p120 proteins in the nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2. Expression of siRNA oligos efficiently knocked down the expression of endogenous p120 and strongly reduced the amount of E-cad/CTF2 present in the nuclear fraction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). This reduction of E-cad/CTF2 in the nuclear fraction was observed to a greater extent with siRNA oligo 2, which induced greater knockdown of p120 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). These data provide further support for an important role of p120 in the nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2.</p><p>Next we investigated the specificity of the effect of p120 on nuclear localization and modification of E-cad/CTF2. Expression of other E-cadherin-binding proteins, &#x003b2;-catenin and Hakai, did not enhance either modification or nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). We also analyzed the effect of p120 on another E-cadherin fragment, E-cad/CTF3, that is released following cleavage by caspase-3. When E-cad/CTF3 alone was expressed, it was not detected in the nuclear fraction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). Coexpression of p120 enhanced neither nuclear localization nor modification of E-cad/CTF3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). As caspase-3 cleavage occurs within the CH2 domain that includes the p120-binding site, this cleavage may impair binding of E-cad/CTF3 to p120. To examine this possibility, we analyzed the interaction between p120 and E-cad/CTF2 or E-cad/CTF3 by coimmunoprecipitation. Indeed we found that E-cad/CTF3 was not coimmunoprecipitated with p120, whereas E-cad/CTF2 was coimmunoprecipitated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>). To further investigate the requirement of p120 binding for its enhancement of E-cad/CTF2 nuclear localization, we used a mutant form of E-cad/CTF2 that cannot bind to p120 (E-cad/CTF2(AAA)). This is a triple alanine mutation within the CH2 domain that prevents binding of E-cadherin to p120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). We found that E-cad/CTF2(AAA) was not present in the nuclear fraction and that expression of p120 did not induce nuclear localization or modification of E-cad/CTF2(AAA) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>F</italic></xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the direct interaction with E-cad/CTF2 is required for p120 to enhance nuclear localization and modification of E-cad/CTF2.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>p120 is required for the nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2.</bold><italic>A&#x02013;D</italic> and <italic>F</italic>, HEK293 cells were transfected as indicated, and total and nuclear lysates were examined by Western blotting (<italic>WB</italic>) with the indicated antibodies. <italic>A</italic>, p120 enhances nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2. <italic>B</italic>, knockdown of p120 decreases the nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2.

To investigate a possible role of ubiquitination in the nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2, we mutated all four lysine residues within E-cad/CTF2 to arginine, producing E-cad/CTF2(RRRR), which cannot be ubiquitinated. No higher molecular weight bands of E-cad/CTF2(RRRR) were observed when it was coexpressed with p120 and/or ubiquitin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>left panel</italic>), indicating that the modifications indeed occur on lysine residues.

This assay uses native calf thymus DNA immobilized on cellulose to precipitate proteins from cell lysates that can bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). It is particularly useful when the potential DNA binding sites are not identified. Interestingly, when expressed in HEK293 cells, E-cad/CTF2 in the cell lysate could bind to DNA, whereas no or very little binding of E-cad/CTF3 was detected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>top</italic>).

We confirmed the specificity of the interaction between E-cad/CTF2 and DNA by performing a competition assay. In this assay, cell lysates were preincubated with increasing amounts of DNA or RNA. Preincubation with DNA suppressed the binding of E-cad/CTF2 to the DNA-cellulose, whereas preincubation with RNA did not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). This indicates a specific interaction between E-cad/CTF2 and DNA, rather than a nonspecific ionic interaction. Because there are no known DNA binding sites within the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain, we investigated whether DNA binding was direct by using purified GST-tagged E-cad/CTF2 protein. We found that GST-E-cad/CTF2 alone did not bind to DNA and that it required the HEK293 cell lysate to interact with DNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>).

To analyze the effect of nuclear E-cad/CTF2, we constructed a nuclear-targeted form of E-cad/CTF2, E-cad/CTF2-NLS-myc. In this construct, E-cad/CTF2 was fused to four nuclear localization signals (NLS), and it was shown to predominantly localize in the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S4A). To examine the effect of nuclear E-cad/CTF2 on Kaiso-regulated promoters, we used the pGL3&#x02013;4x KBS reporter plasmid, which contains four tandem copies of the consensus Kaiso binding site upstream of the <italic>luciferase</italic> reporter gene.

First, we confirmed by immunofluorescence that NLS-tagged E-cad/CTF2 is mainly localized in the nucleus in L cells (supplemental Fig. S5). Expression of the nuclear E-cad/CTF2 protein did not induce detectable morphological changes (data not shown), and did not significantly affect the cell proliferation rate (supplemental Fig. S6). As the production of E-cad/CTF2 is enhanced by staurosporine-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), we examined whether the expression of E-cad/CTF2-NLS affects apoptosis of cells. After 3&#x02013;4 h of addition of staurosporine, L cells started to undergo apoptosis, and caspase-3 was proteolytically cleaved and became an active form as observed by immunofluorescence (supplemental Fig. S7, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) and Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S7<italic>C</italic>). Interestingly, we found that this apoptotic process was strongly suppressed in L cells expressing E-cad/CTF2-NLS (supplemental Fig. S7, <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>C</italic>), suggesting a potential regulatory role of nuclear E-cad/CTF2 in apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we describe the crucial role of p120 in the nuclear localization of the &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage product of E-cadherin, E-cad/CTF2, using several experimental systems. By immunofluorescence, we first observed that coexpression of p120 enhances nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2 in several cell lines. Second, a similar effect is observed using C-terminal-tagged full-length E-cadherin. Third, using a biochemical nuclear fractionation method, we confirm the effect of p120 and show that this effect is specific for p120 as other cadherin-binding proteins do not induce nuclear translocation of E-cad/CTF2. We also demonstrate the requirement of p120 in E-cad/CTF2 nuclear localization using siRNA oligos that knock down endogenous p120. The direct interaction between p120 and E-cad/CTF2 is also required because E-cad/CTF2(AAA) is not detected in the nuclear fraction. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>F</italic></xref>, E-cad/CTF2 binds p120 in the nucleus, suggesting that the nuclear translocation of E-cad/CTF2 is mediated by stoichiometric interaction with p120, although the nuclear localization of p120 is not clearly affected by the presence of E-cad/CTF2. However, it is also possible that the effect of p120 is mediated catalytically, for example, through post-translational modification of E-cad/CTF2. p120 is sequestered in multiple cellular locations including adherens junctions and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>), and under conditions where E-cadherin is down-regulated, p120 is released into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>). The regulation of p120 subcellular localization could therefore impact on the control of nuclear localization of E-cad/CTF2.</p><p>Previously, it was shown that staurosporine treatment induces the production of E-cad/CTF2 by &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage in A431 epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). We also observe a similar cleavage product in response to staurosporine in MCF-7 and MDCK epithelial cells. Recently, <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> toxin was also reported to stimulate &#x003b3;-secretase-induced cleavage of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>). However, the physiological stimuli that induce the production of E-cad/CTF2 were not clear. Our preliminary results suggest that activation of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor leads to &#x003b3;-secretase-dependent accumulation of E-cad/CTF2 in MDCK cells.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref> However, the amount of E-cad/CTF2 induced by activation of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor is much smaller than that of full-length E-cadherin. Despite extensive efforts, we were unable to isolate pure nuclear fractions from epithelial cells, thus the nuclear localization of endogenous E-cad/CTF2 could not be biochemically determined. Furthermore, the available antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin are not suitable for immunofluorescent staining. Hence, a novel experimental approach needs to be established to study the fate of the endogenous cleavage product. Our observation that hepatocyte growth factor induces small amounts of E-cad/CTF2 relative to full-length E-cadherin is quite comparable with that of &#x003b3;-secretase-induced cleavage of Notch. Upon binding to its ligand, Notch is cleaved by &#x003b3;-secretase to release its intracellular domain, however, the amount is too small to be detected in the nucleus by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>). Thus, the main evidence for nuclear localization of Notch has been presented with a reporter assay using a Notch construct C-terminal tagged with GAL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). To demonstrate the physiological significance of E-cad/CTF2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, a similar reporter system needs to be applied in the future.</p><p>Using reporter assays with 4x KBS and the promoter of Kaiso target <italic>matrilysin</italic>, we have shown that the expression of E-cad/CTF2-NLS potentiates the effect of p120 on the relief of the Kaiso-mediated transcriptional repression. With GST pulldown assays, we further show that E-cad/CTF2 forms a trimeric complex with p120 and Kaiso. These data suggest that the interaction between these three proteins influences gene transcription. Another interesting finding is that E-cad/CTF2 specifically binds to DNA. The association of E-cad/CTF2 and DNA is not direct, as E-cad/CTF2 requires p120 for its DNA binding. Thus, E-cad/CTF2 and p120 can mutually affect their functions; whereas E-cad/CTF2 potentiates the inhibitory role of p120 in Kaiso-mediated transcription, p120 promotes the nuclear localization and DNA binding of E-cad/CTF2. At present, the DNA binding site of the E-cad/CTF2-p120 complex is not clear. It is unlikely that the complex binds to the Kaiso-binding regions because p120 promotes dissociation of Kaiso from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Hence, the E-cad/CTF2-p120 complex may be involved in transcriptional regulation or chromatin remodeling of unknown gene(s). Finally, by using L fibroblast cells expressing E-cad/CTF2-NLS, we have also shown that the expression of nuclear E-cad/CTF2 suppresses staurosporine-induced apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of this effect needs to be characterized in future work.</p><p>In summary, p120 mediates the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of E-cad/CTF2. In the nucleus, E-cad/CTF2 can modulate the p120-Kaiso-mediated signaling pathway, and can also potentially regulate the apoptotic process. To further understand the nuclear role of E-cad/CTF2, the identification of its DNA binding sites and the clarification of its <italic>in vivo</italic> functions need to be pursued.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mark Marsh for critical reading of the manuscript.
