Here, we described a novel oligomerization mechanism affecting solute carrier family 30 member 3/zinc transporter 3 (SLC30A3/ZnT3). Oligomerization was mediated by intermolecular covalent dityrosine bonds. Using mutagenized ZnT3 expressed in PC12 cells, we identified two critical tyrosine residues necessary for dityrosine-mediated ZnT3 oligomerization. ZnT3 carrying the Y372F mutation prevented ZnT3 oligomerization, decreased ZnT3 targeting to synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs), and decreased resistance to zinc toxicity. Strikingly, ZnT3 harboring the Y357F mutation behaved as a &#x0201c;gain-of-function&#x0201d; mutant as it displayed increased ZnT3 oligomerization, targeting to SLMVs, and increased resistance to zinc toxicity. Single and double tyrosine ZnT3 mutants indicate that the predominant dimeric species is formed between tyrosine 357 and 372. ZnT3 tyrosine dimerization was detected under normal conditions and it was enhanced by oxidative stress. Covalent species were also detected in other SLC30A zinc transporters localized in different subcellular compartments. These results indicate that covalent tyrosine dimerization of a SLC30A family member modulates its subcellular localization and zinc transport capacity. We propose that dityrosine-dependent membrane protein oligomerization may regulate the function of diverse membrane protein in normal and disease states.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The quaternary structure of polytopic transmembrane proteins plays a critical role in defining their subcellular localization and, consequently, their function.

Similarly, homo-oligomerization regulates the subcellular distribution and signaling capacity of receptors in the endocytic pathway.

Critical to understand the effects that membrane protein homo-oligomerization exert on proteins is the definition of chemical interactions that hold membrane protein homo-oligomers. Identification of key residues and interfacial domains offers molecular targets to assess the functional role of chemical modifications involved in oligomerization and to predict homo-oligomerization in other membrane proteins. Here we present a new covalent homo-oligomerization mechanism in a member of the SLC30A family of zinc transporters that depends on redox-regulated covalent tyrosine dimerization.</p><p>Homo-oligomerization of membrane proteins occurs through non-covalent and covalent interactions, primarily within transmembrane domains. These interactions rely on glycine, leucine or cysteine residues. Among the non-covalent interactions, the most common involve GxxxG and GxxxG-like domains such as those found in glycophorin A, membrane transporters, and receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Lemmon1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Senes1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

A far less explored covalent oligomerization mechanism is that dependent on dityrosine bond formation. Dityrosine bonds are present in a limited group of structural proteins of the bacteria cell wall, invertebrate connective tissue, and in proteins of the vertebrate extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-LaBella1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Edens1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

In all these cases dityrosine bonds are thought to represent the cumulative damage of a protein or to regulate protein function by either decreasing the solubility of secreted proteins or increasing oligomer resilience to mechanical stress.</p><p>In this study we show that dityrosine bonds induced the oligomerization of the zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3), a member of the SLC30A family of zinc transporters.

Here we show that in contrast with YiiP, ZnT3 forms covalent dimers mediated by intermolecular dityrosine bonds. Dityrosine bond formation occurs both spontaneously and induced by oxidative stress. Using site-directed mutagenesis we identified two critical tyrosines in the carboxy-terminal of ZnT3, one that prevented and one that increased dimerization. Our studies indicate that covalent tyrosine dimerization of a SLC30A family member modulates its subcellular localization and zinc transport capacity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used for western blots: monoclonal anti transferrin receptor (H68.4), rabbit polyclonal anti SUMO2/3 and monoclonal anti SUMO1 were from Zymed Laboratories/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

We next tested whether tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations in ZnT3 tyrosine residues could abrogate the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced dimer formation. Human ZnT3 possesses six tyrosine residues, two facing extracellular exposed domains, one in an intracellular loop, and three in the carboxy-terminal domain. We focused on the role of individual tyrosine residues present in the carboxy-terminal domain as candidates to mediate dimer formation (Y330, Y357 and Y372). Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations were engineered in human ZnT3-myc and transiently transfected in PC12 cells, which were incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

We specifically asked whether human ZnT3 harboring the Y372F mutation, which reduces the ZnT3 80 kDa species, was dominant over the Y357F mutation, which increases ZnT3 80 kDa species. Analysis of double mutants ZnT3Y357-372F showed reduced ZnT3 80 kDa species indicating that Y372 is critical and dominant in the formation of dityrosine dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g003">Fig 3F</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;6). Moreover, these results indicate that the remaining Y330 present in ZnT3Y357-372F were less efficiently engaged in dimer formation with other Y330 residue. We next asked whether tyrosine dimers were formed between two Y372 residues. ZnT3 carrying only one tyrosine residue in position 372 by mutation of Y330&#x02013;357 to F still displayed reduced ZnT3 80 kDa species content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g003">Fig 3F</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;8).

This functional change predicts that ZnT3 oligomers containing trans dityrosine bridges between residues 357 and 372 should modify cytoplasmic determinants involved in zinc binding. We explored the structural changes induced by bridging tyrosines 357 and 372 in ZnT3 dimers using AMMP molecular modeling. We modeled human ZnT3 primary sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) using as a backbone the crystal structure coordinates of the bacterial ZnT3 homologue YiiP bound to zinc atoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Lu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. ZnT3 dimers lacking dityrosine bonds closely resembled the crystal structure of YiiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, ZnT3). Zinc atoms in human ZnT3 bound to the cytosolic domain were exposed to water. However, ZnT3 dimers carrying a dityrosine bond between residues 357 and 372 acquired a closed conformation with zinc atoms bound to the cytosolic domain completely buried and away from solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, ZnT3 diY357&#x02013;372). The major conformational change involved in the 357&#x02013;372 dityrosine dimer depended on the motion of the two cytoplasmic loops containing these two tyrosines. Since tyrosine 372 is on the C-terminus and therefore has few conformational restrictions, it moves more than tyrosine 357 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). The modeling method was unlikely to produce major conformation changes as it used conjugate gradients, which is a local optimizer. The distribution of charges, as reflected in the electrostatic field calculated from the model in the presence of dielectric and counter ions showed few differences between the undimerized and dimerized tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). The arrangement of zinc atoms was further explored by projecting cytosolic zinc atoms into the dityrosine bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Zinc atoms moved closer to the unexposed surface of the C-terminal domain of ZnT3 in dimers carrying 357&#x02013;372 dityrosine bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>, compare yellow and green dots). Models made for other pairs of possible dityrosine states, such as 330&#x02013;357 or 330&#x02013;372 did not alter the zinc binding sites. The rearrangement seen with the 357&#x02013;372 dityrosine bridge appears to alter the zinc binding sites and open up buried binding sites that are not present in molecules lacking dityrosine bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Zinc atoms not associated with this binding site are buried in both the tyrosine and dityrosine models. After formation of the dityrosine bond a complete set of well-formed zinc binding sites is generated. This set of sites spans the whole length of the molecule suggesting that dityrosine formation facilitates zinc transport by forming the shielded binding pathway for the C-terminal part of the transporter. This modeling supports the notion that ZnT3 domains involved in zinc binding undergo structural rearrangements in the presence of dityrosine bonds.</p><fig id="pone-0005896-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005896.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>ZnT3 homology modeling with the bacteria Yiip zinc transporter.</title><p>Human ZnT3 pairs or ZnT3 pairs bridged in trans by dityrosine bonds between tyrosine residues 357 and 372 were modeled using AMMP and visualized with Pymol.

Increased levels of dityrosine have been found in atheromatous plates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Hensley1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, cataracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-GarciaCastineiras1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, acute inflammation, systemic bacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Heinecke1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and recently associated with &#x003b1;-synuclein fibrillogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Krishnan1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and A&#x003b2; amyloid oligomerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Atwood1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Di-tyrosine formation as a normal post-translational modification has been described only in a limited group of structural proteins of the bacteria cell wall and insect ligaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Andersen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, and in proteins of the extracellular matrix as collagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-LaBella2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and elastin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-LaBella1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show tyrosine dimerization in a polytopic transmembrane protein, mediated by tyrosine residues in the carboxy terminal domain. In contrast to the described damage connotation and structural roles of dityrosine bonds, ZnT3 tyrosine modification presents a new functional paradigm for dityrosine bonds as regulators of both subcellular localization and metal transport activity. This ZnT3 post-translational modification occurs spontaneously and it is regulated by oxidative stress.</p><p>PC12 cells expressing <italic>wild type</italic> human ZnT3 and tyrosine mutants incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> enabled us to identify tyrosine 372 as a major residue mediating ZnT3 dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). ZnT3 dimers formed between Y330-Y330, Y357-Y357 or Y330-Y357 are likely less abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g009">Fig. 9</xref>, dotted line in Y372F mutant). Moreover, double mutants Y330F, Y357F containing an intact Y372, shows reduce dimerization. This indicates that Y372 formed dimers with Y330 or Y357 but not Y372-Y372 dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g009">Fig. 9</xref>, Y300, 357F). Additionally, double mutant Y357F, Y372F, expressing an intact Y330 also shows reduce dimerization indicating that dimers Y330-Y330 are poorly represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g009">Fig. 9</xref> Y357, 372F). The fact that no detectable phenotype was observed in Y330 mutant indicates that dimerization between Y372 and Y357 is the predominant state of ZnT3 dimers at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g009">Fig. 9</xref><italic>wild type</italic>).</p><p>Interestingly, the gain-of-function phenotype obtained by mutagenesis of tyrosine 357 in human ZnT3 indicates that tyrosine 357 might regulate the availability or proximity of Y330 and Y372 for dimer formation. Tyrosine residues involved in dityrosine bond formation or those adjacent could be subject to tyrosine post-translational modifications that could modulate dimerization and function of membrane proteins. For example NetPhos 2.0 (Technical University of Denmark) predicts that tyrosine 357 in human ZnT3, possesses a high probability for being a phosphate acceptor (0.633). Additionally, nitrosylation of tyrosines, a mofidication induced by oxidative stress, could modulate dityrosine bond formation of zinc transporters. These posttranslational events could affect tyrosine-dependent covalent dimerization, zinc transport, and cell response to metal challenges.</p><p>Zinc transport capacity is modulated by the dimeric state of ZnT3. Two lines of evidence lead us to conclude that dimers or higher oligomeric forms are the likely ZnT3 functional states. First, we observed a correlation between zinc transport into vesicle compartments and dimerization when comparing mouse and human ZnT3. The mouse ZnT3 fails to transport zinc into vesicle compartments as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Palmiter2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005896-Salazar3">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, zinc transport capacity was 2.4 times higher in human ZnT3. Human ZnT3 forms dimers in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, while the mouse transporter was almost insensitive. Moreover, we observed a significant zinquin staining in cells expressing ZnT4 and 5 but not ZnT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). ZnT4 and ZnT5 form covalent oligomeric species in response to oxidative stress but not ZnT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Second, zinquin staining was lost in cells expressing the &#x0201c;loss-of-function&#x0201d; Y372F mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g005">Fig. 5 C and D</xref>). Interestingly, zinc transport was not increased in the gain of function ZnT3Y357F mutant in assays that acutely assess zinc transport capacity (&#x0223c;1 hour; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g005">Fig. 5 C and D</xref>), but became evident as a small yet significant increase in assays that explored sustained zinc transport capacity required to evade zinc toxicity (&#x0223c;24 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). In contrast, the loss-of-function ZnT3Y372F mutant increases cell death induced by zinc. Although, the mechanism is unknown, one possibility is that ZnT3Y372F may act as dominant negative mutant over endogenous zinc transporters leading to an unbalance of zinc homeostasis.</p><p>We described tyrosine mediated dimerization in two member of the SLC30A family, ZnT3 and ZnT4. Considering the distribution of charged residues surrounding ZnT3 and ZnT4 tyrosines, we propose that a putative motif YXXE is at least one of the primary sequences involved in dityrosine bond formation in ZnT family members. Whether this motif could be expanded to YXX&#x0005b;D/E&#x0005d; or to YXE remains unknown, yet these primary structure arrangements would encompass ZnT2 and ZnT1 as candidates for dityrosine bonding, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005896-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). The generality of a YXXE motif, whether this motif is an obligated component in dityrosine bond formation, or whether there are multiple sequences that could mediate dityrosine bond formation requires further testing in other membrane proteins.</p><p>Primary sequence determinants are not the only factors defining dityrosine-mediated dimerization. Differences in oligomerization and zinc transport capacity exhibited by the mouse and human ZnT3 orthologs pointed to a role of the amino terminal domain modulating dityrosine dimerization. Human ZnT3 amino terminal confers an enhanced capacity to respond to oxidative stress induced-oligomerization to mouse ZnT3. In contrast, mouse amino terminal confers an attenuated response to oxidative stress to the human transporter. These observations suggest species differences in biological mechanisms that depend on synaptic vesicle zinc content.</p><p>In conclusion we identified tyrosine dimerization as a new redox-sensitive post-translational modification in the SLC30A family of zinc transporters. Moreover, we demonstrate that dimers/oligomers are likely a functional intermediary in ZnT3 zinc transport. This mechanism uncovers new avenues of zinc homeostasis regulation by oxidative stress shared by several members of the SLC30A family. Elucidation of such mechanism will help us to understand the role of zinc and zinc transporters in pathologic conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes, in which zinc transporters are thought to be involved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005896.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Covalently modified ZnT3 is not sumoylated.
