It is also involved in the regulation of growth factor and cytokine activity. However, little is known about the factors that induce heparanase in cancer cells. We investigated the effect of three growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), on heparanase mRNA induction in lung cancer cells in vitro. In addition, we examined the effect of erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM), which are 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotics that act as biological response modifiers, on the expression of heparanase mRNA induced by growth factors. PDGF, HGF and bFGF stimulated cell migration activity and enhanced the expression of heparanase mRNA in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549. Via different mechanisms, EM and CAM modulate the induction by these factors of heparanase mRNA expression on A549 cells. EM also significantly suppressed A549 cell migration induced by PDGF and HGF, and CAM significantly suppressed A549cell migration induced by bFGF. The results suggest that the growth factors PDGF, HGF and bFGF are important inducers of heparanase in potentially invasive and metastatic cancer cells. The suppressive effect of heparanase mRNA expression by EM and CAM may have interestingtherapeutic applications in the prevention of metastasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
