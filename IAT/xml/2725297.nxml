Elevated proteinuria is associated to the disruption of slit-diaphragm and loss of podocyte foot processes, structural alterations that are considered irreversible. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether proteinuria can be reversed and to identify the structural modifications and the gene/protein regulation associated to this reversal.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p> We used a novel transgenic strain of mouse (RenTg) that overexpresses renin at a constant high level. At the age of 12-month, RenTg mice showed established lesions typical of chronic renal disease such as peri-vascular and periglomerular inflammation, glomerular ischemia, glomerulosclerosis, mesangial expansion and tubular dilation. Ultrastructural analysis indicated abnormal heterogeneity of basement membrane thickness and disappearance of podocyte foot processes. These structural alterations were accompanied by decreased expressions of proteins specific of podocyte (nephrin, podocin), or tubular epithelial cell (E-cadherin and megalin) integrity. In addition, since TGF&#x003b2; is considered the major pro-fibrotic agent in renal disease and since exogenous administration of BMP7 is reported to antagonize the TGF&#x003b2;-induced phenotype changes in kidney, we have screened the expressions of several genes belonging in the TGF&#x003b2;/BMP superfamily. We found that the endogenous inhibitors of BMPs such as noggin and Usag-1 were several-fold activated inhibiting the action of BMPs and thus reinforcing the deleterious action of TGF&#x003b2;.Treatment with an AT1 receptor antagonist, at dose that did not decrease arterial pressure, gradually reduced albuminuria. This decrease was accompanied by re-expression of podocin, nephrin, E-cadherin and megalin, and reappearance of podocyte foot processes. In addition, expressions of noggin and Usag-1 were markedly decreased, permitting thus activation of the beneficial action of BMPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p> These findings show that proteinuria and alterations in the expression of proteins involved in the integrity and function of glomerular and renal epithelial phenotype are reversible events when the local action of angiotensin II is blocked, and provide hope that chronic renal disease can be efficiently treated.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Numerous clinical studies defined proteinuria as a major marker of the decline of renal function.

Proteinuria occurs when the structure of podocytes, peculiar ramified glomerular cells, is destroyed by disruption of the slit-diaphragm and loss of foot processes. It is generally believed that this structural alteration is the crucial step characterizing the irreversibility of chronic kidney disease.</p><p>Our group has investigated over the last years the mechanisms involved in the development of renal fibrosis in order to identify targets for therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Shweke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Ying1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and was among the first groups to report that regression of renal disease was feasible following therapy with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, at least in experimental models of hypertensive nephropathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Boffa1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Fakhouri1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, a major criticism about reversibility of chronic kidney disease in rodents was that the disease was induced in young animals not suffering for a long period from a chronic disease like hypertension or diabetes (as it usually occurs in humans) and that therapy was induced before reaching huge proteinuria or an important destruction of podocyte structure.</p><p>To address these issues in the present study, we used a novel model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Caron1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Caron2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> of hypertension-induced renal disease mimicking closer the kinetics and the physiopathological characteristics of human nephroangiosclerosis. We found that these mice are hypertensive and display albuminuria as early as 2&#x02013;3 month old, and that these pathological features are accentuated with age and are accompanied by functional and structural alterations typical of chronic renal disease including loss of podocyte foot processes. We decided to start treatment with an AT1 receptor antagonist when the animals reached the age of 12-months, thus, to treat aged animals that have been proteinuric for a long period of their life-span. We found that treatment with an AT1 receptor antagonist induced reappearance of foot processes and of proteins characterizing normal slit diaphragms, and re-established the normal phenotype of tubular epithelial cells. These changes were accompanied by a shift in the equilibrium between pro and anti-fibrotic members of the TGF&#x003b2;/BMP superfamily.</p><p>This study, by showing that long lasting proteinuria, disorganisation of podocyte structure and phenotype change of tubular epithelium can be reversed supports the notion that chronic renal disease can be efficiently treated.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>RenTg mice as a model to study hypertension-induced disease</title><p>RenTg mice were generated and described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Caron1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

An important novel finding is that podocyte lesions such as loss of foot processes and basal membrane disorganization are reversible phenomena when the local action of Ang II is blocked. An additional finding is that Ang II antagonism restores the normal phenotype of tubular cells and reverses renal vascular inflammation. Furthermore, we provide some clues about the mechanisms involved in the reversal of renal fibrosis: it appears that this recovery was due to a resetting of the TGF&#x003b2;/BMPs equilibrium towards a more efficient action of the anti-fibrotic members of this family.</p><p>Regression of proteinuria and nephroangio-, glomerulo- or tubulointerstitial sclerosis by blocking the action of the renin-angiotensin system has been documented in several experimental models of progressive renal disease, such as chronic nitric oxide synthase inhibition, renal mass ablation, puromycin aminonucleoside <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-NavarroCid1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Diamond1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a major scepticism about the reversibility of chronic kidney disease in rodents compared to humans, is that the disease was induced in most cases in young animals not suffering for a long period from a chronic disease like hypertension or diabetes (as is usually the case in humans), and that therapy was induced before reaching high levels proteinuria or an important destruction of podocyte structure for a prolonged period. To address these issues in the present study, we used a novel model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Caron1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Caron2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> of Ang II- induced renal disease mimicking closer the kinetics and the physiopathological characteristics of hypertension-associated human renal disease. These mice are hypertensive and display proteinuria (albuminuria) as early as 2&#x02013;3 mo old, and these pathologies are accentuated with age and are accompanied by functional and structural alterations typical of chronic renal disease including loss of foot processes of podocytes and phenotype changes of renal epithelial cells towards the mesenchymal phenotype.</p><p>We decided to start treatment with an AT1 receptor antagonist when the animals reached the age of 12-mo, and thus, to treat relatively aged animals that had been proteinuric for a long period of their life-span. We found that treatment with an AT1 receptor antagonist induced reappearance of foot processes and de novo expression of nephrin and podocin (proteins indicating normal function of slit diaphragm) reducing thus, urinary protein (albumin) excretion. In agreement to our findings, downregulation of nephrin gene that was totally prevented by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and AT1 receptor blocker, was observed in a model of progressive renal disease (passive Heymann nephritis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Benigni1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Ang II induced redistribution of F-actin and zonula ocludents-1 (ZO-1) in a murine cell line of podocytes in vitro&#x0003b; these structural changes were mediated by the AT1 receptor and were associated to an increased permeability of albumin across podocyte monolayers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Macconi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The repair of the glomerular function and the reversal of proteinuria can be due either to restructuring of existing and/or to de novo generation of podocytes. The first hypothesis, has been proposed for the reversal of glomerulosclerosis during ACE inhibition in the renal ablation model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Adamczak1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, podocyte repopulation through remodelling of Bowman's capsule epithelial cells contributed to regression of renal disease in the Munich Wistar Fr&#x000f6;mter rat model of glomerular injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Macconi2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that the underlying mechanism of repair depends on the model and/or conditions of renal injury (abrupt hemodynamic changes in the renal ablation, much slower progressive decline in the MWF model). Our study is among the first using ultrastructural analysis and reporting re-appearance of foot processes and improvement of slit diaphragm barrier following therapy with AT1 receptor blockade.</p><p>In addition to glomerular, RenTg mice displayed also tubular epithelial lesions typical of chronic kidney disease. Thus, the expression of megalin, a tubular protein contributing to protein reabsorption and endocytosis was decreased in 12 mo-old RenTg mice, whereas it returned to normal levels following AT1 receptor antagonism. In agreement with an Ang II-induced effect on megalin expression, treatment with Ang II decreased mRNA and protein expression of megalin in a renal tubular cell line in vitro&#x0003b; this decreased expression resulted to a suppression of cellular uptake and degradation of albumin by these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Hosojima1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Decrease or loss of E-cadherin expression is a typical alarm signal indicating disappearance of the normal epithelial phenotype, whereas induction of FSP-1 expression is associated to the appearance of myofibroblasts and interstitial fibrosis. Thus, in addition to megalin decrease, RenTg mice showed decreased expression of E-cadherin concomitant to the appearance of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and increased expression of FSP-1&#x0003b; AT1 receptor antagonism reversed to normal these phenomena. Since numerous in vitro studies showed that E-cadherin loss and increased FSP-1 expression are induced by the action of TGF&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Ivanova1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Okada1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and since TGF&#x003b2; is considered as a major mediator of the pro-fibrotic action of Ang II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Carvajal1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Weigert1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, it is logical to propose that the changes in E-cadherin and FSP-1 expressions in the RenTg mice are due to the Ang II-induced activation of TGF&#x003b2; pathway.</p><p>To address the above issue, we measured the expression levels of several members of the TGF&#x003b2; superfamily. Comforting our hypothesis, expression levels of TGF&#x003b2;, or of agents assisting or acting as co-factors such as CTGF and LTBP4 were upregulated in 12 mo old RenTg mice. Interestingly, the abnormal upregulation of TGF&#x003b2; protein expression was evident in glomerular and tubular interstitial compartments of the kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006721-g008">Fig. 8E</xref>). This observation suggests that TGF&#x003b2; was the common mediator of podocyte and tubular phenotype changes in RenTg mice. We have reported previously that Ang II induced collagen I synthesis and renal fibrosis through activation of TGF&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Boffa1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Boffa2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, systemic infusion of Ang II into normal rats increased renal CTGF mRNA and protein levels and induced renal injury&#x0003b; AT1 receptor antagonism prevented CTGF increase and the development of renal disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Ruprez1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Other studies observed increased levels of CTGF associated to the development of proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis in murine models of diabetic nephropathy&#x0003b; in these studies, administration of CTGF antisense reduced proteinuria and serum creatinine and mesangial expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Guha1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent data strongly suggest LTBP-4 as an important regulator of TGF&#x003b2; activation and the TGF&#x003b2;-induced fibroblast differentiation associated to the development of fibrosis in tissues such as lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Zhou1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggest that a similar interaction between TGF&#x003b2; and LTBP-4 also occurs during renal disease. The TGF&#x003b2; superfamily includes the BMPs, which in addition to their bone morphogenic action are also antagonists of the pro-fibrotic action of TGF&#x003b2;. In this regard, it has been shown that exogenous administration of pharmacological doses of BMP7 reversed renal disease in several models of experimental renal disease in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Zeisberg1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Zeisberg2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In our model, the gene expression of major BMPs, such as BMP4 and BMP7 remained unchanged in the renal cortex of 12 mo-old RenTg mice before or after AT1 receptor antagonism. Of note, the expression of agents described as endogenous antagonists of BMPs such as noggin and USAG-1 strongly increased with the progression of renal disease in RenTg, and decreased to normal levels during AT1 receptor treatment. Recent studies showed that the USAG-1 is abundantly expressed in the kidney, and in kidney injury models, the ratio of USAG-1 to BMP-7 expression decreased with kidney damage but increased after subsequent kidney regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, mice lacking USAG-1 are resistant to renal injury. Thus, USAG1-/- mice exhibited prolonged survival and preserved renal function in acute (cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity) or chronic (unilateral ureteral obstruction) renal injury models. The preservation of the renal function in USAG-1-/- mice was attributed to the enhancement of endogenous BMP signaling and action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Yanagita1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Noggin is another agent antagonizing the BMP signalling pathway in a variety of cell and/or tissues in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Zimmerman1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Zeisberg3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Very little is known about the Ang II effects on USAG-1 or noggin. To our knowledge, the present study is among the first reporting that the expression of endogenous antagonists of BMPs is induced during hypertensive chronic kidney disease and is reversed during AT1 receptor antagonism. It appears thus, that the development of fibrosis and chronic renal disease is not just a question of increased levels of TGF&#x003b2;, but is a more complex process involving TGF&#x003b2;, its co-factors, the BMPs and their endogenous antagonists, at least in the RenTg model. In this regard, it would be interesting to develop and test in renal diseases pharmacological agents specifically blocking the endogenous inhibitors of BMPs.</p><p>In conclusion, using a novel transgenic strain of mice we show that proteinuria and alterations in the expression of proteins involved in the integrity and function of podocytes or typical of the epithelial phenotype can be reversed when the local action of angiotensin II is blocked, even in aged animals with advanced renal injury. This recovery does not seem to result from correction in the phenotype of a particular cell type, but is rather the result of blocking the detrimental action of Ang II-TGF&#x003b2; pathway in several types of renal cells simultaneously, leading thus to a functional and structural improvement in all renal compartments. Thus our study provides hope that patients suffering from chronic kidney disease would be efficiently treated and opens new insights on the mechanisms involved in this renal recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals and experimental design</title><p>Experiments were performed using a transgenic strain of mouse (RenTg) backcrossed in the gentic background 129SV that is described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006721-Caron1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.
