It is documented that Cdc13p binds specifically to single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> telomeric DNA sequences and interacts with Stn1p. To localize the region for single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> DNA binding, Cdc13p mutants were constructed by deletion mutagenesis and assayed for their binding activity. Based on <italic>in vitro</italic> electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a 243-amino-acid fragment of Cdc13p (amino acids 451&#x02013;693) was sufficient to bind single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> with specificity similar to that of the native protein. Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> observation, <italic>in vivo</italic> one-hybrid analysis also indicated that this region of Cdc13p was sufficient to localize itself to telomeres. However, the telomere-binding region of Cdc13p (amino acids 451<bold>&#x02013;</bold>693) was not capable of complementing the growth defects of <italic>cdc13</italic> mutants. Instead, a region comprising the Stn1p-interacting and telomere-binding region of Cdc13p (amino acids 252<bold>&#x02013;</bold>924) complemented the growth defects of <italic>cdc13</italic> mutants. These results suggest that binding to telomeres by Cdc13p is not sufficient to account for the cell viability, interaction with Stn1p is also required. Taken together, we have defined the telomere-binding domain of Cdc13p and showed that both binding to telomeres and Stn1p by Cdc13p are required to maintain cell growth.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres are the specialized structure at the very ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeres are essential for the maintenance of chromosome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c2">2</xref>). They prevent end-to-end fusion of chromosomes, protect chromosome from degradation by nucleases and facilitate the complete replication of chromosomes. They also suppress the expression of nearby genes, a phenomenon known as telomere position effect (TPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c3">3</xref>). Telomeres might also position chromosomes within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c4">4</xref>). In most of the cloned telomeric sequences, telomeres are composed of short tandem repeated sequences with the strand running in a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction toward the guanine (G)-rich ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c1">1</xref>). The sequence and the number of repeats vary considerably in different species. For example, the telomere sequences of yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> are &#x0223c;250&#x02013;300 bp of TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>&#x0002f;C<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>A, whereas those of human are &#x0223c;10 kb TTAGGG&#x0002f;CCCTAA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c2">2</xref>). Besides the double-stranded telomeric DNA repeats, telomeres in all of the organisms that have been analyzed, also contain a G-rich single-stranded tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c7">7</xref>). In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, a &#x0003e;30 base single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> tail was detected in late S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c8">8</xref>). This single-stranded tail was postulated as an intermediate during telomere replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Protein factors that interact with telomeres participate in telomere functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c10">10</xref>). Factors that bind to the double-stranded telomeric DNA sequences have been identified from many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c16">16</xref>). These proteins are essential for the maintenance of telomere functions and cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c16">16</xref>). For example, in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, Rap1p has been shown to bind double-stranded telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c18">18</xref>). Mutations on Rap1p affect the length of telomere, TPE, localization of the telomere within the nucleus, telomere recombination and cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c21">21</xref>). Moreover, protein factors bound to the single-stranded telomeric DNA were identified in several organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c30">30</xref>). Among these protein factors, <italic>Oxytricha</italic> telomere-binding protein is well characterized. The protein is heterodimeric and is composed of an &#x003b1; subunit and a &#x003b2; subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c33">33</xref>). The &#x003b1; subunit is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that binds to the G<sub>4</sub>T<sub>4</sub> single-stranded end of the telomere. Although the &#x003b2; subunit is not directly involved in binding, it is required for terminus-specific binding. In the yeast genome, there is no homologue of the <italic>Oxytricha</italic> &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-like binding proteins. Instead, Cdc13p binds to single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences <italic>in vitro</italic> and interacts with telomeres <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c34">34</xref>). It is believed that, in yeast, Cdc13p is the functional equivalent of <italic>Oxytricha</italic> &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; binding proteins despite there being no sequence similarity between <italic>Oxytricha</italic> telomere-binding proteins and yeast Cdc13p (J.-J.Lin, unpublished observation). Furthermore, Cdc13p dissociates from single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> DNA at 300 mM NaCl (J.J.Lin and V.A.Zakian, unpublished result) whereas the binding of <italic>Oxytricha</italic> proteins to G<sub>4</sub>T<sub>4</sub> DNA remains associated even at 2&#x000a0;M NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c33">33</xref>). Thus, Cdc13p might represent a class of single-stranded telomere-binding protein that is different from the <italic>Oxytricha</italic> protein.</p><p><italic>CDC13</italic> is an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c35">35</xref>). It is involved in cell cycle control, because a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>CDC13</italic>, <italic>cdc13-1</italic>, causes the cell cycle to arrest in G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phase at the non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c35">35</xref>). This cell cycle control is dependent on the gene product of <italic>RAD9</italic>, which was postulated to be involved in surveying the integrity of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c36">36</xref>). Cdc13p might enable Rad9p to differentiate whether the ends of a linear DNA are telomeres or broken ends by binding to telomeres. It is also demonstrated that <italic>cdc13-1</italic> cells at the non-permissive temperature accumulate single-stranded G-rich DNA near telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c35">35</xref>). Nevertheless, it is unclear whether this single-stranded G-rich DNA is recognized as a damage to trigger the checkpoint mechanism. Since a mutation allele of <italic>CDC13</italic>, <italic>cdc13</italic><italic><sup>est</sup></italic>, causes gradual loss of telomere, Cdc13p also appears to regulate the length of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c24">24</xref>). At least a portion of the telomere function of Cdc13p is contributed by its interaction with Stn1p. <italic>STN1</italic> was identified from a high copy suppressor screening to rescue the temperature-sensitive lethality of <italic>cdc13-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c37">37</xref>) and direct interaction of Cdc13p with Stn1p was demonstrated by two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c37">37</xref>). Moreover, telomere defects caused by <italic>STN1</italic> mutation are similar, if not identical, to <italic>CDC13</italic> mutation, suggesting that these two genes act together in maintaining telomere function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c37">37</xref>).</p><p><italic>CDC13</italic> encodes a 924-amino-acid protein with molecular mass of 104 895 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c35">35</xref>). Sequence comparison between Cdc13p and known DNA- or RNA-binding proteins did not provide any information on the region within Cdc13p responsible for interacting with telomeres (J.-J.Lin, unpublished observation). Thus, Cdc13p might contain a novel DNA-interacting motif for binding to telomeres. In order to identify the functional domains of Cdc13p, we have generated deletion mutants and examined the single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>-binding activity and their ability to interact with Stn1p. Here we showed that Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p, a Cdc13p fragment ranging from amino acids 451 to 693, retain the single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>-binding activity. We also showed that binding to telomeres by Cdc13p is not sufficient to maintain cell viability. Moreover, amino acids 252&#x02013;924, which covered the telomere-binding and Stn1p-interacting activities of Cdc13p, are sufficient to account for the essential function of Cdc13p.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain DH5&#x003b1; was used as host for plasmid construction and propagation, and strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p purification.

The levels of cell growth with 3-AT for the HIS-Int-CA strain carrying plasmid vector alone (Act), Cdc13-DB or Act-Cdc13-DB were similar, indicating that Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p would not bind internal TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>&#x0002f;C<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>A duplex DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd677f4">4</xref>, right panel).

Here, plasmids expressing Cdc13p, Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p, Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p, Cdc13(451&#x02013;924)p or Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p were constructed and transformed into yeast strain 2758-8-4b, a temperature-sensitive mutant of <italic>CDC13</italic> (<italic>cdc13-1</italic>). Yeast strain 2758-8-4b (<italic>cdc13-1</italic>) grows normally at 25&#x000b0;C and arrests at G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phase of the cell cycle at 30&#x000b0;C.

Cells expressing Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p grew at all three temperatures tested.

Since Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p could not complement the growth arrest caused by the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutation, telomere-binding activity alone was therefore not sufficient to account for the essentiality of Cdc13p.</p><p>To test whether Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p complements the null allele of <italic>cdc13</italic>, a plasmid loss experiment was conducted.

If a second plasmid introduced into the yeast expresses functional <italic>CDC13</italic>, YJL501 then no longer requires plasmid YEP24-CDC13 for viability. Growth on 5-FOA is used to monitor the loss of YEP24-CDC13. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd677f5">5</xref>B, 5-FOA-resistant cells were observed in YJL501 transformed with plasmid expressing Cdc13p. Similarly, 5-FOA-resistant cells were observed in YJL501 expressing Cdc13(252&#x02013;924), although this rescue was &#x0223c;10- to 100-fold less efficient than that of Cdc13p. However, transformation of YJL501 with plasmid vector, pTHA-NLS, or plasmids expressing other fragments of <italic>CDC13</italic> did not yield any 5-FOA-resistant cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd677f5">5</xref>B).

Two-hybrid analysis was used previously to establish the interaction between Cdc13p and Stn1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c37">37</xref>). Here, we used the same approach to dissect the region within Cdc13p that interacts with Stn1p.

Similarly, using &#x003b2;-galactosidase as the reporter system, the color-forming ability of Cdc13-1p was reproducibly reduced, as compared with that of Cdc13p at 30 or 37&#x000b0;C (data not shown). These results indicated that Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p was capable of interacting with Stn1p.

Smaller fragments such as Cdc13(510&#x02013;693), Cdc13(451&#x02013;600) or Cdc13(601&#x02013;693) did not show detectable single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> binding activity. It is unclear whether Cdc13(510&#x02013;693)p, which covers amino acids 557 to &#x0223c;690, did not interact with single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> DNA. Nevertheless, our identification of Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p as a stably expressed telomeric-binding domain of Cdc13p provides useful information for future understanding of how Cdc13p binds and modulates telomere function.</p><p>The identity of the second migration bands using TG30 or TG35 as DNA substrate is unclear (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd677f2">2</xref>). The simplest explanation for the appearance of this second migration band would be that TG30 or TG35 provides enough space for two molecules of Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p to bind. This result would also imply that the optimal binding site of Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p on DNA was &#x0223c;13&#x02013;15 bases, an estimation that is in reasonable agreement with the results of using a 34-kDa Cdc13 DBD by Huges <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c42">42</xref>). However, this explanation is complicated by observations from several reports that telomeric DNA-binding proteins can also promote the formation of a G-quartet structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c44">44</xref>). It will be interesting to know whether Cdc13p promotes the formation of a G-quartet structure upon binding.</p><p>Contrary to the ciliate telomere-binding proteins, both Cdc13p and Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p preferred low salt for binding (data not shown). Sequence analysis of this 243-amino-acid region did not provide information on which residues within this region are responsible for interacting with telomeres. Evidence was presented that single-stranded DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA via hydrophobic interactions between aromatic side chains of the protein and the DNA bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c47">47</xref>). For example, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein T4 gp32 utilizes residues Tyr84, 99, 106, 115, 137, 186 and Phe138 to form a hydrophobic pocket to interact with the bases of single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c46">46</xref>). In addition, the <italic>Oxytricha</italic> &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; complex uses a series of aromatic amino acids including Tyr130&#x003b1;, Tyr293&#x003b1;, Tyr134&#x003b2;, His292&#x003b1;, Phe109&#x003b2; and Tyr239&#x003b1; to interact with the extended bases of single-stranded T<sub>4</sub>G<sub>4</sub> DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c47">47</xref>). It is likely that aromatic residues within the 243 amino acids of Cdc13p play a role in the interaction with telomeres. Interestingly, this region indeed has a high content of aromatic residues. However, it remains to be determined which amino acid residues are responsible for this protein&#x02013;DNA interaction.</p><p>Using the one-hybrid system, Bourns <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c34">34</xref>) showed previously that the N-terminal 251 amino acids of Cdc13p interacted with telomere, but that amino acids 252&#x02013;508 or 509&#x02013;924 of Cdc13p failed to do so. Since the N-terminal 251&#x000a0;amino acids were sufficient to target Cdc13p to telomere, it was concluded that the telomere-binding domain was within this region of Cdc13p. In contrast to their study, we showed that the telomere-binding domain was mapped to within the 451&#x02013;693 amino acids of Cdc13p both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd677f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd677f4">4</xref>). Given that the N-terminal 1&#x02013;251 amino acids of Cdc13p did not bind to single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd677f1">1</xref>), it would be interesting to know how this region of Cdc13p interacts with telomeres <italic>in vivo</italic>. Clearly, <italic>in vivo</italic> one-hybrid system detected not only proteins that interact directly with telomeric DNA but also those that interact indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c34">34</xref>). For example, Sir and Rif proteins interact with telomeres by their ability to bind Rap1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c50">50</xref>). One possible explanation is that this N-terminal 251-amino-acid fragment interacts indirectly with the telomere. Conceivably, protein factors that associated with telomeres including Rap1p, Rif proteins and Sir proteins, are potential candidates for recruiting the N-terminal 251-amino-acid polypeptide of Cdc13p to telomeres.</p><p>A Pro371 to Ser substitution caused the phenotype of Cdc13-1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c25">25</xref>). On the basis of gel mobility-shift assay, the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutation did not affect the telomere-binding activity of Cdc13p &#x0005b;J.-J.Lin and V.A.Zakian, unpublished result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c42">42</xref>)&#x0005d;. In our two-hybrid system, the interaction of Cdc13-1p with Stn1p was temperature dependent and the interaction was reduced at the non-permissive temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd677f6">6</xref>). This result indicated that interaction between Cdc13p and Stn1p is essential for cell survival. While we cannot rule out that another uncharacterized change in Cdc13-1p is responsible for the cell cycle arrest at the non-permissive temperature, relatively weak interaction between Cdc13-1p and Stn1p might indeed cause the accumulation of single-stranded G-rich DNA near telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd677c35">35</xref>) leading to this phenotype.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd677f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>-binding domain of Cdc13p.
