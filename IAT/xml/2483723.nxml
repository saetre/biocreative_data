In other proteins, disease-associated amino acid mutations have been analyzed according to the chemical severity of the changes and the locations of the altered amino acids according to their conservation over metazoan evolution.

Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are under-represented at evolutionarily conserved sites in HERG, but distribute randomly in KCNQ1. AAMs are chemically more severe, according to Grantham's Scale, than changes observed in evolution and their severity correlates with the expected chemical severity of the involved codon. Expected chemical severity of a given amino acid also correlates with its relative contribution to arrhythmias. At evolutionarily variable sites, the chemical severity of the changes is also correlated with the expected chemical severity of the involved codon.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Unlike nsSNPs, AAMs preferentially locate to evolutionarily conserved, and functionally important, sites and regions within HERG and KCNQ1, and are chemically more severe than changes which occur in evolution.

Efflux of potassium ions through these channels is critical for repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Mutations that disrupt normal biosynthesis and function of KCNQ1 and HERG have been associated with three cardiac arrhythmias: Short QT syndrome (SQTS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], atrial fibrillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and Long QT syndrome (LQTS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To date, there are close to 200 reported arrhythmia-associated mutations (AAMs) in each channel, with more than 95% of which are linked to LQTS. This arrhythmia, which affects an estimated 1 in 5000&#x02013;10000 people worldwide, is characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram and can lead to Torsade de Pointes (TdP), ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. More recently, the progression from LQTS into TdP has been proposed as a cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and sudden unexplained death syndrome (SUDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Ninety percent of all known LQTS-associated mutations occur in HERG and KCNQ1.</p><p>In studies of larger groups of proteins, or individual proteins other than HERG and KCNQ1, disease-associated amino acid mutations (DAMs) have been analyzed according to the chemical severity of the change, as determined from Grantham's Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and the location and/or context of the altered amino acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. An up to two-fold increase in clinically observable disease occurs in parallel with increases in the amount of chemical change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In many proteins, DAMs are chemically more severe than changes over the course of evolution (called <italic>interspecific </italic>changes) and polymorphic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In rhodopsin, the chemical severity of DAMs also correlates with the expected chemical severity of a given codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], as determined by comparison with the normally occurring human codon.</p><p>The importance of an amino acid to protein function can be inferred from its conservation over the course of metazoan evolution. In many proteins, DAMs are overabundant at evolutionarily conserved and slowly evolving sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], presumably because sites that have experienced little interspecific variation are critical for function. Mutations at these sites are likely deleterious and would be removed from the population by natural selection, if given enough time. In some proteins, DAMs are unevenly distributed among functionally conserved domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], even after accounting for the length and number of evolutionarily conserved amino acids. These data imply that functionally conserved domains, like conserved sites, are less tolerant to mutations because of their greater importance to the overall protein function. However, according to the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, most nucleotide substitutions are phenotypically neutral and avoid natural selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Most nucleotide changes, except for disease-associated changes, might then be expected to distribute randomly throughout a protein. In a study of a large number of proteins, synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (sSNPs) were shown to distribute randomly consistent with a neutral phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Initial studies of non-synonymous (ns) SNPs in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 gene, were also shown to distribute randomly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, a more recent, study, using many proteins, showed that nsSNPs preferentially locate at variable sites and sites with high evolutionary rates, and are underrepresented at sites that are evolutionarily conserved and have low evolutionary rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the nature of the nsSNPs available e.g. ns SNPs are less disruptive when located at conserved sites in some proteins versus others, or to a difference in the nature of the conserved sites e.g. conserved sites in some proteins are less tolerant to amino acid changes.</p><p>In this study, we take advantage of the &#x0003e; 200 mutations reported per channel to quantitatively analyze, for the first time, the distribution of AAMs and non-synonymous SNPs within HERG and KCNQ1 and to determine the chemical severity of these changes, as compared to interspecific changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sequence alignment</title><p>Human protein and mRNA sequences for HERG and KCNQ1 were obtained from NCBI. Other vertebrate sequences were collected from a BLASTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] search at ENSEMBL (default parameters) and the NCBI non-redundant database. To eliminate the inclusion of sequences from closely related paralogs, a manual reciprocal best-hit analysis was used. Sequences were aligned by ClustalX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] using default settings. Less conserved regions in the N and/or C-termini were removed, leaving sequences corresponding to residues 1&#x02013;906 and 83&#x02013;599 of human HERG and human KCNQ1, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Collection of arrhythmia-associated mutations (AAMs) and non-synonymous polymorphisms (nsSNPs)</title><p>HERG and KCNQ1 AAMs were obtained from the NCBI OMIM database, the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Arrhythmias (WGA) LQTS gene database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and from primary literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Only missense mutations that fell within the aligned region were used, and each was included only once, to eliminate frequency bias, but multiple disease mutations could be associated with a single site. nsSNPs were collected from NCBI dbSNP, HAPMAP international and primary literature and were assumed to be phenotypically neutral based on their inclusion in the different databases. nsSNPs that overlapped with identified disease mutations were removed. The final data set included 172 AAMs and 16 nsSNPs for HERG, and 174 AAMs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and 12 nsSNPs for KCNQ1 (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Breakdown of clinical phenotype of disease mutations included in analyses</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">HERG</td><td align="left">KCNQ1</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Long QT</td><td align="left">166</td><td align="left">169</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Short QT</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Atrial Fibrillation</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">SIDS</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Long QT/SIDS</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total</td><td align="left">172</td><td align="left">174</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis and determination of interspecific variability</title><p>Aligned protein sequences, with gaps removed, were used to construct a phylogenetic tree using the maximum likelihood analysis in PHYLIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

The shape parameter was either fixed or free to vary and a likelihood ratio test was performed to evaluate model fitting. Evolutionary rates based on a Poisson model of evolution were established for every site and normalized to the maximum rate observed for each protein. Values between 0 and 1 were binned into eight different categories and used to represent eight different levels of evolutionary change. The analysis was performed on nucleotide sequence alignments of core regions, with gaps removed, of human and three closely related vertebrate orthologs, guided by protein sequence alignments. The expected number of mutations at the codons belonging to each rate category was calculated using a modification of Eq. 1 where N<sub>i </sub>is the number of codons belonging to i category, N is the total number of amino acid positions, and D<sup>total </sup>is the total number of disease mutations for each protein used in the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Distribution of AAMs among functionally important regions of the channels</title><p>To quantify over- or underrepresentation of AAMs in functionally conserved regions of the channels, we compared their distribution to that expected from a uniform or evolutionary hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

The voltage sensing domain (VSD) is composed of the first four transmembrane segments and a pore region is composed of S5, a re-entrant P-loop containing the selectivity filter, and S6. Mapping AAMs onto the sequences and predicted topologies of HERG and KCNQ1 subunits yielded some common distribution patterns as well as some unique to the individual proteins. The final data set used for HERG consists of 172 AAMs at 134 sites and 16 nsSNPs at 16 individual sites (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Of 30 sites harboring multiple AAMs, 24 sites had two, 4 sites had three and 2 sites had four.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. For example, both channels contain a large number of mutations within the pore region (23% and 29% for HERG and KCNQ1, respectively) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). On the other hand, differences in percentages of AAMs do exist in the intra- and extra-cellular linker regions as well as the two cytosolic termini. In HERG, 23% of all known disease mutations are found in the extracellular linkers (between S1 and S2, S3 and S4, S5 and the P-loop, and between the P-loop and S6). In KCNQ1, only 6% are found extracellularly whereas 20% are found in the intracellular linkers (between S2&#x02013;S3 and S4&#x02013;S5). These differences suggest that different linker regions contribution to overall function may be channel specific. Another difference occurs in the distal termini. In HERG, 27% of disease mutations are located in the N-terminus, compared to only 2% in KCNQ1. However, three quarters of these are located in the PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain, a basic helix-loop-helix domain that is unique to the HERG N-terminus and regulates channel closing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Disease mutation distribution by channel region</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Region</td><td align="left">HERG</td><td align="left">KCNQ1</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">N-term</td><td align="left">6%</td><td align="left">2%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">PAS</td><td align="left">21%</td><td align="left">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left">VSD</td><td align="left">9%</td><td align="left">11%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ICL</td><td align="left">3%</td><td align="left">20%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ECL</td><td align="left">23%</td><td align="left">6%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Pore</td><td align="left">23%</td><td align="left">29%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C-term</td><td align="left">15%</td><td align="left">32%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>PAS = Per-Arnt-Sim domain in HERG, N-term = N-terminal region used in analysis (excluding PAS domain in HERG), ECL = extracellular linker regions between S1&#x02013;S2, S3&#x02013;S4, S5-P loop and P-loop-S6, ICL = intracellular linker regions between S2&#x02013;S3 and S4&#x02013;S5, VSD = voltage sensing domain (only transmembrane portions), Pore = pore region including S5, P-loop and S6, C-term = C-terminal portion of channels used in this analysis.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>nsSNPs distribute differently from AAMs in HERG and KCNQ1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

In KCNQ1, 8/12 nsSNPs are found in the cytosolic regions and 4/12 nsSNPs are found in the transmembrane region. Most of these occur at sites that do not have associated disease mutations, suggesting that location is an important determinant of disease. In both channels, however, two sites situated in cytosolic regions harbor both disease and polymorphic mutations, suggesting that amino acid identity plays a role in channel dysfunction at certain sites.</p></sec><sec><title>AAMs occur preferentially at sites conserved throughout vertebrate evolution and at those with lower evolutionary rates of change</title><p>The majority of AAMs mapped to sites completely conserved throughout the evolution of the respective channel: 146/172 mutations (84.9%) in HERG, mapping to 114/906 (12.6%) of the sites used in the analysis, and 153/174 (87.9%) in KCNQ1, mapping to 110/517 (21.3%) of the sites used in the analysis. Conversely, 22/172 AAMs in HERG and 20/174 AAMs in KCNQ1, map to sites with interspecific variation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Only two sites in HERG and one in KCNQ1 involve an amino acid change that is observed in both the AAM and in interspecific change.

AAMs are found preferentially in the intracellular (IC) linker of KCNQ1 and the extracellular (EC) linker of HERG, as well as the PAS domain of HERG, but are underrepresented in the N- and C-termini of both channels. This finding is especially striking for KCNQ1 considering 32% of its disease mutations are found in the C-terminus.

Interspecific and expected chemical severities, however, were not correlated for KCNQ1, and had a very small correlation coefficient for HERG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>) (which becomes non-significant when three outliers are removed; not shown). These findings are consistent with previous studies, which suggest that interspecific chemical severity is not influenced by the expected chemical severity of the codon involved but rather by the process of natural selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Nonetheless, the chemical severities of changes tolerated at variable sites may be influenced by the codon's expected chemical severity. When completely conserved sites were removed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>), the expected chemical severity of the involved codon was correlated with interspecific chemical severity, for both HERG and KCNQ1, but to a lesser extent than with disease chemical severity based on slope and correlation co-efficient.</p><p>We next compared the average chemical severities of AAMs and nsSNPs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> displays the amino acid spectrum of residues involved in disease for both genes. We found that 28% of all AAMs in these two channels have occurred at either a glycine or arginine residue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). This is similar to a broader protein analysis reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The contribution of a particular residue to the overall disease spectrum may be influenced by the proportion of the given amino acid in these proteins. Therefore, we determined the number of disease mutations at a given residue as a proportion of the total number of the residue in both proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). Arginine and glycine residues remain highly represented suggesting they are more likely to be involved in a disease phenotype compared to other residues. The proportion of tryptophan residues involved in disease is also high, although the total number of tryptophan residues is low.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Mutations occur predominantly at arginine and glycine residues</bold>. a) Percentage of AAMs that occur at a given amino acid residue. b) Relative contribution of a given amino acid residue in HERG and KCNQ1 to AAMs. The total number of AAMs that occur at a given amino acid was divided by the total number of residue sites in the combination of the two protein regions used in the analysis. c) The number of AAMs in KCNQ1 and HERG at each of the twenty residues, proportional to their occurrence in the two channels, is significantly correlated (p = 0.001) with the amino acid's weighted average expected chemical severity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2148-8-188-6"/></fig><p>The high involvement of some residues in disease may be due to a high mutation rate that occurs at CpG dinucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] which is a result of a cytosine to thymine transition. This transition is possible in triplets coding for only five of the twenty amino acids, which are: arginine (4/6 codons), serine (1/6 codons), proline (1/4 codons), threonine (1/4 codons) and alanine (1/4 codons). Of the total number of AAMs in HERG and KCNQ1, only 13.3% are due to a C/T transition at a CpG dinucleotide. Of all arginine mutations resulting in disease, 47% are due to this specific nucleotide transition. These numbers suggest that CpG dinucleotides may contribute to the disease process but that this is not the only factor responsible for the high numbers of mutations in this sub-set of amino acids. A role for factors other that CpG dinucleotide hypermutability is also supported by the high involvement of glycines and tryptophans in disease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>), which do not possess CpG dinucleotides.</p><p>Our findings that the overall chemical severity of AAMs is greater than those of interspecific variation and SNPs, and that the chemical severity of AAMs correlates with expected chemical severity at those individual codons, suggest that chemical severity is on a continuum and that a threshold severity exists which, once crossed, results in disease. We might then expect that whether mutations at specific amino acids cause disease at all also depends on the expected chemical severity of the involved codon. To examine this, the proportion of total AAMs at a particular residue was plotted against the calculated weighted average of expected chemical severity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). A significant, positive correlation was found between these suggesting that expected chemical severity of a site contributes to the probability of obtaining a disease mutation, as well as to the severity of that mutation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that that AAMs are overabundant at evolutionarily conserved and slowly evolving sites, which are likely critical for channel function and thus intolerant of changes in amino acid sequence. Because KCNQ1 and HERG are highly conserved, an underlying neutral mutational process could produce large numbers of mutations at conserved sites. Our data provide the quantitative backing to support an over representation of AAMs at evolutionarily conserved positions in these channels. A smaller than expected, but still substantial, numbers of AAMs were found at sites that show interspecific variation. However, only two sites in HERG and one in KCNQ1 are converted to residues that are both an AAM and an interspecific change. Thus, the identity of the residue, rather than its location, is most responsible for producing the disease at sites that have undergone evolutionary change.</p><p>HERG and KCNQ1 possess structurally defined domains with specific functions that have been strongly preserved throughout the course of evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We found that AAMs are found preferentially in some domains, even after accounting for their size and evolutionary conservation. In both channels, the pore region possesses an overabundance of mutations, while both N- and C-termini possess an underabundance of mutations. The extracellular linker region had an overabundance of mutations in HERG, whereas the intracellular linker had an overabundance of mutations in KCNQ1. This implies that the extracellular linker may be more important to overall function in HERG, whereas the intracellular linker is more critical for function in KCNQ1. The overabundance of mutations in the PAS domain, not present in KCNQ1, highlights its functional importance and suggests that that the addition of a functionally important domain in a protein can increase susceptibility to disease. Overall regional conservation, which takes into account the average variability per site in a domain, contributes to the uneven regional distribution of disease-causing mutations in some proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], but we found this only for KCNQ1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). Therefore, factors other than domain size, site conservation and regional conservation must influence the domain specific distribution of AAMs in HERG, and possibly in KCNQ1 as well.</p><p>NsSNPs are underabundant at conserved sites in HERG, but distribute randomly in KCNQ1. The latter finding may be due to a small sample size, although the numbers of nsSNPs analyzed in HERG were similarly small. This difference between the channels may be because nsSNPs are less disruptive when located at conserved sites in KCNQ1, or because conserved sites in HERG are less tolerant to amino acid changes. Nevertheless, the distribution of analyzed nsSNPs in both channels suggests that they are phenotypically neutral. The different patterns of nsSNP distribution between the KCNQ1 and HERG underscore the need to identify and quantitatively analyze the distribution of more nsSNPs on each protein, and to ascertain their impact on channel function and arrhythmia susceptibility. In HERG, it is known that some, but not all, polymorphisms may alter channel function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and also contribute to an increased QT interval duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In both HERG and KCNQ1, AAMs are chemically more severe than interspecific changes tolerated throughout evolution or polymorphisms that are not associated with disease. Codons with a higher expected chemical severity are associated with disease mutations with a high chemical severity. These data are in keeping with those found previously in rhodopsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and suggest that the intrinsic potential of the involved codon contributes to disease chemical severity.</p><p>We also provide novel evidence that the expected chemical severity of a codon contributes to the overrepresentation of certain amino acids in HERG and KCNQ1 AAMs, especially arginine, tryptophan and glycine. In a recent study of 437 proteins, these three amino acids were also highly overrepresented in DAMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, we predict that expected chemical severity plays an important role in determining the propensity of a given codon to cause disease in many proteins, in addition to other factors such as the residue's roles in biosynthesis, function and stability of the channels. Finally, the chemical severities of interspecific changes in KCNQ1 and HERG also correlate with those expected for the codons, when only evolutionarily variable sites are considered. These novel data argue that, in addition to a predicted role of natural selection, the expected chemical severity of the codon contributes to variation observed over the course of evolution in these channels. Despite the presumed predominance of natural selection, the genetic code has been shown to influence the mutational process when evolutionary divergence is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These data are significant given the uncertainty as to the role of natural selection versus non-adaptive forces in shaping genotypic and phenotypic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Our analyses may be influenced by the fact that some mutations may, in a systematic way, never be detected. For example, AAMs that lead to death before natural birth, or to SUDs, may never be identified unless the fetus or victim is subsequently screened for arrhythmogenic mutations. This could, in turn, reduce the number of observed mutations unique to certain sites or functional domains. The evaluation of AAMs has broadened, and identification of mutations in KCNQ1 and HERG, and in other candidate genes, associated with SIDs and SUDs has been carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Identification of AAMs in a more broad population may reveal a different sub-set of mutations that localize to unique regions within the channels, or more strongly support the susceptibility of sites and functional domains identified in this study to arrhythmogenic mutations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study represents the first quantitative evolutionary and chemical severity analysis of AAMs in the HERG and KCNQ1 potassium channel genes. Unlike nsSNPs, AAMs preferentially locate to evolutionarily conserved, and functionally important, sites and regions within HERG and KCNQ1, and are chemically more severe than changes which occur in evolution. Expected chemical severity may contribute to the overrepresentation of certain residues in AAMs, as well as to changes observed throughout evolution.</p><p>Our findings, together with those from other studies, suggest that novel DAMs and AAMs may be recognized quickly by surveying naturally occurring variation among species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. If a SNP identified in an individual does not appear in other species at that position, then it is likely to be disease-causing. The location of AAMs (to conserved or variable regions and/or residues) may correlate with clinical severity or other characteristics of the diseases. In the case of Long QT syndrome, genotype and specific mutations have been shown to contribute to phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and the underlying genetic defects contribute to risk stratification, prevention and therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Unfortunately, there is still considerable variation in Long QT phenotype and age of disease onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, continued discovery and mapping of mutations, as done in this study, along with parallel studies on disease phenotype will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship, help to better predict the outcome of novel disease mutations and aid in development of mutation-specific therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Together, HJ and EA designed the study, interpreted the data and drafted the manuscript.
