The sequence of the DNA-binding domain of Tbf1p is more closely related to that of the human telomeric proteins TRF1 and TRF2 than to any yeast protein sequence, yet the functional homologue of TRF1 and TRF2 is thought to be Rap1p. In this study we show that the Tbf1p DNA-binding domain can target the Gal4 transactivation domain to a (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> sequence inserted in the yeast genome, supporting the model that Tbf1p binds this sub-telomeric repeat motif <italic>in vivo</italic>. Immunofluorescence of Tbf1p shows a spotty pattern throughout the interphase nucleus and along synapsed chromosomes in meiosis, suggesting that Tbf1p binds internal chromosomal sites in addition to sub-telomeric regions. PCR-assisted binding site selection was used to define a consensus for high affinity Tbf1p-binding sites. Compilation of 50 selected oligonucleotides identified the consensus TAGGGTTGG. Five potential Tbf1p-binding sites resulting from a search of the total yeast genome were tested directly in gel shift assays and shown to bind Tbf1p efficiently <italic>in vitro</italic>, thus confirming this as a valid consensus for Tbf1p recognition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the DNA-binding protein Tbf1p (TTAGGG repeat binding factor 1) is encoded by a gene essential for mitotic growth and was originally cloned through its ability to bind human type telomere repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c1">1</xref>). Interestingly, its DNA-binding domain is closely related to that of telomeric proteins in fission yeast (telomere-associated in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> protein, Taz1p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c2">2</xref>) and in vertebrates (TTAGGG repeat factors 1 and 2, TRF1 and TRF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c3">3</xref>). These conserved sequences also exhibit significant homologies to a single Myb repeat and are often referred to as Myb-like sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c4">4</xref>). On the other hand, their high degree of similarity identifies them as members of a distinct group of Myb repeats, called the &#x02018;telobox&#x02019; family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c6">6</xref>). The telobox domains of TRF1, TRF2 and Taz1p are sufficient to bind telomeric DNA specifically <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c7">7</xref>). The binding specificity of all the members of the telobox family is likely to be highly related to the TTAGGG type of telomeric repeat since Tbf1p, TRF1, TRF2 and Taz1p show a high affinity for TTAGGG-like repeats but not to the irregular telomeric repeats of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. The major telomere repeat DNA-binding protein in budding yeast is Rap1p, which binds DNA through two degenerate Myb repeats, only distantly related to teloboxes.</p><p>In yeast, the telomere-associated repeats X and Y&#x02032; contain multiple TTAGGG- or TTAGGG-like repeats, which are known to bind Tbf1p <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c9">9</xref>). This suggests that this protein exerts a function at chromosome ends through binding to sub-telomeric regions. This hypothesis was recently reinforced by the demonstration that Tbf1p sites can counteract telomeric position effects and, more generally, Sir-mediated transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c9">9</xref>). The sub-telomeric regions containing the Tbf1p sites and exhibiting anti-silencing activities were named STARs for <underline>s</underline>ub-<underline>t</underline>elomeric <underline>a</underline>nti-silencing <underline>r</underline>egions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c9">9</xref>). Furthermore, unpublished data from our laboratory demonstrate that Tbf1p proteins artificially tethered to DNA recapitulate STAR activities, blocking propagation of the silent chromatin (G.Fourel, C.Boscheron, E.Revardel and E.Gilson, in preparation). The anti-silencing properties of Tbf1p in the X and Y&#x02032; elements are redundant with Reb1p, a weak transactivation factor whose binding sites are found in a variety of yeast promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c12">12</xref>). Several Tbf1p and Reb1p sites are clustered in the STARs of X and Y&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c9">9</xref>). STARs might form boundaries to limit telomeric position effects and&#x0002f;or to protect the telomere from the influence of sub-telomeric elements. Interestingly, reminiscent of the enhancer-blocking activity of metazoan insulators, Reb1p was reported to inhibit transcription when placed between an upstream activating sequence and a TATA element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c13">13</xref>). The possibility that Tbf1p and&#x0002f;or Reb1p could be involved in boundary effects throughout the yeast genome makes them an attractive target for further analysis.</p><p>In this study we first demonstrate that Tbf1p binds sub-telomeric TTAGGG-like repeats using a one-hybrid system. We then asked whether Tbf1p could bind non-sub-telomeric regions in the yeast genome. We started this analysis by determining a consensus sequence for high affinity Tbf1p binding sites through a PCR-based selection method. Using the consensus, 52 potential binding sites were found scattered through the yeast genome. The presence of a large number of chromosome-associated Tbf1p proteins was confirmed by the analysis of Tbf1p immunostaining in yeast nuclei and meiotic chromosomes. Overall, these data predict an important role for Tbf1p throughout the entire genome and not only in sub-telomeric regions. Furthermore, the potential Tbf1p-binding sites identified in this work will serve as important starting points in further studies of the possible roles of Tbf1p.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strain constructs and &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> DNA manipulation, plasmid extraction and Southern blot analysis were carried out as descibed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c14">14</xref>).

As reported previously for (TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>)<sub>n</sub> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c22">22</xref>), the YTEL strain exhibits a high level of activation likely to be due to binding of multiple Rap1p molecules (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f1">1</xref>B). More interestingly, both HTEL1 and HTEL2 show an increase in &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity when carrying the pA-TBD plasmid, which encodes the transactivation domain of Gal4 fused to the Tbf1p DNA-binding domain (abbreviated to TBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c1">1</xref>) and not when they contain the parental plasmid encoding only the Gal4 moiety (pGAD424) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f1">1</xref>B). The level of transactivation due to pA-TBD is much stronger for HTEL2 (~12&#x000a0;times the level of the same strain without pA-TBD) than for HTEL1 (~3 times; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f1">1</xref>B). The same reporter constructs present on a multicopy plasmid (pHTel2) also exhibited a much higher level of transactivation due to pA-TBD than that of pHTel1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f1">1</xref>C). Thus, a GAD&#x02013;TBD hybrid protein can activate a promoter carrying an upstream (TTAGGG)<sub>10</sub> insert. This finding demonstrates that the Tbf1p DNA-binding domain binds <italic>in vivo</italic> to (TTAGGG)<sub>10</sub>, which has previously only been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c8">8</xref>). This strongly suggests that Tbf1p also binds to sub-telomeric TTAGGG-like repeats <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Tbf1p immunolocalisation in interphase nuclei and in meiotic chromosome spreads</title><p>A polyclonal antiserum raised against the TBD polypeptide in rabbit was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c3">3</xref>). After affinity purification this serum is monospecific for Tbf1p in western blot analysis of total yeast protein extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c3">3</xref>; data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence using the TBD antiserum on vegetatively growing yeast cells is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>A. The Tbf1p staining (green) is exclusively nuclear, as shown by its co-localisation (yellow) with ethidium bromide fluorescence (red) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>Ac). This staining forms a dispersed network throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>Ab). The intensity of theTbf1p fluorescence signal correlates with that due to ethidium bromide, suggesting that most Tbf1p is directly associated with chromatin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>A, compare a and b). This network pattern was obtained with a variety of wild-type strains (data not shown and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>A) and with affinity-purified antibodies as well as the antiserum. Omission of the primary antibody showed no FITC signal above background (data not shown), confirming the monospecificity of the antiserum. Interestingly, in nearly all nuclei Tbf1p is clearly excluded from a crescent-shaped domain of the nucleus always located at one pole, which is characteristic of the yeast nucleolus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>A). This zone of Tbf1p exclusion contains a discrete DNA loop visible by ethidium staining, marked by a triangle in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>Ac, which is likely to represent the rDNA of chromosome XII when the nucleolar RNA is released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c24">24</xref>). It appears, therefore, that Tbf1p is not part of the yeast nucleolus. Tbf1p localisation was also studied in meiotic (pachytene) chromosomes to see if its staining is, like that of Rap1p, enriched at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c19">19</xref>). A micropunctate pattern was observed all along the meiotic chromosomes, suggesting the presence of numerous Tbf1p sites in yeast chromosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>B, compare a and b). Unlike Rap1p, Tbf1p was not predominantly found at telomeres. However, brighter immunofluorescence spots appear to be found at the ends of some paired chromosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>Bc), consistent with the original hypothesis that sub-telomeric regions are also Tbf1p-binding sites <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In summary, immunofluorescence studies with interphase nuclei and with meiotic spreads revealed the presence of many Tbf1p sites along yeast chromosomes, not necessarily exclusively at sub-telomeric locations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>). Therefore, in the rest of this work we will investigate the presence of Tbf1p DNA-binding sites outside sub-telomeric regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of specific Tbf1p-binding sites</title><p>In order to select for high affinity Tbf1p-binding sites from random sequence oligonucleotides we used the Casting method (<underline>c</underline>yclic <underline>a</underline>mplification and <underline>s</underline>election for <underline>t</underline>argets) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c25">25</xref>).

The DNA-binding properties of ETBD and of full-length Tbf1p expressed in a reticulocyte lysate are indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c9">9</xref>; data not shown).</p><p>The 40 bp oligonucleotide D10 containing a central random sequence of 10 bp was used as template to start the selection (see Materials and Methods). The choice of the N<sub>10</sub> core was based on previous studies, which indicated that this length would allow a search for single binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c8">8</xref>; data not shown). A 48 bp oligonucleotide D3 containing the (TTAGGG)<sub>2</sub> sequence was used as a positive control. To ensure that all possible combinations of the 10 nt randomised region (4<sup>10</sup> &#x0003d; 10<sup>6</sup>) would be represented, 70 ng (2.5 pmol) of D10, containing ~10<sup>12</sup> molecules, were used in each binding reaction. The protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were separated by gel electrophoresis, cut out from the gel, electroeluted, amplified by PCR with primers D10A and D10B and used in further rounds of selection. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f3">3</xref> shows the progressive enrichment of ETBD-binding sites. No retarded complexes with the D10 probe nor with the D10.1 probe obtained after the first PCR amplification could be visualised (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f3">3</xref>, lanes 3 and 5) as compared to the complexes formed with D3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f3">3</xref>, lane 1). In these cases, the ETBD&#x02013;DNA complex was excised blind, based on the position of retarded ETBD&#x02013;DNA complexes. After the second round of selection (D10.2, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f3">3</xref>, lane 8), the complexes were detected and their relative amount increased each round, until the sixth round (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f3">3</xref>, lane 15). At this point selection was stopped.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the selected binding sites</title><p>The DNA recovered after rounds 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 was amplified by PCR with primers D10A and D10B. The PCR products were digested with <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Hin</italic>dIII, purified on a 10&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel, electoeluted and inserted into pBSK. At total of 50 independent clones were isolated and sequenced (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb1">1</xref>). Examination of these sequences revealed that an exact match to TAGGG appeared in a vast majority (41 of 50). When this sequence, or one-mismatch derivatives, was employed as a reference point, other nucleotide positions displayed marked sequence preferences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f4">4</xref>). A consensus corresponding to TAGGGTTGG was evident from the alignment of all of these sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f4">4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb1">1</xref>). For the nine oligonucleotides that do not contain the TAGGG motif, the sequence that conformed best to the consensus was used in the alignment. The consensus is composed of bases that are observed &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of the time at each position. Inspection of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f4">4</xref> reveals that this cut-off value, although arbitrary, accurately reflects the nucleotide distribution in the observed data set. In a portion of the oligonucleotides, the sequence homologous to the TAGGGTTGG consensus overlaps the cloning sites of the N<sub>10</sub> oligonucleotide. We did not recover oligonucleotides containing multiple TAGGG core sequences or obvious repeated consensus sequences. The binding of ETBD to 35 of the 50 cloned sequences was checked by specific competition in band shift experiments (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb1">1</xref>; data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The Tbf1p consensus can be used to accurately predict genomic high affinity sites</title><p>We performed computer-assisted searches on the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Genome Database (SGD) using PatMatch with the consensus sequence TAGGGTTGG. A total occurrence of 52 exact matches was obtained, including 10 that were not in open reading frames (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f5">5</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>). To confirm that the sites detected in the yeast genome using the Tbf1p consensus indeed bind Tbf1p in the context of their surrounding sequences, double-stranded oligonucleotides of 30 bp spanning five potential Tbf1p sites were synthesised, four in intergenic regions (BI, SP, CI and MK) and one in a coding region (YI) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f5">5</xref>). As negative controls we designed two double-stranded oligonucleotides of identical size, but corresponding to regions juxtaposed to two potential Tbf1p sites, named NS1 and NS2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f5">5</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f6">6</xref>A, probes derived from the oligonucleotides containing the Tbf1p consensus were avidly bound by ETBD, whereas the two probes lacking this sequence were not. Similar results were obtained with a highly purified ETBD preparation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f6">6</xref>B and C, lane 2; data not shown) and with full-length Tbf1p synthesised in a reticulocyte lysate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f6">6</xref>C, lane 3; data not shown). Furthermore, binding of ETBD appears similar between one of the potential chromosomal Tbf1p sites (YI) and a known Tbf1p-binding site, the STAR motif of the sub-telomeric X element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f6">6</xref>B). Overall, we conclude that the Tbf1p consensus predicts high affinity sites for bacterially produced ETBD and for full-length Tbf1p obtained from a eukaryotic source. This confirms the validity of the Tbf1p consensus sequence determined by our selection procedure.</p><p>The 52 potential Tbf1p binding sites identified in the yeast genome appear to be evenly distributed among the 16 yeast chromosomes and do not show any significant bias towards chromosome ends (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f5">5</xref>). Strikingly, none of the X or Y&#x02032; elements contains the Tbf1p consensus. However, five near matches to the Tbf1p consensus sequence can be found in these regions, with respect to the AGGG core sequence (designated Tbf1<sup>Y</sup>&#x02032;<sup>a</sup>, Tbf1<sup>Y</sup>&#x02032;<sup>b</sup>, Tbf1<sup>Y</sup><sup>&#x02032;c</sup>, Tbf1<sup>Xa</sup> and Tbf1<sup>Xb</sup> in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>; data not shown). These motifs probably account for most of the observed Tbf1p binding to sub-telomeric motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c9">9</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that efficient Tbf1p-binding sites can tolerate some sequence variations from the consensus. Exact matches to the sub-telomeric variants of the Tbf1p consensus are found at internal chromosomal locations (data not shown). This suggests the presence of other sets of Tbf1p sites scattered throughout the genome. Interestingly, the occurrences of sub-telomeric Tbf1p motifs are significantly enriched in intergenic regions, reaching 58&#x00025; of hits (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>). This distribution is clearly non-random, since the proportion of intergenic regions in the yeast genome is roughly 22&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c26">26</xref>). It is also clearly different from the profile of the Tbf1p consensus perfect matches, which does not appear to exhibit any particular bias towards intergenic region (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>). This raises the possibility that subsets of Tbf1p-binding sites have different roles in the genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of the distribution of Tbf1p and Reb1p sites</title><p>Since Tbf1p and Reb1p sites are found associated in the yeast sub-telomeric regions, we asked whether a significant number of potential Tbf1p sites co-localise with Reb1p sites. We made use of a Reb1p consensus sequence, previously defined by a PCR selection procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c11">11</xref>). Searching for the Reb1p-binding sequence CCGGGTAAC, 44 occurrences were found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f5">5</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>). As for the Tbf1p sites, the known sub-telomeric Reb1p sites do not perfectly match the Reb1p consensus. Therefore, other searches using sub-telomeric variants of the Reb1p sites with respect to the GGGTAA core sequence (designated Reb1<sup>Y</sup>&#x02032;, Reb1<sup>Xa</sup>, Reb1<sup>Xb</sup> and Reb1<sup>Xc</sup>) were performed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>). A comparison of the distribution of non-sub-telomeric Tbf1p and Reb1p sites failed to reveal any co-localisation (&#x0003c;500 nt) of these sites (data not shown). This is in contrast to the sub-telomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c27">27</xref>). Furthermore, this analysis did not reveal any internal chromosomal regions containing multiple Reb1p or Tbf1p sites.</p><p>Strikingly, the Reb1p consensus or its sub-telomeric variants are found almost exclusively in intergenic regions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>). This non-random distribution of Reb1p sites does not result from a particular nucleotide composition of the intergenic regions, since a sequence corresponding to the mirror symmetry of the Reb1p sequence used in the computer search (Reb1M) does not show any bias towards intergenic regions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>). Furthermore, if one mismatch is tolerated during the search, the number of occurrences greatly increases, but still displays a strong bias towards intergenic regions, reinforcing the significance of the non-random distribution observed for the perfect matches (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>). This bias towards intergenic regions was also observed for the sub-telomeric variants of the Tbf1p consensus, although to a lesser extent (see above). On the other hand, the bias is not observed for putative sites of two other yeast DNA-binding proteins, Rap1p and Abf1p (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>). The implications of this intriguing distribution of Tbf1p and Reb1p sites are considered in the Discussion.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The yeast protein Tbf1p, encoded by an essential gene, <italic>in vitro</italic> binds TTAGGG-like repeats which are found in sub-telomeric regions of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c9">9</xref>). In this paper we have investigated the localisation of Tbf1p in the yeast genome. We demonstrate that the Tbf1p DNA-binding domain (TBD) can target the Gal4 transactivation domain to a (TTAGGG)<sub>10</sub> sequence to activate transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since the hybrid protein is expressed at a low level (unpublished observation), this transactivation assay is expected to reflect the <italic>in vivo</italic> Tbf1p binding behaviour. Strikingly, the level of transactivation varies according to the orientation of the (TTAGGG)<sub>10</sub> sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f1">1</xref>). This effect could simply be due to differences in the junction sequence between the telomeric insert and the rest of the construct, altering the susceptibility of the promoter to be activated. Alternatively, and in agreement with the fact that the telomeric repeats have the same orientation, the effect of Tbf1p binding could be polar, being more capable of transactivation in one orientation than in the other. In any case, these results strongly suggest that the TTAGGG repeats present in sub-telomeric regions of yeast chromosomes are target sites for Tbf1p. This probably accounts for the Tbf1p spots visible at the end of some pachytene chromosomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>). Furthermore, the sequence characteristics of high affinity Tbf1p-binding sites have been investigated by a PCR-based selection procedure. Since the data set consisted of 50 independently selected oligonucleotides and since all of 35&#x000a0;randomly chosen oligonucleotides were confirmed to specifically bind Tbf1p, it is likely that the final consensus TAGGGTTGG faithfully predicts high affinity Tbf1p sites. Indeed, five regions of the yeast genome containing this sequence were confirmed to bind Tbf1p efficiently.</p><p>The gene encoding Tbf1p was cloned through its ability to bind the vertebrate type telomeric sequence (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c1">1</xref>). In agreement with this property of Tbf1p, the consensus identified in this work can be aligned thanks to only one mismatch to TAGGGTTAG, a sequence included in (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub>. Interestingly, this TAGGGTTAG sequence is identical to the binding site determined for a monomeric telobox domain of TRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c4">4</xref>) and highly similar to the YTAGGGTTR consensus sequence for the full-length TRF1 dimer, as identified by a SELEX procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c28">28</xref>). These data, together with the recent characterisation of Teb1p, a <italic>S.pombe</italic> telobox protein binding with high affinity to (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c7">7</xref>), fully support the proposal that teloboxes bind with high affinity to TTAGGG-like sequences <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c6">6</xref>).</p><p>Using the Tbf1p consensus sequence determined in this work, an overall 52 Tbf1p sites were detected in the entire yeast genome, distributed over 15 of the 16 chromosomes. Since only perfect matches to the consensus were sought, a number of Tbf1p sites may have escaped this analysis. For instance, known Tbf1p sites present in sub-telomeric regions were not selected. Motifs closely related to the consensus are found repeated in these regions, which could cooperate to create a high affinity Tbf1p-binding area. By using the perfect consensus, our search is likely to reveal only a subset of the Tbf1p sites in the genome, but will be of high predictive value. The binding of Tbf1p to these sites can be modulated <italic>in vivo</italic> by the presence of chromatin. For example, it is not known if Tbf1p recognises its site when the DNA is wrapped around the nucleosome. Nonetheless, the large number of signals seen in the immunofluorescence studies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>) suggests that the yeast genome contains a large number of Tbf1p sites, including those in the sub-telomeric regions.</p><p>In the sub-telomeric regions Tbf1p sites are associated with Reb1p sites to form regions that limit the propagation of silent chromatin emanating from the proximal telomere (STARs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c9">9</xref>). This does not seem to be the case for the putative Tbf1p and Reb1p sites found at internal chromosomal locations. For example, no putative Tbf1p site was found in the rDNA repeats, consistent with a lack of nucleolar staining with Tbf1p antibodies in interphase nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd388f2">2</xref>). In contrast, it is known that Reb1p binds and is required for expression of the rDNA transcription unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c29">29</xref>), as confirmed by our database search.</p><p>The putative Tbf1p and Reb1p sites detected in the yeast genome are found enriched in the intergenic regions. This is particularly pronounced for the Reb1p sites (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd388tb2">2</xref>). This is in contrast to a more even distribution between the intra- and intergenic regions of potential Rap1p and Abf1p and probably other transcriptional regulators. Indeed, transcriptional regulatory elements can be found within coding regions in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c31">31</xref>). We believe that the striking bias of Tbf1p or Reb1p sites towards intergenic regions reflects a particular function of these proteins. For example, the binding of Reb1p could create pause sites during elongation by various types of RNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd388c32">32</xref>). Because of the capacity of Tbf1p and Reb1p to mediate STAR insulator properties we speculate that the intergenic localisation of Tbf1p and Reb1p might reflect the delimitation of domains of independent gene expression.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd388f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub>-dependent one hybrid assays.
