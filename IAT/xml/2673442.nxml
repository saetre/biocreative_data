As a consequence, odd numbers of crossovers due to homologous recombination lead to the formation of chromosome dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Chromosome dimers threaten the segregation of genetic information if they are not taken care of at the time of cell division. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, chromosome dimer resolution depends on the addition of a crossover at <italic>dif</italic>, a 28-bp site located at the opposite of the origin of replication, by two related tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). This reaction can also serve to remove catenation links between newly replicated chromosomes when the activity of TopoIV, the major cellular decatenase, is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Recombination occurs within a nucleoprotein complex, (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub>, which contains two molecules of each of XerC and XerD and two synapsed <italic>dif</italic> sites. The XerC and XerD recombinases sequentially catalyse two pairs of DNA strand exchanges within this complex, such that the reaction proceeds via a Holliday Junction (HJ) intermediate. Xer recombination is under the control of a cell division protein, FtsK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), which permits its coordination with the last stage of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). FtsK can be divided into three domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A): an approximately 200 amino acids N-terminal domain (FtsK<sub>N</sub>), a long linker region rich in proline and glutamine and an approximately 500 amino acids C-terminal domain (FtsK<sub>C</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). FtsK<sub>N</sub> contains four transmembrane helices, targets the protein to the division septum and is essential for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). FtsK<sub>C</sub> is an ATP-dependent DNA translocase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome carries preferential loading sites for FtsK<sub>C</sub>, the KOPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). KOPS interact with the extreme C-terminal residues of FtsK, FtsK&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>). They promote the loading of FtsK<sub>C</sub> in a precise orientation, which dictates the direction of translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). KOPS are skewed on the two replichores of the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome: they point towards <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). This ensures that FtsK translocation brings together <italic>dif</italic> sites carried by a chromosome dimer. FtsK then activates recombination via a direct interaction between FtsK&#x003b3; and the C-terminal tail of XerD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Asymmetric Xer recombination assay.

FtsK<sub>C</sub> contains a RecA-type ATPase fold. In the presence of DNA, this fold assembles in hexameric ring structures, which encircle the DNA double helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). These structures convert the energy released by ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work to track along DNA at a velocity of up to 7 kb/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Translocation induces very little rotation of FtsK<sub>C</sub> on the DNA, indicating that it does not track along the minor or major grooves of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). This raised questions on the DNA contacts it makes during translocation. Indeed, FtsK<sub>C</sub> is structurally related to hexameric helicases of the DnaB superfamily, which track along just one strand of DNA even when they move along duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Similarly, motion of the EcoR124I double-stranded DNA translocase mainly depends on contacts to a single DNA strand, contacts to the other strand playing a role in stabilizing the motor on the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of activation of Xer recombination by FtsK is also still enigmatic. XerC and XerD each cleave a specific strand on <italic>dif</italic>. By convention, these strands are termed the top and bottom strand, respectively. In the absence of FtsK, the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> complex can adopt a conformation suitable for XerC to mediate a first pair of strand exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, this pathway of recombination is a dead end, the HJ intermediate being rapidly converted back to substrate by another round of XerC catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In the presence of FtsK, the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> complex adopts a conformation that allows XerD to mediate a first pair of strand exchanges, leading to a HJ that is resolved into a crossover by XerC catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The switch in the catalytic properties of the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> complex depends on a direct contact between FtsK&#x003b3; and XerD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, FtsK&#x003b3; alone does not promote Xer recombination between intact <italic>dif</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and ATP hydrolysis is still required for recombination when FtsK<sub>C</sub> loads in the vicinity of <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), indicating a possible role for the RecA-type ATPase fold of FtsK<sub>C</sub> in recombination activation.</p><p>Here, we have investigated how the structure and composition of DNA interferes with the activity of FtsK using recombination reactions between short <italic>dif</italic>-containing DNA fragments, on which FtsK cannot load, and longer asymmetric DNA fragments, which allow the loading of FtsK on the XerD-side of <italic>dif</italic>. Promotion of recombination between these fragments requires that FtsK translocates along the longer fragment to contact the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> complex. More precisely, FtsK must track along the top strand of this fragment in the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; orientation and along the bottom strand in the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; orientation. We observed an asymmetric requirement for the integrity of top and bottom strands, the integrity of the bottom strand seeming to prevail for efficient recombination. However, the effect of DNA modifications decreased as a function of their distance to <italic>dif</italic>, suggesting a local inhibition of the recombination process rather than an inhibition of FtsK translocation. Indeed, we found that FtsK can track for a few nucleotides along a single DNA strand in both 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; orientations, as judged by its capacity to displace short oligonucleotides bound to single-stranded DNA. Based on these results, we propose that the FtsK&#x003b3;&#x02013;XerD interaction is too transient or too weak in itself to allow for XerD catalysis and that specific DNA contacts are required to stabilize FstK&#x003b3; in the vicinity of (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> for recombination to occur.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA substrates and proteins</title><p>Recombination and probe displacement substrates were obtained by annealing gel-purified synthetic oligonucleotides, which were purchased from Eurogentec or Sigma (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp104/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> FtsK<sub>50C</sub> was purified as a C-terminal fusion to GST, 6His and the FLAG epitope (GST&#x02013;6His&#x02013;FLAG&#x02013;FtsK<sub>50C</sub>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> XerC and XerD were purified as a C-terminal fusion to 6His (6his&#x02013;XerC of 6his&#x02013;XerD).

Four duplex DNA segments extend from the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> recombination complex. However, loading of FtsK<sub>50C</sub> on a single duplex DNA fragment is sufficient for recombination <italic>in vitro</italic>, provided that this fragment extends from the XerD side of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In such reactions, DNA modifications positioned between <italic>dif</italic> and the loading site of FtsK<sub>50C</sub> could affect the efficiency of recombination in two ways. First, they could stop FtsK<sub>50C</sub> translocation, thereby impeding FtsK&#x003b3; from contacting XerD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, i). Such an indirect effect has been previously observed with KOPS inserted in the non-permissive orientation in the vicinity of <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Second, they could impede any active role that the ATPase engine of FtsK<sub>50C</sub> might have in the recombination process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, ii), as suggested by the requirement for ATP hydrolysis in recombination reactions among intact <italic>dif</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Recombination reactions on short asymmetric substrates therefore provide a very sensitive assay to test the impact of DNA modifications on the activity of the FtsK<sub>50C</sub> engine. Here, we used synthetic oligonucleotides to create a short DNA fragment carrying only 3 bp of duplex DNA on either side of <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, 3CD3). This fragment was radiolabelled on the 5&#x02032;-end of the top strand. It was used in recombination reactions against longer DNA fragments, which were also created by hybridization of synthetic oligonucleotides and which carried 3 bp of duplex DNA on the XerC side of <italic>dif</italic> and 89 or 109 bp on the XerD side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, 3CD89 and 3CD109). A triple KOPS motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) was inserted at 35 bp from the extremity of those long DNA fragments to ensure efficient loading of FtsK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, 3KOPS). When &#x0003c;114 bp of duplex DNA are adjacent to the XerD side of <italic>dif</italic>, the efficiency of recombination is over 10 times more efficient in the presence of the triple KOPS motif than in its absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), suggesting that FtsK does not load efficiently on DNA molecules smaller than 114 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We decided therefore to use short 89- and 109-bp DNA extensions on the XerD side of <italic>dif</italic> to further limit random FtsK loading at other places than the 3KOPS. FtsK<sub>50C</sub> promoted a very high level of recombination between equimolar amounts of 3CD3 and 3CD89 or 3CD109 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Top- and bottom-strands asymmetry</title><p>We first tested if FtsK<sub>50C</sub> could promote Xer recombination when a single stranded gap was present between <italic>dif</italic> and the triple KOPS motif on 3CD89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Five base pairs of duplex DNA were left adjacent to <italic>dif</italic>, to avoid any interference in the way XerC and XerD bind and cleave <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The gaps were positioned either on the top or the bottom strand of the 3CD89 substrates, which are, respectively, cleaved by XerC and XerD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Note that FtsK<sub>50C</sub> must track the top strand in the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; orientation and the bottom strand in the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; orientation to reach <italic>dif</italic> when it has loaded at the triple KOPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). On either the top strand or the bottom strand of <italic>dif</italic>, 5, 10 and 30 nt gaps severely impaired Xer recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Efficient recombination was recovered when gaps were filled with DNA, leaving two nicks between non-phosphorylated nucleotides at 5 and 35 bp from <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, Nicks). Thus, the continuity of the top and bottom strands is not important for FtsK activity, as previously observed with a single nick at 5 bp from <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). However, duplex DNA is required between <italic>dif</italic> and the loading site of FtsK for recombination to occur. Finally, we noted that recombination efficiency was much more affected when gaps were on the bottom strand than on the top strand of <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Top- and bottom-strand gaps affect recombination efficiency.

Introduction of nicks or of 5, 10 and 30 nt gaps in the top and bottom strands of i3CD89 yielded similar results than those obtained with 3CD89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and C), indicating that the base composition of DNA does not influence recombination activation. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Top- and bottom-strands asymmetry is not linked to base composition.

This was tested by filling 30 nt top-strand or bottom-strand gaps with RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, RNA).

To check for the integrity and the capacity of the synthetic RNA oligonucleotides to anneal to the gaps, we performed those experiments with two different RNA oligonucleotides, RNA1 and RNA2: RNA1 served to fill the 30 nt top-strand gap on 3CD89 and the bottom-strand gap on i3CD89; RNA2 served to fill the 30 nt top-strand gap on i3CD89 and the bottom-strand gap on 3CD89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). There are two major differences between RNA and DNA: the presence of a hydroxyl group in position 2&#x02032; of the sugar&#x02013;phosphate backbone of RNA and the replacement of thymine by uracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D).

Under the same conditions as those in which we performed our recombination experiments, XerC and XerD were able to fully retard the migration of 3CDtop, which lacks the 3 nt immediately adjacent to the XerD-binding site on the top strand, 3CDbot, which lacks the 3 nt immediately adjacent to the XerD-binding site on the bottom strand, and 3CD0, which totally lacks duplex DNA on the XerD side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A).

To this aim, we used a longer recombination substrate, 3CD109, in which 5, 10 and 30 nt gaps could be positioned at 25 bp from <italic>dif</italic> instead of 5 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). At 25 bp from <italic>dif</italic>, top-strand DNA modifications had no significant effect on the efficiency of recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, Top). Likewise, the presence of a 5 nt gap or of 30 nt of RNA at 25 bp from <italic>dif</italic> on the bottom strand did not alter the efficiency of recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, Bottom). Finally, 10 and 30 nt bottom stand gaps had a much less dramatic effect on the efficiency of recombination at 25 bp from <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, Bottom) than at 5 bp from <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

We did not design longer substrates to test if the effect of 10 or 30 nt gaps could be abolished further away from <italic>dif</italic> because we would not be able to exclude that the recovery of recombination on such longer substrates might not be linked to the loading of FtsK on the intact duplex DNA situated between <italic>dif</italic> and the gap rather than on the ability of FtsK to translocate on single-stranded DNA. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>The effect of gaps is local.

While performing those experiments, we noticed that FtsK<sub>50C</sub> could displace an oligonucleotide bound to either the top or to the bottom strand of the forked structure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp104/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). In other terms, the FtsK<sub>50C</sub> DNA translocase can be converted into a DNA helicase. We observed a high efficiency of displacement when 20 bases of the oligonucleotide paired on the translocation substrate, but very little if pairing reached 34 or 40 bp (data not shown), indicating that FtsK<sub>50C</sub> poorly functions as a helicase and probably stalls during the process. Displacement depended on the presence of an unpaired oligonucleotide tail, or flap, of &#x0003e;10 nt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp104/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>), further indicating that the helicase activity of FtsK is probably due to the obstruction of the channel through which DNA is pumped in the hexameric FtsK rings. Based on these observations, we designed two 40 nt oligonucleotides, with a 20 nt central region pairing with either the bottom strand or the top strand of the 30 nt gap region of 3CD89 and i3CD89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). These oligonucleotides were bound at a distance of 5 nt from the end of the duplex DNA fragment on which FtsK<sub>50C</sub> was loaded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). FtsK<sub>50C</sub> could efficiently unwind both oligonucleotides on either of the two substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). In addition, we observed no significant differences between the efficiency of displacement, whether the oligonucleotides were annealed to the top or to the bottom strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E). Thus, FtsK seems to be able to translocate on single-stranded DNA for at least 5 nt in both the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; orientation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Identification of nucleotides implicated in the activity of FtsK</title><p>We have investigated the importance of the structure and composition of DNA on the activity of FtsK by monitoring Xer recombination between short, asymmetric linear DNA fragments carrying DNA modifications between the loading site of FtsK<sub>50C</sub> and <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This assay was chosen because it is quantitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and because it was expected to be very sensitive. We thus found that activation of Xer recombination is dramatically affected when single-stranded gaps are present on the bottom strand of <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Bottom-strand gaps as short as 2 nt reduced recombination to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), which allowed us to scan for specific nucleotides in the vicinity of <italic>dif</italic> that would be implicated in the activation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This analysis revealed that on the bottom strand, 8 nt are crucial for recombination, from the second to the ninth nucleotide immediately adjacent to the XerD-binding site of <italic>dif</italic>, and that the three top-strand nucleotides immediately adjacent to the XerD-binding site of <italic>dif</italic> are also crucial for recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).

The nature of the bases positioned at &#x0003e;5 nt form <italic>dif</italic> is not implicated in the recombination process, since inverting the sequence of the DNA region on the XerD side of <italic>dif</italic> or replacing thymine bases by uracil bases did not affect recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, replacing part of the bottom strand by RNA severely inhibited recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The DNA double helix is generally in the B-conformation, whereas RNA/DNA hybrids adopt the A-conformation. Replacing 2 nt of the bottom strand by locked nucleic acids, which also adopt the A-conformation when paired with DNA, did not impede recombination, suggesting that the conformation of the double helix does not play a role in the activation process (data not shown). Indeed, the efficiency of recombination reactions in the presence of 2 nt top-strand gaps positioned at 4 bp from <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) or of mismatched bases (data not shown) further indicates that the base pairing and/or the conformation of the double helix are not important for recombination. Thus, recombination activation does not depend on contacts between FtsK and the bases of DNA or on the particular helical structure of DNA but rather on contacts between FtsK and the sugar&#x02013;phosphate backbone of DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of the local DNA structure on Xer recombination activation</title><p>The effect of top and bottom-strand gaps on recombination was attenuated when they were displaced away from <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), indicating that they locally influence the recombination process. Activation of recombination by FtsK requires a direct contact between FtsK&#x003b3; and XerD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This contact has to occur in <italic>cis</italic>, since FtsK cannot activate recombination when loaded on the XerC side of the complex on short asymmetric substrates, whether KOPS are present (data not shown) or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). FtsK&#x003b3; is connected to the FtsK<sub>50C</sub> engine by a region of approximately 15 aa (including a large proportion of glycine residues), which is probably unstructured and could extend to 4 or 5 nm. This should be sufficient to allow FtsK&#x003b3; to contact XerD in <italic>cis</italic>, even if the FtsK motor stalled 3 bp before the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> complex, as would be the case for 2 nt gaps positioned at 0 or 1 bp from <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that 2 nt gaps in the immediate vicinity of <italic>dif</italic> impede the interaction of FtsK&#x003b3; and XerD. It would be therefore tempting to propose that FtsK<sub>50C</sub> needs to change the conformation of the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> complex in addition to contacting XerD. The top and bottom-strands asymmetry could then be explained by the fact that some mechanical stress needs to be propagated through the bottom strand of the substrate, i.e. the strand cleaved by XerD, for this change of conformation to occur. Indeed, the minimum size of bottom-strand gaps abolishing Xer recombination is 2 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), which fits remarkably well with the step size of FtsK monomers, as estimated from crystallographic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Two types of mechanical stress could occur, torsion or flexion. Torsion is ruled out because (i) the motion of FtsK<sub>50C</sub> induces very little rotation relative to the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and (ii) the presence of nicks has no effect on the efficiency of recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Flexion is also very unlikely since FtsK can translocate on single-stranded DNA in both the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; orientation along at least 5 nt, which should allow it to push on the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> synapse, even if a few nucleotides are missing in the vicinity of <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, we observed that XerC and XerD can stop the translocation of FtsK on DNA when bound to <italic>dif</italic> (Bonn&#x000e9;,L. <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data), which should limit the amount of torsion and flexion that FtsK could introduce in the vicinity of the complex. Therefore, we propose that the specific nucleotides we identified in the immediate vicinity of <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>) serve to stabilize FstK at the proximity of the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> complex, to allow for a sufficiently long and stable contact between FtsK&#x003b3; and XerD for recombination to occur.</p></sec><sec><title>Top and bottom-strand asymmetry</title><p>The FtsK hexamer seems to make preferential contacts with the bottom strand of DNA since 8 nt of the bottom strand are important for Xer recombination activation versus only three on the top strand in the immediate vicinity of <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) and since only bottom-strand gaps affect recombination further away from <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). FtsK needs to track along the bottom strand in the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; direction to activate recombination. This could indicate that the FtsK hexamer functions as a 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; translocase, like DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and that DNA contacts with the top strand of DNA only serve to stabilize the motor on DNA, as suggested for EcoR124I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Indeed, most helicases or DNA translocases move on DNA with a preferential polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, we did not observe any asymmetry between the top and bottom strands of DNA in oligonucleotide displacement assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that FtsK can function as both a 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; and a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; DNA helicase. Although surprising, this result was not entirely unexpected since a similar bipolar helicase activity has already been reported for HerA, a DNA helicase from archaea belonging to the FtsK family of translocases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). However, we wish to emphasize that this does not exclude a possible effect of bottom-strand gaps on FtsK translocation. Indeed, the preferential loading of the EcoR124I motor on the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; strand only led to a delay of a few seconds in triplex displacement assays when gaps were present in this strand, EcoR124I being able to bypass gaps of any size when given sufficient time in those assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Complete stalling of EcoR124I by gaps on the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; strand required a force to be applied on the DNA template on which it translocates using magnetic tweezers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Thus, further experiments will be required to determine if one of the two strands of the DNA helix is more important than the other for FtsK translocation.</p><p>The asymmetry between the top and the bottom strand of DNA might also be linked to the particular structure of the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> recombination complex. During, site-specific recombination by tyrosine recombinases, the two DNA strands are brought together in an almost planar configuration, with the four catalytic C-terminal domains of the recombinases on one side of the plane and the four N-terminal domains on the other side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). As a consequence, the six FtsK subunits facing the (XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic>)<sub>2</sub> complex are not equivalent: only half of them should be able to interact with the C-terminal catalytic domains of the XerD recombinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, bottom subunits). Thus, the nucleotides we identified in the vicinity of <italic>dif</italic> might reflect the DNA contacts made by only half of the FtsK translocation complex. Future experiments will aim at addressing as to what are the specific contacts made by FtsK on the sugar&#x02013;phosphate backbone of DNA and by which amino acid residues these contacts are made.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp104/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (BLAN-05-0060); Fondation pour la Recherche M&#x000e9;dicale (Equipe 2007); European Molecular Biology Organization (YIP 2006); Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique (ATIP+); R&#x000e9;gion Ile de France (fellowship to L.B.).
