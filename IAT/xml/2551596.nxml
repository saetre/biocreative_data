C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant whose expression in the vascular wall, in particular, in reactive plaque regions, and circulating levels increase in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. Although CRP is known to induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype in endothelial cells (EC) a direct role on modulation of angiogenesis has not been established.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here, we show that CRP is a powerful inducer of angiogenesis in bovine aortic EC (BAEC) and human coronary artery EC (HCAEC). CRP, at concentrations corresponding to moderate/high risk (1&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g/ml), induced a significant increase in proliferation, migration and tube-like structure formation <italic>in vitro </italic>and stimulated blood vessel formation in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM). CRP treated with detoxi-gel columns retained such effects. Western blotting showed that CRP increased activation of early response kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), a key protein involved in EC mitogenesis. Furthermore, using TaqMan Low-density Arrays we identified key pro-angiogenic genes induced by CRP among them were vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2/KDR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), notch family transcription factors (Notch1 and Notch3), cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61/CCN1) and inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation-1 (ID1).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This data suggests a role for CRP in direct stimulation of angiogenesis and therefore may be a mediator of neovessel formation in the intima of vulnerable plaques.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Unstable carotid atherosclerotic plaques can undergo thrombotic complications and trigger acute clinical events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In atherosclerotic plaques angiogenesis allows the formation of new microvessels to maintain oxygen and nutrient supply for vascular cells. Such processes are potenciated by different molecules secreted by vascular and inflammatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Neovessel growth occurs in active regions of atherosclerotic lesions undergoing remodelling. Our previous studies have demonstrated specific molecular deregulation occurring in these regions, consistent with the promotion of angiogenesis. The new vessels of atherosclerotic lesions may be a focus of instability, since they facilitate the infiltration of inflammatory cells and due to their tendency to leak, may produce haemorrhagic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In a previous study using protein microarrays, we have identified regulation of potentially proangiogenic proteins associated with haemorrhagic vessels in unstable plaques among them c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-src [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The role of CRP modulating of angiogenesis in developing atherosclerotic lesions has not been investigated. CRP is an acute-phase reactant expressed during active inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Inflammation, the key regulator of CRP synthesis, plays an important role in atherothrombotic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. CRP consists of five identical non-covalently associated and nonglycosylated 23-kDa subunits arranged symmetrically around a central pore and it is synthesized mainly in the liver under the control of interleukin-6 (IL-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], although it is also found in other tissues including carotid atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. CRP represents one of the strongest independent predictors of symptomatic atherothrombosis and vascular death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and predicts progression of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In response to acute-phase stimuli, plasma CRP concentration can increase rapidly and dramatically up to 100-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. CRP levels are increased in patients at moderate- (1 to 3 &#x003bc;g/ml) and high-risk (&#x0003e; 3 &#x003bc;g/ml) of future cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Although, originally CRP was suggested to be purely a biomarker, recent studies have pointed that it may in fact be a direct mediator of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Indeed, CRP elicits multiple effects on the vascular wall favouring a proatherosclerotic phenotype. These include attraction of monocytes, mediation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) uptake by macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] reduction in nitric oxide (NO) release of human EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], up-regulation of adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], increasing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in EC and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], activating the complement system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and inducing plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression and activity in human aortic EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. With regard to CRP effects on EC, published studies are somewhat controversial. CRP has been shown to promote production of the pro-angiogenic molecules such as endothelin-1 (ET-1) and IL-6 in human saphenous vein EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and activate NF-&#x003ba;B signalling through the CD32 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In contrast, other studies suggested that EC activation by CRP was due to contamination of the commercially obtained protein with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or sodium azide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>As we have previously demonstrated increased CRP expression in unstable highly vascularized regions of carotid lesions, we decided to investigate the angiogenic properties of this molecule. Here we show that native CRP and not potentially contaminating LPS or azide is strongly angiogenic both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and activates the expression of some important pro-angiogenic genes in endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Chemotaxis was induced by CRP in both HCAEC and BAEC</title><p>Both native and CRPdt significantly increased chemotaxis of HCAEC with a maximum effect at 5 &#x003bc;g/ml following CRPdt treatment (approximately 290% over controls; <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

Angiogenesis is a recognised mechanism involved in the development of complicated atherosclerotic plaques and previous studies have provided controversial data regarding the possible angiogenic or anti-angiogenic effect of CRP. In this work, we have examined the hypothesis that CRP might play a role in modulating angiogenesis, and as such, its presence in vascular regions of developing arterial plaques may be implicated in their progression to unstable, haemorrhagic lesions prone to rupture. Our data shows that CRP, at concentrations commonly found in the circulation of patients with active carotid disease, is highly pro-angiogenic both <italic>in vitro</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, CRP activates cell signalling and increases expression of key genes associated with angiogenesis.</p><p>In order to show that the effects of CRP were due to CRP itself and not other components, we have attempted to address the controversy surrounding the influence of &#x000a8;contaminants&#x000a8; present in commercial preparations of CRP. Notably, Pepys <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that pure natural human CRP free from endotoxins and azide, was not pro-inflammatory to macrophages <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. More specifically, inhibition of HUVEC cell proliferation, eNOS gene expression and increased apoptosis measured by activation of caspase-3/9, have been attributed to the presence of azide in CRP preparations. Similarly, contaminating LPS was shown to increase IL-8, ICAM-1 and MCP-1 gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. It is worthy of note, however, that the effects of azide were demonstrated at concentrations (0.0025%) equal to those produced by administration of 50 &#x003bc;g/ml CRP. In our study, concentrations of CRP and therefore azide used in the majority of experiments were much lower and in fact, had no significant effects on cell growth and gene expression as demonstrated in the TaqMan microarrays. Even so, this highlights the importance of using satisfactory controls when conducting this type of assays. In our studies, all of the controls, used for comparison with CRP tests, contained equivalent amounts of azide so that direct comparisons were able to be made. Finally, in our study, we show that the treatment of CRP with detoxi-gel columns did not negate the pro-angiogenic effects of CRP. Interestingly, assays performed using purified LPS at concentrations that were similar to or exceeded those reported in high purity human recombinant CRP from our commercial supplier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] demonstrated no significant effects on BAEC or HCAEC angiogenesis or IL-8 gene activation. This is in agreement with the recent findings of Dasu <italic>et al</italic>. who showed that purified CRP was able to activate IL-8, IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;, PAI-1 and eNOS in Toll-like receptor 4 knockout HAEC, indicating that the effects were not due to LPS contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we showed that CRP induces angiogenesis <italic>in vitro </italic>in two separate sources of primary cultured vascular EC as well as <italic>in vivo </italic>as judged by an increase in capillary formation in the CAM assay, aortic ring assay and 3D-Matrigel. The angiogenic potency of CRPdt was quite strong, being 50&#x02013;75% of that demonstrated by our positive control FGF-2 (25 ng/ml; comparisons not included). One other study showed previously that CRP induced proliferation of rabbit thoracic EC with a concomitant increase in expression of p-ERK1/2, similar to our own findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In their study, they controlled for LPS by measuring levels with the Limulus assay which were recorded as &#x0003c; 0.125 EU/ml. The authors, however, found that increased proliferation occurred only at significantly high CRP concentrations of (&#x0003e; 20 &#x003bc;g/ml), and furthermore, they did not consider the effects of azide. In agreement with our findings, Bello et al (2008), showed that CRP increases VEGF-A expression via PI3-kinase and ERK1/2 pathway and thus could play a role in the angiogenesis process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Orozlan <italic>et al</italic>. found no effects of CRP on HUVEC proliferation although they did not supply data indicating the concentration of CRP used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In our previous studies where we have characterised various types of vascular cells, we have found HUVEC to be the least responsive to pro-angiogenic stimuli including VEGF, FGF-2 and oligosaccharides of hyaluronan; therefore, these results are perhaps not surprising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The fact that CRP did not stimulate HCAEC proliferation suggests that there may be variability in cellular responses dependent on cell type, and EC have been shown in many studies to be heterogeneous in this regard. Indeed, in contrast to our results, one recent study showed induction of apoptosis in human umbilical EC (HUVEC) incubated with CRP, analyzed by TUNEL and caspase-3 activity assay and inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, the above study used 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of CRP in their assay and we observed a pro-angiogenic effect of CRP at 1 and 5 &#x003bc;g/ml. Moreover, the apoptotic effect of CRP was demonstrated in HUVEC and cellular response may be dependent on EC origin. In addition, in the same study the authors showed that CRP treatment of monocluclear cells induced production of MMP-9 which is involved in extraclellular matrix degradation, cell migration and release of angiogenic factors necessary to elicit angiogesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] Verma <italic>et al</italic>. showed that purified CRP attenuated NO release in human saphenous vein EC, increased apoptosis and inhibited capillary-like tube formation in matrigel at 5&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;g/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; however, they did not control for the effects of azide. The same authors also demonstrated that CRP inhibited EC progenitor differentiation, survival and function through a process involving a reduction in NO expression appeared to be carried out without the use of suitable azide and endotoxin controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>Our data showing a potent angiogenic effect of CRP/CRPdt is strongly backed up by the results of our real-time TaqMan PCR microarrays. Using our specifically designed targeted microfluidity cards, we showed up-regulation of key genes involved in promotion of vascularisation. We found 6 genes up-regulated by CRPdt on HCAEC between 12&#x02013;72 h. VEGF receptor-2 (KDR), the main receptor mediating both signal transduction and the biologic responses, including angiogenesis, triggered by VEGF in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], was significantly induced by CRPdt. Up-regulation of this receptor together with growth factors such as PDGF- B involved in cell proliferation and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], could be one mechanism through which CRP initiates its angiogenic effects. Notch1 was increased after 12 h of CRP treatment. Notch1 is required for formation of correct sprouting and branching patterns during VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Recently, cyclic strain was shown to up-regulate Notch1 in human vascular EC and this process was responsible for significantly increased tube-formation in matrigel suggesting a role in development of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Notch3 is other member of the Notch family that seems to be critical for vascular cell survival and is required for the arterial identity and maturation of vascular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. One particularly novel finding was the up-regulation of CYR61. CYR61 is an extracellular matrix-associated protein expressed within developing vasculature, which promotes angiogenesis both in vitro and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. CYR61 binds directly to the integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>present on activated EC and mediates chemotaxis and tube formation. Finally, ID1, originally identify as a dominant-negative antagonist of the basis helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors has been recently involved in VEGF-induced angiogenesis in human endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Future work should be addressed to determine the expression, localization and relevance of these proteins in angiogenic regions of developing complicated atherosclerotic lesions.</p><p>This discussion would not be complete without a brief mention of the recently characterised modified CRP (mCRP). Evidence has emerged that native pentametric CRP can change its structural conformation following separation into monomers. Following re-arrangement, formation of the mCRP sub-unit has increased binding affinity for plasma membranes, and has been shown to be preferentially expressed in tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Recent evidence suggest that mCRP may be a significantly weaker stimulator of pro-inflammatory molecules in vascular EC (e.g. IL-8, PAI-1 and prostaglandin F1-&#x003b1;), and hence atherogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. However, it is important to remember that native CRP can be found at high concentration in many hospital patients and most of them do not develop acute cardiovascular events. This suggests that cardiovascular effects of CRP if indeed important maybe due to its modified form.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings strongly suggest an important role for CRP in modulation of angiogenesis and as such, CRP could promote the formation of intimal neovessels of complicated unstable plaques increasing the likelihood of rupture. The distribution of both native and mCRP should be investigated in complicated atherosclerotic plaques and further studies should aim to identify the mechanisms of cell binding and intracellular mechanisms leading to cellular activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Human coronary artery EC (HCAEC), EC basal medium and growth factor supplements were bought from TCS CellWorks (Botolph Claydon, UK).
