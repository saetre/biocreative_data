Antiparallel triplex-forming upstream oligonucleotides form efficient triplexes with C1. The C1 tract of human differs from rodent alpha1(I) promoters by 7 nt which are mainly A--&#x0003e;G transitions. Human triplex-forming oligodeoxyribonucleotide (TFO) formed stable triplexes efficiently with a K d of approximately 10-20 nM compared with a K d of approximately 100 nM for rodent TFO. Mutational analysis indicated that 3 or 4 nt (-153 to -155) are sufficient for this higher affinity. TFOs specific for human C1 inhibited transcription from human promoter both in vitro in HeLa cell nuclear extracts and in vivo in cultured chick embryo fibroblasts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
