The variable expressed syndactyly phenotype in cattle is most often seen in the front feet, but all four feet underlying a right-left and front-rear gradient may be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The bovine syndactyly consists mainly of pairs of horizontally synostotic phalanges and adaptive structural changes develop proximal to the fused digits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Bovine syndactyly has been shown to segregate as a monogenic recessive trait with incomplete penetrance in many breeds of cattle in many countries (OMIA: 000963). Genetic mapping located the syndactyly locus on cattle chromosome 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This bovine chromosome region is homologous to a segment of mouse chromosome 2 containing the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 gene (<italic>Lrp4</italic>), alternatively designated as multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 7 gene (<italic>Megf7</italic>). Homozygous <italic>Lrp4</italic>-deficient mice are growth-retarded, with fully penetrant polysyndactyly in their fore and hind limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Positional cloning of two recessive mutations of the mouse that cause polysyndactyly (<italic>dan </italic>and <italic>mdig</italic>) showed that the <italic>Lrp4 </italic>gene plays an essential role in the process of digit differentiation in mammalian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Other members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family have been shown to regulate intracellular signaling cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In humans, syndactyly represents the most common congenital malformation of the hand and is characterized by the apparent fusion of soft tissue of the fingers and toes with or without bony fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Syndactyly may occur as an isolated malformation or as part of a syndrome. Until now the two human genes <italic>HOXD13 </italic>and <italic>GJA1 </italic>were identified harboring causative dominant mutations for isolated syndactyly types II (OMIM: 186000) and III (OMIM: 186100), respectively. However, while clinical studies in these human defects revealed variable phenotypical expression, the establishment of precise genotype-phenotype correlations for limb malformations is difficult and the molecular genetic basis of numerous human cases of syndacytly is still unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recently, two independent causative mutations in the bovine <italic>LRP4 </italic>ortholog were identified in the predominantly affected cattle breeds of Holstein and Angus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A homozygous <italic>LRP4 </italic>exon 33 substitution of two consecutive nucleotides (c.4863_4864delCGinsAT) was observed in 36 affected Holstein individuals, which lead to amino acid changes at two <italic>LRP4 </italic>codons (p. [Asn1621Lys; Gly1622Cys]) affecting a conserved EGF-like protein domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the two reported affected Angus cattle a homozygous <italic>LRP4 </italic>single nucleotide substitution at the first base of intron 37 (c.5385+1G&#x0003e;A) disrupted the 5'splice site, which introduced aberrant splicing of intron 36 and lead to a truncated translation product lacking the normal N-terminal cytoplasmic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The finding that mulefoot is caused by mutations within the same gene in both breeds is in agreement with earlier findings, where affected calves had experimentally been produced by mating of heterozygous Holstein and Angus cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to screen the bovine <italic>LRP4 </italic>gene for co-segregating mutations in sixteen animals from different breeds affected by congenital syndactyly.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Based on the recent identification of bovine <italic>LRP4 </italic>mutations causing congenital syndactyly this gene was studied in sixteen new mulefoot cases of four cattle families from three different breeds for co-segregating functional <italic>LRP4 </italic>sequence polymorphisms.

In the three Italian cases we observed only affected front feet, a single case with an affected right forefoot (VIII-2; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and two cases with two variably affected forefeet (VIII-3 and 4; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The new case from the German Holstein population showed three syndactylous feet, both forefeet and the right hindfoot (VIII-1; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Within this family eight out of twelve syndactyly affected animals were homozygous for the non-conservative substitution of two consecutive nucleotides in exon 33 (c.4863_4864delCGinsAT). Three available sires, two available dams and five paternal half-sibs of these eight calves showed heterozygosity for this exon 33 polymorphism, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). For these animals no further exonic or splice site affecting sequence polymorphisms could be identified in the examined <italic>LRP4 </italic>exons. In contrast, the remaining four syndactylous calves, originating from the originally described German Holstein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], showed only a single copy of the c.4863_4864delCGinsAT allele. These four cases obtained the mutated exon 33 allele from their fathers as the three available dams of the four cases were homozygous for the wildtype allele at the c.4863_4864delCGinsAT polymorphism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A comparison of all generated sequences for these four affected calves revealed three silent mutations: c.756T&#x0003e;C in exon 7, c.4269C&#x0003e;T in exon 29 and c.4749C&#x0003e;T in exon 32, respectively. Two affected calves were individually heterozygous at the exon 7 and exon 29 SNP, respectively, and inherited the respective mutated allele from their heterozygous dams. All four calves and the two dams were heterozygous at the exon 32 SNP. The three newly detected SNP were genotyped in 48 unrelated Holstein sires and showed minor allele frequencies for the mutated alleles of 0.33 (c.756T&#x0003e;C), 0.16 (c.4269C&#x0003e;T), and 0.48 (c.4749C&#x0003e;T), respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Pedigree and <italic>LRP4 </italic>c.4863_4864delCGinsAT genotypes (A) and phenotype example (B) in Holstein family I</bold>.

The pedigree analysis revealed that the first affected bull (II-1) was produced by mating of a Simmental &#x000d7; Charolais artificial insemination sire (I-1) to a German Holstein cow (I-2) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Then, an experimental backcross of the affected sire to one of his daughters (III-1) was performed. This consanguineous mating produced the second affect male calf (IV-1) with an inbreeding coefficient of 25 % (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

All reported family histories are compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance of bovine syndactyly. Also the known variability in the phenotypic expression characterized by the variable number of affected feet and the gradually different fusion of bones per foot could be confirmed by the reported sixteen cases. Most interesting, four novel mutations in the bovine <italic>LRP4 </italic>gene were detected which possibly lead to syndactyly in cattle as none of these sequence variants was observed in chromosomes from unaffected control animals.</p><p>The analysis of the syndactyly cases from the Holstein breed confirmed the presence of the recessively inherited c.4863_4864delCGinsAT mutation in eight cases, which were related to the recently identified founder cow named Raven Burke Elsie, born 1947 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In contrast, four out of twelve syndactyly affected Holstein calves from our Holstein family I shared only a single, paternally inherited copy of this mutation. Therefore we assume the existence of further disease causing mutations within the <italic>LRP4 </italic>gene within the international Holstein population. Unfortunately, we did not find evidence for such a mutation in these four cases within in the 37 analyzed <italic>LRP4 </italic>exons. The identified exon 7, 29, and 32 SNP could be probably excluded as causative mutations for syndactyly since they did not alter the amino acid sequence and due to the observed high frequencies for the mutated alleles in the controls. As no genomic sequence data for the regulatory 5'region of <italic>LRP4 </italic>including exon 1 is publicly available, we were not able to analyze this gene region for possible mutations. There might be even another gene involved in the pathogenesis, e.g. modifying genes that would impact <italic>LRP4 </italic>expression. The bovine <italic>ALX4 </italic>gene, located within the mulefoot linked region on cattle chromosome 15, previously has been excluded in our affected animals as candidate gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The detected c.4940C&#x0003e;T SNP in Holstein family II co-segregates perfectly with the disease according to recessive inheritance and provides evidence that independent non-synonymous <italic>LRP4 </italic>mutations occur within the Holstein population, The two missense mutations in <italic>LRP4 </italic>which co-segregate with syndactyly in the Simmental family underline the identified allelic heterogeneity at the bovine <italic>LRP4 </italic>gene. The observed perfect co-segregation of each of these mutations within the analyzed families provides evidence that these mutations are potentially causative for syndactyly. All available parents carried a single mutated allele and the affected animals showed two copies of mutated alleles, respectively. Finally, the <italic>LRP4 </italic>genotypes of the affected animals from the crossbred family illustrate the existence of compound heterozygotes carrying two different deleterious <italic>LRP4 </italic>alleles. Due to records from the breeder, we assume that the dam of the affected sire II-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), a Holstein cow, had a well known syndactyly carrier sire (Marathon) in her ancestry. This could explain the occurrence of the c.4863_4864delCGinsAT mutation within this family.</p><p>LRP4 represents a core member of the LDL receptor family which consists of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. All receptors are anchored in the plasma membrane by a single transmembrane domain and contain short cytoplasmic tails and the extracellular domains consist of a variable number of ligand binding-type repeats, always followed by EGF homology domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The LDL receptor represents the founding member of the family and over 700 independent mutations that disrupt the function of LDL receptor and cause familial hypercholesterolemia have been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore we also compared the mutations we have found in the bovine LRP4 protein to those known in human LDLR. The four newly described <italic>LRP4 </italic>mutations in this article represent missense mutations, like the <italic>LRP4 </italic>exon 33 two nucleotide substitution reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. All four amino acid exchanges affect functionally important and particularly conserved extracellular domains of the bovine LRP4 protein (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). An alignment of protein sequences of the four relevant homologous LRP4 domains from different species including mammals, birds, bony fishes and flies is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. Furthermore, we used Pfam, a database of multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models covering many common protein domains and families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], for alignments of the bovine LRP4 protein sequence against conserved low density lipoprotein receptor domain class A, B and EGF like domains with the Pfam search by protein sequence option using default parameters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). To test possible functional consequences, the modified proteins were analyzed with two different software packages, PolyPhen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and SIFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Multispecies protein sequence alignment of four parts of LRP4</bold>.

Furthermore, it is highly likely that this mutation disrupts LRP4 function, as for example a frameshift mutation affecting residue 98 of human LDLR class A domain causes hypercholesterolemia in a Japanese family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Two mutations (p.Gly907Arg, p.Gly1199Ser) affect low density lipoprotein receptor class B, or alternatively termed YWTD, domains which are found as multiple tandem repeats building the characteristic beta-propeller structure in low density lipoprotein receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The p.Gly907Arg mutation affects a conserved glycine in LDL receptor class B domain 8 and the p.Gly1199Ser affects an invariably conserved glycine in LDL receptor class B domain 13 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). A substitution of a valine for a glycine at residue 544 of human LDLR causes hypercholesterolemia and functional analysis of this mutation gives rise to an LDL receptor that is not transported to the cell surface and is rapidly degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Several mutations of the human <italic>LDLR </italic>gene causing hypercholesterolemia affecting the LDL receptor class B domain have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore it is likely that these two bovine mutations impair LRP4 function.</p><p>The p.Pro1647Lys mutation is located within a particular type of extracellular EGF-like motif, termed LDL-type EGF-like, which is characteristic for low density lipoprotein receptor related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This domain is also affected by the previously reported Holstein c.4863_4864delCGinsAT mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the majority (47%) of <italic>LDLR </italic>mutations causing hypercholesterolemia in man were found in the EGF-like domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Additionally, the p.Pro1647Lys mutation may be dysfunctional due to the software predicted consequences (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these comparisons provide support for the probable causality of the four newly identified bovine <italic>LRP4 </italic>mutations affecting codons 81, 907, 1199 and 1647, respectively. The three silent exonic mutations identified in the Holstein family I are very likely not causative, particularly as they occur at a rather high frequency in unaffected control animals. Finally, the published exon 33 substitution of two consecutive nucleotides could be confirmed in some of the affected Holstein calves and the recently reported <italic>LRP4 </italic>single nucleotide substitution at the first base of intron 37 (c.5385+1G&#x0003e;A) observed in two syndactyly affected Angus cattle was not observed in any of the examined cases within this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We confirmed a significant role of <italic>LRP4 </italic>mutations in the pathogenesis of congenital syndactyly in cattle. This represents the third <italic>LRP4 </italic>report of mutations in cattle while the first two <italic>LRP4 </italic>mutations were described recently in Holstein and Angus cattle, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The data indicate that extensive allelic heterogeneity exists in cattle and within the Holstein breed. However, the four newly described <italic>LRP4 </italic>mutations do still not explain all analyzed cases of syndactyly. Therefore genetic testing for the carrier status of single individuals remains difficult, because at present obviously not all causal mutations have been detected. Thus, only presence of a known mutated allele can be recorded and unequivocal carriers are detected. Further studies of the regulatory 5'-region and exon1 of the bovine <italic>LRP4 </italic>gene will help to clarify if these regions are involved in the development of syndactyly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>We analyzed a total of sixteen affected animals and samples of sixteen available relatives from three cattle populations (Holstein, Simmental and Holstein &#x000d7; Simmental &#x000d7; Charolais crossbred) with the clinical diagnosis of congenital syndactyly. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by radiography. In a previous linkage study we reported eight affected German Holstein calves belonging to a single eight generation family, named Holstein family I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This pedigree was extended by the inclusion of three cases of syndactyly in Italian Holstein and a single affected male German Holstein calf (VIII 1&#x02013;4; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Each of these four cases could be maternally and paternally traced back to the single common male ancestor of the established Holstein family I. Additionally, a second German Holstein pedigree, named Holstein family II, with a single affected female calf without any relationship for five generations to family I was analyzed. Finally, a single affected purebred female German Simmental calf (Simmental family) and two affected crossbred bulls (father and son) belonging to a Holstein &#x000d7; Simmental &#x000d7; Charolais pedigree (crossbred family) were examined. All control samples used to check the distribution of sequence alterations were taken from an archive of unrelated artifical insemination sires matching to the German Holstein (n = 48), German Simmental (n = 48) and German Charolais populations (n = 16), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation analysis</title><p>Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples by standard methods.

The subsequent re-sequencing of the PCR products was performed after Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and Exonuclease I (N.E.B., Axonlab, Baden, Switzerland) treatment using both PCR primers with the ABI BigDye Terminator Sequencing Kit 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) on an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
