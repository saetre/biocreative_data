Resiniferatoxin (RTX), a potent agonist of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), causes a slow, sustained and irreversible activation of TRPV1 and increases the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, but causes significant depression of evoked EPSCs due to nerve terminal depolarization block. Intrathecal administration of RTX to rats in the short-term inhibits nociceptive synaptic transmission, and in the long-term causes a localized, selective ablation of TRPV1-expressing central sensory nerve terminals leading to long lasting analgesia in behavioral models. Since RTX actions are selective for central sensory nerve terminals, other efferent functions of dorsal root ganglion neurons can be preserved. Preventing nociceptive transmission at the level of the spinal cord can be a useful strategy to treat chronic, debilitating and intractable pain.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1/VR1) is a nonselective cation channel with high calcium permeability expressed on the peripheral and central terminals of small-diameter sensory neurons.

TRPV1 is expressed only at the sensory nerve terminals that form synapses with the second order DH neurons in spinal cord laminae I and II and in the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus (CSTN) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007021.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We have investigated TRPV1-mediated modulation of synaptic transmission at the first sensory synapse using DRG-DH co-cultures. We have shown using DRG-DH co-cultures, that an increase in frequency of synaptic currents in response to capsaicin or RTX occurred only when the neurons form synapses between DRG-DH neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007021.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), and not between DH-DH neurons. Furthermore, only the excitatory synaptic events are affected, not the inhibitory synaptic events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007021-Sikand1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies indicate that TRPV1 channels are expressed only in the terminals of DRG neurons and modulate excitatory synaptic transmission. In this study, we have recorded spontaneous and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (s/eEPSCs) from spinal cord and brain stem slices containing caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus (CSTN). s/eEPSC were recorded at a holding potential of &#x02212;60 mV (close to E<sub>Cl</sub>&#x02248;&#x02212;55 mV) in the presence or absence of bicuculline (20 &#x000b5;M) plus strychnine (2 &#x000b5;M), and APV (20 &#x000b5;M) to block GABA plus glycine and NMDA channels, respectively. We compared the effects of capsaicin (0.5&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;M) and RTX (50&#x02013;200 nM) in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons.

In spinal cord slices, capsaicin (2 &#x000b5;M) increased the frequency of sEPSCs in 53 out of 80 recordings; the mean increase was 942&#x000b1;200&#x00025; (range 32&#x02013;8621&#x00025;, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, KS test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g001">Fig. 1A, C</xref>) without affecting the amplitude significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). RTX (200 nM) increased the frequency of sEPSCs in 16 out of 55 recordings, with a mean increase of 331&#x000b1;87&#x00025; (range 25&#x02013;1200&#x00025;, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, KS test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g002">Fig. 2A, C</xref>) without affecting the amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). In similar experimental conditons using brain stem slices that contained CSTN, we observed similar effects on sEPSCs following capsaicin and RTX application.

We interpret the greater effects of capsaicin compared to RTX as likely due to the slower depolarization RTX produces, with less action potential firing, and therefore less activation of presynaptic terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007021-Raisinghani1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Further analysis of the data showed that the increase in sEPSC frequency caused by continuous application of capsaicin decreased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g003">Fig. 3A, E</xref>), whereas RTX-induced increase in the frequency of sEPSCs did not decrease with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g003">Fig. 3B, G</xref>). The increase in frequency shows a large variability because the extent of sensory input to the recording neurons is variable and cannot be controlled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007021-Sikand1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Intriguingly, following application of capsaicin or RTX, we observed failures in evoked responses and the evoked currents were significantly depressed at the peak of their responses. Capsaicin (2 &#x000b5;M) depressed evoked EPSCs in spinal cord slices (67&#x000b1;7&#x00025;, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g001">Fig. 1B, E</xref>) and in CSTN slices (74&#x000b1;5&#x00025; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g003">Fig. 3A, C, F</xref> ). Similarly, RTX (200 nM) depressed evoked EPSC in spinal cord slices (43&#x000b1;13&#x00025;, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g002">Fig. 2 B, E</xref>) and in CSTN (38&#x000b1;12&#x00025; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g003">Fig. 3 B, D, H</xref>). It appears the depression of evoked currents is by a presynaptic mechanism, since the amplitude of simultaneously-recorded sEPSCs did not decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g001">Figs. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g002">2D</xref>). Possible explanations for the short-term effects of capsaicin and RTX on eEPSCs include shunting of voltage-sensitive currents by open TRPV1 channels, depolarization-induced inactivation of voltage-gated sodium or calcium channels or depletion of readily releasable vesicles. We propose that the failure of evoked responses could be correlated to a blockade of nociceptive transmission. Blockade of nociceptive transmission is likely to be more complete with RTX, because we found that depression of eEPSC amplitude partially recovered following desensitization or washout of capsaicin, whereas RTX induced a sustained and irreversible response.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intrathecal administration of RTX-induced analgesia</title><p>Having demonstrated the unique properties of RTX at the first sensory synapse in the spinal cord and CSTN, we hypothesized that RTX-induced sustained activation of TRPV1 at the presynaptic terminal would cause analgesia by depression of synaptic transmission in the short-term and by nerve terminal ablation in the long-term. Therefore, we tested the effect of intrathecal administration of RTX in adult rats. RTX (0.045&#x02013;1.9 &#x000b5;g/kg) was administered intrathecally in behavioral models of pain.

These results indicate that RTX treatment does not affect mechanical hypersensitivity due to inflammation.

There was a complete loss of TRPV1 labeling in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g006">Fig. 6A, D</xref>). This is likely to be due to TRPV1-mediated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx causing nerve terminal death, or due to TRPV1 internalization. Central terminal ablation was not caused by death of DRG neurons because there was no difference in intensity of TRPV1 labeling or number of neurons labeled in DRG in saline treated animals as compared to RTX-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).

The peptide neurotransmitters CGRP and SP are released by sensory nerve terminals of small diameter TRPV1-containing neurons.

A potential consequence of selective targeting is that the terminals may regenerate over time, avoiding permanent damage. We have studied regeneration of peripheral and central terminals after RTX administration. Following intraplantar injection of RTX (10 &#x000b5;M, 10 &#x000b5;l), thermal hypersensitivity was determined in response to intraplantar injection of capsaicin (100 &#x000b5;M, 10 &#x000b5;l). A loss of capsaicin-induced thermal hypersensitivity accompanied by a loss of TRPV1 staining in peripheral terminals was observed within two days of RTX injection.

In confirmation of the nerve terminal regeneration, TRPV1 staining partially recovered after 63 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007021-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>).

RTX causes a sustained increase in sEPSCs as compared to capsaicin which exhibits a desensitizing response. Evoked synaptic current recordings show synaptic failures that are likely to be due to depolarization block from sustained TRPV1 activation. We propose that this effect causes reduced nociceptive transmission and quick but short-term analgesia. RTX in the long-term leads to ablation of TRPV1 expressing nerve terminals as a result of sustained Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx. Intrathecal administration of RTX reduced inflammatory thermal hypersensitivity without altering acute thermal sensitivity. This is due to selective ablation of TRPV1 expressing central nerve terminals in the dorsal horn that is sufficient to reduce inflammatory thermal hypersensitivity without affecting TRPV1 expressing DRG neurons or their peripheral terminals. Immunohistochemical studies show that TRPV1 in DRG neuronal cell bodies and peripheral terminals are preserved, suggesting that sensory efferent functions such as TRPV1-mediated CGRP and SP release at the peripheral nerve terminals will not be affected. CGRP and SP are vasoactive peptides that have been shown to be essential for control of the microvascular circulation, which includes perineurial capillaries and coronary vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007021-Strecker1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The specificity of intrathecal RTX action was shown by the observation that RTX administration did not affect mechanosensitivity and that staining for TRPV4, a putative mechanosensor, was intact in the dorsal horn. We also observed that following intrathecal administration of RTX, the central terminals did not regenerate even after five months as compared to the peripheral terminals that regenerated within two months of intraplantar RTX injection. The inability of central terminals to regenerate is an intriguing observation. In 1993, Goso et al., reported using receptor binding and neurogenic inflammatory response that RTX-induced loss of binding and extravasation were partly recovered in the bladder but the RTX binding was not recovered in the spinal cord after intrathecal administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007021-Goso1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In earlier studies, a single intrathecal injection of capsaicin depleted substance P from primary sensory neurons and caused a prolonged increase in the thermal and chemical pain thresholds in rats but there was no apparent change in responses to noxious mechanical stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007021-Yaksh1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007021-Russell1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, during intrathecal administration, capsaicin may be distributed throughout the CSF and hence effective concentrations may not have been achieved consistently. Since RTX binds to TRPV1 irreversibly and with high affinity, we propose this property will aid in its localization in a given segment of the spinal cord by slow infusion using osmotic mini pumps.

Our results indicate that intrathecal administration of RTX or its analogues is a promising method of achieving analgesia. Further study is needed of RTX concentration-response relationships, since even lower concentrations of RTX could cause a partial ablation of TRPV1 expressing nerve terminals that may be sufficient for pain relief. Better treatments for chronic intractable pain are urgently needed, especially in terminally ill patients, in whom the best analgesic option now available may be treatment with large doses of potent opiate analgesics, which can cause mental clouding, respiratory depression, and reduce quality of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><p>All the procedures used especially in reference to experimental animals not experiencing unnecessary discomfort, distress, pain or injury have been approved by the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use committee review panel in accordance with the Panel of Euthanasia of American Veterinary Medical Association.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Five week old Sprague<italic>-</italic>Dawley rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with 4 &#x00025; paraformaldehyde.

The rat was placed in a chamber with a metal mesh floor. A 0.5 mm diameter von Frey probe was applied to the plantar surface of the rat hind paw with pressure increasing by 0.05 Newtons/s and the pressure at which a paw withdrawal occurred was recorded and this was taken as PWT. For each hind paw, the procedure was repeated 3 times and the average pressure to produce withdrawal was calculated. Successive stimuli were applied to alternating paws at 5 min intervals.

Data are represented as mean&#x000b1;SEM and expressed as percent of control, which is scaled to 100&#x00025;. For evoked currents, Student's paired t-test was used for statistical comparisons and significance was considered at <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05. For experiments that involved manipulation of one of the legs (carrageenan or capsaicin injection), the data were normalized for each animal as maximum possible effect (MPE). This value was calculated as follows: MPE&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(PDR&#x02212;IBR)/(CBR&#x02212;IBR), where PDR is the postdrug response of the ipsilateral paw, IBR is the ipsilateral paw baseline response, and CBR is the contralateral paw baseline response. Accordingly, the individual values are reported as the mean&#x000b1;SEM. Data obtained for the carrageenan or capsaicin tests were subjected to a one-way ANOVA followed, when significant, by post hoc Dunnett's <italic>t</italic> tests. When comparing the means of only two groups, Student's <italic>t</italic> test was used. All comparisons were analyzed separately for each time point. For all tests, a <italic>p</italic> value lower than 0.05 (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007021.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Expression of TRPV1 in spinal cord and CSTN.
