In mammals, 13 aquaporins were described (AQP0 &#x02013; AQP12). There are two subfamilies: the aquaporins, which transport only water, and the aquaglyceroporins, which transport glycerol, urea, and other small solutes in addition to water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. An exception is AQP6, which is permeated by anions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins are present throughout the body, including in the plasma membrane of renal epithelia, brain astrocytes, and red blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Here we focus on AQP11, a protein with lower homology to previously characterized aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. AQP11 was previously described in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], although the authors were unable to measure solute transport. We aimed to establish the tissue distribution of rat AQP11 and to identify solutes transported by rat and human AQP11.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Cloning and sequence analysis of AQP11</title><p>Searching the human genome using Psi-BLAST, we found two genes with sequences related to members of the aquaporin gene family (also known as the MIP superfamily). Both were also present in rat and mouse genomes. These genes were previously annotated as AQP11 and AQP12 (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_766627">NP_766627</ext-link> and GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_945349">NP_945349</ext-link>). A search for conserved domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] revealed a significant alignment with MIP domain, a feature of all aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. Mouse AQP12 is expressed in pancreas; transport studies were inconclusive because tagged AQP12 failed to traffic to the surface of <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. During preparation of this manuscript, Morishita and colleagues published a report on mouse AQP11; transport studies were also inconclusive because tagged AQP11 failed to traffic to the surface of <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Using PCR, we amplified human AQP11 from colon cDNA, and mouse and rat AQP11 from testes cDNA. Human AQP11 is 91% similar and 82% identical to rat AQP11, and 92% similar and 83% identical to mouse AQP11 (mouse and rat AQP11 are 98% similar and 93% identical). AQP11 is 24&#x02013;33% similar (28% on average), and approximately 10% identical, to the previously characterized mammalian aquaporins (AQP0 &#x02013; 10), but 41% similar and 23% identical to AQP12. AQP11 is most similar to AQP12, and least similar to AQP4 and AQP7 (24%). AQP11 and AQP12 are similar to non-mammalian aquaporins present in plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>(SIPs, ~28%), puffer-fish <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis </italic>(44%), mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae </italic>and fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>(40%), and nematodes <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>and <italic>C. briggsae </italic>(~37%). In addition to mouse and rat, human AQP11 has homologous putative genes in the dingo <italic>Canis familiaris </italic>(gene LOC476798) and in the chicken <italic>Gallus gallus </italic>(gene LOC426725). Sequence alignments and analysis of the phylogenetic tree suggest that AQP11 and 12 are distinct from the known mammalian aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and may comprise a new MIP subfamily (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic tree of the human Aquaporin gene family</bold>.

Aquaporins that transport glycerol or ions, in addition to water, are labeled by brackets on the right. Aquaporins hat transport only water are unlabelled. Aquaporins for which there is no known solute are labeled with a question mark. In many cases only one or two of the mammalian aquaporins in a specific group have been characterized. For example, TIP1.1 is a water-selective channel, but TIP5.1 has not been characterized; human and rat AQP6 are ion and water channels, but mouse AQP6 has not been characterized.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-7-14-2"/></fig><p>Compared to other mammalian aquaporins, AQP11 has several unique attributes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The two Asn-Pro-Ala motifs of the aquaporin superfamily are present, although the first contains a cysteine instead of an alanine. Following the second Asn-Pro-Ala, AQP11 has a leucine, where all other mammalian aquaporins have an arginine. Based on the high-resolution structures of AQP0, AQP1, GlpF, and AQPZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], this leucine is one of four residues which form the selectivity filter, the narrowest region of the monomeric pore. In the region of the pore leading from the constriction point to the cytoplasm, the other aquaporins have Ser-Gly-(Ala/Gly)-His. AQP11 has Val-Gly-Thr-Ser. The histidine (serine in AQP11) is conserved in all other mammalian aquaporins. Similarly, the region of the pore leading to the outside of the membrane is not conserved in AQP11. AQP11 contains a bulky, aromatic phenylalanine, where the other aquaporins have a methionine, isoleucine, leucine, or valine. These changes may have a significant impact on solute transport. Based on this sequence alignment, the polarity and size of the constriction region of AQP11 is quite different from the other aquaporins. In addition, the change in amino acids lining the pore could greatly limit the size and/or charge of solutes transported by AQP11. Because the similarity to other aquaporins for which there is a high-resolution structure is so low, we were unable to use homology modeling to predict the 3-dimensional structure of AQP11.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence alignment of human Aquaporins</bold>.

The bands in kidney and liver were slightly smaller than the bands in testes and brain. These tissues also had bands above 4.5 kb, as did spleen and heart.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>AQP11 is expressed in multiple rat tissues</bold>.

In agreement with our Northern blot, we found AQP11 message in brain cerebrum, in the renal cortex, and in testis. We also detected AQP11 in the intestinal tract from duodenum to ileum, and weaker expression in choroid plexus, cerebellum, colon and liver. Since this RT-PCR was not quantitative, it is impossible to infer relative message abundance. In microisolated renal structures, we found mRNA only in proximal tubules and not in glomeruli, thin limbs of the medulla, thick ascending limbs of the medulla and cortex, distal convoluted tubules, or in collecting ducts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, bottom panel). This is in agreement with a recent study demonstrating AQP11 immunostaining in mouse kidney cortex proximal tubule but not in distal tubule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of anti-AQP11 antibodies in cultured cells</title><p>To elucidate AQP11 protein distribution, we generated antibodies against the C-terminus and N-terminus of rat AQP11.

We saw predominantly intracellular staining and some staining at the plasma membrane, and no staining in cells transfected with empty vector. AQP11 immunoblots of surface biotinylated CHO cell lysates confirmed that AQP11 is present at both the plasma membrane and in the cytosol in transfected CHO cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). We saw no bands in cells transfected with empty vector or in cells transfected with Aquaporin-4, demonstrating the specificity of our C-term antibody. We obtained similar results in transiently transfected MDCK and HEK293 cells using both N-term and C-term antibodies (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Validation of anti-AQP11 antibody and tissue immunoblotting</bold>.

An anti-AQP11 C-term immunoblot of multiple rat tissue membrane proteins revealed two prominent bands: an approximately 32 kDa band in brain, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle; and an approximately 25 kDa band in testes, kidney, and liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref> upper panel, calculated based on migration distance vs. markers of known size; similar results were obtained with the N-term antibody, not shown). De-glycosylation (PNGase treatment) or de-phosphorylation (lambda protein phosphatase treatment) assays did not produce changes in protein migration patterns (not shown). As a control, we also probed total protein lysate from cultured HEK293 cells transfected with rat AQP11. This produced only the 25 kDa band. Both bands disappeared when the antibody was preadsorbed to the antigenic peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, lower panel). There appears to be no correlation between the transcript size (Northern blot) and the protein size (immunoblot), as the testes contain a larger band in the Northern blot (2 kb) but a smaller band in the Western blot.</p><p>Our results demonstrate rat AQP11 RNA and protein are found in testis, kidney, liver, and brain. We failed to detect AQP11 RNA in skeletal muscle and heart (Northern blot, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), although Western blot of these tissues was positive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Since RNA loading was normalized against &#x003b2;-actin hybridization signal (not shown), this discrepancy could be due to low levels of AQP11 RNA in these tissues.</p><p>Biochemical and structural evidence shows that many mammalian aquaporins form tetramers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We subjected rat brain hemisphere membrane proteins to sucrose density ultra-centrifugation and found that AQP11 sediments in similar fractions as AQP4, a water channel known to form tetramers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). In agreement with previous work, we detected AQP4 in fractions 10&#x02013;23, with a peak in fractions 13&#x02013;15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. AQP11 was found in fractions 8&#x02013;19, with a peak in fractions 11&#x02013;13. This distribution overlaps significantly, though not perfectly. Regardless, the first several fractions lack AQP11, and it is in these fractions where we would expect to find an AQP11 monomer. We conclude that AQP11, like AQP4, exists in rat brain as a multi-subunit oligomer &#x02013; presumably a tetramer like AQP4 and other aquaporins.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional expression of AQP11 in xenopus Oocytes</title><p>We injected oocytes with human AQP11, myc-tagged human AQP11, or rat AQP11 and confirmed surface expression of the second two proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy and by immunoblot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Using an oocyte swelling assay, we tested AQP11-injected oocytes for transport of water, glycerol, or urea (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Compared to controls, oocytes injected with 5 ng or 25 ng of human wildtype or myc-tagged AQP11 cRNA showed no increase in the rate of water transport.

It is possible that a putative AQP11 channel is closed unless a ligand or other regulatory molecule is present. It is also possible that AQP11 does not act as a solute channel in vivo. Like AQP0, a poor water channel that forms membrane junctions in the lens of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the role of AQP11 may be primarily structural. It is also possible that AQP11 transports a different, untested solute, such as ammonium, CO<sub>2</sub>, or NO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, it is possible that AQP11 is not functional when expressed in oocytes. If true, this would be the first aquaporin that fails to function when expressed in oocytes.</p><p>A previous study reported that exogenous mouse AQP11 was not targeted to the plasma membrane in oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This conflicts with our observations using rat AQP11. This discrepancy could be due to the amino acid differences between rat and mouse AQP11. Alternatively, it could be because the previous study utilized AQP11 tagged with GFP or V5. These tags may alter AQP11 localization in oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>AQP11 in rat brain</title><p>To further elucidate the location of AQP11 in rat brain, we stained rat brain sections with AQP11 N-term antibody. We found staining primarily in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In the cerebellum, AQP11 immunoreactivity was associated with the dendrites of Purkinje cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed punctate labeling, indicative of intracellular localization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). In the hippocampus, AQP11 positive neurons were found in the CA1 and CA2. In cerebral cortex, staining was absent in cortical layer I, but present in layers II-VI. We failed to see strong staining in other areas of the brain, such as in the thalamus or near the ventricles. Similar staining was obtained with anti-C-terminal AQP11 antibodies (not shown).

The authors of the previous study did not stain brain sections, but they did note that mice lacking AQP11 began dying 15 days after birth, with renal failure and polycystic kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. One explanation for the discrepancy might be due to differences in AQP11 localization in mouse versus rat kidney. In rat kidney, perhaps the termini of AQP11 are not accessible for antibody interaction.</p><p>AQP11 localization in the brain is different from the other brain aquaporins. AQP4 is restricted to astrocytes throughout the brain, while AQP1 is present in the choroid plexus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. AQP9 is present in astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] as well as in a population of catecholaminergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The apparent intracellular localization of AQP11 in Purkinje cells is unusual. Only AQP6 is predominantly intracellular in vivo. The unique distribution and the apparent lack of water/solute transport by AQP11 may predict a unique function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We describe rat AQP11, an aquaporin with lower similarity to known mammalian aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. AQP11, along with AQP12, may comprise a new aquaporin subfamily. Unlike other aquaporins, we were unable to demonstrate transport of water, glycerol, urea, or ions by AQP11. This is likely due to putative pore-lining residues that are not conserved between AQP11 and other mammalian aquaporins. AQP11 is expressed in a variety of rat tissues. In the brain, AQP11 is found in Purkinje cells, hippocampal neurons of CA1 and CA2, and cerebral cortical neurons. Future studies are necessary to elucidate the physiological role of AQP11 in the brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning and sequence alignment</title><p>AQP11 was found using a Psi-BLAST search of GenBank with the BLOSUM62 matrix.
