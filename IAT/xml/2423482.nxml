Although no significant difference could be detected in the binding kinetics of &#x003b1;-actinin 1 with either wild type or mutant GNE in our SPR biosensor based analysis, further investigation is needed to determine whether and how the interaction of GNE with &#x003b1;-actinin 1 in skeletal muscle is relevant to the putative muscle-specific function of &#x003b1;-actinin 1, and to the muscle-restricted pathology of HIBM.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is a unique neuromuscular disorder characterized by adult-onset, slowly progressive distal and proximal muscle weakness, presenting with an unusual feature, the sparing of the quadriceps.

Such interactions could give some clue about novel pathways involving GNE, besides its known function in sialylation, and as such, could be evaluated for potential involvement in HIBM pathophysiology.

Further, we showed by a co-IP assay that GNE and &#x003b1;-actinin interact in a cellular environment, and by immunohistochemistry, that GNE and &#x003b1;-actinin 1 are expressed in distinct but overlapping compartments in skeletal muscle.</p><p>&#x003b1;-Actinin 1 is one of the four family members of &#x003b1;-actinins (1&#x02013;4), which belong to the spectrin protein superfamily including the spectrins and dystrophin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-MacArthur1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x003b1;-Actinin is an actin binding and crosslinking protein, a homodimer with 100 kDa subunits which can be visualized as a long rod-shaped molecule by electron microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Blanchard1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The &#x003b1;-actinins are known to be present in multiple subcellular compartments, including cell&#x02013;cell and cell-matrix contact sites, cellular protrusions and stress fiber dense regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Ote1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the protein isoforms, &#x003b1;-actinin 4, was found to be localized also to the nucleus in various cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Honda1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Poch1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as in a differentiated skeletal muscle cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Goffart1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. GNE is an enzyme primarily localized in the cytosol (8). However, it was shown to be attached to the Golgi complex and in the nucleus of mammalian cells as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Krause1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Binding of calcium to the non-muscle &#x003b1;-actinins (1 and 4) changes the conformation of the protein and inhibits its actin binding capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Noegel1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, muscle &#x003b1;-actinins (2 and 3) are calcium insensitive since alternative splicing abolished their calcium binding ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-MacArthur1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, we found that calcium has a significant positive effect on &#x003b1;-actinin 1 interaction with GNE. Further analysis is needed in order to recognize the precise site of interaction in both GNE and &#x003b1;-actinin 1, and to clarify how the conformational change caused by calcium binding improves this interaction.</p><p>The &#x003b1;-actinins contribute to both the stability and the plasticity of actin-based arrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Ote1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to their function as actin-crosslinking proteins, &#x003b1;-actinins have been found to interact with a large number of protein partners, and to play multiple roles in cells, including linking of the cytoskeleton to various transmembrane proteins, diverse signaling pathways, and regulating the activity of a variety of receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Ote1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In light of recent reports on the interaction in nerve cells between GNE and a brain specific protein involved in the modulation of the cytoskeleton, CRMP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Weidemann1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, and on the possible involvement of GNE in pAkt signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Amsili1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, the interaction of GNE with &#x003b1;-actinin 1 could point to the involvement of GNE in one or more of these processes.</p><p>Although the interaction of HIBM mutant GNE with &#x003b1;-actinin 1, as measured by BIAcore, could not be significantly distinguished from that of the wild-type protein, we cannot rule out the possibility that any micro-change in this interaction might contribute to HIBM pathophysiology. It might be that <italic>in vivo</italic> the mutant GNE binds to &#x003b1;-actinin 1 in a slightly different manner or affinity, and therefore the effect of this change is not seen in normal biological conditions, but it has a deleterious effect on HIBM cells upon long term stress conditions. Since the BIAcore <italic>in vitro</italic> assay cannot mimic <italic>in vivo</italic> stress conditions, further experiments in cellular environments, designed to test the differences between the interactions of mutant and WT GNEs with &#x003b1;-actinins, are needed in order to test this hypothesis. Another possibility of how the BIAcore <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions may conceal a difference between GNE wt and GNE M712T in actinin interaction may derive from the different oligomeric forms of the enzyme. GNE assembles in two oligomeric states, a tetramer with full enzymatic activity and a dimmer only possessing ManNAc kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Ghaderi1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The relatively rough conditions for immobilization of recombinant GNE on the BIAcore chip most likely cause the decay of the tetramer and only dimmers are available in the interaction assay. A difference of tetrameric wt versus mutant GNE in actinin interaction can therefore not be excluded and should be analyzed by other methods, e.g. pull-down assays with pre-purified tetrameric or dimeric GNE. However, the possibility that tetrameric GNE cannot interact with actinin at all can be ruled out, as the conditions of the co-immunoprecipitation assay maintain the native, tetrameric state of the enzyme in cells.</p><p>In contrast to the sarcomeric isoforms of &#x003b1;-actinin (2 and 3), which are components of the sarcomeric Z disc where they crosslink actin filaments and stabilize the muscle contractile apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-MacArthur1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, &#x003b1;-actinin 1 and 4 are considered as the non-muscle isoforms of the protein. Therefore, we were surprised to find the GNE interactor expressed in skeletal muscle primary culture to be &#x003b1;-actinin 1. Interestingly, this is not the first evidence for the expression of non-muscle &#x003b1;-actinins in a myogenic cell line. Endo and Masaki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Endo1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> found that both skeletal and smooth muscle actinins are expressed in cultured embryonic chicken pectoralis cells. The two proteins were found at separate locations within the cells; skeletal muscle &#x003b1;-actinin was absent in myoblasts and was restricted to Z discs in myotubes. Smooth muscle &#x003b1;-actinin was diffused in the cytoplasm and on membrane-associated structures of myoblasts, and then confined to membrane-associated structures of myotubes. In contrast, Goffart et al. reported recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002477-Goffart1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> that both &#x003b1;-actinin 1 and 4 are expressed in C2F3 cells, a subclone of the myogenic mouse C2C12 line. The two proteins were found to be expressed in both myoblasts and myotubes. &#x003b1;-Actinin 1 was present in the cytosol of both cell types, while &#x003b1;-actinin 4 was localized to both cytoplasm and nucleus of myoblasts, and mainly to the nucleus of myotubes. In the present study we have confirmed that &#x003b1;-actinin 1 is expressed in C2C12 muscle cultures, excluding the possibility that expression of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 in skeletal muscle is limited to smooth muscle structures such as blood vessels. To assess the relevance of our findings in mature muscle tissue, we examined the expression of &#x003b1;-actinin 1 and GNE in mouse stretched spinalis muscle. While the localization of the two proteins is distinct, a substantial degree of overlap provides preliminary evidence that the interaction observed <italic>in vitro</italic> may plausibly occur <italic>in vivo</italic> in mouse skeletal muscle. Further comprehensive investigation is needed to elucidate the precise localization of &#x003b1;-actinin 1 and GNE in the myofibrillar apparatus centered on the Z line, and the relevance of &#x003b1;-actinin 1 function in skeletal muscle to its interaction with GNE in general, and to HIBM pathophysiology in particular.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr L.
