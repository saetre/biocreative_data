Inducing RNAi in the mesoderm was sufficient to knockdown almost all dSmyd4 protein expression in adult flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003008-g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The level of a high molecular weight band recognised by the antibody was also reduced, suggesting that this is a modified form of dSmyd4. When RNAi was induced ubiquitously or in the mesoderm we observed large numbers of dead pupae. These flies had died just prior to, or during, eclosion, the stage when adult flies escape from the pupal case.

The large number of family members may allow these proteins to assume a repertoire of functions, or ensure redundancy between family members during development. Further analysis of vertebrate genomes may also reveal larger numbers of Smyd proteins than had previously been anticipated. Studies in vertebrates show that individual Smyd proteins control gene expression in order to fulfil varied functions during development.

This study gives additional insight into the HDAC co-repressors that are involved in repression by dSmyd4. We have shown that dSmyd4 interacts with both dHDAC3 and Ebi, components of the SMRTER co-repressor complex. This contrasts with mammalian Smyd2 protein, which interacts with the Sin3A-HDAC complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003008-Brown1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. We were unable to detect an interaction between dSmyd4 and HDAC1-containing NuRD, CoREST and Sin3A co-repressors by immunoprecipitation. Nevertheless, a common feature of dSmyd4 and vertebrate Smyd2 and Smyd1 is the association of a potential methyltransferase with histone deacetylase activity in a single complex. This implies that a primary role of these proteins is to co-ordinate changes in modification status at their target sites.</p><p>We have described a direct interaction between dSmyd4 and the N-terminal regions of dHDAC1 and dHDAC3. There is a high level of identity between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate class I HDACs, especially at the N-termini where this interaction occurs, therefore this interaction may be relevant to recruitment of HDACs by Smyd family members in other species. The recruitment of HDAC co-repressor complexes by MYND domains is also of clinical importance. AML/MTG8 fusions lead to the aberrant recruitment of HDAC co-repressor complexes in the development of leukaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003008-Lutterbach2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The MTG8 MYND domain interacts with components of these complexes, but the interaction between the MYND domain of MTG8 and HDACs is poorly described. The novel interaction described here may also apply to other interactions such as these.</p><p>The cytoplasmic over-expression pattern of dSmyd4 resembles that of vertebrate Smyd2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003008-Brown1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, providing another parallel between vertebrate and invertebrate Smyd proteins. However, a more relevant indicator of biological function is the distribution of endogenous protein. We show here that endogenous dSmyd4 is predominantly nuclear in S2 cells. The strong cytoplasmic localisation of dSmyd4 in embryos suggests that in addition to its activity as a transcriptional repressor, dSmyd4 may perform additional cytoplasmic functions, for example the methylation of non-histone substrates. This raises additional parallels with Smyd2, since a cytoplasmic role has been suggested for this protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003008-AbuFarha1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The cell-type dependent localisation of endogenous dSmyd4 raises interesting questions about how the localisation of dSmyd4 is regulated. The subcellular localisation of human Smyd3 is regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner and analogous developmental regulation may be required for the function of other Smyd proteins such as dSmyd4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003008-Hamamoto1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Requirement for dSmyd4 in development</title><p>Knockdown of dSmyd4 in muscle tissue resulted in reduced rates of survival. dSmyd4 was expressed during embryogenesis, yet the majority of knockdown flies died at the late pupal stage suggesting that there is a greater requirement for dSmyd4 in processes involved in adult myogenesis. This may be due to redundancy between Smyd proteins during embryogenesis since CG8503 and CG18136 are also expressed in muscle tissue at this time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003008-Tomancak1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

The neural networks and signalling required for eclosion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003008-Park1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> therefore appear to be intact, indicating that dSmyd4 is likely to play a role in controlling muscle development or function. Identifying the precise nature of the eclosion defect caused by dSmyd4 knockdown will be an important step in understanding the function of this and other Smyd proteins in the development of multicellular organisms.
