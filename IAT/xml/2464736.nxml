In this study, we investigate the actions of natural progesterone and of the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on actin cytoskeleton remodeling and on breast cancer cell movement and invasion. In particular, we characterize the nongenomic signaling cascades implicated in these actions. T47-D breast cancer cells display enhanced horizontal migration and invasion of three-dimensional matrices in the presence of both progestins. Exposure to the hormones triggers a rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of membrane ruffles required for cell movement, which are dependent on the rapid phosphorylation of the actin-regulatory protein moesin. The extra-cellular small GTPase RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK-2) cascade plays central role in progesterone- and MPA-induced moesin activation, cell migration and invasion. In the presence of progesterone, progesterone receptor A (PRA) interacts with the G protein G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>, while MPA drives PR to interact with tyrosine kinase c-Src and to activate phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, leading to the activation of RhoA/ROCK-2. In conclusion, our findings manifest that progesterone and MPA promote breast cancer cell movement via rapid actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which are mediated by moesin activation. These events are triggered by RhoA/ROCK-2 cascade through partially differing pathways by the two compounds. These results provide original mechanistic explanations for the effects of progestins on breast cancer progression and highlight potential targets to treat endocrine-sensitive breast cancers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Estrogen is regarded as a carcinogenic factor in the breast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002790-Yager1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and have recently found that estrogen may also alter breast cancer progression by promoting tumour cells motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002790-Giretti1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The generation of cancer cell movement in the surrounding environment is the first step in these processes and involves a complex set of cellular actions. A critical step is represented by the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton toward the cell membrane, which allows the formation of bridges between the backbone of the cell and the extracellular matrix mediated by anchorage proteins.

The identification of the cellular site of PR/G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub> interaction is therefore not solved and will be the aim of future studies.</p><p>In normal mammary epithelial cells PR isoforms are co-expressed equivalently.

More recently PRB (but not PRA) has been shown to localize to the cytoplasm in response to progesterone and thus to interact with c-Src.

To this extent, our finding of a divergent ability of PRA and PRB to recruit the RhoA/ROCK-2 cascade stands in favour of a different role of the two receptor isoforms during cell migration and invasion.</p><p>PR-dependent recruitment of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways in the presence of natural progesterone does not seem to be involved in moesin activation, but the inhibition of these two pathways decreases cell migration and invasion in T47-D cells exposed to progesterone. This implies that moesin is not the exclusive tool mediating cell migration and invasion in the presence of this PR agonist, which is not surprising. On the other hand, PRA does not interact with G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub> when bound by the synthetic progestin, MPA, indicating a high degree of specificity of this signaling event. Indeed, when MPA hits PRA or PRB, the Src/PI3K/Akt pathway is rapidly recruited. This ultimately leads to the activation of RhoA and ROCK-2 and, finally, of moesin. It is possible that when engaged by MPA, PRs may be driven to form a functional signaling module with Src and PI3K, where activated PI3K would lead to recruitment of RhoA, as shown in other cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002790-Saci1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

A similar result is found for breast cancer invasion of three-dimensional matrices, where the inhibition of G proteins, ROCK and MAPK all result in a significant decrease of progesterone-induced cell invasion, notwithstanding the fact that MAPK are not required for moesin activation by progesterone. These apparent discrepancies are likely due to the complexity of the processes of cell movement and invasion, that are controlled by multiple internal and external signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002790-Kamps1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Some of the present results point out that PR signals differently when engaged by different agonists, such as P or MPA, and this maybe responsible for their discrepant actions on some specific endpoints, such as their different impacts on breast cancer subtype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002790-Fournier2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, GR is not responsible for the MPA-dependent activation of moesin, possibly indicating that conformational differences in PR might explain the differential recruitment of signaling pathways in the presence of the two ligands.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that PR is implicated in breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Recruitment of PR by P or MPA leads to rapid extra-nuclear signaling to actin, associated to the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and the formation of pseudopodia and membrane ruffles. These changes increase breast cancer cell invasion of the surrounding environment. PR signaling seems to be ligand-specific, as in the presence of progesterone PR signals to RhoA and ROCK-2 through the activation of G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>, while in the presence of MPA PR uses c-Src and PI3K. These observations help to understand the role of progesterone receptor signaling in breast cancer spread and could provide new molecular targets for breast cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell cultures and treatments</title><p>T47-D breast cancer cells were incubated in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.2 UI/mL insulin, L-glutamine and penicillin streptomycin under a 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C.

The lysates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 10 min, followed by a centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 5 min to pellet and discard unbroken cells. Supernatant were centrifuged at 10,000&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. After that, supernatant and pellet were both collected. Pellets were resuspended to the same volume as the supernatant using ice cold distilled water plus F-actin depolymerization solution (10 &#x000b5;M cytochalasin-D) and put on ice for 1 h to dissociate F-actin. According to the protein concentration previously measured, equivalent volumes of supernatant and dissolved pellet were loaded to run Western blot and G-actin/F-actin ratio was quantitiated using the quantitative digital imaging system.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Cell migration assays</title><p>Cell migration was assayed with razor scrape assays as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002790-Simoncini1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, a razor blade was pressed through the confluent T47-D breast cancer cell monolayer into the plastic plate to mark the starting line. T47-D cells were swept away on one side of that line. Cells were washed, and 2.0 mL of DMEM containing steroid-deprived FBS and gelatin (1 mg/mL) were added. Cytosine &#x003b2;-D-arabinofuranoside hydrochloride (Sigma) (10 &#x000b5;M), a selective inhibitor of DNA synthesis which doesn't inhibit RNA synthesis was used 1 h before the test substance was added. Migration was monitored for 48 hours. Every 12 h fresh medium and treatment were replaced. Cells were digitally imaged and migration distance was measured by using phase-contrast microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Cell invasion assays</title><p>Cell invasion were assayed following the standard method by using the BD BioCoatTM Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> Invasion Chamber (BD Bioscience, USA). In brief, after rehydrating the GFR Matrigel inserts, the test substance was added to the wells. An equal number of Control Inserts (no GFR Matrigel coating) were prepared as control. 0.5 mL of T47-D cell suspension (2.5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/mL) were added to the inside of the inserts. The chambers were incubated for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C, 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. After incubation, the non-invading cells were removed from the upper surface of the membrane using cotton tipped swabs. Then the cells on the lower surface of the membrane were stained with Diff-Quick stain. The invading cells were observed and photographed under the microscope at 100&#x000d7; magnification. Cells were counted in the central field of triplicate membranes. The invasion index was calculated as the &#x00025; invasion test cell/ &#x00025; invasion control cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All values are expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD. Statistical differences between mean values were determined by ANOVA, followed by the Fisher's protected least significance difference (PLSD). All differences were considered significant at P&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr. Dean P.
