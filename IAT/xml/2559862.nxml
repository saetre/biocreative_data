Disruption of the DAG complex occurs in dystrophinopathies and sarcoglycanopathies, two genetically distinct classes of muscular dystrophy characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness and increased fatigability. DAG complex instability leads to mislocalization and downregulation of nNOS&#x003bc;; but this is thought to play a minor role in disease pathogenesis. This view persists without knowledge of the role of nNOS in skeletal muscle contractile function <italic>in vivo</italic> and has influenced gene therapy approaches to dystrophinopathy, the majority of which do not restore sarcolemmal nNOS&#x003bc;. We address this knowledge gap by evaluating skeletal muscle function in nNOS knockout (KN1) mice using an <italic>in situ</italic> approach, in which the muscle is maintained in its normal physiological environment. nNOS-deficiency caused reductions in skeletal muscle bulk and maximum tetanic force production in male mice only. Furthermore, nNOS-deficient muscles from both male and female mice exhibited increased susceptibility to contraction-induced fatigue. These data suggest that aberrant nNOS&#x003bc; signaling can negatively impact three important clinical features of dystrophinopathies and sarcoglycanopathies: maintenance of muscle bulk, force generation and fatigability. Our study suggests that restoration of sarcolemmal nNOS&#x003bc; expression in dystrophic muscles may be more important than previously appreciated and that it should be a feature of any fully effective gene therapy-based intervention.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a versatile signaling molecule in skeletal muscle and is synthesized from oxygen and L-arginine by muscle-specific neuronal nitric oxide synthase mu (nNOS&#x003bc;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Stamler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Silvagno1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Disruption of the DAG complex results in decreased nNOS&#x003bc; expression and aberrant localization. DAG complex disruption occurs in several distinct dystrophies, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Becker Muscular Dystrophy and Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies (LGMD) 2C, 2D and 2E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Brenman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Chao1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Crosbie1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These muscle diseases vary in severity and are characterized by progressive loss of muscle bulk, weakness and increased susceptibility to fatigue. Each disease is characterized by defects in nNOS&#x003bc; expression and/or targeting. Indeed, DMD patients exhibit defective inhibition of vasoconstriction during exercise causing functional muscle ischemia that may exacerbate dystrophic muscle damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Sander1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Asai1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest that loss of nNOS&#x003bc; may contribute to disease pathogenesis.</p><p>Although aberrant nNOS&#x003bc; localization and expression is a feature of the pathology of DMD, BMD and several LGMDs, it is not known whether the loss of nNOS&#x003bc; can cause contractile deficits in normal or dystrophic muscle <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of NO regulation of muscle contractility suggest that nNOS&#x003bc;-deficiency may actually enhance the force generating capacity of skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Kobzik1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Reid1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This thinking has influenced the development of gene-therapy based therapeutic approaches to treating dystrophin-deficient muscles of DMD patients. Viral-mediated delivery of micro- or mini-dystrophin constructs substantially improves dystrophic pathology without restoring nNOS&#x003bc; expression at the sarcolemma in the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model of DMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Gregorevic2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Yue1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether this is a significant limitation of the gene-therapy-based approach remains to be established. It could be a significant limitation if nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient skeletal muscles exhibit functional deficits <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In order to determine if the absence of nNOS&#x003bc; negatively impacts skeletal muscle function, we evaluated the force-generating capacity <italic>in situ</italic> of tibialis anterior (TA) muscles from nNOS knockout (KN1) mice. Given the reported effects of nNOS&#x003bc; on blood supply during exercise, it was important to use an <italic>in situ</italic> approach where the TA muscle was maintained in the most physiologically relevant state with normal vascularization. Unexpectedly, nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient muscles from male mice were smaller in mass and generated significantly lower maximum isometric force compared with littermate controls. Moreover, muscles from both male and female mice lacking nNOS&#x003bc; show increased susceptibility to fatigue compared with controls. In contrast to previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, our data suggest that nNOS&#x003bc;-deficiency results in reduced force-generating capacity and that NO is necessary for sustained muscle contractility. These data also suggest the possibility that mini- and micro-dystrophins capable of restoring sarcolemmal nNOS&#x003bc; expression may be more effective at reversing the functional deficits of dystrophic skeletal muscle. The combination of reduced bulk and impaired contractile function lead us to conclude that nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient muscles are myopathic and that aberrant nNOS&#x003bc; expression could contribute to functional deficits, especially increased susceptibility to fatigue, in DMD, BMD and LGMD 2C, 2D and 2E. We propose that the <italic>NOS1</italic> gene be considered a novel candidate for skeletal muscle myopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sex-Specific Decrease in Skeletal Muscle Bulk of nNOS-Deficient Mice</title><p><italic>Prima facie</italic>, the most striking phenotypic characteristic of the nNOS mutant KN1 mice was the reduced body mass of males.

In order to determine the effect of nNOS-deficiency on muscle mass, the wet weights of two hindlimb muscles, the tibialis anterior (a predominantly fast twitch muscle) and soleus muscles (a predominantly slow twitch muscle), were measured. The masses of both the TA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003387-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and soleus muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003387-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) were significantly decreased in male nNOS mutant mice only, compared with wild type male littermates. Mass reduction occurs in skeletal muscles with different fiber compositions, and therefore could reasonably account for the reduced body mass. In contrast, in female mice, the masses of both TA and soleus muscle were not significantly affected by the absence of nNOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003387-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>, respectively).

In order to test this possibility, TA muscles from KN1 mice were subjected to a simulated exercise protocol in <italic>situ</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Representative data from wild type and KN1 TA muscles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003387-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and the averages are presented in 3B. After 40 s of simulated exercise, nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient muscles begin to show deficits in force production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003387-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). By the end of the exercise protocol, the force-generating capacity of KN1 muscle had declined to a significantly lower force plateau (averaging 45.5&#x000b1;4.4&#x00025;) compared with littermate controls (57.8&#x000b1;1.7&#x00025;), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003387-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Note that the trace shown exhibited near normal recovery. These data highlight a marked increase in fatigability of nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient skeletal muscle. The time taken to fatigue, as represented by the time constant &#x003c4;, is not significantly different between nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient TA muscles and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003387-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

Both male and female KN1 TA muscles showed similar enhanced susceptibility to exercise-induced fatigue (data not shown). It is important to note that susceptibility to fatigue was not simply a consequence of reduced muscle mass. TA masses from wild type female mice, male KN1 and female KN1 mice did not differ significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003387-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), but only nNOS-deficient TAs were more fatigable.

Force recovery was measured after 1 minute and 5 minutes of rest following the conclusion of the fatigue period. Representative data are shown for wild type (black boxes) and KN1 (grey triangles) and are fitted with exponential decay curves (black for wild type and grey for KN1) (A). Both male and female KN1 mice showed similar patterns of fatigue. During 4 minutes of repeated contraction, nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient skeletal muscles did not sustain control levels of force (A).

After 1 minute of rest, nNOS-deficient TA muscles did not recover to the same extent as wild type TA muscle (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, after 5 minutes of rest, the force-generating capacity of nNOS-deficient muscles was fully recovered (B). Numbers of animals analyzed: 13 wild type (7 males and 6 females) and 13 KN1 (5 males and 8 females) mice. Values shown in B are mean&#x000b1;standard error of the mean (S.E.M).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0003387.g003"/></fig><p>Next, we addressed potential mechanism(s) of decreased fatigue resistance in nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that susceptibility to fatigue could be due to increased numbers of fast twitch fibers and fewer slow twitch fibers. Fast twitch fibers have a more glycolytic metabolism and thus fatigue more easily than slow twitch myofibers. A greater proportion of fast twitch fibers would decrease the time taken for the muscle to reach peak twitch tension (P<sub>t</sub>) and shorten the relaxation phase. The twitch responses of nNOS-deficient muscles to a single threshold stimulus are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003387-t001">Table 1</xref>. Peak twitch force (P<sub>t</sub>) was significantly reduced in KN1 males compared with controls. Despite this decrease, nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient muscles did not exhibit any intrinsic weakness, because specific twitch force (sP<sub>t</sub>, &#x0005b;P<sub>t</sub> normalized for cross sectional area&#x0005d;) did not differ from littermate controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003387-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, in contrast to male KN1 muscle, P<sub>t</sub> was unaffected by the absence of nNOS&#x003bc; in female mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003387-t001">Table 1</xref>). KN1 male mice exhibit a sex-specific decrease in Pt, paralleling the decreased TA muscle mass and maximum isometric force deficit. The loss of nNOS&#x003bc; from skeletal muscle had no significant impact on the time to reach peak tension and the time between maximum and half-maximum force production during the relaxation phase of the twitch (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003387-t001">Table 1</xref>). The absence of significant difference in the time of the contraction and relaxation phase of the twitch suggest that there is no gross change in the fiber composition of the TA muscle and argue against a fiber type shift as a mechanism for the increased fatigability of nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient muscle.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0003387-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003387.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Twitch Properties of nNOS&#x003bc;-Deficient Skeletal Muscle Fibers.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0003387-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0003387.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0003387-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"><italic>Male</italic></td><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"><italic>Female</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Wild Type</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>KN1</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Wild Type</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>KN1</italic></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P<sub>t</sub> (mN)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">486&#x000b1;22</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">376&#x000b1;17<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">&#x02021;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">373&#x000b1;19<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">#</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">350&#x000b1;13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TPT (ms)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.8&#x000b1;1.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.2&#x000b1;1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.7&#x000b1;0.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.2&#x000b1;0.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HRT (ms)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.5&#x000b1;1.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.6&#x000b1;1.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.1&#x000b1;1.7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.7&#x000b1;1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">sP<sub>t</sub> (kNm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">79.4&#x000b1;3.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.7&#x000b1;3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">77.1&#x000b1;3.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">78.4&#x000b1;2.9</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>P<sub>t</sub> is twitch force.

Unexpectedly, myopathy is most severe in nNOS-deficient male mice, because female mice exhibit increased fatigability only. Despite the <italic>NOS1</italic> gene being localized to murine autosome five, and not on a sex chromosome, the impact of nNOS on skeletal muscle is mediated by unknown sex-specific mechanisms. This emphasizes the importance of considering gender when experimentally assessing nNOS function. Our data suggest that nNOS&#x003bc; is an important regulator of skeletal muscle size and contractile performance.</p><p>One of the key features of nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient skeletal muscle is increased susceptibility to fatigue, arguably the most significant new finding of the present study. The force generated by nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient muscles during simulated exercise plateaus at a significantly lower level than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003387-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Recovery appears to occur more gradually in KN1 mice; however there is full restoration of force-generating capacity after a five minute rest period. In order to address potential mechanisms of decreased resistance to fatigue in KN1 mice, we looked for functional evidence of increased numbers of fast twitch fibers in KN1 TA muscle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003387-t001">Table 1</xref>). Fast twitch fibers are more easily fatigued than slow twitch fibers. Contraction and relaxation times of single muscle twitches were unaffected by the absence of nNOS&#x003bc;, arguing that increased fatigability was not due to alterations in the ratio of fast to slow twitch fibers. nNOS&#x003bc;-derived NO plays an important role in maintaining normal blood supply during exercise by overriding &#x003b1;-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Thomas1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Thomas2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Impaired blood and oxygen delivery to the vascular beds of active muscles can result in repeated muscle exposure to functional ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Sander1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore we speculate that decreased muscle oxygenation could account, at least in part, for the susceptibility to fatigue of nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient TA muscles. Additional evidence to support this possibility comes from dog studies <italic>in vivo</italic> where pharmacological inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis was proposed to cause fatigue by mismatching blood supply with demand in contracting skeletal muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Haller1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Muscle fatigue is a complex physiological process that can occur by many different mechanisms, further studies are required to address the exact mechanism(s) by which nNOS-deficiency results in increased susceptibility of skeletal muscle to fatigue. At present, nNOS&#x003bc; deficiency does not appear to increase fatigability by significantly altering TA muscle fiber type composition, but may do so through impaired vasoregulatory mechanisms.</p><p>NO has been previously suggested to be an inhibitor of the force-generating capacity of skeletal muscle. In <italic>in vitro</italic> bath studies on excised muscles, the pharmacological inhibition of NOS results in greater force output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Kobzik1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Reid1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, nitric oxide is widely understood to act as an inhibitor or attenuator of muscle contractility. However, these data are not consistent with our findings <italic>in vivo</italic>. We find that the absence of nNOS&#x003bc; is associated with decreased maximal force-generating capacity in males. This is most likely due to decreased muscle mass and not due to defects in the contractile apparatus function; because specific force (sP<sub>o</sub>) was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003387-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, the mass and force-generating capacity of female TA are unaffected by the absence of nNOS&#x003bc;; therefore the differences between male and female force maximal force generation are likely due to differential impact on muscle mass. Also, inconsistent with the thesis that NO attenuates muscle function, we found that force frequency curves were unaffected by the loss of nNOS&#x003bc; and the maximum force-generating properties of female muscle were unaffected by the loss of nNOS. In our view, the most likely explanation of the conflicting reports of the impact of NO on contractility is provided by the different experimental approaches employed. We used an <italic>in situ</italic> approach where the TA muscle is kept in the most physiologically relevant environment possible, within normal physiological temperature range, with intact motor neuron innervation and vasculature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Dellorusso1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This is very important for evaluating nNOS&#x003bc; function in muscle due to its known vasoregulatory role. We also circumvented the limitations of pharmacological inhibition of NOS by using the KN1 mouse to specifically inactivate nNOS. Our view is supported by a recent study questioning the physiological relevance of studies designed to address the role of NO in muscle contraction that were conducted on excised muscles in physiological baths <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Eu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. It was reported that regulation of muscle contractile function by nNOS&#x003bc; depended dramatically on oxygen concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Eu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. At non-physiological oxygen concentrations, such as those found in excised <italic>in vitro</italic> muscle preparations, NO inhibited muscle contractility. Conversely, at low physiological oxygen tensions resembling those found in muscle tissue, NO increased the force-generating capacity of skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Eu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Our finding that nNOS deficiency results in force loss <italic>in situ</italic> is consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> studies performed under physiological oxygen conditions. Therefore, our <italic>in situ</italic> methods presumably maintain more physiologically relevant concentrations of oxygen in muscle tissue. In summary, these data suggest that nNOS-derived NO is necessary for maximal force-generating capacity of muscle <italic>in vivo</italic> and that nNOS plays an important role in the contractile performance of skeletal muscle. Furthermore, these results are consistent with a role of both oxygen and NO in coordinated regulation of the force-generating capacity of skeletal muscle.</p><p>The impact of nNOS-deficiency on muscle contractility has implications for two classes of muscle disease: metabolic myopathies and muscular dystrophies. Skeletal muscle fatigue is a common cause of weakness in human myopathies that result from congenital defects in energy metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Haller1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. These muscle diseases often elude diagnosis since symptoms occur predominantly or exclusively during exercise. Often symptoms are simply attributed to a lack of fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Haller1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the skeletal muscle phenotype of KN1 mice is consistent with that of human metabolic myopathies, the <italic>NOS1</italic> gene may be a novel candidate gene for this class of skeletal muscle disease. The deficiencies in nNOS&#x003bc;-deficient skeletal muscle are also especially relevant to two types of muscular dystrophy, dystrophinopathies (DMD and BMD) and sarcoglycanopathies (LGMD 2C, LGMD 2D and LGMD 2E), two genetically distinct classes of muscular dystrophy where skeletal muscle nNOS&#x003bc; expression and localization is dysregulated as a secondary consequence of the disruption of the DAG complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Brenman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Chao1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Crosbie1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Chang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. nNOS&#x003bc; protein expression is undetectable in cytoplasmic or plasma membrane fractions from DMD patient biopsies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Chang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our data suggest that specific characteristics of dystrophic pathology, including the inability to maintain muscle bulk, inherent muscle weakness and susceptibility to fatigue may be attributable, at least in part, to defects in nNOS signaling. Our data also raise the intriguing possibility that loss of nNOS&#x003bc; is more detrimental to muscle function in male patients than in female patients.</p><p>The pervasive inherent weakness of dystrophin-deficient muscle is due to both increased susceptibility to injury by lengthening contraction and fatigue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Gregorevic1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Watchko1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, in the case of gene therapy of DMD, this is not currently possible because dystrophin is too large to be packaged into adeno-associated viral vectors. This has led to replacement strategies that involve viral vector-mediated delivery of truncated &#x0201c;designer dystrophin&#x0201d; constructs in DMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Odom1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although the substantial improvement of dystrophic muscle function by mini- and micro-dystrophin suggests a minor role for nNOS in <italic>mdx</italic> pathology; the evaluation of fatigue is rarely, if ever, assayed in treated muscles despite reports of fatigue in both mice and patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Gregorevic1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003387-Matecki1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>mdx</italic> mice exhibit increased muscle mass, in contrast to Duchenne patients who suffer progressive loss of muscle mass. The present study suggests that the ability to restore nNOS&#x003bc; would likely confer additional important functionality to the designer dystrophins.

This approach allows for measurement of contractile properties without removing the muscle from its natural environment, thereby maintaining normal vasoregulation and innervation. Eight week old mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of 2,2,2, tribromoethanol (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Mouse hindlimbs were shaved and the distal TA tendon of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was surgically isolated via a skin incision on the anterior surface of the lower hindlimb. The mouse was positioned on a 37&#x000b0;C heated platform in order to restrain the knee joint and the distal tendon was attached to the lever arm of a servomotor (Model 305B-LR, Aurora Scientific, ON, Canada). The exposed surface of the muscle was kept moist by frequent application of prewarmed isotonic saline. The TA muscle was stimulated by electrical trigger of the peroneal nerve using two needle electrodes. The muscle was adjusted to an optimum length (L<sub>o</sub>) that produced the maximum twitch force (<italic>P</italic><sub>t</sub>). Then, the time to reach peak tension (TPT) during the contraction phase of the twitch, and the half-relaxation time (HRT), the time between maximum and half-maximum force during the relaxation phase of the twitch were recorded. While held at L<sub>o</sub> the TA was stimulated every two minutes at increasing frequencies (5 to 200 Hz) to generate force-frequency curves. Maximal tetanic force (P<sub>o</sub>) generation was typically achieved at 200 Hz. After the completion of testing, both L<sub>o</sub> and TA mass were recorded and used to normalize P<sub>t</sub> and P<sub>o</sub> for TA muscle size and calculate specific twitch (sP<sub>t</sub>) or specific tetanic (sP<sub>o</sub>) force.
