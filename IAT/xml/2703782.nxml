While insulin and Akt signaling have been found previously to be essential for adipogenesis, the relative importance of their many downstream branches have not been defined. One direct substrate that is inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation is the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) protein, which associates with TSC1 and acts as a critical negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). Loss of function of the TSC1-TSC2 complex results in constitutive mTORC1 signaling and, through mTORC1-dependent feedback mechanisms and loss of mTORC2 activity, leads to a concomitant block of Akt signaling to its other downstream targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We find that, despite severe insulin resistance and the absence of Akt signaling, TSC2-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes display enhanced adipocyte differentiation that is dependent on the elevated mTORC1 activity in these cells. Activation of mTORC1 causes a robust increase in the mRNA and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x003b3;), which is the master transcriptional regulator of adipocyte differentiation. In examining the requirements for different Akt-mediated phosphorylation sites on TSC2, we find that only TSC2 mutants lacking all five previously identified Akt sites fully block insulin-stimulated mTORC1 signaling in reconstituted <italic>Tsc2</italic> null cells, and this mutant also inhibits adipogenesis. Finally, renal angiomyolipomas from patients with tuberous sclerosis complex contain both adipose and smooth muscle-like components with activated mTORC1 signaling and elevated PPAR&#x003b3; expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study demonstrates that activation of mTORC1 signaling is a critical step in adipocyte differentiation and identifies TSC2 as a primary target of Akt driving this process. Therefore, the TSC1-TSC2 complex regulates the differentiation of mesenchymal cell lineages, at least in part, through its control of mTORC1 activity and PPAR&#x003b3; expression.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ser/thr kinase Akt (or protein kinase B/PKB) plays an essential role in adipocyte differentiation.

While it is clear from these studies that Akt is both necessary and sufficient to drive adipogenesis, its downstream targets involved in regulating this differentiation program are not well understood.</p><p>Akt phosphorylates and regulates a large number of substrates involved in a diverse array of biological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Manning1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, many of which could contribute to the role of Akt in driving adipocyte differentiation. Ultimately, the differentiation defect in MEFs and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes lacking Akt1 stems from an inability to induce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) expression at the initiation of the adipogenesis program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Peng1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Baudry1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Xu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The PPAR&#x003b3; transcription factor is the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, and like Akt1, its activation is both necessary and sufficient for differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Rosen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Supporting an essential role for PPAR&#x003b3; induction downstream of Akt1, forced expression of PPAR&#x003b3; in Akt-deficient MEFs was found to rescue their severe adipogenesis defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Peng1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>At least two downstream branches of Akt signaling have been implicated in the regulation of PPAR&#x003b3; expression and adipocyte differentiation. The forkhead box O (FOXO) family of transcription factors are phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt. Amongst FOXO family members, FOXO1 expression is highest in adipose tissue, but FOXO1 appears to be a strong inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Nakae1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. An active mutant of FOXO1 that cannot be phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt was found to block the differentiation of preadipocytes, and this correlated with a loss of PPAR&#x003b3; induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Nakae1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, FOXO1 has been proposed to directly repress PPAR&#x003b3; transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Armoni1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these studies suggest that Akt-mediated inhibition of FOXO1 is one mechanism by which Akt induces PPAR&#x003b3; and subsequent adipocyte differentiation.</p><p>Another major signaling branch downstream of Akt results in activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a critical regulator of mRNA translation and cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Wullschleger1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Primarily through use of the mTOR-specific inhibitor rapamycin, several studies have concluded that mTOR activity is required for proper differentiation of preadipocyte cell lines and primary cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Bell1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Yeh1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The effects of rapamycin were found to correlate with a reduction in PPAR&#x003b3; mRNA and protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Cho1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Kim1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, mouse knockouts affecting specific mTORC1 targets suggest that both S6K1 activation and 4E-BP1/2 inhibition might contribute to a pro-adipogenic role for mTORC1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Um1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-LeBacquer1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The signaling relationship between Akt and mTOR is quite complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Bhaskar1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Huang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Akt activity results in downstream activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which is acutely sensitive to rapamycin. Akt has been proposed to activate mTORC1 through multiple mechanisms. The first is through direct multi-site phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Inoki1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Manning2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. TSC2, when complexed with its binding partner TSC1, acts as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for the Ras-related small G protein Rheb, which is a potent activator of mTORC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Garami1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Zhang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 relieves its ability to act as a GAP for Rheb within cells, allowing Rheb-GTP to accumulate and activate mTORC1. A parallel mechanism appears to be through phosphorylation of the Akt substrate PRAS40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Kovacina1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. PRAS40 has been found by several groups to associate with mTORC1, either as a regulatory component or downstream substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Sancak1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Wang2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Two studies have demonstrated that the previously characterized Akt phosphorylation site on PRAS40 is involved in mTORC1 activation by Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Sancak1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-VanderHaar1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, a more indirect and less acute effect of Akt activation on mTORC1 has been proposed to be through the effects of Akt on glucose uptake, intracellular energy levels, and AMPK activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-HahnWindgassen1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, while mTORC1 is clearly downstream of Akt, its activation can lead to feedback inhibition of insulin signaling to Akt through effects on the insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Harrington1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>). Therefore, as originally characterized in 3T3-L1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Li1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Berg1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, short-term rapamycin treatment can increase Akt activation in response to insulin in adipocytes and many other cell types.</p><p>A second mTOR-containing protein complex, mTORC2, lies upstream of Akt and contributes to Akt activation by insulin and growth factors by phosphorylating S473 in its hydrophobic regulatory motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Sarbassov1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. mTORC2 is resistant to the acute effects of rapamycin, but prolonged treatment with rapamycin disrupts mTORC2 and in some lines results in loss of Akt phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Sarbassov2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. To this end, prolonged rapamycin treatment has been found to block Akt signaling in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Cho1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that some of the previous findings regarding the effects of rapamycin treatment on adipocyte differentiation could be through loss of mTORC2-mediated Akt activation, rather than inhibition of mTORC1. However, a recent study using siRNAs to the mTORC1-specific component Raptor have supported a role for mTORC1 in adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Polak1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic> are tumor suppressor genes that are mutated in the autosomal dominant tumor syndrome tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is characterized by widespread benign tumors and a high incidence of epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, and cognitive deficits (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Crino1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>). <italic>TSC2</italic> mutations are also the underlying cause of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Carsillo1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>), a proliferative disorder that almost exclusively affects women and results in cystic destruction of the lungs. Due to loss of function of the TSC1-TSC2 complex and its GAP activity toward Rheb, lesions from TSC and LAM patients display constitutively elevated mTORC1 signaling. Interestingly, renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs), which are unusual highly vascular tumors comprised of both aberrant smooth muscle cells and adipocytes, are amongst the most common clinical manifestation of the TSC and LAM diseases. Within AMLs, both the smooth muscle and adipose components display loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the <italic>TSC2</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Karbowniczek1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, demonstrating that both cell types are constituents of the tumor rather than stromal derivatives.

Briefly, slides were deparaffinized and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 3&#x00025; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min at room temperature. For antigen retrieval, sections were heated in a pressure cooker in 10-mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) prior to staining. Antibodies to phospho-S6 (Ser235/236; Cell Signaling Technology #2211; 1&#x02236;200 dilution) and PPAR&#x003b3; (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #7196; 1&#x02236;100 dilution) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were applied and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Negative controls included adjacent sections incubated in PBS without primary antibody. Immunodetection was performed with an LSAB 2 system (DAKO). Hematoxylin was used as a counterstain, and an adjacent section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Results are expressed as the mean&#x000b1;SEM.

As a gain of function model for mTORC1, this study with TSC1/2-deficient MEFs and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes provides critical support to previous studies suggesting involvement of mTOR signaling in PPAR&#x003b3;-driven adipocyte differentiation, which used rapamycin alone to establish this link <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Cho1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Kim1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Through the stable reconstitution of <italic>Tsc2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> MEFs with wild-type and mutant <italic>TSC2</italic>, we find a critical role for the vertebrate-specific sites on TSC2, in addition to those conserved back to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While the TSC2<sup>S939A/T1462A</sup> (TSC2-2A) mutant lead to partial attenuation of mTORC1 signaling, expression of the TSC2<sup>S939A/S981A/S1130A/S1132A/T1462A</sup> (TSC2-5A) mutant resulted in a complete block in the ability of insulin to stimulate mTORC1 signaling events. Importantly, both wild-type TSC2 and the phosphorylation-site mutants were equally efficient at restoring insulin-stimulated Akt signaling to these cells. Therefore, while it is likely that multiple mechanisms exist for Akt to activate mTORC1 signaling, our studies demonstrate that multi-site phosphorylation of TSC2 is essential for this regulation in MEFs. In support of a role for Akt-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 in promoting adipocyte differentiation, MEFs reconstituted with the TSC2-5A mutant were severely blunted in their ability to take on an adipocyte morphology and accumulate intracellular triglycerides relative to those reconstituted with wild-type TSC2. The fact that some basal differentiation still occurs in these cells, where mTORC1 signaling is blocked, suggests that reactivation of IRS-1/Akt signaling upon TSC2 reconstitution in this setting might provide an mTORC1-independent input into adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, while our study demonstrates a critical role for the Akt-TSC2-mTORC1 signaling pathway in this process, it is likely that other branches of Akt signaling, such as FOXO1 phosphorylation and inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Nakae1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, play additional and, perhaps, partially redundant roles in promoting adipogenesis.</p><p>Our study demonstrates close ties between mTORC1 activation and inhibition and corresponding increases and decreases in both mRNA and protein levels of the adipogenic transcription factor PPAR&#x003b3;, which is both necessary and sufficient for adipocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Rosen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms by which signaling pathways regulate PPAR&#x003b3; levels are poorly understood.

The data presented here demonstrate that mTORC1 activation is sufficient to increase PPAR&#x003b3; expression, even in the absence of other signaling inputs from Akt. We have also examined the mRNA and protein levels of the other known adipogenic transcription factors, which can regulate <italic>Pparg</italic> expression. We have detected an increase in C/EBP&#x003b1; transcript levels in TSC-deficient adipocytes, but unlike PPAR&#x003b3;, we have not detected an increase in C/EBP&#x003b1; protein levels.

In these patient populations, AMLs can grow to sizes greater than the kidney and occupy large areas of the body cavity.

The prevailing model for the origins of this tumor is that a mesenchymal precursor cell undergoes a second genetic hit at one of the TSC loci, rendering the cell defective for TSC1-TSC2 complex function and, thereby, activating mTORC1. Following increased growth and proliferation, the progeny of this cell aberrantly differentiate into these mesenchymal cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006189-Crino1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. It seems likely that the mTORC1-dependent increase in PPAR&#x003b3; expression described in this study could account for the abundance of adipocytes in the majority of AMLs from these patients. To this end, we find that both the adipocytes and smooth muscle-like cells in TSC-associated AMLs express high levels of nuclear PPAR&#x003b3;. The somewhat surprising expression of PPAR&#x003b3; in the smooth muscle-like cells suggests that either this transcription factor is also involved in the differentiation of this cell type or that, perhaps, the adipose component of the AML is derived from the smooth muscle through a PPAR&#x003b3;-driven transdifferentiation process. With respect to therapeutics, our findings suggest that PPAR&#x003b3; agonists, such as the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone, might futher stimulate the putative TSC-deficient precursor cells to differentiate and, therefore, limit their capacity to proliferate and/or migrate.</p><p>This study adds adipogenesis to the increasingly diverse array of processes to which mTORC1 activity has been attributed. It is clear that the consequences of mTORC1 activation vary significantly in different cell lineages. Therefore, understanding the role of mTORC1 signaling in human development, physiology, and disease requires studies geared toward defining these tissue-specific functions. Such studies are also important to comprehend the systemic effects of mTORC1 inhibitors, which are now being tested as therapeutics for a number of clinical conditions, including TSC and LAM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006189.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Supplemental Materials and Methods</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006189.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006189.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Quantitative RT-PCR primers used in this study.</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006189.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006189.s003"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>MEFs lacking the TSC1-TSC2 complex are defective in Akt signaling.
