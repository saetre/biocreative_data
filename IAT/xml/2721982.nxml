Cumulative evidences indicate that the deregulation of cyclin A<sub>2</sub> is tightly linked to the chromosomal instability, neoplastic transformation and tumor proliferation. Here we report that treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562 cells with doxorubicin results in an accumulation of cyclin A<sub>2</sub> and follows by induction of apoptotic cell death. To investigate the potential preclinical relevance, K562 cells were transiently transfected with the siRNA targeting cyclin A<sub>2</sub> by functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes. Knocking down the expression of cyclin A<sub>2</sub> in K562 cells suppressed doxorubicin-induced growth arrest and cell apoptosis. Upon administration with doxorubicin, K562 cells with reduced cyclin A<sub>2</sub> showed a significant decrease in erythroid differentiation, and a small fraction of cells were differentiated along megakaryocytic and monocyte-macrophage pathways. The results demonstrate the pro-apoptotic role of cyclin A<sub>2</sub> and suggest that cyclin A<sub>2</sub> is a key regulator of cell differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that knocking down expression of one gene switches differentiation pathways of human myeloid leukemia K562 cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor cells are characterized by deregulation of cell cycle checkpoints, leading to uncontrolled cell division and proliferation under conditions where non-transformed cells cannot enter and pass through the cell cycle.

K562 cells with reduced cyclin A<sub>2</sub> showed a significant decrease in growth suppression, apoptosis and erythroid differentiation, and were differentiated along megakaryocytic and macrophage-monocytic pathways upon administration with DOX. These findings indicate a positive correlation between cyclin A<sub>2</sub> and apoptosis induced by DOX and suggest that cyclin A<sub>2</sub> is a key regulator of cell differentiation, supporting the notion that cyclin A<sub>2</sub> is an important regulator for cell cycle as well as for cell apoptosis and differentiation.
