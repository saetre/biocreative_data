It has been shown that the oestrogen receptor &#x003b1; (<italic>ESR1</italic>) gene can also be silenced by DNA methylation. In this study, we used methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to analyse the methylation status in two regions of the <italic>CXCL12 </italic>promoter and <italic>ESR1 </italic>in tumour cell lines and in primary breast tumour samples, and correlated our results with clinicopathological data.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>First, we analysed <italic>CXCL12 </italic>expression in breast tumour cell lines by RT-PCR. We also used 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) treatment and DNA bisulphite sequencing to study the promoter methylation for a specific region of <italic>CXCL12 </italic>in breast tumour cell lines. We evaluated <italic>CXCL12 </italic>and <italic>ESR1 </italic>methylation in primary tumour samples by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Finally, promoter hypermethylation of these genes was analysed using Fisher's exact test and correlated with clinicopathological data using the Chi square test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>CXCL12 </italic>promoter hypermethylation in the first region (island 2) and second region (island 4) was correlated with lack of expression of the gene in tumour cell lines. In the primary tumours, island 2 was hypermethylated in 14.5% of the samples and island 4 was hypermethylated in 54% of the samples. The <italic>ESR1 </italic>promoter was hypermethylated in 41% of breast tumour samples. In addition, the levels of ER&#x003b1; protein expression diminished with increased frequency of <italic>ESR1 </italic>methylation (p &#x0003c; 0.0001). This study also demonstrated that <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 and <italic>ESR1 </italic>methylation occur simultaneously at a high frequency (p = 0.0220).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first study showing a simultaneous involvement of epigenetic regulation for both <italic>CXCL12 </italic>and <italic>ESR1 </italic>genes in Brazilian women. The methylation status of both genes was significantly correlated with histologically advanced disease, the presence of metastases and death. Therefore, the methylation pattern of these genes could be used as a molecular marker for the prediction of breast cancer outcome.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Breast cancer development and progression is influenced by intrinsic properties of the tumour cells, as well as by macro-environmental factors. There is an extensive interplay between tumour cells and signalling molecules such as chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Chemokine receptors and growth factors have been extensively implicated in the metastatic process of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A chemokine-mediated process of tumour cell homing to specific metastatic sites requires an enrichment in the site of metastasis formation for specific chemokines; these chemokines are then able to induce the migration of tumour cells that express the corresponding receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. CXCL12, formerly known as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1&#x003b1;), is a CXC subfamily of chemokines that is expressed by stromal cells, including fibroblasts and endothelial cells. CXCL12 is also known to be present in the organs that are target for metastasis in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>In cancer cells, gene expression is commonly altered due to a combination of genetic and epigenetic events. Aberrant gene silencing in mammalian cells is associated with promoter methylation, and it is known that many regions of the genome are methylated at one or more CpG sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recent studies have also demonstrated that the <italic>CXCL12 </italic>gene modulates metastatic potential in breast and colon carcinomas, where it controls its own regulation in an autocrine loop. Epigenetic silencing causes the loss of autocrine expression and results in an imbalance in the expression levels of CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Sixty percent of primary breast tumours are ER&#x003b1;-positive, and two-thirds of advanced breast tumours respond to therapy with anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen (Novaldex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, a fraction of tumours that are ER&#x003b1;-positive at diagnosis subsequently lose ER&#x003b1; expression during the progression of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Hypermethylation of the oestrogen receptor &#x003b1; gene (<italic>ESR1</italic>) is a common occurrence in several specific populations and for workers in a number of occupations; it seems to be a relevant factor for hormonal treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the methylation patterns of <italic>ESR1 </italic>and two CpG islands in the <italic>CXCL12 </italic>gene in breast tumour samples from Brazilian women. This is the first study to report an association between simultaneous DNA methylation of these two genes compared to other prognostic factors in breast cancer among Brazilian women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Lines</title><p>Breast tumour cell lines were all obtained from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, (S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil).

The study included only female patients with invasive breast tumours. All patients gave informed consent for the study to retain and analyse their tissue for research purposes. The ages of the patients ranged from 27 to 84 years (mean 57.8 &#x000b1; 14.7). Histological types were either infiltrative ductal carcinoma (IDC) (n = 51, 73.9%) or infiltrative lobular carcinoma (ILC) (n = 18, 26.1%). The lymph node status of the patients was positive (n = 35, 51.5%) or negative (n = 33, 48.5%). Histologic grade was determined according to the modified Bloom-Richardson criteria. Of the patients, 27.6% were Grade I, 47.8% were Grade II and 24.6% were Grade III. TNM staging was done according to official classification methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] used twenty normal samples and all of them showed <italic>CXCL12 </italic>expression without methylation, which is in agreement with a possible tumoral methylation specificity observed in our results.</p></sec><sec><title>MSP analysis in primary breast tumours</title><p>The MSP assay was subsequently used to analyse primary breast tumour samples. All samples showed the band corresponding to the unmethylated state for islands 2 and 4 (data not shown). Based on these results, we can conclude that the samples have cellular heterogeneity due to the presence of normal tissue or infiltrating lymphocytes.</p><p>For the methylated condition, nine representative tumour samples are shown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Of all the samples tested (69), only four were methylated at both islands, and three of these samples methylated at both genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Moreover eighteen samples were methylated in both, <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 and <italic>ESR1 </italic>genes (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0220). This finding indicates a strong correlation between the promoter methylation of <italic>ESR1 </italic>and <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4. In other words, methylation of the <italic>ESR1 </italic>promoter could be involved in directing the methylation of island 4 (see more details in discussion).</p><p>We also wanted to confirm that the presence or absence of island 2 or island 4 methylation observed in MSP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) was not just a PCR artefact. Therefore, we sequenced island 4 isolated from tumour samples 1, 3 and 8 (representative for banding pattern). Island 4 displayed 6% methylation in samples 1 and 3, and 89% methylation in sample 8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These results are in agreement with the PCR bands observed in the MSP.</p></sec><sec><title>The correlation between CXCL12 and ESR1 promoter methylation status with patient clinicopathological data</title><p>The correlation between the CpG islands of <italic>CXCL12 </italic>and <italic>ESR1 </italic>methylation and the clinicopathological parameters of our samples are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. For island 2, <italic>CXCL12 </italic>methylation was observed in ten of 69 (14.5%) samples and was not significantly associated with any clinicopathological data (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1a</xref>). For island 4, <italic>CXCL12 </italic>methylation was observed in 37 of 69 (54%) samples. The clinicopathological parameters are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1b</xref> and hypermethylation in this region was significantly associated with histological grade SBR (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0180), metastasis (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0008) and death (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0019). These results suggested that CpG island 4 might be important as a factor for poor prognosis of disease. In order to test this hypothesis we evaluated all of the clinicopathological data for their prognostic value in a univariate analysis for overall survival (OS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) using Kaplan-Meier analysis (<italic>p </italic>value for log rank test). The overall survival (OS) was significantly worse for many clinicopathological parameters, which are shown in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. The graphical results for OS and MFS are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> for <italic>ESR1 </italic>and <italic>CXCL12</italic>. The OS correlated with <italic>ESR1 </italic>(<italic>p </italic>= 0.0009) and <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0071) methylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> respectively). The metastasis-free survival correlated with <italic>ESR1 </italic>and <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 (for both, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, respectively). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the overall survival and metastasis-free survival were significantly shorter when silencing of <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 and <italic>ESR1 </italic>occurred by gene hypermethylation. The effects of the covariables on OS and MFS were examined in the Cox proportional hazard regression model. The results for the univariate analysis are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. In the multivariate analysis, all variables presenting <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.2 from the univariate analysis were selected to build the multiple model (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). For overall survival, the presence of metastasis (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0022) was considered a prognostic factor and <italic>ESR1 </italic>hypermethylation showed a statistical trend (<italic>p = </italic>0.0555). Besides ER&#x003b1;, the hypermethylation of <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 and <italic>ESR1 </italic>genes (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0302, <italic>p = </italic>0.0089 and <italic>p </italic>= 0.0046, respectively) was considered an independent prognostic factor for metastasis-free survival. Patients with ER&#x003b1; protein present had the lowest risk of metastasis development (HR 0.3343; 95% CI 0.1247-0.8963). Otherwise, patients with methylation at both <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 and <italic>ESR1 </italic>genes had a risk of developing metastasis, with <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 having the highest risk (HR 7.1355;

Extensive interplay exists between the tumour cells and signalling molecules such as chemokines. Muller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] showed that cancer metastasis is a non-random process; organ selectivity by the tumour cells is largely determined by factors that are expressed in remote organs that eventually turn into preferred sites of metastases. Many reports have demonstrated that chemokines are essential factors for the invasion and survival of tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, many other factors, such as the microenvironment of the breast cancer cells and genetic and epigenetic alterations, might be involved. Epigenetic events in tumours cells have the ability to modulate gene expression and the role of epigenetic alterations in cancer progression has been the focus of increasing interest in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we assessed the epigenetic regulation of the <italic>CXCL12 </italic>and <italic>ESR1</italic>genes in breast cancer samples from Brazilian women. The regulation of <italic>CXCL12 </italic>expression by promoter hypermethylation is common in colon carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and breast cancer, suggesting that tumour cells that silence <italic>CXCL12 </italic>are at a selective advantage for metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In another recent study, positive correlations between <italic>CXCL12 </italic>hypermethylation and ER&#x003b1;-negative status were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. One of our objectives was to verify in our samples the methylation findings obtained in other female populations. We evaluated two CpG islands of the <italic>CXCL12 </italic>gene. The first (island 2) was hypermethylated in ten of 69 (14.5%) tumour samples. This region had already been analysed by another group that found DNA methylation in five of 15 (33.3%) American breast cancer samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] with patient samples from a Chinese population, it was verified that 33 of 63 (52.4%) tumour samples were hypermethylated in the same region. These different results might be due to population or environmental differences. The results for island 2 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1a</xref>) showed that no statistical significance was identified for any of the variables. We still do not know if different populations might possess promoter regions that are variable due to SNPs or other mechanisms that can switch genes off.</p><p>We have also analysed the <italic>CXCL12 </italic>5' upstream transcription region in more detail and found a second CpG island we refer to here as island 4, which is near a DNA consensus site for transcriptional activation. Island 4 is located 565 bps from the region studied by Garcia-Moruja et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and we speculate that this region is important for transcriptional regulation. However, Antequera and Bird [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] argue that the importance of CpG islands situated near the TSS is not always obvious, and that new transcripts beginning in CpG islands distant from the main promoter have been found. Island 4 is located 19 bps away from a 5" oestrogen responsive element (ERE) binding site. No data exist to prove that these ERE consensus sequences could be functional. However, Lin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] demonstrated discernable differences between functional and non-functional ERE sites (1234 sites were found) and the <italic>CXCL12 </italic>gene was one of the oestrogen-responsive genes identified in microarray experiments. Other studies have demonstrated that <italic>CXCL12 </italic>might be a target for oestrogen receptor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We have concluded that the ERE proximal to island 4 could be involved in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>CXCL12</italic>. This interaction was modelled by Hall and Korack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], who suggested that oestrogen activates <italic>CXCL12 </italic>expression. In this model, CXCL12 binds to the cell surface receptor, CXCR4, in a potentially autocrine and/or paracrine (MAPK cascade) manner, resulting in the activation of cell proliferation.</p><p>The MSP results for island 4 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1b</xref>) showed a statistical correlation with three variables related to metastasis, reinforcing a probable role for island 4 in the metastatic process. From these variables, we highlight the correlation of island 4 hypermethylation with <italic>ESR1 </italic>silencing (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1c</xref>). In order to study this probable correlation, Kaplan-Meier and Cox analyses were performed. These analyses confirm that the silencing of both <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 and <italic>ESR1 </italic>genes by DNA hypermethylation and probably the absence of ER&#x003b1;, are prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><p>The results showed that <italic>ESR1 </italic>promoter methylation occurred at a higher frequency in samples with methylated <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 than in samples with methylated island 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In addition, previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] reported that the <italic>ESR1 </italic>gene possesses a hypermethylated promoter region. This might explain the correlation found in this study between the hypermethylation of <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4, but not island 2, and the oestrogen receptor negativity. We speculate that these effects are caused by the proximity of the CpG island to an ERE. Curradi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] observed that the presence of about eight methylated dinucleotides could inhibit transcription because approximately 700 bps of distance is required for chromatin modifications. Therefore, it is possible that the methylation of island 4 could attenuate or even inactivate ERE binding activity.</p><p>On the other hand, several studies have also shown the inverse correlation. The absence of ER&#x003b1; could inactivate target genes that possess an ERE site. It is known that 60% of primary breast tumours are ER&#x003b1;-positive, and two-thirds of the advanced tumours do not respond to therapy with anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen (Novaldex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). However, more than a third of patients do not express ER&#x003b1; at the time of diagnosis, and a fraction of tumours that are positive at the time of diagnosis often lose ER&#x003b1; expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Breast tumour cells in which ER&#x003b1; is absent cannot be regulated by oestrogen, and endocrine therapy is not an option, resulting in a poorer prognosis. Lapidus et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] showed for the first time that <italic>ESR1 </italic>is inactivated by CpG island DNA methylation in cell lines and primary breast tumours. The same group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] also used MSP to show that breast cancers expressing ER&#x003b1; had an unmethylated promoter region. Mirza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] detected 66% and 60% <italic>ESR1 </italic>hypermethylation in Indian and Chinese populations, respectively. Thus, the hypermethylation of ER&#x003b1; is commonly seen in several populations and seems to be relevant to hormonal treatment response. According to this, Leu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] proposed a model suggesting that the progesterone receptor gene (<italic>PGR</italic>) or another hypothetical target containing an ERE consensus site inside the promoter region becomes hypermethylated and silenced by repressor proteins when ER&#x003b1; is not expressed. In other words, <italic>ESR1 </italic>inactivation and the consequent lack of ER&#x003b1; cause all target genes to become susceptible to epigenetic silencing. Apparently, <italic>ESR1 </italic>gene silencing by promoter hypermethylation and the consequent absence or decrease of ER&#x003b1; expression are able to lead to <italic>CXCL12 </italic>gene silencing by hypermethylation.</p><p>Consequently, the absence of CXCL12 signals the cells to form metastasis in tumours with a high tumour grade with negative ER&#x003b1; status, increasing the probability of patient death. We do not yet know if island 4 hypermethylation could be involved in the chromatin alterations associated with the blockage of ER&#x003b1; binding, or if the absence of ER&#x003b1; due to epigenetic silencing can contribute to the hypermethylation of C<italic>XCL12</italic>.</p><p>The results presented here show that epigenetic alterations might play an important role in the downregulation of CXCL12 mRNA in breast cancers in Brazilian women. Our results, together with recent findings, emphasise the importance of the CXCL12/CXCR4 signalling axis in the organ-specific patterns of metastasis. Epigenetic events could regulate other genes involved in the development of breast cancer and could also be used to predict a better prognosis. The results presented here could also be interpreted as a cause of the eventual resistance seen in response to endocrine therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results have shown, for the first time, a correlation between hypermethylation of <italic>CXCL12 </italic>island 4 and <italic>ESR1 </italic>in patients with histologically advanced cancer, the presence of metastases and death. This correlation could be an important factor in prognosis, cancer prevention and treatment of these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EASR, carried out the experimental data acquisition, performed data analyses and interpretation and drafted the manuscript.
