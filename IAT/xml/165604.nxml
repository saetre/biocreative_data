This initial estimate was proven to be incorrect because a comparison of the predicted genes that were identified in public and commercial sequencing projects and inclusion of a third cluster of known genes revealed little overlap among the three groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although many of the discrepancies between the different human genome assemblies are caused by fundamental disparities in the compilation of the sequence information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], it is still evident that the human genome harbors probably significantly more than 40,000 genes and that these genes are not easily identified. This is particularly true for genes that are either expressed transiently, at low levels, or in very few specific cell types. Such elusive genes are underrepresented in cDNA libraries and consequently also in expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. Computational annotation of such genes from genomic DNA becomes additionally challenging when the genes consist of many scattered small exons.</p><p>Two pairs of previously un-notated genes encoding transmembrane proteins have recently been identified based on their linkage with inherited disorders. The first set of genes, transmembrane cochlear expressed genes 1 and 2 (<italic>TMC1</italic>) and <italic>TMC2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] were found in a search for mutations causing dominant and recessive deafness in human and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mutations in the second pair of genes, <italic>EVER1 </italic>and <italic>EVER2</italic>, are linked to epidermodysplasia verruciformis that is associated with an increased susceptibility to infection with some human papillomaviruses causing a high risk of skin carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We noticed that the proteins encoded by these genes are homologous, which raised our interest in testing whether the genome accommodates additional related genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The mammalian TMC gene and protein family</title><p>We used human TMC1 and TMC2, murine Tmc1 and Tmc2, and human EVER1 and EVER2 sequences in conjunction with database search algorithms to identify homologous sequences in genomic and expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. We iteratively assembled contiguous theoretical coding sequences for individual human and mouse proteins. We verified regions of individual murine cDNAs that were not unequivocally predictable with database information by RT-PCR and by sequencing. This strategy resulted in the identification of the murine orthologues of EVER1 and EVER2, and four hitherto uncharacterized human and mouse proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). All identified proteins have eight predicted membrane-spanning domains (TM1 &#x02013; TM8) and share the completely conserved amino acid triplet C (cysteine) &#x02013; W (tryptophan) &#x02013; E (glutamic acid), predicted to be located in the extracellular loop upstream of TM6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Whereas the genome of <italic>Fugu rubripes </italic>is one order of magnitude shorter than the length of the human genome, the total number of genes is estimated to be approximately the same [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Because of the low homology of amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences, we were not able to determine the complete coding sequences of the eight pufferfish TMC proteins unequivocally; nevertheless, we obtained sufficient sequence information of the central parts of the proteins bearing the transmembrane domains to classify the eight pufferfish TMCs into the three subfamilies. This subfamily assignment of individual TMC proteins was further substantiated by an analysis of the degree of conservation of intron positions within the <italic>Fugu rubripes </italic>TMC gene family (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The <italic>Fugu rubripes </italic>genome contains three TMC subfamilyA genes <italic>Tmc2-rs1 </italic>(<italic>Tmc2-related sequence1</italic>), <italic>Tmc2-rs2 </italic>(<italic>Tmc2-related sequence2</italic>), <italic>Tmc3</italic>, three TMC subfamilyB genes <italic>Tmc5, Tmc6-rs1 </italic>(<italic>Tmc6-related sequence1</italic>), <italic>Tmc6-rs2 </italic>(<italic>Tmc6-related sequence2</italic>), and two subfamilyC genes <italic>Tmc4 </italic>and <italic>Tmc7 </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The nomenclature of the pufferfish TMC genes and proteins is derived from the phylogenetic relation of the corresponding sequences with the mammalian TMCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It is interesting that the pufferfish genome lacks orthologues of mammalian TMC1 and TMC8. <italic>Fugu rubripes Tmc5 </italic>and <italic>Tmc7 </italic>are clustered, equivalent to the clustering of their mammalian orthologues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>TMC genes also exist in invertebrates.

We obtained the coding sequences of additional homologues in human and mouse, which form the TMC protein family (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We subdivided the TMC protein family into three subcategories A, B, and C. This subfamily-classification is based on two major observations. First, the sequence homologies among the different TMC protein sequences of individual species' do cluster into three groups (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref>). Second, our analysis of the organization of vertebrate TMC genes implied identical allocation of the individual TMCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of comparative structural predictions of all mammalian TMCs we propose a basic topology of the generic TMC protein with variable intracellular amino- and carboxyl-termini, a conserved core with eight membrane-spanning domains, and some variability in the length of several intra- and extracellular loops (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This prediction further refines the previously published TMC protein features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The structural presumptions for the region flanked by TM6 and TM7 were somewhat ambiguous, despite the region's high conservation among all TMC proteins with a high proportion of apolar amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We hypothesize that it is unlikely that some members of the TMC family display an atypical topology, thus we propose that the lipophilic intracellular loop between TM6 and TM7 bears some flexibility, which may enable this domain to integrate into the inner surface of the phospholipid bilayer or even to pass through the plasmamembrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>The high amino acid sequence conservation of 75&#x02013;96% identity among the individual human and mouse TMC proteins implies that mutations that alter the coding sequence in the corresponding genes are subjected to significant selective pressure; thus advocating that TMC proteins have important cellular roles. Mutations in <italic>TMC1 </italic>are responsible for the autosomal dominant human hearing disorder DFNA36 and for the recessive deafness DFNB7/11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; the corresponding murine gene <italic>Tmc1 </italic>also causes deafness in the mutant mouse strains <italic>Beethoven </italic>(<italic>Bth</italic>) and <italic>deafness </italic>(<italic>dn</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. <italic>Bth</italic>/<italic>Bth </italic>mice display altered potassium currents in early postnatal cochlear hair cells, in particular Ik,n and Ik,f currents appear to be depressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This observation led to the hypothesis that Tmc1 may participate directly or indirectly in regulating the permeability of potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Because of the high level of conservation of the amino acid sequences among the eight mammalian TMC proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>), we speculate that other TMC proteins may as well be modifiers of ion channels or transporters.</p><p>Our assembly of TMC protein sequences allowed us to analyze their phylogenetic relationships (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Because our analysis did not reveal any TMC genes in yeast and plants, we conclude that TMC proteins are a specific trait of animals. The <italic>C. elegans </italic>genome harbors two genes encoding presumptive TMC subfamily A-like proteins, both of which branch off close to the center of the phylogenetic tree, which may indicate similarity with the primordial TMC protein sequence. It is interesting that some of the intron locations of the two <italic>C. elegans </italic>genes are conserved when compared with vertebrate TMC genes, in particular with the TMC subfamily A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>).</p><p>It is likely that the TMC family has diversified into three subfamilies before the <italic>Protostomia </italic>and the <italic>Deuterostomia </italic>diverged because the genome of the mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae </italic>contains one putative member of each TMC subfamily. Interesting in this regard is that the fruit fly's genome only has a single TMC subfamily A-like gene. The vertebrate TMC gene family is diversified, with each subfamily represented by multiple members.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The recently identified genes encoding the cochlear transcripts for TMC1 and TMC2, and encoding the proteins EVER1 and EVER2, belong to a novel gene family that is conserved in animals. The TMC protein family has eight members in vertebrates and forms three subfamilies, A, B, and C. TMCs are proteins with a conserved core of eight membrane-spanning domains. Most murine TMC genes are widely expressed at relatively low transcription levels; some TMC genes, however, display more restricted expression patterns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Database-aided and experimental assessment of TMC cDNA and protein sequences</title><p>We created and continuously refined contigs of members of novel TMC cDNAs by aligning fragmented sequence information obtained from public and commercial EST databases (GenBank/NCBI &#x02013; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>, Celera Discovery System &#x02013; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.celeradiscoverysystem.com"/>). We started this procedure by using sequence fragments homologous to the known mammalian TMC proteins. Individual fragments were assembled to longer contigs using multiple alignment tools such as ClustalW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]<italic>&#x000a0;</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.es.embnet.org/Doc/phylodendron/clustal-form.html"/> or Multalin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]&#x000a0;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/multalin.html"/>. Our sequence determination was continuously refined with the results of repeated BlastN and tBlastN database searches with the updated contigs, and finally we extended our search by using genomic databases. The majority of Blast searches were conducted with the default parameter settings. With this strategy were able to generate presumptive "framework" contigs for the in databases less abundantly represented TMC genes. Because of the inter-species conservation of protein-coding sequences we were able to predict the presumptive DNA sequence encoding amino- and carboxyl-termini of various TMC proteins by comparing human and murine genomic TMC sequence.</p><p>We constantly refined individual TMC sequences by using genomic sequence information and comparing gene structures. In addition to iterative database searches, we also took into account the results of gene prediction algorithms using genomic DNA harboring TMC genes as inputs (GeneScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], GenomeScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]&#x000a0;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genes.mit.edu"/>). Some invertebrate TMC genes were already annotated as hypothetical proteins. We used human and murine genome databases (GenBank/NCBI &#x02013; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>) to determine the chromosomal locations of all mammalian TMC genes.</p><p>In a second phase, we used polymerase chain reaction and 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments to obtain experimental proof for our cDNA predictions and to determine murine TMC sequence that was only ambiguously predicted.</p><p>Secondary structure predictions were done with PSORTII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]&#x000a0;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp"/>. The phylogenetic distances between various TMC protein sequences were calculated with ClustalW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]&#x000a0;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.es.embnet.org/Doc/phylodendron/clustal-form.html"/> and the resulting distance matrix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1 (A)</xref> was visualized as a tree diagram with centered node position using the Phylodendron phylogenetic tree printer available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/treeapp"/>.</p><p>Evolutionary distance between two gene structures was defined as the reciprocal of the ratio of conserved intron locations with respect to the coding sequences of the TMC genes. The distances were determined for each pair of murine TMC genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref> (B)). We compared the relationship of the TMC gene structures by performing cluster analysis of distances using the kitsch algorithm of the PHYLIP Phylogeny Inference Package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]&#x000a0;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/phylogeny/intro-uk.html"/>. The results of the cluster analysis were visualized as a tree diagram with centred node position using the Phylodendron phylogenetic tree printer.</p><p>Accession numbers for all TMC cDNAs reported in this paper are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>mRNA expression analysis</title><p>Organs we dissected from eight-week-old mice and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Specifically, we used cortex, cerebellum, eye, cochlea, pituitary gland, salivary gland, small intestine, colon, lung, thymus, liver, kidney, heart, urinary bladder, testis, prostate, and ovary. We also used in a control experiment aimed to verify Tmc2 expression in the cochlea, plasmid DNA obtained from an organ of Corti cDNA library that was kindly provided by Dr. B. Kachar, NIDCD/NIH. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini and Midi kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For RT-PCR, 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One tenth of the resulting cDNA was used as template for each PCR amplification with primers specific for each member of the TMC gene family (Tmc1: 5'-GAAACAATGGTGGGGCAGGAA and 5'-GATGGCGGGAGGGAGACGAT, Tmc2: 5'-CCCCGGCCACCACCACAC and 5'-GAAGGGGCCACAGTCAAACGAG, Tmc3: 5'-TCTGGACAAAGTGAACAGCATG and 5'-GAACATTGAATGCTGGCAGACA, Tmc5: 5'-GGGCGGGTTATTTTGGGGACAC and 5'-ACAACAAAGGGCAGCAACAACACC, Tmc6: 5'-CTATCACTGGCTGGGCCGCAGG and 5'-GCAGCCGGAGAATCTGTACTGC, Tmc4: 5'-GTGGAGTCAGATCACGTGTGGG and 5'-CAGGCAGAACAGTATGAGGAAC, Tmc7: 5'-GGGCTCCAAGATCACATCCTGT and 5'-CGAATTTCAAGGTGGCAATGGC, and Tmc8: 5'-GGGTCAGACGGTGCTGTGCATA and 5'-AGAGGAAGACACTGTTGAGTAG). Care was taken to select primer pairs that amplify TMC transcripts encoded in multiple exons to rule out the amplification of genomic DNA contamination. Specific products obtained with each primer pair from various organs and in several independent experiments were verified by sequencing. To estimate the quality of the template and to compare expression levels, we amplified mouse glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a ubiquitously expressed abundant transcript with specific primers (5'-AACGGGAAGCCCATCACC and 5'-CAGCCTTGGCAGCACCA). Cycling parameters were 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min, 8 cycles of (94&#x000b0;C20 s, 60&#x000b0;C20 s -1&#x000b0;C/cycle, 68&#x000b0;C45 s), followed by 17, 24 or 34 additional cycles of (94&#x000b0;C30 s, 52&#x000b0;C30 s, 68&#x000b0;C45 s) and 68&#x000b0;C for 5 min.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KG carried out iterative database searches to identify mammalian members of the TMC family, he did PCR and RACE experiments to obtain TMC cDNA sequence, and he performed part of the transcript expression analysis.
