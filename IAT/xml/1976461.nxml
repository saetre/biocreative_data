Sister chromatid cohesion is important for not only faithful chromosome segregation but also for proper DSB repair. During DSB repair, the Smc1&#x02013;Smc3 cohesin complex is loaded onto chromatin around the DSB to support recombination-mediated DSB repair. In this study, we investigated whether Ctf18, a factor implicated in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion, is involved in DSB repair in budding yeast. Ctf18 was recruited to HO-endonuclease induced DSB sites in an Mre11-dependent manner and to damaged chromatin in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase-arrested cells. The <italic>ctf18</italic> mutant cells showed high sensitivity to DSB-inducible genotoxic agents and defects in DSB repair, as well as defects in damage-induced recombination between sister chromatids and between homologous chromosomes. These results suggest that Ctf18 is involved in damage-induced homologous recombination.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA double-strand break (DSB) is probably the most dangerous type of DNA damage among the various types of DNA damage that can affect a cell. They are formed by exogenous agents, such as ionizing radiation (IR) and certain chemotherapeutic drugs and by endogenously generated reactive oxygen species and chromosomal stress. The inability to respond properly to DNA DSBs and repair the damage may lead to genomic instability, which in turn may either lead to cell death or increase the risk of pathological consequences such as the development of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Observations in yeast and mammalian cells suggest that sister chromatid cohesion is important for DNA repair as well as proper segregation of chromosomes. It has been proposed that cohesin facilitates DNA repair by holding sister chromatids locally at DSB sites to allow strand invasion during homologous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5">2&#x02013;5</xref>). The cohesin complex of budding yeast, which consists of Smc1, Smc3, Scc1 and Scc3, forms a ring-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">6&#x02013;11</xref>). This holds the sister chromatids together by trapping the sister DNA molecules within its ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and is essential for maintaining cohesion between sister chromatids until metaphase to assure equal segregation of sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Loading of the cohesin complex onto chromatin requires the Scc2&#x02013;Scc4 complex, whereas Eco1/Ctf7 is required to establish sister chromatid cohesion during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The interaction between Eco1/Ctf7 and PCNA, which acts as a clamp for DNA polymerases, is essential for sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, Eco1/Ctf7 is neither required for the loading of cohesin onto chromatin nor for the maintenance of cohesion in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Mutation of the <italic>CTF18</italic> gene causes a decrease in the fidelity of chromosome transmission or chromosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Mutations in <italic>CTF8</italic> and <italic>DCC1</italic> as well as <italic>CTF18</italic>, whose products form an alternative replication factor C (RFC) complex in conjunction with the four small subunits Rfc2-5 of RFC (Ctf18-RFC), cause a moderate non-lethal defect in sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Ctf18-RFC has been shown to interact with PCNA and to load it onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Moreover, Ctf18-RFC is capable of unloading PCNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Since Ctf18 physically associates with Eco1/Ctf7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), it seems likely that the moderate defect in sister chromatid cohesion of <italic>ctf18</italic> mutant cells maybe related to the function of Eco1/Ctf7. Of note, Ctf18 and Eco1/Ctf7 are found at replication forks, and Ctf18 is required for the efficient recruitment of PCNA onto replication forks in HU-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>Studies in yeast have revealed that normal loading of the cohesin complex onto chromatin during the progression of DNA replication is insufficient to hold DSB ends in close proximity. This suggests that the cohesin complex must be loaded within the vicinity of the DSBs following replication to facilitate the repair of the DSBs through sister chromatid recombination (SCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Until now, the function of Ctf18 in homologous recombination has not been considered because of the synthetic sick or lethal interaction between the mutation of the <italic>CTF18</italic> gene and <italic>RAD52</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) which plays a major role in homologous recombination repair. In this study, we present evidence that Ctf18 is involved either directly or indirectly in recombination-mediated DSB repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

In response to DSBs, the MRX complex arrives first at the sites of DSBs and performs nucleolytic resection to generate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The ssDNA is recognized by the ssDNA-binding protein Rpa, and proteins involved in DNA damage checkpoint are recruited at DSB sites in an Rpa-dependent manner. Subsequently, proteins that are involved in HR are recruited. The assembly of Rad51 on ssDNA is initiated by Rad52, which in turn causes strand invasion. We found that the induction of DSBs occurred in a similar manner in both wild-type cells and <italic>mre11</italic> cells arrested in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

The function of Ctf18 in homologous recombination repair has not been considered because of the synthetic sick or lethal interaction between the <italic>CTF18</italic> mutation and the <italic>RAD52</italic> mutation, which plays a major role in homologous recombination repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In this study, we found that repair of DSBs induced by phleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), recombination of sister chromatids induced by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and interchromosomal recombination between heteroalleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) were defective in <italic>ctf18</italic> cells. This indicates that Ctf18 is involved in recombination repair. Although <italic>ctf18</italic> cells were nearly normal for HO-endonuclease-based NHEJ, this result does not necessarily rule out the possibility of Ctf18 involvement in the NHEJ pathway under other assay conditions, such as those used by Schar <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) who reported that <italic>smc1-2</italic> mutants were much less efficient in plasmid end-joining mediated by the NHEJ pathway.</p><p>Although Ctf18 was recruited to the DSB site at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) even in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase-arrested cells, we could not detect an obvious defect in the processes of HO endonuclease-induced recombination, such as primer extension and ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The discrepancy between the results obtained after inducing a single DSB with HO-endonuclease and those obtained after inducing DNA damage with phleomycin or MMS may be explained by the different mechanisms of recombination involved in repairing these two types of DNA damage; HO endonuclease induces intrachromosome recombination, whereas MMS and phleomycin induces interchromosomal or sister chromatid recombination. Alternatively, this discrepancy may be due to differences in the amount of DNA damage induced by these agents. For example, the function of Ctf18 maybe more important following the induction of multiple sites of DNA damage when the demands on the cell to execute HR-mediated DNA double-strand break repair are greater. Finally, the discrepancy may be due to the differences in the DNA ends created by HO endonuclease, MMS and phleomycin. Ctf18 could be required for the repair of DNA lesions induced by MMS and phleomycin but not for the repair of DSB induced by HO endonuclease.</p><sec><title>How does Ctf18 contribute to recombination repair?</title><p>Ctf18 may affect recombination repair through the function of the cohesin complex. Cohesin complexes normally associate with distinct loci on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53 B54 B55 B56">53&#x02013;56</xref>), but associate with damaged DNA regardless of whether cohesin-binding sites are present or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). During normal cell cycling, cohesion is established during S-phase, but not during G<sub>2</sub>-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Following DNA damage, cohesion is also established <italic>de novo</italic> in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Cohesin mutant also leads to an impairment of coordination of homologous recombination and NHEJ processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In the current study, we showed that the loading of cohesin (Scc1) onto the DSB site in the <italic>MAT</italic> locus was not affected by deletion of the <italic>CTF18</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, we observed that the function of Ctf18 is required for both recombination between sister chromatids and for recombination between homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results do not necessarily eliminate the possibility that Ctf18 is involved in establishing <italic>de novo</italic> cohesion of sister chromatids during recombination repair in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase-arrested cells or the possibility that the defect in homologous recombination repair of <italic>ctf18</italic> cells is due to the inefficient establishment of cohesion during replication. In addition, the cohesin complex is composed of multiple subunits, including Scc1 and the Smc1/Smc3 heterodimer, and there exist at least two forms of cohesin, one tightly bound and the other loosely associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Since a large cellular pool of the Smc1/Smc3 heterodimer in cells is apparently not in a complex with Scc1, the ChIP data for Scc1 presented here does not necessarily represent the behavior of the cohesin complex. In a future study, we will examine the loading of the Smc1/Smc3 heterodimer onto damaged sites to shed further light to this issue.</p><p>Interestingly, the recruitment of Ctf18 onto the DSB site in the <italic>MAT</italic> locus and the donor site, the <italic>HML</italic> locus, was dependent on Mre11 and Rad52, respectively. Therefore, Ctf18 may be recruited onto the DSB site via the function of Mre11 and thereafter function together with Rad52 in DSB repair. Moreover, Ctf18 is recruited onto chromatin even after the induction of DNA damage in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase-arrested cells. These data suggest that the Ctf18 may play a novel role other than damage-induced cohesion establishment in recombination repair.</p><p>Finally, genetic recombination not only promotes genetic diversity in a population, but also insures the integrity of an organism's genome. Inappropriate or inefficient recombination drives tumor formation and underlies certain premature aging diseases in humans. Mutations in the human CTF18 complex could lead to the chromosomal instability known as a hallmark of most cancers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank J.E.
