Based on a compari&#x000ad;son of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding specificities, we suggested that homeoprotein binding sites on actively transcribed genes are largely accessible, whereas the binding of homeoproteins to inactive and poorly transcribed genes may be significantly inhibited at most sites, perhaps by chromatin structure. To test this model, we have measured the accessibility of restriction enzyme sites in a number of genes in isolated nuclei. Surprisingly, our data indicate that there is no difference in the overall accessibility of sites for several restriction enzymes on active versus inactive genes. However, consistent with our model, restriction enzyme recognition sequences that overlap with homeoprotein binding sites are less accessible on inactive genes than they are on active genes. We propose that transcriptional activation in all animals may involve a localized increase in accessibility at the AT-rich regions bound by homeo&#x000ad;proteins and perhaps at a few other regions, rather than a generalized effect on all sites throughout a gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Sequence-specific DNA binding proteins are one of the largest groups of regulatory proteins in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c1">1</xref>). Yet while the DNA binding specificities of these proteins have been studied extensively <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c4">4</xref>; http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;transfac.gbf.de&#x0002f;transfac ), little information is available about the range of DNA sequences that most of these proteins interact with in cells. Even less is known about the mechanisms that determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> pattern of DNA binding. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments have shown that cooperative interactions between sequence-specific DNA binding proteins can modify DNA binding specificities and that chromatin structure can inhibit DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c9">9</xref>). But the relative contributions of these influences on DNA binding in animal cells are unknown. To address these issues, we are studying DNA binding by a collection of four <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeo&#x000ad;proteins: Paired, Bicoid and two selector homeoproteins, Eve and Ftz.</p><p>Homeoproteins are a highly conserved family of transcription factors that control development in all animal phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c12">12</xref>). Like other extended families of metazoan transcription factors, homeoproteins bind <italic>in vitro</italic> with overlapping specificities to variants of a short, degenerate DNA consensus sequence. For example, the selector homeoproteins all bind with similar specificities to variants of the consensus sequence NNATTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c15">15</xref>); Bicoid binds with high affinity to a smaller range of sequences, GGATTA, GCATTA, CGATTA and AGATTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c18">18</xref>); Paired binds not only to many ATTA sequences, but also to an entirely different 10&#x02013;14 bp sequence via a second DNA binding domain contained within the Paired protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c20">20</xref>).</p><p>Using an <italic>in vivo</italic> UV crosslinking assay, we showed previously that Eve, Ftz, Paired and Bicoid have significantly overlapping DNA binding specificities in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and that they bind to a broad array of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c22">22</xref>). A detailed comparison of <italic>in vivo</italic> UV crosslinking data and <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding preferences suggest that, across the highly transcribed genes <italic>hb</italic>, <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic>, there is a strong correlation between the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding specificities of these proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f1">1</xref>A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c23">23</xref>). However, inactive or poorly transcribed genes, such as <italic>rosy</italic>, <italic>Adh</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic>, are UV crosslinked significantly more weakly <italic>in vivo</italic> by all of these proteins than would be expected from the intrinsic affinities of homeoproteins for these DNA fragments <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f1">1</xref>B).</p><p>To explain these and other observations, we suggested that the pattern of homeoprotein DNA binding <italic>in vivo</italic> is determined by two principal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c22">22</xref>). First, homeoproteins may be expressed at sufficiently high concentrations <italic>in vivo</italic> such that they bind efficiently to sites on actively transcribed genes; the chromatin structure of active genes is not envisioned to inhibit DNA binding and thus the intrinsic DNA binding specificities of homeoproteins should determine their distribution across the length of these genes. As Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f1">1</xref>A demonstrates, this is apparently the case on the genes we have examined. Second, some structural feature may inhibit homeoprotein DNA binding at most sites on inactive or poorly transcribed genes. We suggest that this is why the relative binding on less active genes is lower <italic>in vivo</italic> than it is <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f1">1</xref>B; <italic>rosy</italic>, <italic>Adh</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic>).</p><p>In this paper, we have directly tested a key prediction of the above model. We have measured the relative accessibility of restriction sites in two highly transcribed and two weakly transcribed genes. Our results demonstrate that homeoprotein binding sites are indeed more accessible in highly transcribed genes than they are in weakly transcribed genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Embryo UV irradiation assay</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (stages 5&#x02013;8) were collected and irradiated under 254 nm UV light for either 0 or 60 min using techniques described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c26">26</xref>). DNA was extracted and purified also as previously described with the following changes. Isolated embryonic nuclei were treated with 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml proteinase K for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C and then lysed by the addition of sarkosyl to a final concentration of 4&#x00025;. Restriction enzyme digests were carried out in a 100 &#x000b5;l volume of 1&#x000d7; restriction enzyme buffer (content specified by enzyme manufacturer) and contained 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g DNA from irradiated or unirradiated embryos and either 0, 60 or 120 U restriction enzyme. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C and were stopped by addition of proteinase K to 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml. This was followed by incubation at 65&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The DNA was subsequently precipitated, washed and resuspended in standard loading buffer for separation on a 0.8&#x00025; agarose gel. DNA was transferred to an uncharged nylon membrane and analyzed by Southern blot using standard procedures. Image data were quantitated with a Fuji Phosphor&#x000ad;imager.</p></sec><sec><title>Restriction enzyme chromatin accessibility assay</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (stages 5&#x02013;8) were collected and dechorio&#x000ad;nated using standard techniques. Embryos were then suspended in buffer A (15 mM Tris pH 7.4, 60 mM KCl, 15&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF) at &#x0223c;1 g&#x0002f;3&#x000a0;ml and then immediately dissociated in a motorized dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was poured over Miracloth and diluted to 5 ml buffer A&#x0002f;g embryos. Embryos were then further homogenized with a B dounce homogenizer. This was followed by the addition of NP-40 to a final concentration of 0.5&#x00025;. The released nuclei were then centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m. at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 min in a Sorval SS34 rotor. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in an appropriate 1&#x000d7; restriction enzyme buffer (content specified by enzyme manufacturer) at 1 ml&#x0002f;g embryos and then centrifuged for 15 s in a microfuge. The nuclei were then resuspended in 1&#x000d7; restriction enzyme buffer (1 ml&#x0002f;g embryos) in preparation for restriction digestion. Nuclear chromatin digestion reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C in a 200 &#x000b5;l volume of 1&#x000d7; restriction enzyme buffer and contained 20 &#x000b5;l of resuspended nuclei and either 0, 100 or 200&#x000a0;U enzyme.

After a 1 h incu&#x000ad;bation at 65&#x000b0;C, the DNA was phenol&#x0002f;chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated.

DE is the digestion efficiency and INT is the intensity of each fragment band as a percentage of the total intensity in the gel lane. The digestion efficiencies of primary restriction sites that were too close together to resolve on the gel were averaged. For example, in the case of two unresolved primary restriction sites (B<sub>X</sub> and B<sub>Y</sub>), the following was done. Assume B<sub>X DE</sub> &#x0003d; B<sub>Y DE</sub>. Guesses of B<sub>X DE</sub> (and hence also of B<sub>Y DE</sub>) are adjusted until B<sub>INT</sub> &#x0003d; B<sub>X INT</sub> &#x0002b; B<sub>Y INT</sub>, where B<sub>X INT</sub> &#x0003d; B<sub>X DE</sub>(1 &#x02013; A<sub>DE</sub>) and B<sub>Y INT</sub> &#x0003d; B<sub>Y DE</sub>(1 &#x02013; B<sub>X DE</sub>) (1&#x000a0;&#x02013; A<sub>DE</sub>). A<sub>DE</sub> is the digestion efficiency of the adjacent primary restriction site closer to the probed secondary restriction site and B<sub>INT</sub> is the intensity of the unresolved band. All image data were quantitated using a Fuji Phosphorimager.</p><p>It is formally possible that if different length DNA fragments transfer with different efficiencies in our Southern blots and if there is a systematic difference in the length of fragment produced by each enzyme on some genes, our results could be biased. However, as Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd416tb1">1</xref> indicates, the variations in the mean lengths of fragments transferred to Southern filters cannot explain the lower amounts of <italic>Adh</italic> and <italic>rosy</italic> DNA fragments produced by <italic>Mse</italic>I digestion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f4">4</xref>B). Further, the digestion efficiencies of a number of sites have been measured independently using partial digestion products that differ in length by 3-fold or more. In such cases, there is no significant difference in the amount of fragment produced (data not shown). Thus, the relative amount of each partial digestion product accurately reflects the relative digestion of the given restriction site in nuclei.</p><p>Restriction enzyme digestion efficiencies of <italic>Mse</italic>I, <italic>Rsa</italic>I and <italic>Hae</italic>III sites were measured using a variety of other conditions, in addition to those described above. A number of the published nuclear preparation and restriction enzyme digestion methods were sampled, including those of Wu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c28">28</xref>) and Wallrath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c29">29</xref>). Higher or lower salt concentrations ranging from 0 to 60 mM KCl and 15 to 150 mM NaCl during preparation of nuclei or during primary restriction digestions were also tested, as was the presence of sucrose. All procedures gave similar data to those described in Results.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>To compare the mean digestion efficiencies of <italic>Mse</italic>I sites on <italic>rosy</italic> and <italic>Adh</italic> with those on <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic>, the data for <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> were first pooled. <italic>F</italic>-tests using an &#x003b1; of 0.05 indicate that the variances of the <italic>rosy</italic> and the pooled <italic>eve</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ftz</italic> data can be considered equal, but that the variances of the <italic>Adh</italic> and the <italic>eve</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ftz</italic> data are not equal. The appropriate <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed using Microsoft Excel. 95&#x00025; confidence limits for the difference between each pair of means were calculated using the Excel derived <italic>t</italic>-statistic (7.12 for the <italic>Adh</italic> versus <italic>eve</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ftz</italic> comparison and 3.34 for the <italic>rosy</italic> versus <italic>eve</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ftz</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c30">30</xref>). One tailed tests were appropriate as we had previously hypothesized that the digestion efficiencies of sites on <italic>rosy</italic> and <italic>Adh</italic> would be less than those on <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic>. The probability that the digestion efficiencies of <italic>Mse</italic>I sites on <italic>Adh</italic> are the same or greater than those on <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> is 7.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup>.

Our model assumes that <italic>in vivo</italic> UV crosslinking and <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding both accurately measure, in their respective environments, the relative occupancy of proteins on different gene fragments.</p><p>UV crosslinking and DNA affinity assays do give the same relative results when tested under the same conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c23">23</xref>). It is crucial, however, to ensure that there is no factor(s) that interferes with the quantitative nature of the UV method <italic>in vivo</italic>. The only factor we can imagine that might have such an effect is if some genes receive different doses of UV irradiation than others. For example, less well transcribed genes may be physically buried within the nucleus and thus shielded from UV irradiation. In such a case, these genes would be UV crosslinked to homeoproteins at lower levels than highly transcribed genes because of their physical location and not, as our model assumes, because they are actually bound at lower levels. The <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> genes are strongly transcribed at the stage of development examined in the <italic>in vivo</italic> UV crosslinking experiments, whereas <italic>Adh</italic> is not transcribed and <italic>rosy</italic> is only weakly transcribed in a subset of cells at the same stage. Therefore, we have sought to determine if the <italic>Adh</italic> and <italic>rosy</italic> genes receive the same amount of UV light as the <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> genes during crosslinking experiments.</p><p>We have previously noted that, in DNA purified from UV irradiated embryos, some restriction enzyme sites in a small proportion of DNA fragments from each gene cannot be digested, even if the DNA has been treated with protease to remove attached proteins prior to restriction enzyme digestion (J.Walter, A.Carr, J.D.Laney and M.D.Biggin, unpublished data). Presumably, this inhibition of digestion is due to UV damage at restriction sites in some copies of the gene. The proportion of restriction sites that cannot be digested should thus be a measure of the amount of UV light incident at each gene. Restriction sites that contain two adjacent thymine residues, for example <italic>Eco</italic>RI sites, should be most susceptible to UV damage because thymine is more readily activated by UV light than are other bases and because adjacent thymines readily form thymine dimers upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c31">31</xref>). Therefore, to maximize our ability to detect damaged DNA sites, we have tested the susceptibility of <italic>Eco</italic>RI sites to UV light. To further increase our ability to measure UV damage, embryos have been UV irradiated for twice the time usual in standard UV crosslinking experiments.</p><p>Live <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos were irradiated with 254 nm light for either 0 or 60 min. DNA was extracted, proteinase K treated, purified, digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and then subjected to Southern analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f2">2</xref>A, partial digestion products are observed in experiments using DNA from irradiated embryos, but not in experiments using DNA from unirradiated embryos. For example, a Southern blot probed with a short DNA fragment wholly contained within a 3.4 kb <italic>Eco</italic>RI <italic>ftz</italic> fragment detects only this 3.4 kb fragment in DNA from unirradiated embryos. But in DNA from irradiated embryos, larger DNA fragments of the size expected for partial digestion products are also visible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f2">2</xref>A and B). Digestion in the presence of higher concentrations of enzyme does not decrease the amount of partial digestion products observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f2">2</xref>A). Also, if unirradiated plasmid DNA is included in a digest of irradiated DNA, an <italic>Eco</italic>RI site in the plasmid is completely digested (data not shown). Thus, the inhibition of DNA digestion must be due to physical obstruction on each DNA molecule that is not cut.</p><p>The mean proportion of <italic>Eco</italic>RI sites in <italic>Adh</italic> and <italic>rosy</italic> that cannot be digested in irradiated DNA is very similar to that of sites in <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f2">2</xref>C). This result strongly suggests, therefore, that each of these four genes receives the same level of incident UV light during crosslinking experiments and that our <italic>in vivo</italic> UV crosslinking results must provide an accurate measure of the relative levels of binding of endogenous homeo&#x000ad;proteins on these genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Restriction site accessibility in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic nuclei</title><p>The above experiment confirms that there is a discrepancy between the <italic>in vitro</italic> affinities of homeoproteins for DNA and the <italic>in vivo</italic> levels of occupancy when genes transcribed to different degrees are examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f1">1</xref>B). From this and other data, we earlier inferred that homeoprotein DNA binding sites should be less accessible on poorly transcribed genes than they are on strongly transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c22">22</xref>). Below, we use a restriction enzyme accessibility assay to directly test this idea.</p><p>It has previously been shown that, in isolated nuclei, most DNA sites in SIR silenced yeast genes are 10 times less accessible to restriction digestion than are sites in the same genes when they are active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c32">32</xref>). In other yeast genes and in some metazoan genes, short regions of DNA just upstream of the mRNA start site become much more accessible to restriction enzyme digestion when these genes are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c35">35</xref>). This assay may thus provide a useful way to test our model.</p><p>We have compared the digestion efficiency of restriction sites within <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> to those within <italic>rosy</italic> and <italic>Adh</italic> in isolated nuclei. We measured the accessibility of three enzymes: <italic>Rsa</italic>I, <italic>Hae</italic>III and <italic>Mse</italic>I. <italic>Hae</italic>III and <italic>Rsa</italic>I were chosen because their recognition sequences, GGCC and GTAC, respectively, are very different from those of homeoproteins. Across the restriction fragments we have examined, only 1 of 40 <italic>Rsa</italic>I sites (2.5&#x00025;) and 9 of 75 <italic>Hae</italic>III sites (12&#x00025;) are within 10 bp of a copy of the homeoprotein core recognition sequence, ATTA. Thus, these enzymes allow us to measure the general accessibility of each gene locus at sites not bound by homeoproteins. <italic>Mse</italic>I was chosen because it cuts the sequence TTAA. This sequence is a 1 bp mismatch from the homeoprotein core recognition sequence and, as a consequence, many homeoprotein DNA binding sites contain an <italic>Mse</italic>I site. Within the genes we have analyzed, 52 of 80 <italic>Mse</italic>I sites (65&#x00025;) either overlap or are within 10 bp of an ATTA element. In addition, because homeo&#x000ad;proteins bind strongly to some 1 bp mismatches to ATTA, many of the other 35&#x00025; of <italic>Mse</italic>I sites are within or close to sequences predicted to be bound by homeoproteins. This enzyme should thus allow us to monitor accessibility at homeoprotein binding sites.</p><p>Accessibility was measured by indirect end-labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c29">29</xref>). Briefly, nuclei were purified from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos of developmental stage 4&#x02013;5, the same stage as used in the <italic>in vivo</italic> UV crosslinking experiments. These nuclei were then immediately added to a restriction enzyme solution containing either <italic>Rsa</italic>I, <italic>Hae</italic>III or <italic>Mse</italic>I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f3">3</xref>A). This primary digestion continued until all accessible restriction sites had been cut: digestion of nuclei for longer or with more enzyme gave no further cutting (data not shown). After digestion, the DNA was purified from nuclei, removing all histones and other proteins from the DNA. Then, the DNA was cut with a secondary restriction enzyme, which recognizes a 6 bp sequence. In this digestion, all sites recognized by the secondary enzyme were cut to completion, delimiting specific gene regions for analysis. The double-digested DNA was then separated on an agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane for Southern analysis. Blots were probed with a short DNA fragment from one end of a length of DNA bounded by secondary digestion sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f3">3</xref>B). Each fragment detected by a probe thus shares a common secondary enzyme site at one end and has a unique primary restriction enzyme site at the other end. The relative intensities of each fragment were used to quantitate the digestion efficiency of each primary restriction site (Materials and Methods). Note that there is no systematic difference between the size of fragments produced by partial digestion of <italic>Mse</italic>I, <italic>Rsa</italic>I and <italic>Hae</italic>III that could bias our analysis (Materials and Methods).</p><p>The digestion efficiencies of sites for <italic>Mse</italic>I, <italic>Rsa</italic>I and <italic>Hae</italic>III were calculated and averaged across <italic>rosy</italic>, <italic>Adh</italic>, <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f4">4</xref>). Because some primary restriction sites are either too close or too far from secondary restriction sites, it was not possible to measure accessibility at all sites. Data was obtained for 83&#x00025; of <italic>Mse</italic>I sites, 85&#x00025; of <italic>Rsa</italic>I sites and 60&#x00025; of <italic>Hae</italic>III sites within the designated regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f4">4</xref>A). The histogram indicates 95&#x00025; confidence limits for the mean digestion of each enzyme on each DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f4">4</xref>B). As the figure shows, there is no significant difference in average digestion efficiency of <italic>Rsa</italic>I and <italic>Hae</italic>III at the four genes examined. However, the average digestion efficiency of <italic>Mse</italic>I sites is lower on <italic>rosy</italic> and <italic>Adh</italic> than it is on <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic>. One tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests indicate that with 95&#x00025; confidence the <italic>Mse</italic>I sites on <italic>Adh</italic> are digested between 1.8- and 2.4-fold less well than they are on <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> and the <italic>Mse</italic>I sites on <italic>rosy</italic> are digested 1.3- to 1.9-fold less well than they are on <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> (Materials and Methods). We obtain essentially the same result if we compare just those <italic>Mse</italic>I sites that overlap or lie within 10 bp of ATTA elements. Thus, consistent with our model, the DNA sequences in and around homeoprotein binding sites on <italic>Adh</italic> and <italic>rosy</italic> are less accessible than comparable sites on the <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> genes. The fact that homeoprotein binding sites on <italic>Adh</italic> are less accessible than those on <italic>rosy</italic> is also consistent with our model: at the stage of development studied in the <italic>in vivo</italic> UV crosslinking experiments, <italic>Adh</italic> is not transcribed in any cells, whereas <italic>rosy</italic> is weakly transcribed in a minority of cells. We discuss the implications of these data below.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> homeoproteins bind more weakly to poorly transcribed genes than predicted by <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f1">1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c23">23</xref>). We have shown that UV crosslinking gives an accurate and quantitative measure of the relative levels of protein binding to different affinity DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c24">24</xref>) and, in this paper, we establish that the same amount of UV light reaches all genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Therefore, the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA binding specificities of homeoproteins differ.</p><p>In principle, there are two ways that DNA binding specificities could be altered <italic>in vivo</italic>. One, DNA binding could be specifically increased at actively transcribed genes by heteromeric cooperative interactions between homeoproteins and other sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. Two, DNA binding by homeoproteins could be inhibited at weakly transcribed genes. The following data suggest that the second of these two mechanisms is the principal means by which homeoprotein DNA binding is modified <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>A variety of experiments suggest that homeoproteins bind to high affinity DNA sites on actively transcribed genes without the aid of cooperative interactions with other sequence-specific DNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c36">36</xref>). For example, the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA binding preferences of homeoproteins are very similar on actively transcribed genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f1">1</xref>A). Yet if, as the first model suggests, cooperative interactions with other sequence-specific DNA binding proteins greatly affect homeoprotein DNA binding <italic>in vivo</italic>, the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> specificities would differ on actively transcribed genes. As a second example, transgenic promoter constructs containing only high affinity Bicoid recognition sequences are activated by Bicoid in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c38">38</xref>). Thus, in some contexts, endogenous Bicoid does not need to form heteromeric complexes with other transcription factors to bind its recognition sites <italic>in vivo</italic>. By default, if homeoprotein DNA binding is not greatly increased on actively transcribed genes, the major factor modifying DNA binding <italic>in vivo</italic> must be the inhibition of binding to inactive genes.</p><p>To directly test this idea, we have used a restriction enzyme accessibility assay. This assay demonstrates that sites bound by homeoproteins are 1.6- to 2.2-fold less accessible on poorly transcribed genes than they are on actively transcribed genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f4">4</xref>). Thus, two separate experimental approaches both indicate that homeoprotein DNA binding is differentially inhibited on less well transcribed genes.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, we do not see differences in accessibility on active versus inactive genes at sites cut by the restriction enzymes <italic>Rsa</italic>I and <italic>Hae</italic>III, which do not recognize homeoprotein DNA binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f4">4</xref>). It is unlikely that this is because different restriction enzymes respond differently to altered chromatin structures; previous studies have not found such effects and, instead, have shown close agreement between DNase I, micrococcal nuclease and restriction enzyme mapping data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c33">33</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that upon activation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes, accessibility is increased locally at regions around homeoprotein DNA sites. A general increase in accessibility throughout the length of genes, such as that associated with derepression of SIR silencing in yeast, is not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c39">39</xref>); though, from our data, we cannot rule out that a few other regions, in addition to homeoprotein DNA sites, may display increased accessibility upon gene activation.</p><p>Typically, homeoprotein binding sites are present as clusters that form short AT-rich patches in the non-protein coding portions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c40">40</xref>; T.Johnson, D.Dalma-Weiszhausz, M.D.Biggin and M.Gerstein, unpublished data). These patches might lie within the center of nucleosomes on inactive genes but may be placed at the edge or between nucleosomes on active genes. Such differential positioning of nucleosomes can cause up to 10-fold differences in accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c41">41</xref>), which could explain the differential accessibility we observe. Interestingly, the human SWI&#x02013;SNF chromatin remodeling complex contains a HMG I&#x0002f;Y-like DNA binding domain that shows a high preference for AT-rich DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c42">42</xref>); and it is thought that SWI&#x02013;SNF complexes are specifically recruited to transcriptionally active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c8">8</xref>). These complexes, therefore, may be found most frequently at AT-rich patches within active genes and preferentially increase accessibility at these sites. Consistent with this idea, hypomorphic mutations in components of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SWI&#x02013;SNF-like remodeling complexes often have specific effects on homeoprotein gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd416c45">45</xref>). While these remodeling complexes probably have broad effects on DNA binding by many classes of transcription factor, they may play a more important role for the homeoproteins.</p><p>Although the restriction enzyme accessibility data agrees qualitatively with the predictions resulting from the comparison of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f1">1</xref>), the two experimental approaches give different estimates of the degree to which homeoprotein binding is inhibited on inactive genes. Given the disparity between the relative <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA binding preferences of homeoproteins, DNA sites in the <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> genes should be about 10 times more accessible than sites in the <italic>Adh</italic> and <italic>rosy</italic> genes in blastoderm embryos (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f1">1</xref>). However, the restriction enzyme assay shows only a 1.6- to 2.2-fold mean reduction in accessibility at <italic>rosy</italic> and <italic>Adh</italic> compared to <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f4">4</xref>). We suspect that the reason for this difference is that the enzyme accessibility assay may be underestimating the true difference in accessibility <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why the present assay may not be fully quantitative. For example, during the isolation of nuclei, some aspects of <italic>in vivo</italic> structure may be lost. Also, sequence-specific DNA binding proteins may block accessibility of restriction enzymes to their recognition sites, though perhaps to a lesser extent than the presence of nucleosomes. Given that most homeoprotein binding sites are likely to be occupied by homeoproteins on the <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> genes when they are actively transcribed, the restriction enzyme assay may underestimate the accessibility of these sites for homeo&#x000ad;proteins. Indeed, the average extent to which homeoprotein recognition sites are cut in <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> is only &#x0223c;30&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd416f4">4</xref>) and no homeoprotein sites are cut by &#x0003e;40&#x00025;. Thus, the true degree of accessibility of transcription factor sites is inherently difficult to measure with this method. We suggest that it will be important to develop new approaches to accurately quantitate DNA accessibility in cells in the future.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd416f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Comparison of the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA binding preferences of several <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeoproteins.
