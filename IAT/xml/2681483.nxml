We then examined the methylation status of H19 in germ cells from E13.5 embryos. As also expected, we observed that the methylation status in wildtype male germ cells differed substantially from that of somatic cells with only 15&#x00025; of alleles methylated, fully 83&#x00025; unmethylated (p&#x0003c;0.001), and the remainder hemi-methylated (characterized by incomplete methylation on a single strand, data not shown). This indicated that the majority of chromosomes in wildtype germ cell populations were in the process of erasing H19 methylation marks.

Here we report that regardless of whether the germ cell programs mandate entry into meiosis for female germ cells or mitotic arrest in male germ cells, germ cell numbers are diminished in the absence of <italic>Dazl</italic> function. Indeed, in spite of intra-genotype variation, we detected statistically significant differences in germ cell numbers early in development with ablation of <italic>Dazl</italic> by E14.5. The differences in the numbers of germ cells amongst mice of different genotypes are magnified further by E16.5. We also note that by quantification we observed a more severe reduction in germ cell number at E15.5 and E16.5 in male <italic>Dazl</italic> mutants than in females, suggesting a sex-specific difference in the kinetics of germ cell loss.</p><p>Results of quantitative analysis were mirrored by studies of gene expression. Beginning at E13.5, there were observable and reproducible differences in the expression of certain genes in wildtype versus <italic>Dazl&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> germ cells. <italic>Dazl&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> male germ cells had relatively low expression of early germ cell markers such as <italic>Pumilio-2</italic>, <italic>Stella</italic> and <italic>Oct-4</italic>, while mutant female germ cells had relatively high expression of these same markers relative to their wildtype littermates. We also note that the striking differences in <italic>Stella</italic> expression between wildtype male and female PGCs occurring at E14.5 is consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005654-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.

As the majority of migrating germ cells should have arrived at the gonad by E12.5, this data suggests that loss of <italic>Dazl</italic> function may result in defects in germ cell proliferation, differentiation and/or maintenance with substantial germ cell loss manifested in the gonocyte population of both sexes.</p><p>Additionally, we explored other hallmarks of <italic>in vivo</italic> germ cell development, including imprinting and entry into meiosis. We found that <italic>Dazl</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; males displayed a delay or incomplete erasure at E13.5, and failure to properly re-establish methylation of genomic imprint marks at the H19 DMR, relative to wildtype and heterozygous animals. We note that it is possible that disruption of <italic>Dazl</italic> may directly or indirectly impact imprinting status; previously, germ cell specific genes, other than components of the cellular enzymatic machinery such as the demethyltransferase family, have not been shown to impact germ cell imprinting. Furthermore, we observed that many of the PGCs isolated from <italic>Dazl</italic>-null mutants were able to enter meiosis, however these cells displayed a significant defect in progression through meiosis relative to wildtype.

The high expression of pluripotency, epigenetic regulator, and early and late germ cell-associated genes at early time points of differentiation in both male and female wildtype and <italic>Dazl</italic> heterozygous lines suggests that mESC lines that contain at least one copy of <italic>Dazl</italic> are able to undergo an initial wave of germ cell differentiation. However, only the female wildtype lines displayed a strong second wave of germ cell differentiation at day 35. We note that the <italic>Oct4</italic>&#x00394;PE:GFP transgene has been reported to decrease in expression in germ cells undergoing spermatogenesis (39), therefore, lack of induction of germ cell markers at later stages in male wildtype lines could be due to loss of maturing germ cells as they down-regulate <italic>Oct4</italic>. Analysis of the Oct4&#x00394;PE:GFP-negative fraction from male wildtype lines at day 35 supports this suggestion (data not shown). Furthermore, we did not see these results in ESCs with a genetic ablation of <italic>Dazl</italic>. In these lines, in particular in the female line, the drastic reduction in expression of pluripotency and epigenetic regulating genes, as well as the early and late germ cells markers, as early as day 0, and persisting throughout all timepoints of differentiation, suggests that <italic>Dazl</italic> is linked to germ cell potential even at early fate decisions of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation, and supports the conclusion that <italic>Dazl</italic> is critical to maintaining a population of mESCs capable of germ cell fate.</p><p>As illustrated in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005654-g009">Figure 9</xref>), we suggest that <italic>Dazl</italic> functions early <italic>in vivo</italic> or in differentiating mESCs <italic>in vitro</italic>, either directly or indirectly, to maintain germ cell pluripotency. We further suggest that this RNA-binding protein may function to translationally-regulate or interact with key factors required to guide the germ cells through development, from stage to stage, and is required for the post-migratory pluripotent germ cells to begin reprogramming and switch from mitotic to meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005654-g009">Figure 9A&#x02013;9D</xref>).</p><p>We also wish to emphasis two items of interest arising from our <italic>in vitro</italic> results. The first addresses a common and perplexing problem of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of ESCs, namely the persistence of a residual <italic>Oct4</italic>-positive population that is thought to be tumorigenic in transplant assays following somatic differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005654-Cao1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005654-Blyszczuk1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we demonstrate that the use of ESCs carrying a disruption of a germ cell-specific gene, <italic>Dazl</italic>, significantly reduced or abolished the <italic>Oct4</italic> residual population. Even when retinoic acid, shown to promote self-renewal of ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005654-Wang1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref> is added to the media, we still see a complete reduction of GFP-positive cells in <italic>Dazl</italic> null cell lines (data not shown). Thus, our results suggest that the residual <italic>Oct4</italic> population of cells is not a population of ESCs resistant to differentiation but instead is the population of cells that has differentiated to the germ cell lineage rather than the somatic lineages. This implies that all differentiation of ESCs may be a balance between somatic and germ cell fates.</p><p>Finally, we note that this is the first demonstration that a genetic ablation leads to failure to produce germ cells <italic>in vitro</italic> with altered gene expression beginning at Day 0 in undifferentiated ESCs. This observation supports the hypothesis that a <italic>Dazl</italic>-dependent subpopulation of cells in undifferentiated ESC colonies may be predisposed towards differentiation to the germ cell lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005654-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Interestingly, a recent report documented evidence of heterogeneity within undifferentiated mESC colonies based on presence or absence of <italic>Stella</italic>, which leads to differences in differentiation potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005654-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further analysis utilizing this system will help uncover how the fundamental decision between formation and maintenance of the <italic>Oct4</italic>-residual population and differentiation to the germ cell lineage is coordinated by a gene that encodes an RNA-binding translational regulator. In conclusion, the data presented in this report shows that <italic>Dazl</italic> serves as a molecular linker between maintaining the pluripotent germ cell population and execution of the epigenetic and genetic programs that define multiple time points of germ cell differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>The Oct4&#x00394;PE:GFP transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005654-Stebler1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005654-Anderson1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>Dazl</italic> null allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005654-Ruggiu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> have previously been reported.
