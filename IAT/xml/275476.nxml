It has been proposed that the generation of genetic instability in BS cells could result from an aberrant non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ), one of the two main DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways in mammalian cells, the second major pathway being homologous recombination (HR). Using cell extracts, we report first that Ku70&#x0002f;80 and the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), key factors of the end-joining machinery, and BLM are located in close proximity on DNA and that BLM binds to DNA only in the absence of ATP. In the presence of ATP, BLM is phosphorylated and dissociates from DNA in a strictly DNA-PKcs-dependent manner. We also show that BS cells display, <italic>in vivo</italic>, an accurate joining of DSBs, reflecting thus a functional NHEJ pathway. In sharp contrast, a 5-fold increase of the HR-mediated DNA DSB repair in BS cells was observed. These results support a model in which NHEJ activation mediates BLM dissociation from DNA, whereas, under conditions where HR is favored, e.g. at the replication fork, BLM exhibits an anti-recombinogenic role.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome (BS) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a predisposition to the development of all types of cancer and by a chromosomal instability including an increase in chromosome breakage, sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and symmetric quadriradial chromatid interchanges between homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c1">1</xref>). BS results from mutations in both copies of the <italic>BLM</italic> gene located on chromosome 15 at 15q26.1. This gene encodes the BLM protein that belongs to the DExH box-containing RecQ helicase subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c2">2</xref>). The BLM protein displays an ATP- and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; DNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c3">3</xref>), but its function is still unclear.</p><p>Several studies have suggested a role for BLM in double-strand break (DSB) repair. DSBs occur under physiological conditions, but can also be induced by a number of exogenous agents, constituting a major threat to genome integrity. In mammalian cells, DSBs can be repaired by two major pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) that permits the joining, precisely or not, of broken DNA ends containing little or no homology, and homologous recombination (HR) that requires a homologous sequence provided by either a sister chromatid or a homologous chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c5">5</xref>). HR includes several mechanisms such as gene conversion, single-strand annealing and break-induced replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c6">6</xref>). NHEJ plays a dominant role during G<sub>1</sub> to early S phase of the cell cycle, whereas HR is preferentially used in late S to G<sub>2</sub> phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c7">7</xref>). Furthermore, a competition may exist between NHEJ and HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c11">11</xref>), and an inhibition of the HR pathway by components of NHEJ has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Using an <italic>in vivo</italic> host cell end-joining assay, R&#x000fc;nger and Kraemer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c14">14</xref>) were the first to describe a reduced and error-prone joining of linear plasmid DNA in BS cells. Recently, controversial results differing from those of R&#x000fc;nger and Kraemer were published by two independent groups that analyzed the efficiency and fidelity of NHEJ <italic>in vitro</italic> in cell-free nuclear extracts prepared from BS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c16">16</xref>). Langland <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c16">16</xref>) showed that the efficiency and fidelity of DSB repair by BS extracts were comparable with those of normal extracts when ligatable ends were present. In contrast, Gaymes <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c15">15</xref>) showed an increase in the activity of the NHEJ pathway in BS extracts, associated with repair infidelity and the formation of large deletions. Thus, no clear conclusions on the role of BLM in DSB repair via the NHEJ pathway can be drawn from these three studies. However, these studies only tested the NHEJ pathway that plays an important role in G<sub>1</sub>, whereas we have previously shown that the endogenous BLM protein is undetectable in G<sub>1</sub>. We and others have shown that BLM accumulated to high levels in S phase, that persisted in G<sub>2</sub>, which is consistent with a role for BLM in a replicative and&#x0002f;or post-replicative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c18">18</xref>). Several lines of evidence are in favor of an increase in DSB repair via the HR pathway in BLM-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c19">19</xref>). Indeed, BS cells are characterized by an increase in interchange between homologous chromosomes at homologous sites and by a 10-fold increase in SCEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c1">1</xref>). HR mediates SCEs in vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c20">20</xref>), and a large fraction of SCEs in BS cells depend on Rad54 function, and thus are formed via HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c21">21</xref>). Moreover, BLM recombinant protein promotes an ATP-dependent branch migration of Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c22">22</xref>). A model has been proposed in which a BLM defect would result in the annealing of free ends of newly synthesized daughter strands at sites of blocked replication forks, forming Holliday junctions. If these Holliday junctions cannot be resolved by a potential reverse branch migration activity of BLM, their resolution would generate DNA breaks that are repaired mainly by HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c21">21</xref>). Finally, Luo <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c23">23</xref>), who generated the only viable Bloom mice, showed that the gene targeting frequency obtained in the BLM-deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells was 3.5-fold higher than that obtained in wild-type ES cells, and proposed that this accounts for the mechanism of elevation in SCEs.</p><p>These data, associated with our results showing that BLM is phosphorylated via the ATM pathway in response to ionizing radiation, known to generate DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c25">25</xref>), prompted us to explore the possible relationship between BLM and the key components of the NHEJ pathway, Ku70&#x0002f;80 and the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), and to analyze the capacity of BS cells to repair <italic>in vivo</italic> DSBs by NHEJ or HR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and extracts</title><p>The Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid B-cell lines GM03403D and D1, and HeLa cells were cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c24">24</xref>).</p><p>HeLa nuclear extracts from the Computer Cell Culture Center (Seneffe, Belgium), and D1 and GM03403D nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam <italic>et al</italic>.

The DNA-dependent Ku&#x02013;DNA-PKcs assembly was also destabilized in the presence of EtBr (lanes 3 and 5), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c36">36</xref>).</p><p>Our results clearly show that BLM, Ku and DNA-PKcs can assemble on the same dsDNA molecule, but do not support interaction between these proteins in the absence of DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>The BLM protein is retained with Ku70&#x0002f;80 and DNA-PKcs on DNA, but only in the absence of ATP</title><p>To further characterize the DNA-mediated assembly of BLM with Ku and DNA-PKcs, we performed an assay where double-stranded oligonucleotides were coupled to paramagnetic streptavidin beads and used as a target to retain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c37">37</xref>). The associated proteins were then analyzed by western blotting. Double-stranded oligonucleotides exhibiting different termini structures &#x0005b;30 bp, blunt; 30 bp, 5&#x02032; protuding 2 nt single-strand (ss); 30 bp, 5&#x02032; protuding 4 nt ss; 77 bp, 3&#x02032; protuding 3 nt ss; 71 bp blunt&#x0005d; were coupled to beads. DNA-treated beads were incubated with HeLa nuclear protein extracts, in the presence or absence of ATP, which is crucial for DNA-PKcs function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c41">41</xref>). No non-specific binding to the paramagnetic beads was detectable in the absence of DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f2">2</xref>A, lane 1). BLM was present together with DNA-PKcs and Ku70&#x0002f;80 in the protein fractions retained on DNA, independently of the type of DNA termini, but only in the absence of ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f2">2</xref>A, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10). Indeed, the BLM protein did not bind to any type of oligonucleotide in the presence of ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f2">2</xref>A, lanes 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11). Furthermore, analysis of the supernatants of the binding reactions clearly showed that in the presence of ATP, the unbound BLM protein was shifted to a slightly slower migrating form (compare in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f2">2</xref>B, lanes 3, 5, 7 and 9 with lanes 1, 2 and 8). One can note that in the presence of ATP, the amount of DNA-PKcs retained on DNA beads was reduced, and Ku80 was shifted to a slower migrating form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f2">2</xref>A, lanes 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11), as already reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c37">37</xref>).</p><p>Hence, BLM, Ku70&#x0002f;80 and DNA-PKcs are present together in the protein fraction retained on DNA in the absence of ATP.

In this context, our results suggest that in the presence of DNA and ATP, BLM could be phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs, which would result in its dissociation from DNA. To test this, DNA-treated (30 bp, 5&#x02032; &#x0002b; 4 nt) beads were incubated in the absence or presence of ATP, with nuclear protein extracts from either M059J cells that do not express DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcs-deficient cells, Fus9) or M059J-complemented cells that contain an extra copy of the human gene coding for DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcs-complemented cells, Fus1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c27">27</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f3">3</xref>A, BLM from DNA-PKcs-deficient cells was retained similarly on DNA in both the absence and presence of ATP (lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, BLM from DNA-PKcs-complemented cells was retained on DNA only in the absence of ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f3">3</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6), as observed in HeLa extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f2">2</xref>A). Analysis of the supernatants of the binding reactions showed that in the presence of ATP, BLM protein from DNA-PKcs- complemented cells was shifted to a slightly slower migrating form (compare in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f3">3</xref>B, lane 12 with lane 11). In order to determine if this shift was due to phosphorylation, the corresponding supernatant of the binding reaction was treated with CIAP.

A <sup>32</sup>P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear protein extracts from BS GM3403D or wild-type D1 EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells, in the presence or absence of C19 anti-Ku70 antibody. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f4">4</xref>, the same shifts (lanes 1 and 3) and supershifts (lanes 2 and 4) were observed with the protein extracts prepared from either BS or control cells.

A cohesive-ended DSB was generated by restriction endonuclease EcoRI digestion of an autoreplicating plasmid pHRecCJI that contained two EcoRI sites separated by 49 bp containing a unique NheI site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f5">5</xref>A). Precise end-joining repair of such a substrate would lead to restoration of a unique EcoRI site associated with a loss of the NheI site. Experiments were carried out in the BS EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line GM03403D, homozygous for the blm<sup>Ash</sup> allele which contains a frameshift mutation commonly found in patients from Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c2">2</xref>), leading to production of an undetectable truncated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c17">17</xref>). We used a wild-type EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B cell line D1, which displays a growth rate comparable with that of BS GM03403D cells, as a control (data not shown). Expo nentially growing BS and control cells were transiently transfected in parallel with the circular supercoiled plasmid and with the EcoRI-digested plasmid. After 48 h, the plasmids were extracted and non-replicated plasmids were eliminated by DpnI digestion which cleaves DNA that was not replicated in human cells and thus retained the bacterial <italic>dam</italic> methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c43">43</xref>). In our experiments, only recircularized plasmids could be replicated, ensuring that the recovered molecules were repaired in human cells. Replicated DpnI-resistant plasmids harvested from human cells were used to transform bacteria.</p><p>The DSB end-joining efficiency in BS and control cells was estimated on the basis of three independent experiments by calculating the ratio between the number of bacterial colonies obtained after transformation with repaired plasmids versus the control circular plasmids. We observed a high variability between each experiment in both BS and control cells, and the survival rate of linear plasmid relative to uncut plasmid varied from 13 to 39&#x00025; in BS cells, and from 15 to 49&#x00025; in control cells. These non-significant differences led us to conclude that BS lymphoblasts are as efficient as normal cells in rejoining EcoRI DNA ends.</p><p>The DSB end-joining fidelity in BS and control cells was analyzed by performing PCR on 1782 bacterial colonies obtained after transformation with repaired plasmids using primers located on either side of the DSB. PCR products from accurately repaired molecules were up to 788 bp in length, thus migrating faster than PCR products amplified from the native pHRecCJI plasmid (837 bp) used as the control, since they lack at least 49 bp. PCR products were subjected to EcoRI digestion to detect the error-free repaired molecules. We have found by analyzing three independent experiments that 644 of 939 plasmids (68.5&#x00025;) and 577 of 843 plasmids (68.4&#x00025;) were accurately joined in the control and BS cell lines, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f5">5</xref>B). Thus, BS cells are not defective in the fidelity of rejoining of EcoRI-induced DSBs, which is in agreement with the results published by Langland <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c16">16</xref>). Interestingly, the authors observed a 5-fold increase in mutation rate with BS extracts when terminal phosphates were removed from EcoRI-digested DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c16">16</xref>). In order to determine the efficiency and fidelity of the repair of such a substrate in our system, EcoRI-digested plasmid was treated with CIAP before transfection into BS and control cells. The efficiency of the phosphatase treatment was confirmed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> ligation followed by transformation. The end-joining efficiency of dephosphorylated EcoRI ends varied between 16.4 and 47&#x00025; in the control cells, and between 23 and 42&#x00025; in BS cells. The error-free joining of dephosphorylated EcoRI ends was 63&#x00025; (357&#x0002f;567 repaired plasmids) in the control cells and 64.6&#x00025; (370&#x0002f;572 repaired plasmids) in BS cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f5">5</xref>B).</p><p>These results demonstrate that the joining efficiency and fidelity of EcoRI ends without terminal phosphates is similar in BS and control cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The repair of DSBs by HR is significantly increased in BS cells</title><p>To analyze the DNA DSB repair by the HR pathway in BS cells, we developed a two-plasmid assay. One plasmid, pHRecSJ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f6">6</xref>A), is autoreplicating in human cells due to the presence of the SV40 large T-antigen-coding sequence and the replication origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c29">29</xref>). The other plasmid, pRSJ, is a derivative of pHRecSJ in which the SV40 large T-antigen-coding sequence and the replication origin have been deleted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f6">6</xref>B). Thus, pRSJ is non-replicating but homologous to pHRecSJ, and can serve as a substrate for HR. The autoreplicating pHRecSJ plasmid was digested by the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and NotI, generating a substrate with a deleted 331 bp fragment and exhibiting non-complementary termini. The linear EcoRI&#x02013;NotI pHRecSJ plasmid and the circular non-replicating pRSJ plasmid, containing the 331bp fragment missing in the pHRecSJ plasmid, were transiently co-transfected into GM03403D BS cells and D1 control cells. After 48 h, the plasmids were extracted and unreplicated plasmids were eliminated by DpnI digestion, as described above. In these experiments, all unreplicated pRSJ molecules were destroyed by DpnI digestion, and only repaired and replicated pHRecSJ plasmids were DpnI resistant. EcoRI&#x02013;NotI end rejoining was globally less efficient than EcoRI&#x02013;EcoRI end rejoining in both BS and control cells, but we again observed a high variability between each of the three experiments in both BS and control cells, and the survival rate of linear plasmid relative to uncut plasmid varied from 7.7 to 12&#x00025; in BS cells, and from 1.5 to 20&#x00025; in control cells. The EcoRI&#x02013;NotI DSB introduced into the pHRecSJ plasmid can be repaired by NHEJ or by HR. In the latter case, the missing 331 bp EcoRI&#x02013;NotI fragment would be restored. The pathway by which the EcoRI&#x02013;NotI pHRecSJ plasmid was repaired was analyzed by performing PCR on bacterial colonies from the above experiments using the same primers as mentioned above. PCR products from the molecules repaired by HR were 784 bp in length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f6">6</xref>C, lane 8) and displayed the same migration pattern as PCR products amplified from the native pHRecSJ plasmid used as the control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f6">6</xref>C, lane 4) since they contained the 331 bp fragment. PCR products of 453 bp or less were repaired by NHEJ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f6">6</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;3, 5&#x02013;7 and 9&#x02013;11).</p><p>To determine the percentage of EcoRI&#x02013;NotI DSB molecules repaired via the HR pathway, we first analyzed the PCR products from 883 rejoined plasmids from D1 control cells, randomly chosen from three independent experiments. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f6">6</xref>D, eight molecules in 883 (0.9&#x00025;) were repaired via the HR pathway in these cells. Concerning BS cells, the analysis of only 386 rejoined plasmids, again randomly chosen from three independent experiments, was enough to show a significant difference since 18 molecules in 386 were repaired via the HR pathway in BS cells (4.66&#x00025;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f6">6</xref>D). Sequence analysis of 10 of these 784 bp PCR products from either BS or control cells confirmed that each molecule recovered precisely the 331bp EcoRI&#x02013;NotI fragment (data not shown).</p><p>Moreover, PCR products (43 BS and 46 controls) repaired by NHEJ were also subjected to sequence analysis. Termini rearrangements produced during the processing of the non-complementary ends by EcoRI&#x02013;NotI, which are mainly deletions varying from 1 to 358 bp (see Supplementary Material), were comparable in the control and BS cells. Only two out of 43 clones derived from BS cells and one out of 46 clones derived from control cells were accurately repaired, probably by filling-in of the 3&#x02032;-recessed end by a DNA polymerase to create a ligatable blunt end (see Supplementary Material).</p><p>Altogether, these results clearly show that the DSB repair by HR is increased more than five times in BS cells compared with wild-type cells, whereas NHEJ remains unchanged.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have first shown that BLM, Ku and DNA-PKcs assemble on the same DNA molecules only in the presence of added DNA. In our experimental conditions, EtBr destabilized the Ku&#x02013;DNA-PKcs complex, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c36">36</xref>), and also disrupted the interaction between BLM and Ku or DNA-PKcs. Our results also suggest that BLM and DNA-PK complex bind to DNA independently, and are co-immunoprecipitated even if they do not physically interact, since we were unable to co-immunoprecipitate these proteins in the absence of DNA. However, we cannot formally exclude that binding to DNA facilitates their physical interaction, which does not resist the EtBr exposure. Another possibility is that other DNA-binding proteins are required to mediate the assembly of BLM and DNA-PK complex on DNA. Future experiments with BLM, Ku and DNA-PKcs purified proteins will help address these questions. Altogether, our results indicate that BLM and DNA-PK complex can be located in close proximity on DNA. Since BLM does not unwind DNA double-stranded substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c44">44</xref>), it is unlikely that it is recruited with DNA-PK complex to process DNA ends. Moreover, we showed that BS cells display an accurate NHEJ (see below), indicating that BLM does not play a major role in this pathway. Thus, our results suggest that NHEJ and HR compete for DSB sites, which can potentially result in the simultaneous recruitment of proteins specific for each pathway, as discussed below. Interestingly, we also found that in the presence of ATP, BLM protein is phosphorylated and dissociates from DNA via a DNA-PKcs-dependent pathway. Indeed, BLM phosphorylation and dissociation from DNA are not observed in M059J DNA-PKcs-deficient cells, whereas they are restored in M059J DNA-PKcs-complemented cells. These results suggest that once the NHEJ pathway is activated, BLM is phosphorylated by the DNA-PKcs, which mediates its dissociation from DNA, possibly through the alteration of its substrate specificity.</p><p>Our results that BS cells display an accurate NHEJ pathway are consistent with the data that BLM-deficient cells are not radiosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c45">45</xref>) and are not defective in V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c49">49</xref>), and also fit with the BLM expression during the cell cycle. Indeed, we have previously shown that BLM is undetectable in G<sub>1</sub> phase cells, whereas it is strongly expressed in S and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c17">17</xref>). These data do not support an important role for BLM during the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle and, in addition, it is now admitted that NHEJ is essential in G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c7">7</xref>). Our results are in agreement with those reported by Langland <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c16">16</xref>) showing that efficiency and fidelity of DSB repair by BS extracts are comparable with those of normal extracts when ligatable ends (EcoRI) are present. However, when terminal phosphates were removed, we did not observe the increase in mutation rate in BS cells that these authors reported. In contrast, we found that 5&#x02032;-OH termini were joined accurately in BS cells, which is in agreement with the recent data showing that phosphate addition by human polynucleotide kinase is coupled to functional NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c50">50</xref>). Interestingly, mouse cell lines containing targeted mutations in Ku70, DNA-PKcs or XRCC4 do not exhibit an elevation of the rate of SCEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c9">9</xref>), which indicates that the NHEJ defect is not accompanied by an increase in the generation of SCEs, and thus the high level of SCEs in BS cells does not reflect an impaired NHEJ. It is interesting to note that all the experiments showing an error-prone NHEJ in BS cells have been performed in the SV40-transformed BS cells, GM08505 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c16">16</xref>). It is well known that the SV40 T antigen inactivates p53, and inactivation of p53 results in high rates of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c52">52</xref>), indicating that wild-type p53 suppresses HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c53">53</xref>). Moreover, p53 and BLM functionally interact in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c45">45</xref>), BLM cooperates with p53 in regulation of transcription and cell growth control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c54">54</xref>), and p53 modulates BLM&#x02019;s ability to disrupt Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c55">55</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated that p53 and BLM functionally interact during resolution of stalled DNA replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c56">56</xref>). These data suggest that the SV40-transformed BS fibroblasts lack not only BLM but also functional p53, which was shown to interfere with the BS phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c57">57</xref>). The EBV-transformed BS cells that we used in the present study exhibit a normal p53 response to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c57">57</xref>), and are not impaired in the rejoining of linear plasmid &#x0005b;R&#x000fc;nger and Kraemer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c14">14</xref>); this study&#x0005d;. Hence, differences in p53 status could explain the apparent discrepancy between our results and those reported by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c16">16</xref>), suggesting that under certain conditions (e.g. p53 inactivation), BS cells can exhibit an NHEJ defect.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrated that the repair of DSBs by HR was five times higher in BS cells than in control cells. These results are consistent with the high rate of SCEs and the increase in interchange between homologous chromosomes at homologous sites in BS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c1">1</xref>), and the 4- to 5-fold increase of spontaneous HR events induced by dominant-negative mutants of BLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c56">56</xref>). HR is an important process in restarting broken replication forks through the break-induced replication (BIR) mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c58">58</xref>). Richardson and Jasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c59">59</xref>) reported that following an I-SceI endonuclease-induced DSB, almost all recombination events were initiated by only one end of the DSB, suggesting that BIR plays an important role in DSB repair in mammalian cells. Furthermore, BIR has been proposed to be involved in mammalian telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase (ALT cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c60">60</xref>), and it has recently been shown that BLM promotes telomeric DNA synthesis in ALT cells, suggesting that it facilitates recombination-driven amplification of telomeres in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c61">61</xref>). Our data are consistent with a role for BLM in BIR, as recently proposed by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c64">64</xref>).</p><p>Several studies suggest that the NHEJ and HR pathways overlap, compete or act sequentially at sites of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c13">13</xref>). Our results also suggest that NHEJ and HR compete for DSB sites, resulting in a simultaneous recruitment of the proteins specific for each pathway. We propose a model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg834f7">7</xref>) in which during S and G<sub>2</sub> phases, BLM stays at the site of the DSB during the time interval required for NHEJ to take place. Once the NHEJ pathway is activated, BLM is phosphorylated by the DNA-PKcs, and this phosphorylation mediates its dissociation from DNA. If the NHEJ fails to repair the DSB, the recombination machinery will replace it, as proposed by Delac&#x000f4;te <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c11">11</xref>). Then the BIR process takes place, creating a single Holliday junction that will be resolved by the reverse branch migration activity of BLM, probably in association with topoisomerase III&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c65">65</xref>) and, in some cases, with p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c56">56</xref>), leading to the restoration of intact molecules. During replication, when a fork encounters a nicked template and gives rise to a one-ended DSB and an intact chromosome, the one-ended DSB invades the intact sister chromatid leading to the formation of a single Holliday junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c9">9</xref>). BLM&#x02019;s branch migration activity may resolve the Holliday junction, leading to the restoration of the replication fork. In the absence of a functional BLM protein, the Holliday junction will be resolved by either gene conversion (SCE) or by crossing-over between the homologous chromatids (symmetric quadriradial chromatid interchange). Alternatively, the Holliday junction will migrate to the end of the chromosome arm as a result of extensive DNA synthesis, leading to loss of a chromosom arm (loss of heterozygosity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg834c63">63</xref>). This model fully explains why SCE, symmetric quadriradial chromatid interchange and loss of heterozygosity are hallmarks of BS cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_31_21_6272__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_31_21_6272__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg834f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Co-immunoprecipitation of protein&#x02013;DNA complexes.
