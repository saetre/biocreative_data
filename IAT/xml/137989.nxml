Here, we describe a transgenic mouse line, LC-1, where the expression of the <italic>cre</italic> and luciferase gene is tightly controlled by the Tet system. Using the <italic>R26R</italic> mouse line as indicator for CRE activity, and mouse lines expressing tetracycline controlled transactivators (tTA&#x0002f;rtTA) in various tissues, we show that; (i) in the non-induced state CRE recombinase is tightly controlled throughout the development and adulthood of an animal; (ii) upon induction, efficient recombination occurs in the adult animal in all tissues where tTA&#x0002f;rtTA is present, including hepatocytes, kidney cells, neurons and T lymphocytes; and (iii) no position effect appears to be caused by the LC-1 locus. Moreover, using the novel rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1 mouse line, we show that in hepatocytes, complete deletion of the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked insert in <italic>R26R</italic> animals is achieved less than 48 h after induction. Thus, the LC-1 mouse appears suitable for exploiting two rapidly increasing collections of mouse lines of which one provides tTA&#x0002f;rtTA in specific cell types&#x0002f;tissues, and the other a variety of <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Site-specific recombinases, such as CRE and FLP derived from microorganisms, catalyze recombination between their cognate recognition sites, <italic>loxP</italic> and <italic>frt</italic>, respectively, with high specificity. Both systems function in mammalian cells and, in particular, the CRE&#x0002f;<italic>loxP</italic> system has developed into a powerful tool for the <italic>in vivo</italic> manipulation of genomes in transgenic mice (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c3">3</xref>). While the recombinases permit to invert or delete DNA fragments in <italic>cis</italic> or switch segments of DNA in <italic>trans</italic> and thus allow a variety of modifications, including chromosome engineering, the most common application is the conditional deletion of a DNA fragment flanked, e.g., by two <italic>loxP</italic> sites in order to silence or activate a gene. In the most generally applied approach, conditionality of recombination is based on the specificity of the promoter driving the expression of the <italic>cre</italic> gene and, accordingly, recombination will occur dependent on the spatial and temporal activity of the respective promoter. Not withstanding its great potential, this approach has a number of limitations. Thus, the activity spectrum of a promoter depends on a rigid developmental&#x0002f;differentiation program of an organism and, accordingly, as recombination induces irreversible alterations, the final pattern of CRE action will reflect the &#x02018;history&#x02019; of a promoter&#x02019;s activity throughout development. While such a cummulative recombination pattern may be of interest in some studies, it diminishes the precision of the approach in others. Moreover, as CRE will act whenever a respective promoter becomes active in a particular tissue&#x0002f;cell type, it will not be possible to induce recombination at a later time in the lifespan of an animal, thus preventing a thorough study of the unperturbed state in the same individual. Finally, there is increasing evidence that by recognizing pseudo <italic>loxP</italic> sites within the mouse genome, CRE can cause undesired recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c5">5</xref>). Even if such recombinations occur at a low rate, the outcome will depend on the intracellular concentration of CRE and the duration of its expression.</p><p>Obviously, controlling CRE activity from outside at will would enhance the scope of the technology significantly as numerous attempts demonstrate. Two approaches have primarily been followed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c2">2</xref>): controlling either the transcription of the <italic>cre</italic> gene or the activity of CRE itself. Both principles have been applied with some success, but problems concerning the general applicability have remained. They were connected with the inducers of the control systems (interferon, synthetic steroids such as tamoxifen and Ru486), the diminished enzymatic activity of the CRE fusion proteins and the tightness of the control systems over long periods of time. The latter parameter is particularly important in the study of long-lived cells as recombination events, caused by leakiness of the control system, accumulate over time.</p><p>When properly set up, the Tet regulatory system allows tight control of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c7">7</xref>) and indeed control of CRE via doxycycline (Dox) has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c10">10</xref>). The approach of Utomo <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c9">9</xref>) seems particularly attractive in this context. Here, a single vector encodes two transcription units, of which one contains the gene of a tetracycline controlled transactivator (tTA or rtTA) driven by a cell type specific promoter, whereas the other one encodes CRE controlled by the tTA&#x0002f;rtTA responsive promoter P<sub>tet</sub>-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c7">7</xref>). Mouse lines derived with this vector were shown to control CRE activity satisfactorily in the expected tissues. Nevertheless, like other regulatory systems which function via promoter activation, the tightness and range of regulation of the Tet system depends strictly on the genomic locus where the P<sub>tet</sub> controlled transcription unit is integrated. For example, enhancers which may act over considerable distances can activate the minimal promoter within P<sub>tet</sub> when located near the integration site. One would, therefore, predict that the Utomo vector will function in some, but not in other settings.</p><p>Here, we describe an alternative strategy which is based on a mouse line, designated LC-1, that contains a P<sub>tet</sub>-<italic>cre</italic> transcription unit integrated in an appropriate chromosomal locus and which exhibits remarkable properties: when used to generate triple transgenic animals,which also contain the <italic>lacz</italic> gene silenced by a <italic>loxP</italic> flanked Stop sequence (ROSA <italic>R26R</italic> line) and which produce rtTA or tTA in various tissues, no CRE mediated recombination is detected via X-gal staining in the uninduced state during development and during at least 14 months of adulthood. In contrast, upon induction, efficient recombination occurs in all tissues examined. Moreover, there is apparently no position effect variegation (PEV) connected with the LC-1 locus.</p><p>Considering the rapidly increasing number of mouse lines producing tTA or rtTA in a wide variety of tissues&#x0002f;cell types (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c11">11</xref>) and the large &#x02018;zoo&#x02019; of mouse lines with <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c12">12</xref>), the LC-1 line will allow researchers to exploit both pools to generate animals where CRE activity is subjected to Tet control. Even though the breeding of triple transgenic mice will be somewhat demanding, it permits, however, to obtain the desired animals without generating and characterizing a new transgenic line.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA constructs</title><p>The bidirectional transcripton unit (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f1">1</xref>) encoding the <italic>cre</italic> and the luciferase (<italic>luc</italic>) gene under the control of the promoter P<sub>tet</sub>bi-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c13">13</xref>) was derived as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c14">14</xref>).

The <italic>lacz</italic> gene was identified analogously using internal primers (see above).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Generation of a mouse line controlling CRE recombinase</title><p>To facilitate the identification of founder lines where the <italic>cre</italic> gene is regulated tightly and over a suitable range, the bidirectional promoter P<sub>tet</sub>bi-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c13">13</xref>) was used to coregulate the <italic>cre</italic> and the <italic>luc</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f1">1</xref>). Upon transfer of the respective DNA construct into mice, seven founder lines were obtained which transmitted the transgene stably. Animals of these lines were crossed with rTA<sup>CMV</sup>-3 mice which produce rtTA in all organs where the activity of the human cytomegalovirus promoter IE (P<sub>hCMV</sub>) is supported (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f2">2</xref>) including muscle, pancreas, thymus, kidney and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c17">17</xref>). Monitoring the luciferase activity in the various organs in presence and absence of Dox revealed the LC-1 line (TCL-1, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c14">14</xref>) as a most promising one: in the OFF state, i.e. in absence of Dox, luciferase activity was barely or not at all detected in any organ. In contrast, when Dox was supplied (2 mg&#x0002f;ml in drinking water), it was induced to levels reflecting the activity of P<sub>hCMV</sub> in the respective organs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f2">2</xref>). Moreover, when LC-1 mice were crossed with animals of the TA<sup>LAP</sup>-2 line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c17">17</xref>), a hepatocyte specific tTA mouse line, luciferase was induced to high levels exclusively in the liver (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f2">2</xref>). In all other lines, luciferase was also barely detectable in the uninduced state. However, it was inducible to only low levels when compared to LC-1. One of these lines expressed the <italic>cre</italic> transgene transiently during embryonal development, mediating the complete deletion of <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked substrates even in the absence of the rtTA transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of a mouse line expressing rtTA2<sup>S</sup>-S2 under the control of the LAP promoter</title><p>The promoter of the liver enriched activator protein, P<sub>LAP</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c16">16</xref>), can give rise to hepatocyte specific expression when ectopically inserted in transgenic mice, as previously shown with the mouse lines TA<sup>LAP</sup>-1 and TA<sup>LAP</sup>-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c17">17</xref>) which produce tTA in a highly hepatocyte specific manner. For various reasons, we were interested in generating an analogous mouse line that expresses rtTA instead of tTA in hepatocytes. Thus, the fusion between P<sub>LAP</sub> and the gene encoding the novel transactivator rtTA2<sup>S</sup>-S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c15">15</xref>) was used for transgenesis resulting in seven DNA positive animals of which five transmitted the transgene. When crossed with individuals of the LC-1 line, noninvasive luciferase monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c23">23</xref>) in presence and absence of Dox (2 mg&#x0002f;ml in drinking water) revealed four lines where the luciferase gene was not activatable. By contrast, in one line designated rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1 the antibiotic induced high activity. When luciferase was measured in extracts of isolated organs of double transgenic rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1&#x0002f;LC-1 mice, high values were, as expected, found in liver, but also in kidney. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f2">2</xref>, in absence of Dox, luciferase values are at the level of instrumental background (&#x0223c;1 r.l.u.&#x0002f;&#x000b5;g protein). Upon induction by Dox, all organ extracts examined show a low luciferase activity which is, however, 2 to 3 orders of magnitude below the values observed in liver and kidney. Our data show that the <italic>luc</italic> gene is shut off tightly in the non-induced state in all tissues, while, upon induction, it is activated over 3 to 5 orders of magnitude in liver and kidney, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f2">2</xref>). Examination of rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1&#x0002f;nZL-2 double transgenic animals where the <italic>lacz</italic> gene is under control of P<sub>tet</sub>bi-1 revealed that every hepatocyte is stained demonstrating that in rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1 mice P<sub>LAP</sub> is not subjected to position effect variegation in the liver (data not shown). Moreover, induction of luciferase expression in rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1&#x0002f;LC-1 animals is rapid as luciferase activity can be monitored within 1 h after i.p. injection of 2 mg of Dox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Doxycycline controlled CRE expression</title><p>Even though it was anticipated that <italic>cre</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> are co-regulated by Dox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c23">23</xref>), the usefulness of the LC-1 mouse line obviously depends on the tightness of CRE expression in the OFF state and the intracellular level of CRE upon induction which would ensure efficient recombination at the target site. By using the <italic>R26R</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c20">20</xref>) indicator mouse line where constitutive &#x003b2;-galactosidase synthesis via the endogenous <italic>ROSA26</italic> promoter is prevented at the transcriptional level by a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked stop sequence, we have examined the functional CRE background of the LC-1 mouse line. Thus, LC-1&#x0002f;<italic>R26R</italic> double transgenic animals were histologically analyzed for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity at day E14 of embryonic development (data not shown) and through adulthood. As exemplified in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f3">3</xref>, no signs of recombination were detected in several up to 14-month-old animals in any tissue examined, confirming the tight control of the bidirectional transcription unit in the LC-1 locus as already indicated by the barely detectable luciferase activities in LC-1 animals.</p><p>The same picture emerges when triple transgenic animals, where tTA or rtTA is expressed tissue-specifically, are examined in the OFF state. As exemplified for liver, kidney and lung, there is no sign of recombination in rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1&#x0002f;LC-1&#x0002f;<italic>R26R</italic> animals in the OFF state as shown by <italic>in situ</italic> &#x003b2;-galactosidase monitoring (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f4">4</xref>) and by PCR of respective DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f5">5</xref>). In contrast, two i.p. injections (2 mg of Dox each) spaced 24 h apart convert the inactive <italic>lacz</italic> into an active gene within less than 48 h via recombination (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f5">5</xref>). This experiment revealed that in the rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1 mouse line the transactivator is produced not only in hepatocytes but also in some additional rather well defined cell populations of the kidney such as the cortical proximal tubules and of TAL profiles of the inner stripe. Moreover, there is also sporadic expression in a minor fraction of bronchial epithelial cells which, however, do not include clara or mucous epithelial cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f4">4</xref>). This particular pattern of CRE activity is obviously due to position effects governing the activity of the LAP promoter in the rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1 mouse line, as comparisons with TA<sup>LAP</sup>-1 and TA<sup>LAP</sup>-2 mouse lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c17">17</xref>) confirm (data not shown). The high levels of luciferase activity (r.l.u.&#x0002f;&#x000b5;g) detected in the kidney, where only a fraction of cells produce the transactivator, suggest that a lower expression of the transactivator in hepatocytes of rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1 animals may limit luciferase expression. This phenomenon has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c17">17</xref>).</p><p>When LC-1 mice were crossed with individuals of the TA<sup>CamK</sup>-1 mouse line (line B in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c24">24</xref>) which constitutively produce tTA in neurons of the forebrain, Dox dependent co-regulation of CRE and luciferase expression was demonstrated by assaying luciferase activity in tissue extracts and by immunostaining of CRE <italic>in situ</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Accessibility of the LC-1 locus for tTA&#x0002f;rtTA</title><p>Detailed analysis of liver sections as depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f4">4</xref> shows that in rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1&#x0002f;LC-1&#x0002f;<italic>R26R</italic> animals, recombination has occurred in every hepatocyte. Obviously, none of the three mouse lines gives rise to position effect variegation in hepatocytes implying that every hepatocyte produces rtTA which, when activated by Dox, can access the respective LC-1 locus to express CRE which in turn is capable of catalyzing a recombination event at the ROSA26 locus in every cell. These results show that at least in hepatocytes the LC-1 mouse line is not subjected to PEV and that CRE levels are induced that lead to a rapid and complete deletion of an appropriately <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked DNA segment. This reasoning is supported by data obtained with two sets of triple transgenic animals (TA<sup>LAP</sup>-1&#x0002f;LC-1&#x0002f;pol&#x003b2;<sup>flox</sup> and &#x000b5;EG2&#x0002f;LC-1&#x0002f;pol&#x003b2;<sup>flox</sup>) where complete deletion of the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked beta polymerase was demonstrated in hepatocytes and T lymphocytes by Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c14">14</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we describe two transgenic mouse lines of which the first one, the LC-1, allows us to superimpose an effective and reliable temporal control onto CRE mediated recombination via the Tet regulatory system, whereas the second one, the rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1, confines Tet regulation via rtTA rather exclusively to hepatocytes, some subsets of kidney cells and a minute population of cells in the bronchial epithel.</p><p>The LC-1 mouse line will expand the applications of conditional mutagenesis. A prerequisite for regulating a gene of interest such as the <italic>cre</italic> gene tightly and over a sufficient range is the integration of the P<sub>tet</sub>-<italic>cre</italic> transcription unit into an appropriate chromosomal site, where no outside activation of P<sub>tet</sub> occurs while high levels of expression can be achieved upon induction. Indeed, the locus identified in our LC-1 mouse lines appears to fulfill all criteria required.</p><p>First, with the exception discussed below, we have not detected CRE recombination in any tissue and at any time during development and adulthood of up to 14-month-old LC-1&#x0002f;<italic>R26R</italic> double transgenic animals demonstrating that the bidirectional <italic>cre&#x02013;luc</italic> transcription unit embedded in the LC-1 locus generates no or only subfunctional and, thus, negligible amounts of CRE which agrees with the barely measurable luciferase activities monitored in the various organs of the animals. Corresponding results were obtained with rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1&#x0002f;LC-1&#x0002f;<italic>R26R</italic> triple transgenic mice. Thus, in the OFF state the LC-1 locus appears to be ubiquitously silent.</p><p>Second, expression of CRE and luciferase is inducible in all cell types and tissues examined. For example, by crossing LC-1 mice with individuals of the rTA<sup>CMV</sup>-3 line, luciferase activity is detected in all tissues&#x0002f;organs where P<sub>hCMV</sub> is known to be active (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c17">17</xref>). Moreover, luciferase is induced in hepatocytes, neurons, kidney cells and T lymphocytes as analyses of respective LC-1 double transgenic animals show. In the LC-1 locus, the <italic>cre</italic> and the <italic>luc</italic> gene are transcribed at about the same rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c23">23</xref>). It, therefore, can be safely assumed that CRE is produced in all cells where luciferase can be monitored. This is supported by immunostaining of CRE which was positive in all tissues analyzed, namely in hepatocytes, neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnf134f6">6</xref>), kidney cells (data not shown) and T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c14">14</xref>). Moreover, in all these cell types, efficient CRE mediated recombination was detected. Therefore, given the present set of data, it appears not unlikely that LC-1 animals are capable of producing CRE and, thus, of mediating recombination in many, possibly all cell types provided that tTA or rtTA is expressed in the respective cell.</p><p>Third, our data obtained with rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1&#x0002f;LC-1&#x0002f;<italic>R26R</italic> mice show that upon induction CRE recombination occurs rapidly in all hepatocytes. Accordingly, the LC-1 locus is accessible for tTA&#x0002f;rtTA in every cell. Similar results were obtained in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (H.Krestel, personal communication). Apparently, the LC-1 locus does not cause PEV in these very different cell types, and it will be interesting to learn from future studies whether absence of PEV will be another general feature of this locus.</p><p>The second mouse line characterized here (rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1) demonstrates that CRE and luciferase controlled by P<sub>tet</sub>bi-1 can be regulated over several orders of magnitude via Dox in highly specific cell populations while not causing any measurable activity of luciferase or CRE in the uninduced state. The finding that in the uninduced state even 6&#x02013;8-month-old triple transgenic animals (rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1&#x0002f;LC-1&#x0002f;<italic>R26R</italic>) show no sign of recombination in cells producing rtTA2<sup>S</sup>-S2 demonstrates the high discrimination potential of this transactivator.</p><p>One observation should, however, not go unmentioned here. We have occasionally detected a very small number of X-gal positive cells in kidney and heart sections of some, but not all individuals of a litter of LC-1&#x0002f;<italic>R26R</italic> double transgenic animals. While this could well be an artefact indicating endogenous activities for X-gal production, it could also reflect individual variations in background activity of the LC-1 locus. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnf134c17">17</xref>), up to 5-fold differences in expression levels can be measured among littermates of transgenic animals. We attribute these differences to epigenetic variations among individuals, a point to be kept in mind when changing the genetic background via breeding.</p><p>In conclusion, the properties of the genomic site, where the P<sub>tet</sub>bi-1 controlled <italic>cre</italic> gene is integrated and co-regulated with the <italic>luc</italic> gene, make the LC-1 mouse line an interesting and probably widely applicable experimental tool for controlling CRE recombination <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the fact that the expression of CRE cannot only be tightly suppressed, thus preventing undesired background, but also induced to high levels may be of particular value. Various reports suggest that recombination efficiency also depends on the topography of the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked DNA within the chromatin context. Short exposure of such sites to high levels of CRE may be a suitable approach for achieving efficient and complete recombination while avoiding side effects of high constitutive levels of recombinase. Finally, considering the two growing &#x02018;zoos&#x02019; of transgenic mouse lines containing either tTA&#x0002f;rtTA genes under the control of various tissue specific promoters or a wide variety of <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked genes, the LC-1 mouse line provides an attractive link for exploiting the two worlds of transgenic mice.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gnf134f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Transcription units incorporated in the LC-1 and rTA<sup>LAP</sup>-1 mouse line, respectively.
