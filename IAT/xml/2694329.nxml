We hypothesized that L-4F reduces adiposity via increased pAMPK, pAKT, HO-1, and increased insulin receptor phosphorylation in ob mice. Obese and lean mice were divided into five groups: lean, lean-L-4F-treated, ob, ob-L-4F-treated, and ob-L-4F-LY294002. Food intake, insulin, glucose adipocyte stem cells, pAMPK, pAKT, CB1, and insulin receptor phosphorylation were determined. Subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were determined by MRI and hepatic lipid content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. SAT and VAT volumes decreased in ob-L-4F-treated animals compared with control. L-4F treatment decreased hepatic lipid content and increased the numbers of small adipocytes (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and phosphorylation of insulin receptors. L-4F decreased CB1 in SAT and VAT and increased pAKT and pAMPK in endothelium. L-4F-mediated improvement in endothelium was prevented by LY294002. Inhibition of pAKT and pAMPK by LY294002 was associated with an increase in glucose levels. Upregulation of HO-1 by L-4F produced adipose remodeling and increased the number of small differentiated adipocytes. The anti-obesity effects of L-4F are manifested by a decrease in visceral fat content with reciprocal increases in adiponectin, pAMPK, pAKT, and phosphorylation of insulin receptors with improved insulin sensitivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>adiponectin</kwd><kwd>adiposity</kwd><kwd>apolipoprotein A-I</kwd><kwd>heme oxygenase-1</kwd><kwd>insulin receptor</kwd><kwd>insulin sensitivity</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>endothelial dysfunction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Published, JLR Papers in Press, March 26, 2009.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Insulin resistance is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes and its associated cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Once hyperglycemia is established, an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurs, resulting in a progressive deterioration in vascular function with an elevation of inflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Obesity is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Obesity and insulin resistance are considered independent predictors of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). However, recent studies have revealed the presence of myocardial perfusion abnormalities, even in the absence of coronary lesions, in patients with asymptomatic diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). This suggests that obesity and diabetes are strongly associated with endothelial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), increased lipolysis, hepatic triglyceride secretion, and sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). SREBPs are the major transcription factors that regulate genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis and are regulated by pAMPK and pAKT in ob mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In addition, activation of the endocannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1 receptor) was shown to increase the hepatic lipogenic transcription factor and fatty acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In visceral adipose tissue, CB1 receptor activity leads to a decrease in adiponectin and an increase in lipogenesis, both of which contribute to insulin resistance.</p><p>Drug therapy for atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and other diseases associated with highly inflammatory states have been shown to either directly or indirectly induce heme oxygenase (HO) activity and increase HO gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). These drugs include aspirin, statins, losartan, immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine A, and a host of other compounds, including 4F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). These 4F compounds are apolipoprotein A1 mimetic peptides, synthesized from either D (D-4F) or L (L-4F) amino acids that enhance the ability of HDL to protect LDL against oxidation in atherosclerotic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Oral administration of D-4F has been reported to reduce atherosclerotic disease independent of cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). D-4F causes HDL to become anti-inflammatory, stimulates HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux, and reverses cholesterol transport from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). D-4F has been reported to reduce SREBP-1c mRNA levels EO6 immunoreactivity and renal inflammation in LDL receptor-null mice fed a Western diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In a sickle cell disease model, apolipoprotein A1 improved vasoreactivity in LDL-receptor null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). L-4F and D-4F improve vascular function and restore the balance between nitric oxide and superoxide anions due to increase in EC-SOD, HO-1, and peNOS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Induction of HO-1 protein results in a marked increase in serum levels of adiponectin and a decrease in the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF and an increase in insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the mechanism of L-4F treatment in the restoration of vascular function by measuring the expression of pAMPK, pAKT, and insulin receptor phosphorylation. L-4F treatment resulted in reduced adiposity, manifested by a decrease in visceral and subcutaneous fat levels, decreased adipogenesis, and the increased presence of smaller insulin sensitive adipocytes via an increase in pAMPK, pAKT, and insulin receptor phosphorylation.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animal protocols</title><p>Male obese (ob) mice (B6v-Lep ob/J) were purchased from Harlan (Chicago, IL) at the age of 7 weeks and used at 8 weeks of age. Age- and sex-matched lean mice (B6.V, lean&#x0003b; Harlan) served as controls. Mice were fed a normal chow diet and had free access to water. Body weight of ob and lean mice at the beginning of the treatment were 34 &#x000b1; 5 g and 26 &#x000b1; 3 g, respectively. Glucose levels were 248 &#x000b1; 21 and 126 &#x000b1; 14 mg/dl for ob and lean mice, respectively. Glucose monitoring was performed using an automated analyzer (Life Scan, Milpitas, CA). Beginning at 9 weeks of age when all ob mice had established diabetes, L-4F (i.e., Ac-D-W-F-K-A-F-Y-D-K-V-A-E-K-F-K-E-A-F-NH<sub>2</sub>) synthesized from <sc>l</sc>-amino acids as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>) was injected at a dose of 200 &#x003bc;g/100 g daily in 200 &#x003bc;l vehicle), or vehicle (ABCT: ammonium bicarbonate buffer at pH 7.4 containing 0.01% Tween 20) were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 6 weeks. At the time of sacrifice, subcutaneous and visceral fat visible in the abdomen, mesenteric fat, fat around the liver, kidney spleen, and heart were dissected free, pooled for each mouse, and weighed. Blood was collected (50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;l) from the tail vein of anesthetized ob mice following administration of either L-4F or vehicle. L-4F treated ob mice were divided into two groups, one treated with L-4F and the P13 kinase AKT inhibitor, LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA) 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-HCl), which was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with PBS and injected i.p. at a dose of 100 mg/kg, three times a week for the last three weeks of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). We have previously shown that LY294004 is an inhibitor of HO-1-mediated cell protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). The second group of ob-L-4F-treated mice were treated with the same volume of vehicle (PMSO+PBS) without LY294002. Six groups of animals were studied: <italic>A</italic>) lean, <italic>B</italic>) lean-L-4F, <italic>C</italic>) lean-L-4F-LY-294002, <italic>D</italic>) ob control, <italic>E</italic>) ob-L-4F, and <italic>F</italic>) ob-L-4F-LY294002. Food intake did not change in the mice in any treatment group. The Animal Care and Use Committee of New York Medical College approved all experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy</title><p>Subcutaneous fat tissue (SAT) and visceral fat tissue (VAT) were determined by MRI, while hepatic fat was determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Mice were imaged in a GE Excite 1.5T scanner using a knee coil with a T1-weighted spin-echo pulse sequence (TEC 9.0 ms, TR = 540ms, NEX = 4, FOVO 8 &#x000d7; 8 cm) and an image size of 224 &#x000d7; 192 pixels. The whole chest and abdomen of each mouse were covered with axial slices (thickness 3 mm, no spacing). Acquired images underwent semiautomatic segmentation of SAT and VAT using the previously validated HIPPO FAT&#x000ae; tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p><p>The software computed three masks (background, fat, and nonfat tissues) using a fuzzy clustering segmentation. External and internal SAT boundaries were then defined by an active contour algorithm that exploited the previously computed masks as external force maps. A third contour was computed surrounding the area where VAT was present together with other tissues. VAT itself was assessed by the automated analysis of the signal histogram in the visceral region previously defined, by identifying the second peak of the signal histogram. This provided whole body volume (including the skeletal and soft tissues), total fat, SAT and VAT volumes, as well as VAT/SAT and fat/body volume ratios.</p></sec><sec><title>Liver lipid measurements</title><p>Localized 1H MRS of the liver was acquired on the GE Excite 1.5T MRI scanner. The liver slice with the largest gross dimensions was chosen for the MRS study. MRS for water and fat quantification was accomplished using a point resolved spectroscopy sequence. After line broadening and phase and baseline correction, the peak area of the water at 4.77 ppm and fat resonance (FR) at 1.40 ppm were measured. Quantification of the fat content was done by comparing the area of the FR with that of the unsuppressed water. Spectroscopic data were processed using the NUTS software. Hepatic fat percentage was calculated by dividing (FR) by the sum of FR and peak area of water. This technique is highly reproducible, with a coefficient of variation &#x0003c;2% in slices studied on eight separate occasions.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of adipocyte cell size, HO-1, and CB1</title><p>Subcutaneous adipose tissue and renal, liver, and aortic visceral fat tissue collected from untreated ob mice and L-4F-treated ob mice (n = 8 mice per group) were prepared for morphological analysis. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, cut into small pieces, and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. The samples were cut by microtome (5 &#x003bc;m thick), mounted on D-polylisinated glass slides, deparaffinizated in xylene, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for the evaluation of adipocyte size or processed for CB-1 or HO-1 immunohistochemistry. Immunostaining for CB-1 was carried out using a goat polyclonal anti-CB-1 primary antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and HO-1 immunostaining was carried out using a rabbit polyclonal anti-HO-1 primary antibody (Stressgen Bioreagents, Victoria, BC, Canada). For each experimental group, five sections per animal were stained. Sections were immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide and diluted in methanol for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were preincubated with 3% horse serum for 60 min followed by primary antibody anti-CB-1 diluted 1:125 for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The sections were then washed in TBS (0.1 M), incubated 30 min at room temperature with biotinylated horse anti-goat immunoglobulin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC complex&#x0003b; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The reaction product was visualized using hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as the chromogen. All slides were dehydrated and mounted in DPX (Sigma-Aldrich). Negative controls for primary antibody with nonimmune serum revealed no signal.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of CB-1 and HO-1 fat</title><p>CB-1 and HO-1 staining intensity was computed as integrated optical density (IOD).

This is manifested by a decrease in both SAT and VAT, a decrease in hepatic lipid content, and the presence of increased numbers of adipocytes with smaller cell size. MRI and MRS showed that treatment with L-4F resulted in a reciprocal decrease in visceral fat with improvement in vascular dysfunction as determined by the levels of pAMPK, pAKT, and phosphorylation of insulin receptors. Thus, L-4F appears capable of reprogramming vascular tissue and adipocytes in a manner that results in the expression of a new phenotype that contains adipocytes of reduced cell size with restored insulin sensitivity. Four observations substantiate this conclusion.</p><p>First, the L-4F-mediated prevention of visceral and subcutaneous fat accumulation, measured by MRI, is consistent with the observed decrease in hepatic lipid content. The decrease in lipid content is also consistent with the finding that L-4F treatment produced an elevation of the phosphorylation of insulin receptors at multiple sites (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). The decrease in visceral and subcutaneous fat levels was paralleled by an increase in the number of smaller adipocytes, which are regarded as &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; insulin-sensitive adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Thus, it appears that L-4F acts by preventing the adipocytes from increasing in size. Larger adipocytes appear to die off as their size increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), and the beneficial action of L-4F can be seen in lipid droplets that are smaller in size and with reduced hepatic lipid content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Abdominal fat mass is regarded as a predictor of cardiovascular risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), which may be a result of obesity-mediated systemic inflammation with inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6, and IL-1, which are markedly elevated in obese rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). There is a direct proportionality of the degree of visceral adiposity and endothelial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>).</p><p>Second, L-4F treatment decreased serum IL-1&#x003b2; and CB1 receptor. The metabolic syndrome and obesity are characterized by increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, which decrease insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). CB1 receptors in mice increase hepatic lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Therefore, the L-4F-mediated decreases in the levels of IL-1&#x003b2; and CB1 receptors may contribute to the observed increase in insulin sensitivity. In addition, downregulation of the peripheral endocannabinoid system, CB1, may contribute to the weight loss as well.</p><p>Third, L-4F administration has been shown to increase HO-1 protein levels and adiponectin both in vitro and in vivo. Decreased levels of serum adiponectin are the result of an increase in the levels of ROS and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Previous studies have shown that increased levels of HO-1 protein caused a marked increase in serum adiponectin levels in Zucker fat rats and ob mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). An increase in adiponectin levels is an indication of improvement in the metabolic syndrome that, in turn, leads to increased insulin sensitivity and a subsequent decrease in arterial disease and heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). This supports the concept that expansion of adipogenesis leads to an increased number of adipocytes of smaller cell size. Smaller adipocytes are considered to be healthy, insulin-sensitive adipocyte cells that are capable of producing adiponectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). While increases in obesity and diabetes are considered a risk factor for cardiovascular complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), improvement in the diabetic phenotype, including improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, may occur through increased preadipocyte differentiation and increased adiponectin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, the remarkable action of L-4F treatment in increased pAKT, pAMPK, and phosphorylation of insulin receptors is associated in an improvement in glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance is an independent factor for the development of vascular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). Therefore, L-4F treatment improves vascular function on the basis of increases in both insulin sensitivity and insulin receptor phosphorylation. Others have shown that increased phosphorylation of insulin receptors and vascular function may be a response to the increase in pAMPK and pAKT crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). Further activation of pAMPK and pAKT increases glucose transport fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). In this study, inhibition of pAKT by LY294002 administration in L-4F-treated mice reversed glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. We previously reported that LY294002 inhibition of the AKT pathways prevented HO-1 in ameliorating cell protection against ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). However, LY294002 administration in vivo inhibited both AKT and AMPK and decreased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. pAKT and AMPK act as fuel sensors in the regulation of energy balance, and the resultant crosstalk of AMPK-AKT has been shown to regulate nitric oxide bioavailability and vascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>). Furthermore, activated AMPK alone has been suggested as a therapeutic target to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>). Thus, the novel effect of L-4F on the HO-1-adiponectin-pAKT-pAMPK-module (i.e., an increase in HO-1) increases adiponectin, and the subsequent increase in AKT-AMPK crosstalk and signaling pathway provides a beneficial mechanistic basis for L-4F-mediated vascular protection. L-4F treatment offers great potential as a drug that could be employed therapeutically to address the metabolic derangements associated with obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and insulin-resistant diabetes to restore vascular function.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>FR, fat resonance</p></list-item><list-item><p>HO, heme oxygenase</p></list-item><list-item><p>IOD, integrated optical density</p></list-item><list-item><p>i.p., intraperitoneally</p></list-item><list-item><p>MRS, magnetic resonance spectroscopy</p></list-item><list-item><p>MSC, mesenchymal stem cell</p></list-item><list-item><p>ob, obese</p></list-item><list-item><p>ROS, reactive oxygen species</p></list-item><list-item><p>SAT, subcutaneous fat tissue</p></list-item><list-item><p>SREBP-1, sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1</p></list-item><list-item><p>VAT, visceral fat tissue</p></list-item></list></glossary><ack><p>The authors are indebted to Dr. Attallah Kappas and the Beatrice Renfield Foundation for their support.
