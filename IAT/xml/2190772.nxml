Using a multifaceted approach, we have investigated the global responses to Cd and other relevant stresses (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and Fe) in the model cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis </italic>PCC6803.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that cells respond to the Cd stress in a two main temporal phases process. In the "early" phase cells mainly limit Cd entry through the negative and positive regulation of numerous genes operating in metal uptake and export, respectively. As time proceeds, the number of responsive genes increases. In this "massive" phase, Cd downregulates most genes operating in (i) photosynthesis (PS) that normally provides ATP and NADPH; (ii) assimilation of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur that requires ATP and NAD(P)H; and (iii) translation machinery, a major consumer of ATP and nutrients. Simultaneously, many genes are upregulated, such as those involved in Fe acquisition, stress tolerance, and protein degradation (crucial to nutrients recycling). The most striking common effect of Cd and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is the disturbance of both light tolerance and Fe homeostasis, which appeared to be interdependent. Our results indicate that cells challenged with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>or Cd use different strategies for the same purpose of supplying Fe atoms to Fe-requiring metalloenzymes and the SUF machinery, which synthesizes or repairs Fe-S centers. Cd-stressed cells preferentially breakdown their Fe-rich PS machinery, whereas H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-challenged cells preferentially accelerate the intake of Fe atoms from the medium.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We view the responses to Cd as an integrated "Yin Yang" reprogramming of the whole metabolism, we found to be controlled by the Slr1738 regulator. As the Yin process, the ATP- and nutrients-sparing downregulation of anabolism limits the poisoning incorporation of Cd into metalloenzymes. As the compensatory Yang process, the PS breakdown liberates nutrient assimilates for the synthesis of Cd-tolerance proteins, among which we found the Slr0946 arsenate reductase enzyme.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Photosynthetic organisms that support much of the life on Earth, in using solar energy to renew the oxygenic atmosphere and make up organic assimilates essential to the food chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] are frequently challenged with toxic <underline>r</underline>eactive <underline>o</underline>xygen <underline>s</underline>pecies (ROS) generated by respiration and photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and toxic metals that constitute persistent pollutants because they cannot be degraded. One of them, Cadmium (Cd), is very abundant in the environment as it is often combined with sulfur in Earth's crust, and it is also intensively spread out as (i) a by-product of zinc mining, (ii) the burning of fossil fuel, (iii) the dispersal of sewage sludge and phosphate fertilizers, and (vi) the manufacturing of paints, batteries and screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Subsequently, Cd can be transferred to the food chain, and bio-accumulated in human where it has a half-life greater than 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and causes various diseases by as yet unclear processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Even metals that are essential to enzyme activity, such as zinc and iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], can become toxic when occurring in excess. This toxicity is likely due to the poisoning replacement of the cognate metal cofactor of diverse metalloenzymes, a phenomenon sometimes leading to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Cyanobacteria, the most abundant photosynthetic organisms on Earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], are attractive models to investigate the interrelations between metal toxicity and oxidative stress, because they perform the two metal-requiring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] ROS-generating processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], photosynthesis and respiration, in the same membrane system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, cyanobacteria share a wide range of genes in common with plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], in agreement with they being the likely ancestor of chloroplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, lessons learned from stress responses in cyanobacteria will also greatly facilitate the understanding of how plant cells face environmental challenges. This is important, as Cd has been reported to be toxic to plants by as yet unknown processes that may [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or may not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] impair photosynthesis. Moreover, cyanobacteria are also suitable for biosensor and/or bioremediation applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Using the model cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis </italic>PCC6803 that possesses a small genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] fully sequenced, and easily manipulable with replicating plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we have analyzed the global responses of photosynthetic cells challenged with Cd, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(the paradigm ROS agent) or drastic changes of availability of either Fe or Zn, through (i) DNA microarrays; (ii) absorption spectroscopy; (iii) oxygen evolution; (iv) Western blot; (v) targeted gene inactivation and (vi) assays of cell fitness. We show that Cd triggers a "Yin Yang" integrated reorganization of the cyanobacterial metabolism, under the control of the Slr1738 regulator. The "Yin" ATP-sparing downregulation of cell metabolism likely limits Cd uptake and poisoning incorporation in place of the cognate metal cofactor of metalloenzymes. The compensatory "Yang" breakdown of the photosynthetic machinery that impairs ATP production, liberates nutrient assimilates that become available for the synthesis of Cd-toxicity protecting enzymes, among which we found the Slr0946 arsenate reductase.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transcriptional regulations elicited by Cd are slower and more sustained than those triggered by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></title><p>The transcriptome approach was used to characterize the kinetics of global changes in <italic>Synechocystis </italic>PCC6803 (<italic>Synechocystis</italic>) gene expression elicited by noxious agents, which were continuously applied to the cells to mimic the persistent character of stresses encountered in Nature. Exponentially growing cells were exposed to CdSO<sub>4 </sub>(50 &#x003bc;M) or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(3 mM) for increasing periods of time that triggered a wide range of changes in cellular viability (from 100% to less than 10%) and regulation (number of responsive genes and magnitude of changes in expression), as required for a thorough investigation of stress responses (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). For each time point, total RNA were isolated from stressed and unstressed cells, reverse-transcribed, differentially labeled (dye swapped), hybridized together (stressed versus unstressed samples) and analyzed with DNA glass microarrays (two slides per each time point), as described in Methods. Our data (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) showed that the Cd-elicited regulation could be divided in two main temporal phases. The early phase was moderate since only 151 genes responded to Cd during the first 60 min of treatment, and the changes were mostly up-regulation. The second phase occurring between 90 to 360 min of treatment was massive, with about 1,222 responsive genes equally distributed between up- and down-regulated genes. The relevance of the "early" and "massive" phases of Cd responses was verified by performing an independent biological repeat of both the time points 60 min (early phase) and 300 min (massive phase), and using an appropriate statistical test (Methods) to analyze all data (see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Indeed, a large number of the Cd-regulated genes (791) appeared to be differentially expressed between the two temporal phases of responses.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Influence of Stress on the Viability and Global Transcription Profile</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Treatment</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="10"><bold>Cadmium</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="5"><bold>Hydrogen peroxide</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Fe depletion</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Fe excess</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Zn excess</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>[C]</italic></td><td align="center" colspan="10"><italic>50 &#x003bc;M</italic></td><td align="center" colspan="5"><italic>3 mM</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>2-0</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>1-0</italic></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><italic>16 mM</italic></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><italic>776 &#x003bc;M</italic></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Time (min)</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>15</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>30</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>60</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>75</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>90</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>180</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>300</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>300'</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>360</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>960</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>15</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>30</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>180</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>300</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>420</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>2,800</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>2,800</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>240</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>360</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>30</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>240</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="22"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">% survival</td><td align="right">100</td><td align="right">98</td><td align="right">90</td><td align="right">88</td><td align="right">85</td><td align="right">70</td><td align="right">57</td><td align="right">59</td><td align="right">43</td><td align="right">&#x0003c;10</td><td align="right">100</td><td align="right">98</td><td align="right">64</td><td align="right">45</td><td align="right">19</td><td align="right">55</td><td align="right">43</td><td align="right">80</td><td align="right">15</td><td align="right">99</td><td align="right">70</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Induced genes</td><td align="right">22</td><td align="right">88</td><td align="right">46</td><td align="right">52</td><td align="right">293</td><td align="right">299</td><td align="right">310</td><td align="right">451</td><td align="right">283</td><td align="right">51</td><td align="right">447</td><td align="right">408</td><td align="right">170</td><td align="right">68</td><td align="right">75</td><td align="right">106</td><td align="right">154</td><td align="right">42</td><td align="right">34</td><td align="right">38</td><td align="right">245</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Repressed gene</td><td align="right">8</td><td align="right">17</td><td align="right">10</td><td align="right">13</td><td align="right">250</td><td align="right">315</td><td align="right">328</td><td align="right">439</td><td align="right">310</td><td align="right">26</td><td align="right">490</td><td align="right">478</td><td align="right">92</td><td align="right">12</td><td align="right">55</td><td align="right">104</td><td align="right">109</td><td align="right">98</td><td align="right">100</td><td align="right">22</td><td align="right">221</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Wild type cells were challenged for the indicated durations prior to survival and transcriptome analyses (Methods).

Concerning the Fe-starvation stress, we choose to study the responses to a continuous Fe limitation because stresses occurring in Nature are durable, whereas Singh and co-workers studied cells recovering from a transient Fe deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This presumably explains the fact that we observed the induction of a larger number of Fe acquisition genes than the previous workers.

Fifth, consistent with the Cd-elicited induction of the arsenate reductase gene <italic>arsC </italic>(see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel C) we showed that <italic>arsC </italic>operates in Cd tolerance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Thus, the ArsC enzyme has a great biotechnological potential in contributing to the tolerance to two widespread persistent pollutants: arsenic and cadmium. Possibly the ArsC enzyme, which employed glutathione (GSH) and glutaredoxin as reductants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], could somehow "sequester" Cd in generating an hypothetical GSH-Cd complex less toxic than Cd. Sixth, as inferred from the Cd-elicited upregulation of numerous high light-inducible genes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel A) we showed that Cd decreases the tolerance to light (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Seventh, as anticipated from its Cd-elicited induction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel C) we demonstrated that the Slr1738 regulator mediates several responses that are crucial to protection against Cd, such as the decline of the PS machinery and the upregulation of the <italic>arsC </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p><p>The occurrence of large clusters of co-regulated genes, encoding ribosome, ATPase or Fe uptake proteins, suggests a mechanism of global control of gene expression involving chromosomal structure, similarly to chromatin remodeling in eukaryotic cells. This prediction is comforted by the findings (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) that the <italic>Synechocystis </italic>HU and Dps nucleoprotein genes, possibly involved in such structure-dependent global regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], are regulated by Cd (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>), positively (HU, sll1712) or negatively (Dps, slr1894).</p><p>Many of our data support the notion of metal selectivity. For examples, (i) Fe but not Zn mimicked the Cd-mediated downregulation of N acquisition and assimilation genes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel F); and (ii) Zn but not Fe mimicked the Cd-mediated decline of the PS machinery (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) and the downregulation of ribosomal genes which is therefore not a general stress response. By contrast, numerous genes responded the same way to Cd, Fe, Zn and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>), suggesting that reactive oxygen species might act in signal transduction of stress responses, as proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>Both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and Cd were found to upregulate numerous genes operating in tolerance to oxidative stress (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel D) and to the related high light stress (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel B) that also generates toxic <underline>r</underline>eactive <underline>o</underline>xygen <underline>s</underline>pecies (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These findings, which were anticipated in the case of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>stress, were confirmed by showing that both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and Cd render cells light sensitive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In addition, both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and Cd upregulated the <italic>suf </italic>genes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel D) involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis or repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and the Fe uptake genes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel C; all genes in the case of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and half of them in the case of Cd). Consistently, we found that increasing the concentration of Fe in the medium increases the cell tolerance to both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and Cd (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These results are reminiscent to what occurs in oxidative-stressed <italic>E. coli </italic>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. They suggest that <italic>Synechocystis </italic>challenged with either H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>or Cd accelerates Fe uptake strongly (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or moderately (Cd) to provide extra Fe atoms for the repair of damaged Fe-S clusters. Having also noticed that Cd triggers a larger breakdown of the Fe-rich PS machinery than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we believe that cells challenged with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>or Cd use two strategies to provide extra Fe atoms to the machinery that synthesizes or repairs Fe-S centers. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells undergoing a limited PS-decline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) mostly accelerate the intake of Fe from the medium, while Cd-stressed cells that moderately increase Fe intake breakdown a part of their abundant PS machinery (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), which normally contains 21&#x02013;23 Fe atoms per PS unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Consequently, we predicted, and confirmed, that increasing the availability of Fe limits the Cd-elicited decline of the PS-machinery (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Many of the key genes involved in acquisition and metabolism of C, N and S that were downregulated by Cd and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>are coding for ATP-consuming enzymes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panels E and F). These responses can be viewed as an ATP-sparing process used by the cells to compensate for the decreased production of ATP caused by the decline of the PS apparatus (Cd and to a lesser extent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or of the respiration machinery (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>but not Cd downregulates cytochrome oxidase genes, See TableS4B). Similarly, the downregulation of ribosomal genes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel A) encoding normally abundant proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] triggered by cells facing Cd and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is likely aimed at sparing C, N and S nutrients to compensate for the downregulation of the corresponding acquisition and assimilation genes.</p><p>Based on the presently reported findings, we view the responses to a continuous Cd stress as a two temporal-phases process. In the early phase occurring during the first 60 min of exposure (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), Cd-stressed cells regulate mainly the genes operating in metal transport (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel C) and protein maturation and degradation (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> panel A). These responses presumably limit Cd entry into the cells and incorporation in place of the cognate metal cofactor of metalloproteins. In prolonged exposures (after 60 min.), these regulations are conserved, and even amplified in term of the number of responsive processes, thereby defining the next phase designated as "massive" for this reason. At this stage, the responses to Cd can be viewed as an integrated "Yin Yang" reprogramming of the whole cellular metabolism. As the Yin process, most key genes operating in uptake and assimilation of inorganic nutrients (C, N and S) and protein synthesis are turned down. These responses allow (i) the sparing of both energy (ATP) and reducing power (NAD(P)H) normally consumed by nutrient assimilation and subsequent metabolism, and (ii) the limitation of the poisoning incorporation of Cd in metalloenzymes. As the compensatory Yang process, the PS breakage of the PS machinery, which decreases the production of both ATP and NADPH, liberates Fe and C, N and S nutrient assimilates that can be recycled into the synthesis of Cd-tolerance enzymes such as the ArsC arsenate reductase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and, presumably, other Cd-inducible enzymes: Suf proteins (see above), flavodoxin (IsiB), ferredoxin (FedII), flavoproteins (Flv2 and Flv4), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx1), peroxiredoxin (Ahpc-like), thioredoxin (TrxA), hydrogenase subunits (HypA, D, E) and the ZiaA (the ATPase homologous to the cadmium export ATPase of other organisms). Furthermore, other new Cd-tolerance enzymes might be discovered in the future, among the product of the orphan genes which apperaed to be upregulated by Cd (see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). We showed that the Cd-induced Slr1738 regulator (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and TableS4) plays a central role in the protection against Cd (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) in mediating several of the important regulations, such as the breakage of the PS machinery, the downregulation of ribosomal genes, and the upregulation of the <italic>arsC </italic>arsenate reductase and <italic>suf </italic>genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis </italic>PCC6803 as a model organism, we analyzed the global responses of environmentally important cells to stresses triggered by Cd (an abundant persistant pollutant), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(the paradigm ROS agent), or drastic changes in Fe availability, which appeared to modulate the tolerance to Cd and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Our results indicate that cells challenged with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>or Cd use different strategies for the same purpose of increasing the supply of Fe atoms to the synthesis and repair of Fe-requiring metalloenzymes. While H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-challenged cells preferentially accelerate Fe intake, Cd-stressed cells preferentially breakdown the Fe-rich PS machinery to liberate Fe atoms. We view the responses to Cd as an integrated "Yin Yang" metabolic reprogramming. As the "Yin" process, the ATP- and nutrients-sparing downregulation of anabolism limits the poisoning incorporation of Cd into metalloenzymes. As the compensatory "Yang" process, the PS breakdown liberates nutrient assimilates for the synthesis of Cd-tolerance proteins. We found that this reprogramming is mediated by the Slr1738 transcriptional regulator that also operates in oxidative stress tolerance, in agreement with its sequence homology with the peroxide resistance regulator of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Further studies will be necessary to understand the influence of Cd and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>on the activity of Slr1738.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, growth and survival analyses</title><p>The unicellular cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis </italic>PCC6803 was grown as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] at 30&#x000b0;C in liquid BG11 medium enriched with Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>(3.78 mM, final concentration), under continuous white light of standard fluence (2,500 luxes, i.e. 31.25 &#x003bc;E.m<sup>-2</sup>.s<sup>-1</sup>).

Then, plates were incubated for the indicated times (in min) prior to cell harvest and fast disruption with an Eaton press. Iron depletion analyses were performed with liquid cell suspensions to avoid uncontrolled liberation of Fe atoms from agar.

Test RNA (from stressed cells) and corresponding control RNA (untreated cultures) were reverse transcribed, differentially labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes and hybridized in a replicate dye swap. Arrays were immediately scanned with a GenePix&#x02122; 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments), and images were analyzed with GenePixTM Pro 4.0 (Molecular Devices). Spots were considered when they lack blemishes, deformations or dusts, and their fluorescence signal exceeded the local background plus 2 standard deviations. Then, signal intensity was determined by subtracting local background of each spot (GenePix&#x02122; Pro 4.0). Each GenePix Result file (.GPR) was converted to a TIGR Array viewer file (.TAV) using TIGR ExpressConverter version 1.7 for signal analysis.

Normalized measures served to compute the ratios of Cy3/Cy5 intensity and the associated log2-transform (denote log2-ratios) for each gene. For each replicated dye-swap, the average expression ratio of a given gene is calculated as the geometric mean of the two ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p><p>Three lines of evidences attested the quality of our data. First our normalization method was validated with both internal (positive: <italic>Synechocystis </italic>DNA; negative: Salmon sperm DNA) and external (human TFR mRNA) controls. Second, for each dye-swap, correlation coefficients calculated between both replicates (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>) appeared to be greater than 0.9 in most cases, thereby attesting the within-study reproducibility. Third, to analyze the within-platform variations, Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs were prepared from a single preparation of total RNA from unstressed cells, mixed together and hybridized to a microarray. The distribution of expression ratio ((see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>) showed that 90% of them fall within the range (0.80 &#x02013; 1.25) and 99% within the range (0.64 &#x02013; 1.57). Moreover, the mean of this distribution is equal to 1.00 (standard deviation equal to 0.13). Consequently, we felt confident to regard as regulated any particular gene the expression level of which was changed at least 1.9 fold.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the two temporal phases of the responses to Cd and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></title><p>We have considered each cDNA array as a split replicate, without averaging the dye-swap values. For each stress, the microarray data were dispatched in two groups each corresponding to a presumed kinetic phase. In the case of Cd the first group of data (15 mins to 60 mins) contains 8 replicates and the second (90 min to 360 min) contains 10 replicates, while for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>the first group (15 min to 30 min) contains 4 replicates and the second (180 min to 420 min) contains 6 replicates. To identify genes with log2-ratios significantly different between the two time phases, p-values were first calculated for each gene using a moderated t-test based on an empirical Bayes analysis that is equivalent to shrinkage (or expansion) of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in a more stable inference. The p-values of the t-test were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) as proposed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Thus, using a cut-off of the adjusted p-values at 0.05 gives and approximate level of False Discovery Rate (FDR) at 0.05.
