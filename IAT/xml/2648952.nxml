FN1 expression has been described to increase significantly from the morula towards the early blastocyst stage, suggesting that FN1 may also be involved in early blastocyst formation. By alternative splicing at 3 defined regions, different FN1 isoforms are generated, each with a unique biological function. The analysis of the alternative FN1 splicing on the one hand and the search for candidate FN1 receptors on the other hand during early bovine embryo development may reveal more about its function during bovine preimplantation embryo development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RT-qPCR quantification of the FN1 splice isoforms in oocytes, embryos, cumulus cells and adult tissue samples revealed a large variation in overall FN1 expression and in splice variant expression. Moreover, two new FN1 transcript variants were identified, the first one expressed in bovine preimplantation embryos and the second one expressed in cumulus cells.</p><p>In the search for candidate receptors for the new embryo specific FN1 isoform, RNA expression analysis identified 5 &#x003b1; integrin subunits (ITGA2B, ITGA3, ITGA5, ITGA8, ITGAV) and 2 &#x003b2; integrin subunits (ITGB1 and ITGB3) with a similar or overlapping RNA expression pattern as compared to FN1. But double immunofluorescent stainings could not confirm complete co-localisation between FN1 and one out of 3 selected integrins alpha subunits (ITGA3, ITGA5, ITGAV).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The existence of a new FN1 transcript variant, specifically expressed in morulae and blastocysts strengthens the idea that FN1 is involved in the process of compaction and blastocyst formation. Analysis of the integrin expression could not identify the binding partner for the embryo specific FN1 transcript variant making further steps necessary for the identification of the FN1 receptor and the downstream effects of FN1-receptor binding.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Fibronectin 1 (FN1) is a large adhesive glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix composed of 2 nearly identical subunits with a variety of binding domains for cell surface and extracellular ligands. By means of these multiple interaction sites, FN1 is involved in a variety of biological processes. Its major function is the support of cell adhesion, but FN1 also plays a role in cytoskeleton organisation, cell migration, many important physiological processes such as wound healing, thrombosis and ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and in diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis and arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Structurally, FN1 is composed of 3 types of repeating structural domains (type I, II and III domains &#x02013; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and a single type III connecting segment (IIICS). This organisation is conserved among species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The functional complexity of FN1 is carried out through its protein diversity, which consists of multiple isoforms including plasma FN1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and cellular FN1 filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Those FN1 isoforms are the products of a single gene, and are generated by alternative splicing at 3 sites (EIIIA, EIIIB and IIICS) of the mRNA precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Splicing at the EIIIA and EIIIB regions happens by exon skipping, while the IIICS region can be totally included, partially included or totally excluded due to 3 alternative splice acceptor sites and one alternative splice donor site within this exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In human and bovine, about 20 different protein encoding mRNA transcripts are theoretically produced, but it is still unknown whether all of these combinations do exist <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The expression level of the spliced isoforms and their relative proportion changes during embryonic development and in pathological processes both spatially and temporarily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Each alternatively spliced domain has unique biological functions and a lot of studies have been done to reveal the functions of each domain and the splicing regulation mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The EIIIA and EIIIB regions are absent in plasma FN1 and EIIIA/EIIIB containing FN1 is poorly expressed in normal adult tissue but overexpressed in developing embryos, wound healing and tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Alternative splicing of the bovine FN1 gene</bold>. (A) Schematic diagram of the domain structure of FN1, consisting of three repeating units, types I (red), II (green) and III (blue).

Integrins mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions and the dimerisation of specific &#x003b1; with specific &#x003b2; subunits determines the specificity for the ligand as well as intracellular signalling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Upon binding of a ligand, e.g. FN1, integrins transduce signals into the cell interior (outside-in signalling), but they can also receive intracellular signals that regulate their ligand-binding affinity (inside-out signalling) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. At least 10 different integrins can serve as FN1 receptors. Some are specifically binding FN1 but others have multiple ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>FN1 and its receptors have different functions in mammalian reproduction and embryogenesis (sperm-oocyte interactions, implantation, and placentation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and both the FN1 alternative splicing as well as the expression of the integrin receptors are developmentally regulated. So far, most studies have focussed on implantation and placentation, but bovine embryos are special in the way that they have a delayed implantation. In contrast to human, the bovine blastocyst elongates in the uterine lumen for several days, until attachment starts around day 19&#x02013;20 post insemination (p.i.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless a significant rise in bovine FN1 expression was already observed at time of transition from morula to blastocyst, more than 10 days before bovine implantation occurs. Moreover a significantly higher FN1 RNA expression was found in bovine <italic>in vivo </italic>golden standard blastocysts, compared to <italic>in vitro </italic>produced ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Until now, little is known about the importance of the FN1 matrix during compaction and early blastocyst formation. Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] described that trophectodermal cells of bovine hatched blastocyst have already acquired the ability to adhere and outgrow on FN1. But, since at this stage of development no attachment of the bovine blastocyst to the uterine epithelium is occurring, other functions for FN1 may be assumed. Moreover, a study about FN1 fibrillogenesis in Xenopus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] suggested that the dynamic assembly of the FN1 matrix is cell-type dependent and a key event in regulating cell adhesion, migration and differentiation. Based on these data we set up the hypothesis that the embryonic FN1 matrix, formed at the onset of blastocyst formation, may have the adhesive property to link cells together and to provide a substrate for cell layer migration.</p><p>In a first step to investigate this hypothesis, and to find a link between the embryo culture conditions and alterations in FN1 expression, RT-qPCR was performed for the quantitative analysis of the FN1 splice variants in bovine oocytes, pre-implantation embryos, cumulus cells and a selection of adult tissues, followed by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescent staining for the determination of integrins as candidate FN1 receptors in bovine preimplantation embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Quantitative expression analysis of the bovine FN1 splice variants</title><sec><title>Primer validation experiment</title><p>For each alternatively spliced FN1 region (EIIIB, EIIIA and IIICS), primer pairs were designed for specific amplification of both splice variants. The positions of the primers are displayed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Specific amplification was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis showing specific fragments of the expected sizes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), by melt curve analysis and by

The optimized RT-qPCR assay revealed large differences in overall FN1 RNA expression and, more importantly, large differences in splice variant expression.</p><p>The maternal FN1 transcript isoform, expressed in oocytes and gradually degrading in 2-cell embryos, was identical to the embryonic FN1 transcript isoform expressed from the morula stage onwards. Sequencing followed by the comparison of this splice variant (EIIIB-/EIIIA+/IIICS+) with the in silico predicted bovine FN1 transcript variants in the NCBI Entrez Gene database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] revealed that it constitutes a new FN1 splice isoform (Genbank Accession Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ513187">FJ513187</ext-link>) supporting our hypothesis that FN1 exerts a specific function during compaction and early blastocyst formation.</p><p>Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] reported that <italic>in vitro </italic>produced embryos had a reduced FN1 RNA expression compared to <italic>in vivo </italic>"golden standard" embryos. <italic>In vitro </italic>culture conditions are largely different from the <italic>in vivo </italic>environment in the maternal tract and deficiency in survival factors such as cytokines and growth factors are known to have consequences for the quality of the <italic>in vitro </italic>embryo by induction of changes in gene expression, metabolism and even epigenetic modifications. As growth factors, cytokines, hormones and even stress are also reported to act as regulators of alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] a comparison of the FN1 splice variant expression between <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>blastocysts was performed. The significantly higher FN1 RNA expression found in <italic>in vivo </italic>blastocysts was not associated with a switch in splice variant composition. The FN1-ESV splice variant was also found in <italic>in vivo </italic>blastocysts and the ratios between the splice variants remained largely constant.</p><p>From the hatched blastocyst stage onwards, the expression of the EIIIB region increased, pointing to a shift in FN1 splice variant expression from the FN1-ESV isoform towards the in silico predicted FN1 isoform 2 (Accession Number: XM_864390). This shift goes together with the onset of initial differentiation of the primitive endoderm or hypoblast in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and is not surprising since the primitive endoderm was demonstrated to be the major source of FN1 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The FN1 isoform 2 (EIIIA+/EIIIB+/IIICS+) is involved in cell lineage and tissue rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], processes that occur extensively during early embryogenesis. The expression of a second FN1 transcript variant in hatched blastocysts supports our hypothesis that FN1 exerts multiple functions during blastocyst formation.</p><p>Another remarkable finding was the difference in FN1 isoform expression between the oocyte (and early embryos) and the surrounding cumulus cells. The cumulus cells express another new FN1 isoform, named FN1-CSV (Genbank Accession Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ513188">FJ513188</ext-link>). The adhesion of spermatozoa to the oolemma is mediated by integrins recognizing the RGD sequence in glycoproteins such as FN1 and vitronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. But since a different FN1 isoform is expressed in oocytes and cumulus cells, a different function for FN1 can be expected.</p><p>In adult tissues, a variety of different splice variants was found. In general, the EIIIB and EIIIA region were excluded, agreeing with other studies describing exclusion of these regions in normal adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] but inclusion during pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Soluble plasma FN1 (EIIIB-/EIIIA-/IIICS-) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] is particularly secreted by hepatocytes, probably explaining the higher expression of the IIICS- variant in liver tissue. It was not the main focus of our research to study the FN1 isoform expression in adult tissue samples, but the aberrant splice variant pattern (EIIIB+/EIIIA+) in the reproductive tissues (placenta, uterus and ovary) was remarkable, although not entirely unexpected. These tissues are very proliferative and active, and the inclusion of EIIIA and EIIIB occur under such conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Embryo implantation and placenta formation require, besides cell migration, trophoblast differentiation and villous mesenchyme formation, also intensive vascular proliferation and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], explaining the higher inclusion of the EIIIA and EIIIB regions.</p><p>Taking a closer look at the FN1-ESV isoform, it was seen that the main difference with the most closely related isoform (in silico predicted isoform 12) was the inclusion of a 75 bp fragment containing a second RGD motif, a TYR fosforylation site and an ASN glycosylation site. The RGD motif is the recognition site for interaction with integrins and the conserved RGD motif is located in the 10<sup>th </sup>type III domain, next to the PHSRN synergy site located in the 9<sup>th </sup>type III domain. Upon interaction with the RGD ligand, the integrins can transduce signals into the cell interior, but they may also receive intracellular signals regulating their cell binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The various &#x003b1; integrin subunits have different cytoplasmic tails by which they are able to activate different cellular responses upon binding to a common extracellular ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. By the binding of cytoskeleton linkage proteins such as talin, vinculin and &#x003b1;-actinin to their cytoplasmic tail, integrins serve as transmembrane links between extracellular contacts and the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and act as modulators of cytoskeleton organisation, an important process during blastocyst formation. As the FN1-ESV isoform contains a second RGD motif, the study of the integrin expression in bovine embryos may help to find out more about the functions of FN1 during blastocyst formation. ITGA5B1 and ITGAVB3 are classical receptors for FN1 but at least 8 other different integrins may serve as receptors for fibronectin and many integrins can bind multiple ligands. RT-qPCR analysis was performed for 9 selected &#x003b1; and 5 selected &#x003b2; subunits. The integrin subunits following the FN1 expression profile (ITGA2B, ITGA3, ITGA5, ITGA8, ITGAV and ITGB3) and the ITGB1 subunit expressed in all the tested developmental stages, were considered as potential receptors for the new embryonic FN1 splice isoform. ITGAD and ITGB7 were only expressed at the hatched blastocyst stage, making them good candidate receptors for FN1 isoform 2. Furthermore, remarkable differences in integrin RNA expression were found between <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>produced blastocysts. The embryonic origin might not only influence the FN1 expression but also the integrin expression, or ligand and receptor might regulate each others expression.</p><p>The double immunofluorescent stainings on <italic>in vitro </italic>produced bovine blastocysts found ITGA3 mainly located in the TE cells, whereas ITGA5 and ITGAV were stronger expressed in the ICM. Although the integrins were expressed in close proximity to FN1, there was no full co-localisation between FN1 and one of 3 the receptors. Either, none of the tested integrins was the unique FN1 receptor, each integrin receptor can bind to other ligands besides FN1, or the FN1-ESV isoform can interact with more than one integrin receptor by the dual RGD sequences. One should keep in mind that analogous to the differences observed for RNA expression, differences in protein expression can exist between <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>golden standard embryos. ITGA2B and ITGA8 were not tested in this study due to the lack of suitable, specific antibodies. Our approach using RNA expression pattern analysis and double immunofluorescent stainings excluded some integrins as candidate binding partners for the embryo specific FN1 isoform, but we were not able to identify one specific FN1 receptor in bovine blastocysts. The application of other molecular techniques such as the yeast two hybrid method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] or the MAPPIT strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] will be necessary for further analysis of the FN1-integrin interaction in bovine blastocysts in order to find out more about the function of FN1 during early blastocyst formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we have established a reliable assay for mRNA quantification of different FN1 splice isoforms. The assay was used for FN1 expression analysis in bovine oocytes, embryos, cumulus cells and adult tissues and as such we have identified 2 novel FN1 isoforms, specifically expressed in early embryos and cumulus cells, respectively. The existence of the FN1-ESV transcript variant strengthens our hypothesis that FN1 may exert a specific function during blastocyst formation.</p><p>Expression analysis of integrins, the main family of FN1 receptors, during bovine preimplantation embryo development was a first step towards unravelling the FN1 function during blastocyst formation. RT-PCR identified candidate binding partners for the FN1-ESV isoform, but detailed identification of its receptor needs further investigation to test our hypothesis that the embryonic FN1 matrix has the adhesive property to link cells together and provides a substrate for cell layer migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sample collection</title><sec><title>In vivo embryo production</title><p><italic>In vivo </italic>embryos were produced according to the protocol described in Goossens <italic>et al</italic>.

An in-solution DNase digestion was carried out to remove any contaminating DNA by treating the total RNA with 2 units of RQ1 DNase (Promega, The Netherlands) during 30 min, followed by a spin-column purification (Microcon YM-100, Millipore, Belgium).</p><p>Total RNA was extracted from the bovine tissue samples (4 samples/tissue) using the Aurum Total RNA Fatty and Fibrous Tissue Kit (Bio-Rad, Belgium) according to the products manual. An on-column DNase I digest was performed during the RNA extraction protocol.</p><p>A minus RT control was performed with primers for GAPD to check the removal of the genomic DNA and First-strand cDNA was synthesized from the total amount of RNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Belgium) following the manufacturer's instructions. The iScript Reverse Transcriptase is a modified MMLV-derived reverse transcriptase and the iScript Reaction Mix contains both oligo(dT) and random primers. After the RT reaction and RT control with primers for GAPD, the cDNA was 2.5 times diluted in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Primer design</title><p>All the primers were designed using the Primer 3 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and are based on the sequences available in NCBI GenBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>For each region (EIIIB, EIIIA and IIICS) 3 sets of primers were designed. Primer pairs 1&#x02013;3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) are surrounding the alternative spliced regions and make the distinction between the presence and the absence of the alternatively spliced regions possible. These primers were also used for the generation of the specific standards. Primer pairs 4&#x02013;6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) are used for specific amplification of the full-length splice regions (EIIIB+, EIIIA+ and IIICS+) with one of the primers located in the specific spliced region. Primer pairs 7&#x02013;9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) are boundary spanning primers used for specific amplification of the EIIIB-, EIIIA- and IIICS- regions.</p><p>Additionally, primers were designed for the RNA expression analysis of 9 different integrin &#x003b1; subunits and 5 different integrin &#x003b2; subunits (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), known from literature to be candidate receptors for FN1.</p><p>All the PCR amplicons were sequenced for verification.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse Transcription qPCR</title><sec><title>Generation of splice variant specific qPCR standards</title><p>The FN1 regions spanning EIIIB, EIIIA and IIICS were amplified with primer pairs 1 to 3 respectively, using pooled cDNA from bovine oocytes, embryos, cumulus cells and adult tissues. The generated PCR products (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were cloned into a pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Belgium) and transformed into competent DH5&#x003b1; E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Belgium). Clones were randomly picked and, after sequencing of the inserts, used for generation of gene-specific qPCR standards.</p><p>The cDNA fragment of each isoform was amplified by using 20 ng of the specific plasmids as the template for a PCR reaction. PCR fragments were run on a 2% agarose gel, excised and eluted using the Geneclean II kit (Q-Bio gene &#x02013; MP Biomedicals, Belgium). PCR fragments were quantified using the PicoGreen Kit (Molecular Probes &#x02013; Invitrogen, Belgium) on a NanoDrop 3300 Fluorospectrometer (Isogen Life Science B. V., Belgium) and the molar concentration of each PCR product was calculated on the basis of the mass concentration and the length in base pairs of each fragment as described in Vandenbroucke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Standard curves are generated by 10-fold serial dilutions of specific PCR products as validated by Vandenbroucke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of alternative transcripts using boundary spanning primers</title><p>Primer pairs designed for specific detection of each splice variant (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, primers 4&#x02013;9) were used in combination with SYBR Green I (Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG; Invitrogen, Belgium).</p><p>First, the specificity of the primers was tested by amplifying each splice variant in the presence of excess on the alternative splice form. In concrete terms this means that for each alternatively spliced region, a dilution series of the PCR product of the short transcript was mixed with excess of the PCR product of the full-length transcript or with equal amounts of water in a second and similar series of dilution. The same was done for each of the full-length transcripts.</p><p>Each qPCR reaction contained 1&#x000d7; SYBR Green I PCR Mix (Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG; Invitrogen, Belgium), 200 nM of each specific primer and 2.5 &#x003bc;l of sample. After a 2 min UDG incubation step at 50&#x000b0;C and an initial denaturation step at 95&#x000b0;C for 3 min to activate the <italic>Taq </italic>DNA polymerase, the PCR programme consisted of 45 cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 20 sec and a combined primer annealing/extension at the specific and optimised annealing temperature (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) for 40 sec during which fluorescence was measured. A melt curve was produced to confirm a single gene-specific peak and to detect primer/dimer formation by heating the samples from 70 to 95&#x000b0;C in 0.5&#x000b0;C increments with a dwell time at each temperature of 10 sec while continuously monitoring the fluorescence. PCR efficiencies were calculated using a relative standard curve derived from each specific PCR product (a ten-fold dilution series with five measuring points). For each reaction two technical replicates were run, whereby a no-template control was included.</p><p>The geometric mean of three validated reference genes (YWHAZ, GAPD and SDHA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] was used to calculate an accurate normalisation factor for normalisation of the total FN1 RNA expression level. The mean quantity of each transcript (raw data) was divided by the respective normalisation factor to obtain a normalised value for each transcript. The relative proportion of each splice variant was determined by interpolating the CT values of the unknown samples to the corresponding standard curve and subsequently used for the calculation of the composition of the total FN1 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression analysis of integrins in bovine preimplantation embryos</title><p>In a first screening experiment, the expression profiles of the 14 selected integrin subunits (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) were determined in different stages of embryonic development using RT-qPCR as previously described. In a second experiment the integrin expression was compared between <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>produced embryos (2-cell, 8-cell and blastocysts), also by RT-qPCR.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The gene expression levels were analysed by calculating 95% confidence intervals after logarithmic transformations, whereby non-overlapping intervals denote significant differences at the 0.05 level.</p><p>Statistical tests were performed using the GraphPad Instat program. An ANOVA test was performed to compare the overall FN1 expression between oocytes, embryos, cumulus cells and adult tissue samples. A t-test was used to compare the relative FN1 splice variant expression in each sample type.

A primary mouse monoclonal antibody (AB6328 &#x02013; Abcam, UK) against FN1 was used in combination with a secondary goat-anti-mouse antibody labelled with Cy5 (Chemicon &#x02013; Millipore, Belgium). The primary rabbit integrin antibodies (ITGA5 (C2405-02D): USBiological &#x02013; Immunosource, Belgium; ITGA3 (AB1920) and ITGAV (AB1930): Chemicon &#x02013; Millipore, Belgium), guaranteed to have no-cross reactivity with other integrins were used in combination with a secondary goat-anti-rabbit antibody labeled with FITC (Molecular Probes, The Netherlands).</p><p><italic>In vitro </italic>blastocysts were selected from the culture media at day 7 p.i., washed 3 times in PBS and fixed with ice cold acetone for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing in polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP; 1 mg PVP/ml PBS), non-specific binding sites were blocked by incubating the embryos with 10% goat serum in PVP for 30 min. After 3 washes in PVP the embryos were incubated with the mouse primary, monoclonal antibody against FN1 (1/100) for 2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C, washed again 3 times in PVP and then incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with the specific rabbit antibody against one of the 3 selected integrins (1/100). Afterwards, the embryos were washed 3 times with PVP, incubated with the secondary goat-anti-mouse antibody labelled with Cy5 for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C (1/100), washed again with PVP and incubated with the secondary goat-anti-rabbit antibody labelled with FITC (1/100).</p><p>The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Belgium) for 10 min at room temperature and immediately mounted in a droplet of glycerol with (25 mg/ml) 1,4-diazabicyclo (2.2.2) octane (DABCO; Acros, Belgium) on slides with vaseline bridges.</p><p>Negative controls (by replacing the primary antibody with goat serum), double negative controls (only Hoechst staining) and controls for cross reactivity of the antibodies were performed simultaneously to check for non-specific binding and for auto-fluorescence.
