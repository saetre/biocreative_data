A new protein, termed Spindly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and SPDL-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, was recently shown to regulate KT localization of dynein, but depletion phenotypes revealed striking differences, suggesting evolutionarily diverse roles of mitotic dynein. By characterizing the function of Spindly in human cells, we identify specific functions for KT dynein. We show that localization of human Spindly (hSpindly) to KTs is controlled by the Rod/Zw10/Zwilch (RZZ) complex and Aurora B. hSpindly depletion results in reduced inter-KT tension, unstable KT fibers, an extensive prometaphase delay, and severe chromosome misalignment. Moreover, depletion of hSpindly induces a striking spindle rotation, which can be rescued by co-depletion of dynein. However, in contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, hSpindly depletion does not abolish the removal of MAD2 and ZW10 from KTs. Collectively, our data reveal hSpindly-mediated dynein functions and highlight a critical role of KT dynein in spindle orientation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Error-free chromosome segregation during mitosis depends on the formation of a bipolar spindle and correct attachment of all kinetochores (KTs) to spindle microtubules (MTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Connell and Khodjakov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka, 2008</xref>). To prevent chromosome missegregation, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached to MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Prominent among the MT-dependent motor proteins implicated in various mitotic functions is dynein/dynactin. This minus end&#x02013;directed motor complex is required for proper spindle formation, plays a role in spindle pole focusing and separation, and controls spindle length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vaisberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaetz and Kapoor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goshima et al., 2005</xref>). Remarkably, dynein localizes to unattached KTs and disassociates upon MT attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">King et al., 2000</xref>). It is involved in establishing the initial lateral contact between KTs and MTs, which results in rapid poleward movements of chromosomes during early prometaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rieder and Alexander, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vorozhko et al., 2008</xref>). Subsequently, these lateral MT interactions mature into stable end-on attachments at the KT that are mediated by the KMN network, a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins comprising KNL-1 and the Mis12 and Ndc80 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>). Importantly, the dynein/dynactin complex also localizes to the cell cortex where it contributes to spindle orientation and positioning, most likely by providing pulling forces on astral MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Connell and Wang, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The recruitment of dynein/dynactin to KTs is dependent on the conserved Rod/Zw10/Zwilch (RZZ) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karess, 2005</xref>), possibly through direct interaction between ZW10 and the dynactin subunit p50-dynamitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Starr et al., 1998</xref>). Additional proteins, notably Nde1 and Ndel1, are also required for targeting dynein/dynactin to KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stehman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vergnolle and Taylor, 2007</xref>). In recent years, manipulation of the RZZ complex has been extensively used to study the roles of KT-associated dynein. In fact, inhibition of the RZZ complex suppressed the rapid poleward movement of chromosomes and reduced KT tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Savoian et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), consistent with results obtained upon direct disruption of dynein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vorozhko et al., 2008</xref>). However, the role of KT dynein in chromosome congression remains controversial. Although inhibition of dynein/dynactin during prometaphase did not impair metaphase plate formation in vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vorozhko et al., 2008</xref>), depletion of ZW10 from human cells induced chromosome misalignment, suggesting that KT dynein is required for efficient congression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, depletion of Rod from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells delayed chromosome alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>), but <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and larval neuroblasts depleted of ZW10 showed no obvious defect in metaphase plate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams and Goldberg, 1994</xref>).</p><p>More recently, the dynein/dynactin complex has been implicated in the removal of SAC proteins from the outer KT, and this, in turn, has been proposed to play an important role in SAC silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wojcik et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mische et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whyte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sivaram et al., 2009</xref>). However, studies on the role of dynein/dynactin in SAC silencing through interference with the RZZ complex are confounded by the fact that the RZZ is also essential for SAC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2000</xref>), particularly for recruiting MAD1/MAD2 to KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buffin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kops et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>A protein termed Spindly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>) and SPDL-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann et al., 2008</xref>) has recently been identified as a new KT regulator of dynein. However, depletion of this protein yielded partially distinct phenotypes in the two invertebrate species, suggesting that some KT dynein functions may have diverged during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Civril and Musacchio, 2008</xref>). Here, we report the characterization of the human homologue of Spindly/SPDL-1, which we identified originally as a putative component of the spindle apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sauer et al., 2005</xref>). Our results have important implications for the role of KT-associated dynein in spindle orientation and in the removal of outer KT components during SAC silencing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>hSpindly localizes to KTs and spindle poles</title><p>Bioinformatic analysis of the human mitotic spindle proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sauer et al., 2005</xref>) by the ENFIN consortium predicted CCDC99 (accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Q96EA4">Q96EA4</ext-link>) to be a spindle protein (unpublished data). Independently, CCDC99 has been suggested as the potential human homologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spindly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>). Analysis of Hela S3 cells overexpressing myc-tagged CCDC99 by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed KT and spindle pole localization in mitosis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812167/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>), identifying this protein as a bona fide spindle component. Thus, hereafter we refer to CCDC99 as human Spindly (hSpindly). Endogenous hSpindly localization was determined using an hSpindly-specific antibody that recognizes a single band of 70 kD, the predicted molecular weight of hSpindly (Fig. S1 B). No specific signal could be detected with the preimmune serum or after depletion of hSpindly by siRNA (Fig. S1, B&#x02013;D), confirming antibody specificity. Interphase localization of hSpindly was mainly nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; Fig. S1 A). This contrasts with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spindly, which localized to MT plus-end tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>). In mitosis, hSpindly decorated KTs in early prometaphase before it relocalized to the spindle poles before metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; Fig. S1, A and E). Colocalization with BubR1, adjacent to the CREST signal, indicated that hSpindly is an outer KT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). After all chromosomes achieved perfect alignment, no obvious staining on the spindle poles could be seen (Fig. S1 E), suggesting that hSpindly diffuses to the cytosol after moving to the poles. At later stages of mitosis (anaphase and telophase), no specific association of hSpindly with any spindle structures could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). A parallel biochemical analysis revealed that hSpindly protein levels were reduced after release from nocodazole arrest (Fig. S1 F), but this degradation was blocked by addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. S1 G), indicating that hSpindly is degraded upon mitotic exit. Furthermore, an upshift could be detected in nocodazole-treated cells, suggesting that hSpindly is modified during M phase (Fig. S1, F&#x02013;H). This modification appeared to be phosphorylation dependent because the slower migrating form of hSpindly was not detected in lysates from nocodazole-arrested cells treated with &#x003bb;-phosphatase (Fig. S1 H).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>hSpindly localizes at outer KTs and spindle poles, downstream of the RZZ and Ndc80 complexes.</bold> (A) HeLa S3 cells in interphase were stained with anti-hSpindly (red) and anti&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin antibodies (green), and DAPI (blue).

In the case of hSpindly we found that siRNA-mediated depletion of ZW10 (ZW10-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kops et al., 2005</xref>] and ZW10-2) not only abolished KT localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>) but also caused a reduction in hSpindly protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Conversely, hSpindly depletion did not affect either localization or stability of ZW10 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812167/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link> and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The observed effect of RZZ depletion on the stability of hSpindly appears to reflect a new level of regulation, as no such effect had been seen in either <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>) or <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann et al., 2008</xref>). In agreement with the results observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann et al., 2008</xref>), RZZ members (ZW10 and Rod), but not dynein, could be coimmunoprecipitated with hSpindly (Fig. S2 B) from mitotic HeLa S3 cells lysates. However, this interaction could only be observed under detergent-free conditions (see Materials and methods). In addition, glycerol gradient centrifugation revealed that a fraction of ZW10 co-migrated with hSpindly, and hSpindly depletion caused a slight shift in the sedimentation behavior of ZW10 (Fig. S2 C). Thus, our results are consistent with an interaction between hSpindly and the RZZ complex, albeit weak and likely dynamic.</p><p>Next, we asked whether KT localization was important for the stability of hSpindly. Upon depletion of Hec1/Ndc80 we found that both ZW10 and hSpindly were displaced from KTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>; Fig. S2 D; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2006</xref>), and yet, levels of hSpindly were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). This clearly demonstrates that hSpindly degradation does not result from its dissociation from KTs and instead suggests that the interaction with the RZZ stabilizes the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Aurora B controls KT localization of hSpindly</title><p>Aurora B has been shown to promote the recruitment of the RZZ complex to the KT until the establishment of tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Famulski and Chan, 2007</xref>). Thus, we asked whether the KT association of hSpindly is also regulated by Aurora B. First, we analyzed hSpindly localization after depletion of Aurora B or inhibition of the kinase by the small molecule inhibitor ZM447439 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ditchfield et al., 2003</xref>). In both cases, hSpindly KT and spindle pole localization was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>; Fig. S2 E), as expected, considering the dependency of the RZZ on Aurora B. Furthermore, the stability of hSpindly was clearly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). We also observed a slight decrease in ZW10 protein levels, further pointing to an influence of Aurora B on both the RZZ and hSpindly. To examine the localization of hSpindly in response to lack of tension, MG132-treated metaphase cells were treated with taxol (1 &#x000b5;M). On most KTs of taxol-treated cells, hSpindly colocalized with BubR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>), which had previously been reported to be enriched at tensionless KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skoufias et al., 2001</xref>). Although this treatment resulted in few MAD2- (and hSpindly)-positive KTs, which were likely to be unattached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauf et al., 2003</xref>), many KTs were hSpindly-positive but MAD2-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F;</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812167/DC1">Fig. S3 C</ext-link>; see Fig. S3, A and B for MAD2 antibody characterization). Inhibition of Aurora B kinase by a short treatment with ZM447439, sufficiently short as to not reduce hSpindly levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>), inhibited the recruitment of both hSpindly and MAD2 in cells treated with taxol, but not nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, F and H</xref>; Fig. S3 C). Thus, Aurora B controls hSpindly recruitment to KTs in response to taxol, presumably through the RZZ complex.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Aurora B regulates the localization of hSpindly in response to taxol.</bold> (A) HeLa S3 cells were treated with GL2 (control) or Aurora B siRNAs for 40 h, or with ZM447439 (ZM) for 16 h before being stained with anti-hSpindly (red) and anti&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin (green) antibodies and DAPI (blue).

Similar to taxol-treated cells, hSpindly was found on many MAD2-negative KTs (Fig. S3, D and E), suggesting that KT&#x02013;MT attachment is not sufficient to remove hSpindly from KTs. However, a significant fraction of sister KT pairs clearly displayed asymmetric hSpindly localization (Fig. S3 F), and similar observations were made, albeit less frequently, in taxol-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). This suggests that hSpindly localization to KTs is not regulated by tension but, presumably, by some structural or dynamic aspect of KT&#x02013;MT interaction.

We show that hSpindly localizes to the outer KTs during prometaphase and relocalizes to the spindle poles before metaphase, in an MT- and dynein/dynactin-dependent manner. Similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spindly and <italic>C. elegans</italic> SPDL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann et al., 2008</xref>), the RZZ complex acts as an upstream regulator of hSpindly. However, in human cells, the RZZ complex not only controls localization of hSpindly but also its protein level, suggesting that hSpindly is stabilized through association with the RZZ complex. SPDL-1 could be coimmunoprecipitated with Zwilch from <italic>C. elegans</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, we were able to coimmunoprecipitate hSpindly with ZW10 and Rod, provided that detergents were omitted, and our glycerol gradient analysis is also consistent with an interaction between hSpindly and the RZZ complex. We propose that hSpindly forms transient and dynamic interactions with the RZZ complex, rather than being a stable subunit of the complex. The fact that Hec1/Ndc80 depletion mislocalized both ZW10 and hSpindly without affecting the corresponding protein levels indicates that KT localization is not a prerequisite for the stability of hSpindly. Similar to the RZZ complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Famulski and Chan, 2007</xref>; and unpublished data), Aurora B activity controls hSpindly localization in response to taxol. Although this might be interpreted to suggest a tension-sensitive localization of hSpindly, we emphasize that hSpindly occasionally showed an asymmetric localization on sister KTs, especially in monastrol-treated cells, arguing that hSpindly localization responds to a particular state of KT&#x02013;MT attachment (or MT dynamics) rather than tension across the inner centromeres. Interestingly, inhibition of Aurora B also caused a reduction in hSpindly levels, suggesting a regulatory relationship between the two proteins, likely through the RZZ complex. We found that hSpindly is phosphorylated on at least five Cdk1 sites both in vitro and in vivo (unpublished data), but have so far been unable to phosphorylate the protein by Aurora B. Similarly, we have not been able to phosphorylate ZW10 by Aurora B (unpublished data). Thus, if Aurora B regulates the interaction between hSpindly and the RZZ complex by direct phosphorylation of one of the subunits, this most likely involves other members of the RZZ complex.</p><p>The role of Spindly in the KT recruitment of dynein is apparently well conserved among species.

Consistent with this notion, chromosome misalignment was induced by either depletion of hSpindly or ZW10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; this paper). Remarkably, however, only cells depleted of hSpindly showed an overall lengthening in the duration of M phase, likely because cells depleted of ZW10 compensate a prolonged prometaphase with a premature onset of anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), due to SAC defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buffin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kops et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the specific defects resulting from the impaired recruitment of dynein to KTs can more readily be visualized in hSpindly-depleted cells, as this protein is not required for SAC activity.</p><p>KT dynein was suggested to be required for the generation of tension across sister KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). The decreased inter-KT distance observed upon hSpindly depletion clearly supports this notion. Furthermore, the increase in spindle length upon hSpindly knock-down is in agreement with the idea that KT dynein facilitates the formation of load-bearing attachment, as is the case for SPDL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann et al., 2008</xref>). For <italic>C. elegans</italic> it was further proposed that the RZZ complex negatively regulates the MT-binding activity of the Ndc80 complex at tensionless KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann et al., 2008</xref>). The data obtained here for HeLa S3 cells suggest that the functions of hSpindly and ZW10 differ significantly between species. First, in human cells the RZZ complex controls not only the localization but also the stability of hSpindly, whereas in invertebrates it apparently controls only localization. Second, the depletion of Hec1/Ndc80 abolished KT localization of both ZW10 and hSpindly in human cells, but not in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamamoto et al., 2008</xref>). Third, KNL-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is required for KT targeting of both Ndc80 and RZZ complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Desai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann et al., 2008</xref>), whereas Blinkin, its human homologue, is not required for the KT localization of Hec1/Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kiyomitsu et al., 2007</xref>). Together with data from the literature, our present results suggest that in human cells hSpindly and the RZZ complex act downstream of the Ndc80 complex to recruit dynein/dynactin.</p><p>Interference with Spindly function in different species also revealed fundamental differences with regard to the role of KT dynein during SAC inactivation. Several studies have implicated dynein/dynactin in the silencing of the SAC through the removal of checkpoint proteins, such as MAD2 and the RZZ complex, from KTs and their transport along MTs to spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wojcik et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mische et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whyte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sivaram et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, hSpindly depletion did not block the removal of MAD2 and ZW10 from aligned chromosomes, and yet this process required dynein/dynactin. This suggests that the dynein/dynactin complex is able to remove SAC components from KTs without the need for an hSpindly-mediated accumulation of dynein at these structures. It is worth mentioning in this context that we seldom observed a complete inhibition of SAC protein removal upon overexpression of p50-dynamitin in metaphase cells. This could either reflect an incomplete disruption of the dynein/dynactin complex, or alternatively, the existence of a dynein-independent removal mechanism that is able to compensate for the loss of dynein. Regardless, hSpindly-depleted cells clearly showed a prolonged prometaphase delay, indicating persistent SAC activity despite ongoing removal of MAD2.</p><p>Importantly, we also found that depletion of hSpindly or ZW10 induced frequent spindle rotation, similar to what had previously been observed upon depletion of the dynein regulator Nde1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>) and depletion or overexpression of LIS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>). These proteins are well known to determine the stability of astral MTs, the cortical localization of dynein and proper spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, ZW10, Nde1, and dynein are also required for the integrity of the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirose et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang et al., 2004</xref>), but this is not the case for hSpindly (unpublished data). These studies thus suggest that ZW10, Nde1/Ndel1, and LIS1 regulate dynein activity both at the KT and elsewhere, whereas hSpindly exclusively controls the function of dynein at KTs.</p><p>So, how could hSpindly depletion lead to spindle misorientation? hSpindly was undetectable at the cortex or on astral MTs. Furthermore, neither the actin cytoskeleton nor the cortical localization of dynein was detectably impaired in hSpindly-depleted cells. Yet, remarkably, the spindle rotation phenotype could be rescued by co-depletion of dynein. The observation that a comparable spindle orientation defect could also be induced by depletion of Hec1 or CenpA highlights a role of KTs in spindle orientation and supports the notion that spindle misorientation induced by hSpindly depletion is due to interference with KT-associated but not cortical dynein. It seems plausible, therefore, that KT forces cooperate with cortical forces essential for spindle orientation.</p><p>In summary, our characterization of hSpindly helps to understand which dynein-mediated processes require dynein accumulation at the KT (notably chromosome congression) and which processes do not (notably SAC silencing). Both chromosome alignment and KT tension are now confirmed to be regulated by KT-associated dynein/dynactin complexes, which in turn are regulated by Spindly and the RZZ complex in all metazoans. In contrast, the mechanism by which hSpindly and KT dynein control spindle orientation awaits elucidation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cloning procedures</title><p>For cloning hSpindly (Q96EA4), a cDNA clone (IRAUp969B0653D) was obtained from the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum f&#x000fc;r Genomforschung (RZPD), and was cloned in-frame into a pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) encoding an N-terminal 3xmyc tag.
