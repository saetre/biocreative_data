The phosphatase cdc25C is a main regulator involved in transition from the G<sub>2</sub> phase to mitosis in the cell division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c2">2</xref>). Microinjection of an antibody against cdc25C into HeLa cells leads to an inhibition of cell cycle progression before mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c3">3</xref>). Consistent with its function at the time of passage from G<sub>2</sub> to mitosis, mRNA levels of <italic>cdc25C</italic> change periodically during the cell cycle. Only small amounts are found in G<sub>1</sub> and increasing concentrations are observed in S phase with maximum levels in G<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c2">2</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptional regulation during the mammalian cell cycle has so far been mostly associated with the function of the E2F family of transcription factors and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein pRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c5">5</xref>). Heterodimers formed by E2F and DP components are able to activate transcription of cell cycle promoters in late G<sub>1</sub> and S phase. In G<sub>0</sub> and early G<sub>1</sub>, complex formation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pRb family of proteins with E2F&#x0002f;DP represses transcription. Transition from this repression in the early phase of the cell cycle to activation at later times is controlled by phosphorylation of pRb-family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c7">7</xref>).</p><p>More recently we have identified another mechanism by which gene transcription can be regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This mechanism employs a tandem transcriptional element composed of the cell cycle-dependent element (CDE) and the cell cycle genes homology region (CHR). The fluctuations in mRNA levels from genes like <italic>cdc25C</italic>, <italic>cyclin A</italic>, <italic>cyclin B2</italic> and <italic>cdc2</italic> (cdk1) are dependent on differential transcription due to these tandem repressor elements in their promoters. CDE&#x0002f;CHR sites regulate the promoters by repression in G<sub>0</sub> and G<sub>1</sub> and release from repression later in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c10">10</xref>). Both halves of the CDE&#x0002f;CHR element are required for transcriptional repression in G<sub>0</sub> and G<sub>1</sub>. Inactivation of either the CDE or the CHR leads to deregulation of transcription with high expression levels already in early phases of the cell cycle. The proteins regulating through CDE&#x0002f;CHR elements have so far only been described poorly. A factor called CDF-1, which is different from E2F, has been shown by one group to bind to some CDE&#x0002f;CHR elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c11">11</xref>). However, this factor has resisted cloning and further molecular characterization. The <italic>cdc2</italic> and <italic>cyclin A</italic> promoters were shown to bind E2F to the CDE half of the CDE&#x0002f;CHR site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c12">12</xref>).</p><p>In the human <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter a recognition site for the tumor suppressor p53 has been described. This site can bind p53 and is able to activate transcription in response to co-transfection of a <italic>p53</italic>-expressing plasmid, at least when artificially placed adjacent to the adenovirus <italic>E1b</italic> minimal promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c13">13</xref>). We have demonstrated that transcription of <italic>cdc25C</italic> is repressed by p53. This down-regulation of <italic>cdc25C</italic> is not contingent upon the p53 site in its promoter but depends on CCAAT boxes. The down-regulation of <italic>cdc25C</italic> is part of the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M checkpoint control by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c15">15</xref>).</p><p>The trimeric nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y) binds to these CCAAT boxes and is the major activator for CDE&#x0002f;CHR-regulated promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c8">8</xref>). NF-Y binding activity varies during the cell cycle. However, it only contributes as a general activator to the typical cell cycle-dependent expression of genes like <italic>cyclin B2</italic>. Concentration of its NF-YA subunit decreases only after the peak expression in G<sub>2</sub> of the CDE&#x0002f;CHR genes has already been reached. NF-Y binding activity is also present in G<sub>1</sub>, at which time these cell cycle genes are not expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c16">16</xref>). Another important transcriptional activator is Sp1. It binds to GC boxes and is the first identified member of a larger family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c17">17</xref>). Sp1 was also recognized as a factor involved in transcription of the cell cycle genes, particularly through cooperation with E2F or pRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c20">20</xref>).</p><p>Here we describe the first CHR element that does not rely on intact CDE or E2F sites upstream of it to confer cell cycle-dependent transcription. The cdc25C CHR can cooperate with E2F and Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites in regulating promoter activity during the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning of the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter and plasmid constructs</title><p>The <italic>cdc25C</italic> genomic DNA upstream of the start codon was amplified from the adaptor-ligated Mouse GenomeWalker library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by primer walking.

We co-transfected, into normally growing NIH 3T3 cells, increasing amounts of a plasmid carrying a dominant-negative mutant of NF-YA (YA13m29) together with the wild-type <italic>cdc25C</italic> reporter construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f3">3</xref>). More than 60&#x00025; of the activity is lost at the highest concentration of the dominant-negative mutant. This indicates that more than half of the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter activity is dependent on activation by NF-Y.</p></sec><sec><title>p53 down-regulates transcription of <italic>cdc25C</italic> independent of a p53 consensus binding site</title><p>The mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter does not contain a p53 consensus binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f2">2</xref> and Supplementary Material). The site, which can bind p53 in the human promoter, is located centered around nucleotide &#x02013;787 relative to the translational start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c15">15</xref>). This region is not homologous in human and mouse promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f2">2</xref>). However, transfection of SaOS-2 cells with a plasmid expressing p53 yields a 6.8-fold down-regulation of the mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter luciferase reporter when wild-type p53 is compared with a mutant form of p53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f4">4</xref>). The mutant used as a control is an altered form with amino acid changes P72R and V143A, which lead to its inability to serve as a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c33">33</xref>). Down-regulation of transcription from the mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter by the p53 tumor suppressor proves that this regulation is independent of a p53 binding site in the promoter since this promoter lacks such a site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f2">2</xref>). This result is consistent with our previous observations and conclusions on the human <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The CHR is the major site responsible for regulating cell cycle-dependent transcription of mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic></title><p>In order to elucidate the impact of potential cell cycle elements we mutated the putative CHR and the region upstream of it in reporter constructs and tested them for cell cycle-dependent transcription. These constructs were transfected in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and expression assayed by luciferase activity. Cells were starved by serum deprivation to test for G<sub>0</sub> expression and restimulated by serum re-addition to the medium for 24 h to obtain promoter activities for a cell population enriched in G<sub>2</sub>. Stimulation of transcription of 17 mutant promoters from G<sub>0</sub> to G<sub>2</sub> was measured relative to the wild-type <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>). Average stimulation of 13.6-fold for wt-m25C-luci was set to 100&#x00025;.</p><p>Mutant promoters M6 to M11 have lost most of their ability to drive cell cycle-dependent transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>A). These mutant promoters all contain changes in the putative CHR that lead to a lack of repression in G<sub>0</sub>. Activities in G<sub>2</sub> stay at the same level as for the wild-type construct, whereas mutant reporter activities increase in resting cells. In mutants M6 to M11 this behavior results in a drop of cell cycle regulation of transcription to about one-fifth that of the wild-type <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter. Even single nucleotide mutations as in M8 and M11 display a substantial loss of regulation. Therefore, this site is indeed a CHR.</p><p>Functional CHR elements have, until now, only been described in conjunction with CDEs. The respective sequence in the mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter upstream of the CHR is different from any CDE identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c10">10</xref>). Still, mutation of this region leads to a change in regulation. An alteration in cell cycle-dependent transcription is seen in mutants M1 and M4 with about half the regulation lost. Like regulation of mutants M6 to M11, changes in cell cycle transcription of M1 and M4 are also due to an increase of activity in G<sub>0</sub> while transcriptional activation in G<sub>2</sub> stays at the same level as activity for the wild-type promoter. In comparison with the wild-type <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter, mutants M2 and M3 do not give a significant change in regulation; and the mutation introduced in M5 even shows an improved cell cycle-regulated transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>A). Summing up the results from the mutations presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>A, it is obvious that changes in the CHR result in a much stronger alteration of cell cycle-dependent transcription than mutations in the region upstream from it, where in other promoters a CDE is found. If the region upstream of the CHR in the mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter is changed to a CDE-like sequence, as in mutant M16, or even mutated to the CDE from the human <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter, as in M12, cell cycle-regulated transcription is improved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B).</p><p>All deregulated promoter mutants show an increase in luciferase activities in G<sub>0</sub> instead of a loss in G<sub>2</sub>. Mutants such as M5 and M15, for which a stronger regulation than for the wild-type construct is observed, have an expression in G<sub>0</sub> at a similar level to the wild-type promoter. Their change in stimulation compared with wild type results from an increase of promoter activity in G<sub>2</sub>. Mutant M16 is different in that it shows a lower than wild-type activity in resting cells, thereby displaying a increased fold induction in comparison with the wild-type <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter. In contrast, the reduced cell cycle-dependent transcriptional regulation seen in mutants M1 and M4 is due to an increase in expression in G<sub>0</sub> rather than lower levels of expression in G<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref> and data not shown). Each deregulated mutant promoter gives activities at the elevated level at which wild-type <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter activity in G<sub>2</sub> is observed. This implies a loss of repression rather than a reduction of activation when cell cycle elements are mutated.</p></sec><sec><title>The CHR is able to cooperate in regulating cell cycle-dependent transcription with CDE, E2F or Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites</title><p>All CHR elements identified so far to be relevant for cell cycle-dependent transcription are found in conjunction with a CDE site 4 nt upstream of the CHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c10">10</xref>). Therefore, we tested if the CDE from the human <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter, introduced in the proper position with mutant M12 to create the CDE&#x0002f;CHR tandem element, would lead to cell cycle transcription in the context of the mouse promoter. The mutant M12 with an intact CDE&#x0002f;CHR is not only transcribed in a cell cycle-dependent manner, but displays an even stronger regulation with a lower activity in G<sub>0</sub> compared with the wild-type promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B). As a control, mutation of the CHR in this CDE&#x0002f;CHR context has been described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c8">8</xref>). This indicates that the CHR from the mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter can cooperate with a CDE artificially placed in tandem with it. Yet the CDE alone cannot regulate cell cycle-dependent transcription in the human promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c8">8</xref>).</p><p>An E2F site originating from the mouse <italic>B-myb</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c25">25</xref>) was another element we chose to test in tandem with this CHR. Mutant promoter M13 with an E2F&#x0002f;CHR site shows a stronger cell cycle transcription than the wild-type promoter with just a CHR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B). As a control that the cell cycle-dependence of this new tandem element is contingent upon the CHR and not simply attributable solely to the introduced E2F site we changed the CHR in this context. M14 as the corresponding mutant has almost no ability to direct cell cycle-dependent transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B). Therefore, E2F and CHR sites cooperate in the M13 mutant promoter to regulate cell cycle-dependent transcription.</p><p>The ability of the mutant sites to bind E2F protein was tested in EMSAs. As a control, an oligonucleotide from the <italic>B-myb</italic> promoter carrying an E2F site was used by incubating it with E2F-1 and DP-1. This binding was compared with the same oligonucleotide with its E2F site mutated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f6">6</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). E2F does not bind to the wild-type <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter oligonucleotide nor to probes mutated in the CHR and upstream from it (lanes 3&#x02013;6). However, when an E2F site is introduced upstream of the CHR, binding similar to that of the B-myb probe is also observed in the context of the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter (M13 and lane 1). Binding to this E2F site is not dependent on an intact CHR since mutant oligonucleotide M14 is still able to bind E2F with similar affinity as M13 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f6">6</xref>). Taken together with functional assays this indicates that, on the one hand, an E2F site can bind E2F-1&#x0002f;DP-1 heterodimers even in the absence of an intact CHR in tandem with it. But, on the other hand, this isolated E2F site is not able to regulate cell cycle-dependent transcription (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f6">6</xref>).</p><p>Two other mutants were tested to see if changing the region upstream of the CHR to DNA binding sites for Sp1 and Sp3 would diminish cell cycle-dependent transcription, like a random mutation did in M1 and M4 mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>A). Unexpectedly, both mutants M15 and M16, which were created to place Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites upstream of the CHR, do not show a reduced cell cycle-dependent transcription. Instead, cell cycle transcription is even more pronounced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B). Additional mutation of the CHR in the M16 construct to the M17 mutant leads to a total loss of cell cycle-dependent transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B). This proves that introduction of Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites alone is not sufficient to create a cell cycle element.</p><p>We tested protein binding to the Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites that were introduced in the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter and could support cell cycle-dependent transcription. Because of the similarity between E2F and Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites we used E2F-1&#x0002f;DP-1 proteins in EMSAs. The M16 and M17 mutants, both based on the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter and mutated to an Sp1&#x0002f;3 site, were able to shift a weak band compared with bona fide E2F sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f6">6</xref>). However, mutant M15, also a <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter segment with an Sp1&#x0002f;3 site, cannot yield a band with E2F (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f6">6</xref>). Since mutants M15 and M16 showed cell cycle-dependent transcription and mutant M17 did not, and only mutants M16 and M17 but not M15 could bind E2F, it can be excluded that only E2F is responsible for cell cycle transcription through Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites introduced in the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f6">6</xref>).</p><p>Sp1 and Sp3 protein binding to wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides was tested by EMSA from HeLa cell nuclear extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>). The GC control probe provides mobilities for the Sp1 and Sp3 protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2). A wild-type DNA fragment from the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter cell cycle regulatory region containing the CHR does not bind Sp1 or Sp3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>A, lane 3). Probes based on the same oligonucleotide with mutations in the CHR or the region upstream of it (M1, M4, M6 and M9) do not give an Sp1&#x0002f;3 shift (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>A). However, <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter mutants engineered to contain Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites shift bands with the mobility of Sp1 and Sp3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>A, M15&#x02013;M17). To confirm the identity of Sp1 and Sp3 shifts, we carried out competition EMSAs and experiments including specific antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>B). An oligonucleotide (GC) which can bind both Sp1 and Sp3 factors shifts two bands that can be self-competed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2). The bands are reduced in intensity or disappear and supershifted complexes become visible when antibodies specific for Sp1 or Sp3 are added (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4). The same Sp1 and Sp3 complexes are shifted by the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter mutants M14 to M17. Competition with the Sp1&#x0002f;3-binding GC oligonucleotide abrogates binding of the two specific bands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;12).</p></sec><sec><title>Sp1 and Sp3 can bind to an activator site in the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter</title><p>There is one putative Sp1&#x0002f;3 site in the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter centered around nucleotide &#x02013;709 in the mouse promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f2">2</xref>). The homologous region in the human promoter, containing a sequence for a classical Sp1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c34">34</xref>), had been deleted with a loss of about one-third of the activity and thereby shown to be relevant for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c30">30</xref>), but protein binding to this site remained to be tested. In EMSAs the GC oligonucleotide and a specific antibody were used as positive controls. The Sp25C probe containing the putative Sp1&#x0002f;3 site from the mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter was employed to compete with the two complexes specific for Sp1 and Sp3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;4). The <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter segment used as a probe was able to shift Sp1 and Sp3 factors whereas a mutant of the Sp1&#x0002f;3 site (Sp25Cmut) did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>C, lanes 5 and 9). Supershift with the antibody against Sp1 and competition with self and the GC oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>C, lanes 6&#x02013;8) are consistent with the notion that the putative Sp1&#x0002f;3 site in the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter is indeed a binding site for Sp1 and Sp3.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>All CHR elements identified until now need a CDE in tandem with them to be functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c10">10</xref>). We describe here for the first time a CHR that does not have a CDE 4 nt upstream. The CHR in the mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter is homologous to the CHR in the human promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f2">2</xref>). However, the human <italic>cdc25C</italic> CHR can only repress and, thereby, regulate transcription during the cell cycle while the CDE 5&#x02032; from it is intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c8">8</xref>). The nucleotide sequence 5&#x02032; from the mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> CHR is different from any known CDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c10">10</xref>). Nevertheless, mutation of this segment reduces cell cycle-dependent transcription in mutants M1 to M4 to some extent, but it is clearly not as pronounced as with mutations in the CHR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>A). In contrast, for <italic>cyclin A</italic>, <italic>cdc2</italic> and human <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoters mutations in CDEs and CHRs had equally strong effects on deregulation of cell cycle-dependent transcription. Furthermore, an extensive and detailed mutational analysis of the CDE in the human <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter shows that a mutation from 5&#x02032;-GGCGG-3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032;-AGTGG-3&#x02032;, as found in the mouse promoter described here, would clearly result in a loss of cell cycle-dependent transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c8">8</xref>). Comparison of the CHR elements in the human and mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoters reveals that the homology extends beyond the CHR core (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f2">2</xref>). However, a detailed study testing various nucleotides in and around the CHR core in the human promoter has shown that nucleotides outside the core 5&#x02032;-TTTGAA-3&#x02032; are not needed for cell cycle-dependent transcriptional regulation in this assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c11">11</xref>). The difference in CDE&#x0002f;CHR combinations of mouse and human <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoters is not likely the result of a general species difference since CDE&#x0002f;CHR-regulated promoters from mouse have been described with CDEs that conform the CDE consensus derived from human <italic>cdc25C</italic> CDE, e.g. as seen in the mouse <italic>cyclin B2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c10">10</xref>). Another point indicating that it is not just the difference in organism that dictates the combination of CDEs and CHRs results from the fact that in most transfections of reporter constructs for cell cycle assays mouse NIH 3T3 cells are used irrespective of the origin of the gene.</p><p>CDE sequences display some homology to E2F sites. In fact, for <italic>cyclin A</italic> and <italic>cdc2</italic> it has been described that E2F can bind to CDEs in the promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c12">12</xref>). Furthermore, in the <italic>B-myb</italic> promoter a CHR-like element, named the downstream repression site, was identified to regulate cell cycle-dependent transcription together with an E2F site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c36">36</xref>). Therefore, we tested if the isolated CHR in the mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter can cooperate with an E2F site. Transcriptional up-regulation during the cell cycle by this hybrid E2F&#x0002f;CHR is even more pronounced than with wild-type CHR element alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B). Still, this regulation is dependent on the CHR since its mutation leads to a drop of cell cycle transcription despite an intact E2F site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B, mutant M14). We conclude that the <italic>cdc25C</italic> CHR can cooperate with an E2F site.</p><p>Originally thought of as a negative control we created two constructs that yielded Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites upstream from the CHR (mutants M15 and M16). Surprisingly, the two mutant promoters did slightly better in up-regulating cell cycle-dependent stimulation of transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>B), different from promoters with other mutations in this region which show a moderate loss of regulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref>A, mutants M1 to M4). Both Sp1&#x0002f;3 mutants of the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter (M15 and M16) are able to bind Sp1 and Sp3 proteins. Also the E2F mutants M13 and M14 bind well to Sp1&#x0002f;3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f7">7</xref>A and B). This suggests that Sp1 and Sp3 proteins can also bind <italic>in vivo</italic> to this region adjacent to the central regulator site CHR, implying that E2F as well as Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites can cooperate with the CHR in cell cycle-regulated transcription.</p><p>Sp1&#x0002f;3 had earlier been implicated in cell cycle transcription but never in conjunction with CDE&#x0002f;CHR regulation. For example, binding of Sp1&#x0002f;3 to a GC element has been shown for the hamster <italic>thymidine kinase</italic> promoter which is necessary for growth-related transcription from this promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c37">37</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that Sp1 and E2F sites overlap in the mouse <italic>cyclin E</italic> promoter and have an antagonistic effect on transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c38">38</xref>). It has been found that pRb can form complexes with Sp1 during all phases of the cell cycle. This complex activates the hamster <italic>dihydrofolate reductase</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c19">19</xref>). Karlseder <italic>et al.</italic> showed that cooperation between E2F and Sp1 is necessary for general activity of growth-dependent transcription of the mouse <italic>thymidine kinase</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c18">18</xref>). Sp1 binding sites are necessary for E2F-1-dependent repression of the human <italic>cyclin D1</italic> promoter. E2F-1 can act through an Sp1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c20">20</xref>). To a limited extent this could also be the case for <italic>cdc25C</italic> transcription since we observe a weak binding of E2F also to the Sp1&#x0002f;3 mutants M16 and M17 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f6">6</xref>). Recently, cooperation between Sp1 and E2F sites has been reported in a promoter regulating <italic>DNA polymerase</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c39">39</xref>). In summary, it appears to be a novel finding that Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites can substitute for the CDE in a CDE&#x0002f;CHR tandem element.</p><p>Generally, standard deviations in experiments presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f5">5</xref> are relatively large. The reason is that we have performed several completely independent experiments and included them in these results. Therefore, variations stemming from, for example, synchronization of cells, transfections and luciferase measurements are the cause for these standard deviations. In particular, quality of synchronization varies to a large extent from one experiment to another. Because of these strong potential variations we refrained from just presenting several measurements from experiments carried out in parallel with just one representative synchronization.</p><p>The regulatory region of other <italic>cdc25</italic> genes, like that of mouse <italic>cdc25B</italic>, are different from that of <italic>cdc25C</italic>. The <italic>cdc25B</italic> promoter contains a TATA box and its transcription during the cell cycle is, in part, mediated by a cell cycle-regulated repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf306c40">40</xref>). The two sites overlap and are different from the CHR described for the <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf306f2">2</xref>).</p><p>In summary, it becomes evident that the CHR can act as a single element in cell cycle-dependent transcription or function in tandem with CDE, E2F or Sp1&#x0002f;3 sites. It appears that E2F, Sp1 and Sp3 proteins can cooperate with the protein binding to the CHR. So far this factor has eluded identification. From the work described here it is obvious that a priority of future work will be to elucidate the identity of this transcriptional regulator and analyze its interactions with other factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_30_9_1967__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_30_9_1967__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf306f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Cell cycle-dependent expression from the mouse <italic>cdc25C</italic> promoter.

Stimulation rates represent transcriptional regulation of wild-type <italic>cdc25C</italic> and mutant promoters during the cell cycle. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with wild-type (wt) or mutant m25C-luci constructs, grown for 24 h, starved by serum deprivation and restimulated to enter the cell cycle. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity. Wild-type and mutant constructs were tested in parallel experiments. Stimulation of promoter activity during the cell cycle was calculated by dividing luciferase activities 24 h after serum addition by activities before serum stimulation. Stimulation for wt-m25C-luci was set as 100&#x00025; and percentages for mutants were calculated for every experiment relative to this stimulation. Average stimulation for wild-type was 13.6-fold.
