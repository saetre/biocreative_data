Weakening and disruption of intercellular adhesions represents one of the most characteristic features of EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Differentiated epithelial cells strongly adhere to each other via specialized junctional complexes assembled at the lateral plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Among them, the most apically-located tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs) are critical for epithelial cell differentiation and maintenance of the integrity of epithelial layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. TJs and AJs mediate cell-cell adhesions through homotypical interactions of their transmembrane proteins such as occludin, claudins and E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, these junctional complexes are affiliated with the apical actin cytoskeleton, and participate in outside in transduction of signals and forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Disruption of TJs and AJs occurs at the early stage of EMT and has two major functional consequences in tumor cells. One is the increase in cell proliferation, and another is enhanced cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The former reflects the fact that TJs and AJs sequester many transcriptional regulators such as &#x003b2;-catenin, ZONAB, and symplekin, which upon junctional disassembly translocate into the nucleus to stimulate expression of genes controlling cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The later effect is due to dramatic cytoskeletal reorganizations induced by the loss of intercellular contacts and resulting in altered cell-matrix adhesions and actin filament dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although TJ/AJ disassembly plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis, its molecular mechanisms remain poorly investigated.</p><p>Disruption of epithelial junctions during EMT is commonly modeled <italic>in vitro </italic>by exposing epithelial cells to growth factors or chemical tumor promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Among them, carcinogens targeting protein kinase C (PKC) are the most extensively characterized. PKC, which plays a key role in cancer signaling pathways, is dramatically stimulated by two major classes of pharmacological agents: phorbol esters and indole alkaloids, teleocidins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These PKC activators elicit a variety of responses characteristic of tumor cells, including stimulation of cell proliferation, decreased sensitivity to apoptosis, increased cell-matrix adhesion and cell migration/invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Because of this, phorbol esters and teleocidins are widely used to study signaling pathways which underline tumor progression and metastasis.</p><p>A large body of evidence indicates that scattering/invasiveness of epithelial cells induced by PKC-targeting tumor promoters involves disassembly of intercellular junctions. Indeed, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was shown to disrupt AJs in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], mouse epidermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and rat liver epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, TPA and teleocidin have been shown to rapidly increase paracellular permeability and disassemble TJs in confluent monolayers of MDCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], LLC-PK1 porcine renal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and human corneal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, molecular mechanisms underlying disassembly of epithelial junctions by PKC-targeting tumor promoters remain poorly characterized. Several studies highlighted the role of endocytosis of AJ/TJ proteins E-cadherin and occludin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, endocytosis alone cannot be responsible for PKC-dependent junctional breakdown. Indeed, a continuous internalization of E-cadherin and claudins in confluent epithelial cell monolayers does not result in AJ/TJ disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], being antagonized by the apical actin cytoskeleton, known to associate with and stabilize AJ and TJ structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Reorganization/disassembly of the perijunctional actin cytoskeleton is required for the large-scale disruption and internalization of epithelial apical junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>PKC is a powerful regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in a variety of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and phorbol esters have been shown to induce dramatic reorganization of actin filaments in epithelial monolayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is therefore likely that disassembly and internalization of epithelial junctions induced by PKC activators is mediated by remodeling of the perijunctional actin cytoskeleton. Reorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton are usually driven by myosin II motor, which slides actin filaments against each other, thus producing contractile forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Epithelial cells express nonmuscle myosin (NM) II, which is enriched in perijunctional circumferential F-actin bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, NM II activity was shown to be critical for disassembly of epithelial junctions caused by various stimuli, such as depletion of extracellular calcium and proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However, it is unknown whether NM II plays a role in the disruption of epithelial junctions during cancer cell metastasis and specifically during junctional disassembly induced by PKC-activating tumor promoters.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of NM II in the disassembly of epithelial apical junctions caused by PKC-targeting tumor promoters, which mimic the disruption of epithelial cell-cell adhesions during EMT and tumor metastasis. We rationalized that appropriate model cell line for this study should fulfill the following criteria: 1) to be a human tumor cell line; 2) to have well-developed TJs and AJs; 3) to readily disassemble their junctions after exposure to PKC-activating tumor-promoters. However, MDCK and LLC-PK1 cell lines, which are widely used to study phorbol ester-induced junctional disruption, do not fulfill the first criteria since they are neither human, nor cancer cells. On the other hand, well characterized human colonic carcinoma cell lines, such as T84, Caco-2, and HT-29 do not respond to PKC activation by junctional disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. To overcome this problem, we used HPAF-II human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. These cells readily differentiate to form well-defined apical junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], which appear to be easily disruptable by tumor promoters octylindolactam (OI)-V and TPA. Using this model, we observe that OI-V-induced disassembly of epithelial AJs and TJs is mediated by activation of NM II, which is stimulated by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) II in a RhoA-independent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>OI-V and TPA rapidly disrupt paracellular barrier and induce disassembly of epithelial apical junctions</title><p>HPAF-II cells cultured on permeable membrane support rapidly (within 5&#x02013;7 days) developed confluent cell monolayers with high (1,500&#x02013;2,100 Ohm &#x000d7; cm<sup>2</sup>) transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis of these monolayers showed a typical 'chicken wire' labeling pattern for E-cadherin, &#x003b2;-catenin, occludin and ZO-1 at the cell apex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which is characteristic for the mature AJs and TJs. To investigate the effects of PKC activators on apical junctions, HPAF-II cells were treated with 0.1 &#x003bc;M and 1 &#x003bc;M of either OI-V or TPA. In this concentration range, both agents reportedly induce membrane translocation and activation of 50&#x02013;100% of different PKC izoenzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Exposure of HPAF-II cell monolayers to either OI-V or TPA resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent increase in paracellular permeability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Thus, 1 &#x003bc;M of OI-V (curve 3) or TPA (curve 5) decreased TEER from initial value of ~2000 Ohm &#x000d7; cm<sup>2 </sup>to ~5 Ohm &#x000d7; cm<sup>2 </sup>within 5 h.

Interestingly, OI-V caused more profound disruption of junctional morphology than TPA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which is consistent with a previous study demonstrating a superior potency of teleocidin over phorbol ester in increasing permeability of LLC-PK1 cell monolayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Because of its higher efficiency, all subsequent experiments were performed using 1 &#x003bc;M of OI-V.</p></sec><sec><title>Classical PKC isoenzymes mediate OI-V-induced junctional disassembly</title><p>Next we sought to elucidate which intracellular signal initiates OI-V-dependent junctional disassembly. While teleocidins and phorbol esters primarily signal through activation of PKC, several other target proteins, such as protein kinase D, chimaerins, and Munc 13 have been recently identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed the role of PKC in OI-V-mediated AJ/TJ disassembly in HPAF-II cells. In addition, we sought to determine which subclass of PKC is involved. PKC isoenzymes are classified into three subclasses: "classical" (PKC&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;I, &#x003b2;II, and &#x003b3;), "novel" (PKC&#x003b4;, &#x003b8;, &#x003b5; and &#x003b7;) and "atypical" (PKC&#x003b6; and &#x003b9;/&#x003bb;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Since only first two subclasses are activated by teleocidins and phorbol esters, we asked whether classical or novel PKC mediate disruption of epithelial junctions.</p><p>To address these questions, we first investigated which PKC isoforms are expressed in HPAF-II cells. RT-PCR and immunoblotting analyses revealed the presence of multiple isoforms including three classical (PKC&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; I, and &#x003b3;) and four novel (PKC&#x003b4;, &#x003b8;, &#x003b5; and &#x003b7;) isoenzymes (Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). In OI-V treated cells, members of both classical (PKC&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;I) and novel (PKC&#x003b4;) subclasses rapidly (within 1 h) accumulated at cell membranes (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), which is indicative of PKC activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. To gain insight into the functional roles of different PKC subclasses in OI-V-mediated junctional disassembly, pharmacological PKC inhibitors with different subclass specificity were used. They include GF-109203X, which inhibits both classical and novel PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], a selective inhibitor of classical PKC, G&#x000f6; 6976 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], and an inhibitor of novel PKC &#x003b4; and &#x003b8;, rottlerin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].

In this study, we investigate molecular mechanisms underlying tumor promoter-induced disassembly of epithelial apical junctions by challenging HPAF-II human pancreatic epithelial cell monolayers with OI-V or TPA. HPAF-II cells have been derived from highly metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These cells polarize in culture and develop a high resistance paracellular barrier with well-defined TJs and AJs. In addition, these cells are amenable to transfection with siRNAs. Together, these features make HPAF-II cells an excellent <italic>in vitro </italic>model to study disruption of epithelial cell-cell adhesions during tumor progression/metastasis.</p><p>Exposure of HPAF-II cell monolayers to OI-V or TPA induced rapid opening of the paracellular barrier (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and disassembly of AJs and TJs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Since both agents are known to activate PKC, it is logical to suggest that such a junctional disassembly is triggered by activation of PKC. Our pharmacological inhibition and biochemical analyses confirmed the role of PKC activation in disruption of epithelial AJs and TJs and indicated that classical PKC isoenzymes are responsible for this biological effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Different classes of PKC have been previously implicated in phorbol ester-mediated opening of epithelial barriers. Our data are consistent with results of two studies that have implicated classical PKC in TPA-induced increase in paracellular permeability in LLC-PK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and T84 cell monolayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. However, some other studies have suggested the role of novel PKC isoforms in TPA-induced internalization of AJ protein E-cadherin in MDCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and disruption of claudin-4-based TJ in OVCA433 ovarian epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Since TPA and OI-V activate both classical and novel PKC, distinct roles of these subfamilies in AJ/TJ disassembly in different epithelia is likely to reflect cell-specific differences in their expressional levels and/or junctional association. It is noteworthy, that pharmacological inhibitors do not allow identification of the individual PKC isoform, which is responsible for AJ/TJ disruption in HPAF-II cell monolayers. Further studies involving more selective RNA interference or dominant-negative PKC mutant approaches are required to answer this important question.</p><p>A key finding of this study is a critical role of NM II in disassembly of AJs and TJs upon PKC activation in HPAF-II epithelial cells. It should be noted that the involvement of actomyosin contractility in PKC-dependent disruption of cell-cell adhesions has been addressed in previous publication, which yielded conflicting results. Thus, the increased F-actin tension/contraction has been implicated in phorbol-ester-induced disruption of endothelial junctions in one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], but not another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] study. Furthermore, TPA was shown to either increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>], have no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] or decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] RMLC phosphorylation in endothelial and epithelial cell monolayers. Our conclusion that PKC activation disrupts epithelial AJs and TJs via stimulating NM II activity is based on several lines of evidence. First, OI-V triggered NM II activation in HPAF-II cells at the onset of junctional disassembly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Second, NM II relocalized to disassembling junctions in parallel with cell rounding in OI-V-treated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Finally, inhibition of NM II significantly attenuated OI-V-induced disassembly of AJs and TJs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>Our study provides the first direct evidence implicating NM II activity in the disruption of epithelial apical junctions by PKC-activating tumor promoters. Such activation of NM II is likely to serve as a trigger for junctional disassembly by either breaking adhesive contacts formed by transmembrane junctional proteins, or by destabilizing perijunctional F-actin bundles. This may activate endocytosis of AJ/TJ proteins, thus leading to complete disintegration of apical junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although the role of NM II in the breakdown of epithelial barrier in inflammation is generally accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], it has not been explored whether similar mechanism mediates disruption of epithelial cell-cell adhesions in tumorigenesis. Based on the present <italic>in vitro </italic>data, we hypothesize that stimulation of actomyosin contractility can also be involved in the loss of epithelial cell-cell contacts during metastatic scattering of tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Although PKC was shown to directly phosphorylate RMLC at Ser1/2 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], such phosphorylation cannot be responsible for the increased level of Ser19/Thr18-phosphorylated RLMC and stimulation of actomyosin contractility. In a search for an intermediate signaling step, which links PKC activation and stimulation of NM II, we identified ROCK as a critical regulator of junctional disassembly in OI-V-challenged HPAF-II cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Importantly, selective siRNA-mediated knock-down of ROCK-I and ROCK-II showed a unique role of the latter isoform in the PKC-dependent disruption of epithelial junctions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). These results are in a good agreement with our recent study, which demonstrated the involvement of ROCK-II, but not ROCK-I in AJ/TJ disassembly induced by the depletion of extracellular calcium in intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Although ROCK-I and ROCK-II are highly homologous (~65% of sequence identity and 92% identity in their kinase domain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>], these isoforms can be differentially regulated, and can activate distinct actomyosin-dependent processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. For example, ROCK-II, but not ROCK-I, binds to inositol phospholipids, and is activated by phosphoinositol-3-kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. These different regulatory mechanisms are likely to underline a selective involvement of ROCK-II in the dynamics of epithelial apical junctions. Importantly, our pharmacological analysis failed to observe the involvement of MLCK or ERK-mediated signaling in PKC-dependent AJ/TJ disassembly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), which further supports a unique role of ROCK in stimulating NM II-dependent contractility that disrupts epithelial junctions.</p><p>Inhibition of NM II and ROCK while substantially attenuating OI-V-induced disintegration of AJ/TJ structure either did not affect, or only modestly attenuated the decrease in TEER (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This suggests that PKC activation compromises integrity of the epithelial barrier via several pathways including, but not limited to ROCK and NM II. Additional mechanisms may involve PKC-dependent changes in phosphorylation of different junctional components, which perturbs normal protein-protein interactions within the AJ/TJ complexes. Indeed, altered phosphorylation of occludin and p120 catenin was observed in epithelial and endothelial cells exposed to PKC-activating tumor promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]</p><p>One intriguing findings of this study is that the signaling cascade, which is triggered by PKC activation and mediated by ROCK-II does not involve RhoA GTPase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). This implies that PKC can bypass RhoA in stimulating ROCK-II activity and is consistent with a recent report demonstrating PKC-dependent ROCK activation downstream of RhoA in human endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. Our findings also agree with data obtained in other experimental systems which demonstrated that RhoA inhibition did not prevent TPA-induced contraction in cerebrovascular smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>] or TPA-mediated reorganization of NM II in CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. Lack of involvement of RhoA in OI-V-induced junctional disassembly indicates that this process may be either regulated by other Rho isoforms such as RhoC and RhoE, or may involve Rho-independent mechanisms.</p><p>Recent studies have unraveled a complexity of mechanisms regulating ROCK activity which also involves Rho-independent activatory modes. For example, a Rho-independent cleavage of ROCK, that renders this enzyme constitutively active, was reported by several groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]. Particularly, ROCK-II was shown to be cleaved by caspase-2 in thrombin-stimulated endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>] or by granzyme B in apoptotic lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]. However, this mechanism is not responsible for ROCK-II activation by PKC-targeting tumor promoters in model pancreatic epithelium, since OI-V did no induce ROCK-II cleavage in HPAF-II cells (data not shown), and caused junctional disassembly in caspase-independent fashion (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Further studies are required to elucidate mechanisms of PKC-dependent activation of ROCK-II in epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study dissected critical intracellular events which are involved in disassembly of epithelial apical junctions stimulated by the tumor promoter, octylindolactam V.
