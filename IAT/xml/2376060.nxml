A better understanding of the pathogenesis and risk factors for this disease will contribute not only to improvements in early detection and prevention but also to the development of more effective therapies for it.</p><p>Approximately 10&#x00025; of NSCLC specimens carry activating mutations in <italic>K-ras</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-AvielRonen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The histologic subtype of NSCLC that most frequently has <italic>K-ras</italic> mutations is adenocarcinoma; 30&#x00025; of adenocarcinomas have these mutations. <italic>K-ras</italic> mutations have also been identified in atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) lesions, which are thought to precede the development of lung adenocarcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Mori1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. A growing body of evidence indicates that <italic>K-ras</italic> mutations are important in the initiation of lung adenocarcinoma development. Mouse models have been developed that express mutant <italic>K-ras</italic> conditionally, somatically, or inducibly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Fisher1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Johnson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These mice develop AAH lesions rapidly and with high penetrance, and a subset of these lesions progress to adenocarcinomas.</p><p>A candidate lung cancer progenitor cell (bronchioalveolar stem cell or BASC) has been identified in murine models of <italic>K-ras</italic>-induced lung cancer. BASCs have a specific pattern of stem cell marker expression (Sca-1<sup>pos</sup> CD34<sup>pos</sup> CD45<sup>neg</sup> Pecam<sup>neg</sup>), are located at the terminal bronchi, and have the capacity to self-renew and undergo multi-linage differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Kim1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These cells may be the same as the variant Clara (or Clara<sup>V</sup>) cells, which are located adjacent to clusters of neuroendocrine bodies in bronchi and bronchioles. Similar to BASCs, Clara<sup>V</sup> cells are capable of restoring the Clara cell population after naphthalene injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Rawlins1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. After intra-nasal installation of adenoviral Cre into Kras<sup>LSL</sup> mice, which develop lung adenocarcinoma due to activation of a conditional oncogenic <italic>K-ras</italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Jackson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, BASCs rapidly proliferate prior to the development of histologic abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Kim1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The BASCs in these mice contain <italic>K-ras</italic> mutations identical to those found in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Kim1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. On the basis of this evidence, BASCs are postulated to be progenitors of lung adenocarcinoma in mice. The biochemical signals that initiate the expansion of this cellular population have not been fully elucidated. This deficiency is important given that the elucidation of these signals might lead to better treatment for NSCLC patients.</p><p>Premalignant lesions typically undergo a transient expansion followed by programmed senescence, and only a minority of early lesions progresses to a fully transformed state. In the case of Ras-dependent cancer mouse models, the programmed senescence of premalignant lesions is activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, which inhibits Ras through feed-back pathways involving increased expression of SPROUTY proteins, Ras GTPase activating proteins, and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-CourtoisCox1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The senescence program in premalignant lesions can be blocked by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-CourtoisCox1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that PI3K is a crucial determinant of the malignant progression of these lesions. In fact, PI3K signaling is constitutively activated in NSCLC cells through inactivating somatic mutations in, or epigenetic silencing of, <italic>phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10</italic> (<italic>Pten</italic>), a lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K signaling cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Eng1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Forgacs1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the importance of PI3K in regulating the expansion of BASCs in two genetic mouse models of oncogenic <italic>K-ras-</italic>induced lung cancer. The oncogenic <italic>K-ras</italic> alleles in these models are activated somatically in one (Kras<sup>LA1</sup>) and conditionally in the other (Kras<sup>LSL</sup>) (5, 7). We found increased numbers of BASCs in these mice relative to those of wild-type littermates. BASC expansion and malignant progression in the lung were attenuated by pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K and enhanced by genetic inactivation of <italic>Pten</italic>. We speculate on the basis of these findings that pharmacologic strategies to inhibit PI3K will be useful in the prevention and treatment of NSCLC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PX-866 inhibits lung tumorigenesis in Kras<sup>LA1</sup> mice</title><p>We postulated that PI3K is required for malignant progression in lung cancer and tested this hypothesis by using Kras<sup>LA1</sup> mice as a model of lung tumorigenesis.

This conclusion was based on findings from experiments that incorporated pharmacologic and genetic approaches to target PI3K in two different genetic mouse models and an <italic>in vitro</italic> model. We have previously reported that <italic>Pten</italic> inactivation cooperates with oncogenic <italic>K-ras</italic> to accelerate lung tumorigenesis, causing lung tumors that are more histologically advanced and more rapidly obstruct bronchial lumina and replace alveolar spaces than those of mice with oncogenic <italic>K-ras</italic> alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Iwanaga1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these findings raise the possibility that PI3K promoted lung tumorigenesis through its effects on BASCs. However, conclusive evidence in this regard will require proof that adenocarcinomas arise from BASCs. Transplantation studies to determine whether BASC injections are sufficient to recapitulate lung adenocarcinoma development in mice have thus far not been reported. A stem cell population has been identified in the lungs of mice and in tumors from NSCLC patients that expresses CD133, exhibits stem cell characteristics <italic>in vitro</italic> (forms spheres and can be induced to undergo terminal differentiation), and is tumorigenic in nude mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Eramo1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Although certain features of that stem cell population are similar to those of BASCs (i.e. response to naphthalene-induced lung injury), their relationship remains to be elucidated.</p><p>When initiated during embryogenesis, conditional <italic>Pten</italic> inactivation in the lung leads to hypoxia and perinatal death, indicating that <italic>Pten</italic> expression is required for normal lung development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Yanagi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, Cre expression in CCSP<sup>Cre</sup> mice began at postnatal day 4, allowing us to evaluate <italic>Pten</italic>'s role in maintaining lung function after birth. Although we can not exclude the possibility that subtle changes in lung function occurred, the <italic>Pten</italic>-deficient mice in this study had no obvious alterations in their lung structure and exhibited no morbidity at up to 12 months of age, suggesting that, after birth, lung tissues can function normally without <italic>Pten</italic>. This apparent resilience of lung tissues to <italic>Pten</italic> deficiency stands in contrast to adult hematopoietic stem cells, which are depleted within 40 days after inactivation of <italic>Pten</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Yilmaz1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that the self-renewal capabilities of hematopoietic stem cells can not be maintained in the absence of PTEN's negative growth regulatory signals. Although the reasons for this difference are not clear, it may be related in part to the relative infrequency with which lung stem cells normally divide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Rawlins1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>PI3K has been reported to play an important role in tumorigenesis initiated by oncogenic <italic>K-ras</italic>. Kras<sup>LA2</sup> mice that have a knock-in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation that blocks the interaction of PI3K with K-ras develop far fewer lung tumors than do Kras<sup>LA2</sup> mice with wild-type <italic>PIK3CA</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Gupta1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating a key role for PI3K as a downstream mediator of K-ras. Corroborating this point, we found that PX-866 treatment inhibited lung tumor growth in Kras<sup>LA1</sup> mice. However, based on other findings reported here, the importance of PI3K in <italic>K-ras</italic>-induced lung tumorigenesis may not be restricted to its role as a downstream mediator of K-ras. First, PI3K expression increased as Kras<sup>LA1</sup> lung tissues underwent malignant progression from AAH to adenocarcinoma, suggesting that PI3K was activated in these histologically advanced lesions in part through K-ras-independent mechanisms. Second, findings reported here and elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Iwanaga1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> indicate that <italic>Pten</italic> inactivation enhanced oncogenic <italic>K-ras</italic>&#x02013;induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. Extrapolating from these findings, somatic mutations in NSCLC cells involving genes that regulate PI3K-dependent signaling (i.e. <italic>Pten, Egfr</italic>, and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Angulo1">&#x0005b;ref. 23&#x0005d;</xref>) may transform these cells in part by cooperating with oncogenic <italic>K-ras</italic>. The potential importance of secondary somatic mutations in promoting oncogenic <italic>K-ras</italic>-induced lung tumorigenesis is illustrated by the long latencies of adenocarcinomas that arise in mice engineered to express mutant <italic>K-ras</italic>, which develop lung lesions rapidly and with high penetrance, but only a fraction of the lesions progress into adenocarcinomas and require several months to do so <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Fisher1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Johnson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Findings reported here differed from those reported previously in a different strain of mice that undergo conditional <italic>Pten</italic> deletion induced by SPC-driven Cre expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Yanagi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In that report, <italic>Pten</italic> inactivation was sufficient to increase BASC numbers and induce lung tumors, which stands in contrast to findings presented here and elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002220-Iwanaga1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> that <italic>Pten</italic> deficiency is not sufficient to increase BASC numbers or induce lung tumors. That previous report also differed with respect to the genetic events that cooperated with <italic>Pten</italic> deficiency. In that study, <italic>Pten</italic> inactivation accelerated lung tumorigenesis induced by urethane, a carcinogen that frequently induces <italic>K-ras</italic> mutations, but only 2 of 6 tumors evaluated had <italic>K-ras</italic> mutations, which leaves open the possibility that urethane cooperates with <italic>Pten</italic> loss by inducing somatic mutations of genes other than <italic>K-ras</italic>. This stands in contrast to our model in which the conditional <italic>K-ras</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic> alleles recombined in the same (CCSP-expressing) cells. Hence, the disparate outcomes of these studies might be related to secondary genetic events in the urethane-treated mice or differences in experimental design, such as the genetic backgrounds of the mice or the specific promoter elements driving Cre expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Antibodies purchased for these studies include rabbit anti-p110&#x003b1; (sc-7174), p110&#x003b2; (sc-7175), SPC (sc-13979), goat anti-CC10 (sc-9772) and PTEN (sc-6818) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-total AKT (9272), Ser473-phosphorylated AKT (9271), Ser21/9-phosphorylated GSK3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (9331), total GSK3 (9332), cleaved caspase-3 (9661), Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (9542), phosphorylated-histone H3 (9701), Ser28-phosphorylated histone H3 (9713P) (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), rabbit anti-SPC (WRAB-SPC, Seven Hills Bioreagents, Cincinnati, OH), rabbit anti-CCSP (07-623, Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY), FITC-conjugated anti-Sca-1 (557405), biotin-conjugated anti-CD45 (553771) biotin-conjugated-CD31 (558737), PE-conjugated anti-CD34 (12-0341-33, eBioscience), anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Flour 488 (A11008), and anti-goat IgG Alexa Flour 594 (A11058) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
