In contrast with the long life of immature oocytes in ovary, the life of ovulated mature eggs is limited to only a few days. Many reports indicate that aged eggs without fertilization or parthenogenetically activated eggs eventually die by apoptosis [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]]. Although the exhaustion of nutrients can contribute to oocyte/egg apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the mechanism of this machinery is still poorly understood.</p><p>The translation of Mos protein kinase begins during oocyte maturation and automatically activates Mos-MEK-ERK (p42MAPK in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte)-p90Rsk kinase cascade. This is called CSF (cytostatic factor) pathway because its primary role is to arrest the cell cycle until fertilization [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]]. In vertebrates, CSF arrests mature eggs at the metaphase of meiosis II, and many mitotic kinases including Cdc2/cyclin B are also kept active. Recent studies suggest that CSF pathway also regulates apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], but the exact targets are largely unknown.</p><p>Baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) family proteins are evolutionarily conserved zinc-coordinating proteins, and some members inhibit apoptosis by blocking caspase activities [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]]. We recently identified four BIR family proteins in <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs and examined their apoptosis-inhibiting activities using a cell-free system derived from interphase egg extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Whereas xXIAP was a physiological apoptosis inhibitor, xEIAP (identical with XLX reported by Holley <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]) only weakly inhibited apoptosis, and neither xSurvivin1/xBIR1 nor xSurvivin2/SIX showed anti-apoptotic activities. However, both CSF and mitotic kinases are inactive in interphase egg extracts, and we wondered whether BIR family proteins might be functionally regulated by phosphorylation in CSF-arrested egg extracts. We found that p42MAPK directly phosphorylated xEIAP/XLX on three Ser residues in the Ser-rich region between BIR2 and RING finger domains in CSF-arrested egg extracts. The effects of phosphorylation on the stability and anti-apoptotic activity of xEIAP/XLX were also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Phosphorylation-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift of xEIAP/XLX in CSF-arrested egg extracts</title><p>As previously reported, recombinant xEIAP/XLX is rapidly degraded by at least two distinct, consecutively acting proteolytic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Within 2 h incubation, xEIAP/XLX is significantly degraded in both CSF-arrested and interphase egg extracts in a C-terminal RING finger-dependent manner. Subsequently, spontaneous cytochrome <italic>c</italic>-induced caspase activation begins after 4 h incubation in interphase egg extracts (apoptotic egg extracts), and the remaining xEIAP/XLX is cleaved by the activated caspases at yet unidentified site(s). This caspase activation is delayed or suppressed in CSF-arrested egg extracts by a p42MAPK-dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We found that the electrophoretic mobilities of recombinant 6XHis-tagged (6XHis-FL) and MBP-tagged (MBP-FL) xEIAP/XLX slightly decreased during incubation in CSF-arrested but not interphase egg extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), whereas those of other BIR family proteins (xSurvivin1/xBIR1, xSurvivin2/SIX, and xXIAP) did not (data not shown). However, the rapid degradation of both 6XHis-FL and MBP-FL in egg extracts hampered the detailed analysis of this shift. Thus, we also used the C-terminally truncated stabilized forms of xEIAP/XLX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. MBP-&#x00394;1, consisting of residues 1&#x02013;269 of xEIAP/XLX, showed a marked upward shift in CSF-arrested but not interphase egg extracts. In contrast, the electrophoretic mobility of MBP-&#x00394;2 consisting of residues 1&#x02013;218 of xEIAP/XLX did not change in both extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To confirm that upward shift in CSF-arrested egg extracts was due to phosphorylation, endogenous xEIAP/XLX was immunoprecipitated from CSF-arrested egg extracts and then treated with alkaline phosphatase. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, the phosphatase treatment increased the electrophoretic mobility of endogenous xEIAP/XLX, indicating that the upward shift was indeed induced by phosphorylation. These results suggest that the region encompassing residues 219&#x02013;269 of xEIAP/XLX contains CSF-phosphorylation site(s). We also found that, in apoptotic egg extracts, MBP-fused recombinants generated several shorter fragments, most likely produced by caspase-mediated cleavages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The larger fragment (~70k, single asterisk) was slightly smaller than MBP-&#x00394;1, whereas the smaller fragments (50&#x02013;55k, double asterisks) were close to the parental MBP (45k). The cleavage of MBP-&#x00394;2, which was smaller than the larger fragment, produced only the smaller fragments. Our data indicate that xEIAP/XLX is cleaved at several sites, one of which locates between the residues 219&#x02013;269. It should be noted that our Western blot detected only the MBP-fused N-terminal fragments but not the released C-terminal fragments. We did not observe any cleavage products of radiolabeled 6XHis-FL, suggesting that the generated C-terminal fragments might be further degraded.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phosphorylation-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift of xEIAP/XLX in CSF-arrested egg extracts</bold>.

The presence of 100 &#x003bc;M roscovitine, a specific Cdk inhibitor, could not block the upward shift of MBP-&#x00394;1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast, 100 &#x003bc;M U0126, a specific inhibitor for MEK and thereby an indirect inhibitor for downstream p42MAPK and p90Rsk, partially inhibited the change of electrophoretic mobility. Staurosporine, a general protein kinase inhibitor, completely blocked the shift when supplied to CSF-arrested egg extracts at 10 &#x003bc;M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This result indicated that CSF pathway was involved in xEIAP/XLX phosphorylation. It should be noted that the complete inhibition of already activated p42MAPK and 90Rsk requires not only MEK inhibition but also the dephosphorylation of these kinases. The partial inhibition by U0126 suggests that xEIAP/XLX may be phosphorylated by downstream p42MAPK and/or p90Rsk rather than MEK itself. Indeed, recombinant p42MAPK phosphorylated MBP-&#x00394;1, but not MBP-&#x00394;2, <italic>in vitro </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, MAPK). In contrast, neither substrate was phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated Cdc2/Cyclin B2 complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, Cdc2). In control reactions, p42MAPK selectively phosphorylated myelin basic protein but not histone H1, whereas Cdc2/Cyclin B2 strongly phosphorylated both substrates. Similarly, MBP-&#x00394;1, histone H1, and myelin basic protein, but not MBP-&#x00394;2, were phosphorylated in CSF-arrested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, CSF) but not interphase egg extracts (Fig, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, INT). Altogether, we conclude that xEIAP/XLX is directly phosphorylated by p42MAPK in CSF-arrested egg extracts.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Phosphorylation of xEIAP/XLX by p42MAPK in CSF-arrested egg extracts</bold>.

There are five Ser-Pro-Xaa-Ser repeats within the residues 219&#x02013;269 of xEIAP/XLX, three of which (Ser235/251/254) fulfil optimal MAPK consensus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Although another optimal MAPK consensus site resides inside the first BIR domain of xEIAP/XLX (Ser58), this residue may not be recognized because MBP-&#x00394;2 was not phosphorylated by p42MAPK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). As C-terminal region absent in MBP-&#x00394;1 (residues 270&#x02013;401) contains no MAPK consensus site, MBP-&#x00394;1 is a suitable substrate to study the phosphorylation of xEIAP/XLX by p42MAPK. We first tried to evaluate the phosphorylation of individual Ser residues by Ala substitution, with closely located Ser251 and Ser254 mutated together. We analyzed the p42MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of WT, Ser235Ala single mutant (1A), Ser251/254Ala double mutant (2A), and Ser235/251/254Ala triple mutant (3A). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, 1A and 2A mutations led to 11% and 34% reductions of phosphorylation, respectively. The decrease of phosphorylation in 3A mutant (49%) was close to the sum of decreases in 1A and 2A mutants (45%), suggesting that these residues were independently phosphorylated. However, 3A mutant was still significantly phosphorylated, probably at Ser231/247, both in CSF-arrested extracts and by recombinant p42MAPK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Interestingly, when the same three Ser residues were changed to Asp (3D), this mutant was not phosphorylated at all (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The most straightforward interpretation of these data may be that Ser235/251/254 are the primary residues targeted by p42MAPK. The remaining residues were phosphorylated in 3A mutant but not in 3D mutant, presumably because the net charges also affected the phosphorylation status of xEIAP/XLX. The introduction of negative charges by p42MAPK-mediated phosphorylation may be limited to at most three sites under physiological condition, and remaining two residues can be phosphorylated only when Ser235/251/254 are substituted to neutral residues.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>p42MAPK phosphorylates Ser235/251/254 of xEIAP/XLX</bold>.

For 6XHis-FL, MBP-FL, and MBP-&#x00394;1, the upward band shift of WT observed in CSF-arrested egg extracts was reduced in 3A mutants and blocked in 3D mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Moreover, the larger cleavage product (single asterisk) in apoptotic egg extracts was slightly decreased in MBP-FL 3D mutant and absent in MBP-&#x00394;1 3D mutant. If we assume that this fragment is produced by caspase-mediated cleavage after Asp, the cleavage site may be Asp237 and the introduction of negative charge at Ser235 may inhibit caspase recognition especially in MBP-&#x00394;1. However, the smaller fragments of MBP-FL and MBP-&#x00394;1 (double asterisks) were equally observed in all the three recombinant forms. Thus, although MBP-&#x00394;1 was stabilized by 3D mutation against caspase-mediated cleavage in apoptotic egg extracts, the overall stabilities of 6XHis-FL and MBP-FL were not significantly altered by 3A or 3D mutation in both egg extracts, indicating that the alterations of p42MAPK recognition sites did not modify the stability of xEIAP/XLX in egg extracts. Next, we asked whether the apoptosis-inhibiting activity of xEIAP/XLX is affected by the same substitutions. As previously described, the time-dependent fragmentation of sperm nuclei is the hallmark of apoptosis execution in interphase egg extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The addition of MBP-xXIAP strongly inhibited nuclear fragmentation (positive control) compared to non-fused MBP (negative control). All xEIAP/XLX recombinants did not inhibit apoptosis significantly in our experiments, either in the presence (MBP-FL; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) or absence (MBP-&#x00394;1; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) of RING finger-containing C-terminus. Similar results were obtained in CSF-arrested egg extracts, as judged from the caspase-dependent cleavage of endogenous p150<sup>Glued </sup>at 6&#x02013;8 h (nuclear morphology could not be analyzed because of mitotic chromatin condensation, data not shown). Moreover, we previously reported that the immunodepletion of xEIAP/XLX from either CSF-arrested or interphase egg extracts showed no effect on apoptotic execution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Altogether, we conclude that neither protein stability nor apoptosis-inhibiting activity of xEIAP/XLX is affected by p42MAPK-mediated phosphorylation.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Phosphorylation of Ser235/251/254 affects neither protein stability nor apoptosis-inhibiting activity of xEIAP/XLX</bold>.

Kinase assay using purified p42MAPK and Cdc2/Cyclin B2 was performed in 10 &#x003bc;l of Assay Buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.7, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT) containing respective kinase, 1 &#x003bc;g of substrate protein, 100 &#x003bc;M cold ATP, and 37 kBq of [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (GE Healthcare). For phosphorylation assay by egg extracts, either CSF-arrested or interphase egg extracts were first diluted 5-fold with MEB-TX (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.7, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 80 mM sodium glycerol 2-phosphate, 20 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100). Diluted extracts were then supplied with 1 &#x003bc;g of substrate protein and 37 kBq of [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP in 10 &#x003bc;l. After the reaction at 30&#x000b0;C for 30 min, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed with image analyzer.</p></sec><sec><title>Dephosphorylation of endogenous xEIAP/XLX</title><p>Affinity-purified anti-xEIAP/XLX antibody was first immobilized on Affi-Prep Protein A beads and then mixed with CSF-arrested egg extracts to retrieve endogenous xEIAP/XLX.
