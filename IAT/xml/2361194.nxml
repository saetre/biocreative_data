However, the precise role of host cell death during in vivo infection remains poorly understood. Macrophages infected by pathogenic species of <italic>Yersinia</italic> typically undergo an apoptotic cell death. This is due to the activity of a Type III secreted effector protein, designated YopJ in <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, and YopP in the closely related <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>. It has recently been reported that <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> YopP shows intrinsically greater capacity for being secreted than <italic>Y. pestis</italic> YopJ, and that this correlates with enhanced cytotoxicity observed for high virulence serotypes of <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>. The enzymatic activity and secretory capacity of YopP from different <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> serotypes have been shown to be variable. However, the underlying basis for differential secretion of YopJ/YopP, and whether reduced secretion of YopJ by <italic>Y. pestis</italic> plays a role in pathogenesis during in vivo infection, is not currently known. It has also been reported that similar to macrophages, <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> infection of dendritic cells leads to YopP-dependent cell death. We demonstrate here that in contrast to <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>, <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> infection of bone marrow&#x02013;derived dendritic cells does not lead to increased cell death. However, death of <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected dendritic cells is enhanced by ectopic expression of YopP in place of YopJ. We further show that polymorphisms at the N-terminus of the YopP/YopJ proteins are responsible for their differential secretion, translocation, and consequent cytotoxicity. Mutation of two amino acids in YopJ markedly enhanced both translocation and cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, expression of YopP or a hypersecreted mutant of YopJ in <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> resulted in its attenuation in oral mouse infection. Complete absence of YopJ also resulted in attenuation of virulence, in accordance with previous observations. These findings suggest that control of cytotoxicity is an important virulence property for <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, and that intermediate levels of YopJ-mediated cytotoxicity are necessary for maximal systemic virulence of this bacterial pathogen.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The ability of bacterial pathogens to modulate death of infected host cells is an important virulence determinant. For pathogenic members of the genus <italic>Yersinia</italic>, the type III secreted effector protein YopJ/YopP is required for <italic>Yersinia</italic>-induced macrophage death. The YopJ protein is expressed by <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, while the ninety-four percent identical YopP protein is expressed by <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>. <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> infection also triggers YopP-dependent killing of dendritic cells, which are critical antigen presenting cells of the immune system. We demonstrate that in contrast to macrophages, dendritic cells are resistant to <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>-mediated cytotoxicity. However, <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> expressing YopP in place of YopJ was highly cytotoxic toward dendritic cells. This difference in cytotoxicity was attributable to a difference in the delivery of YopJ and YopP into mammalian cells. Furthermore, mutation of two amino acids at the N-terminus of YopJ enhanced its delivery and cytotoxicity. Remarkably, we found that enhancing the cytotoxicity of <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> by expression of YopP led to its attenuation in a mouse model of <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection. This indicates that optimal virulence for a given pathogen requires careful regulation of virulence properties and highlights the potential evolutionary tradeoffs between cellular cytotoxicity and in vivo virulence.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is generally thought that the ability of bacterial pathogens to cause host cell death in vitro is important for virulence in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Monack1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However the role of host cell killing in bacterial virulence during in vivo infections remains poorly understood. Whether a particular optimal level of cell death might exist during bacterial infection, and how such a level might be achieved is a question that has not yet been addressed. Standard genetic approaches to investigate the basis of microbial pathogenesis typically screen or select for loss of function mutants in which a particular virulence property is completely abrogated. However, modulating the level of activity of individual virulence factors by bacterial pathogens has been shown to be important for maximizing overall virulence. This may be because of two opposing selective pressures that act on any given virulence property: positive selection for enhanced bacterial replication is countered by a selection for reduced host detection. Thus, because host organisms possess mechanisms to sense infection and are likely to respond to disruption of signaling pathways, bacterial pathogens must evolve additional mechanisms for modulating an initial baseline activity of particular virulence factor. For example, during the process of cell invasion, the activity of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> GEF protein SopE is counteracted by the phosphatase SptP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Fu1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, and this activity of SptP is important for limiting TNF-&#x003b1; production by <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Lin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, replacement of the <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> pore-forming toxin LLO with the related but much more active toxin PFO leads to attenuated bacterial replication in vitro and in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Glomski1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. We wished to examine whether bacterial proteins that trigger cell death might also possess an optimal level of activity for a given bacterial pathogen. We therefore devised a system in which the cytotoxicity of the facultative extracellular pathogen <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> could be altered in a tunable fashion. This approach enabled us to uncover a requirement for limiting the extent of cell death during the course of animal infection that has not previously been appreciated in studies of <italic>Yersinia</italic> virulence.</p><p>The Gram negative genus <italic>Yersinia</italic> contains three pathogenic species whose close evolutionary relationship provides an ideal system with which to investigate the evolution of bacterial virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Wren1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Y. pestis</italic> (the etiologic agent of plague) and <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> are the most closely related, with <italic>Y. pestis</italic> believed to have recently evolved from <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Wren1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> comprises a more distantly related, heterogeneous group of biotypes that are both highly pathogenic and non-pathogenic in animal infection models. A common feature of <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection is a tropism for lymphoid tissues.

We therefore examined cleavage of the Caspase-3 substrate poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) as a means of comparing the extent of cell death in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). PARP was cleaved in macrophages infected either with <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> or <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> at low and high MOI, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

We confirmed that caspase-3 was indeed differentially activated in DCs infected by these various strains of <italic>Yersinia</italic> using a cell-permeable fluorescent caspase-3 substrate.

Two of these polymorphisms are synonomous changes, while two are non-synonomous, resulting in an IS to SP change at amino acids 10 and 11. We therefore generated mutations in the <italic>yopJ</italic> coding sequence of plasmids pYopJ and pYopPJ, creating substitutions in all 4 polymorphic nucleotides. These plasmids were designated pYopJn or pYopPJn, and demonstrate that whereas wild-type YopJ is poorly secreted, mutation of 4 nucleotides at the 5&#x02032; end of <italic>yopJ</italic> is sufficient to markedly enhance secretion of YopJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, compare YopPJ to YopPJn).

In order to measure the amount of protein actually translocated into infected cells, we constructed reporter plasmids encoding a GSK tag in the pYopJ, pYopP, pYopJn and pYopPJn plasmids. This tag is phosphorylated by host cell Ser/Thr kinases only upon translocation of the fusion protein into the cytosol, and is therefore a useful tool to measure the extent of protein translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Garcia1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, levels of translocated YopJn were notably higher than levels of translocated YopJ. The amount of total GSK fusion protein was similar for all of the constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, right panel), indicating that differences in steady-state level of total protein were not responsible for differences in translocation.</p><p>We next examined the extent of cell death caused by infection with <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> strains harboring these plasmids. As expected and consistent with the known role of of YopJ/P in macrophage death, an increase in macrophage cell death occurred upon infection with any of the strains containing pYopJ, pYopP or chimeric and mutant, but not vector control, plasmids, demonstrating their functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, death of DCs occurred only when they were infected by strains containing plasmids mediating high levels of YopJ/P protein secretion, specifically pYopP, pYopJP, and pYopPJn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). These plasmids also mediate high levels of Yop/P protein translocation, suggesting that increased levels of translocated YopJ/P are directly responsible for increased death of DCs. Interestingly, although YopJn-GSK was also translocated at higher levels than YopJ-GSK, this was not enough to markedly enhance the level of cell death in DCs infected with YopJn-expressing bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that a fairly high threshold of YopJ activity is necessary to induce death of DCs, and that this threshold is significantly higher than for macrophages.

It is interesting to note that while <italic>Y. pestis</italic> YopJ contributes to host cell death and blocks cytokine secretion in vitro, as it does for enteric <italic>Yersiniae</italic>, it appears to be nonessential for virulence in a rat model of bubonic plague <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Lemaitre1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study suggests that expression of YopP or a hypersecreted form of YopJ in <italic>Y. pestis</italic> may also attenuate virulence during in vivo infection. Our data also indicate that despite inducing higher levels of cell death in infected tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g005">Figure 5</xref>), <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> expressing YopP were attenuated for colonizing and possibly replicating within the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g006">Figure 6</xref>). An intermediate level of YopJ protein delivery therefore appears necessary for maximal virulence, as bacteria completely lacking YopJ are also deficient in colonization of the spleen following oral infection, consistent with earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Monack3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent work indicates that YopJ is not required for replication of <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> in the spleen if the bacteria are delivered intraperitoneally, bypassing the intestinal route <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Auerbuch1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results therefore indicate a requirement for intermediate levels of YopJ delivery in mediating spread of bacteria to the spleen from initial sites of colonization within the intestine.</p><p>The underlying basis for why increasing cytotoxicity of <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> infection leads to attenuation are not clear at this time, but could involve an intracellular stage during in vivo infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Pujol1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Pujol2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Excessive cytotoxicity may lead to death of cells that provide an important intracellular niche for <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, potentially for purposes of spreading from the initial site of colonization to other tissues. Recent evidence indicates that spread of <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> to the spleen following oral infection occurs directly from a replicating pool within the intestinal lumen, through a pathway that bypasses the mesenteric lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Barnes1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, despite the differential susceptibility of bone-marrow derived macrophages and dendritic cells to YopJ-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g003">3</xref>), it appears that at least within mesenteric lymph nodes, both CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (primarily macrophage) and CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (primarily dendritic) cell populations showed either high or intermediate levels of cell death when infected by YopP- or YopJ- expressing <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g005">Figure 5</xref>). A particular phagocytic cell subset within the Peyer's patches or intestinal lamina propria may be responsible for transporting <italic>Yersinia</italic> from the intestine to systemic sites, and these cells may be differentially susceptible to YopJ-mediated cell death. Recent work has highlighted the role of a particular subset of dendritic cells within the lamina propria, designated CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, in uptake of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Niess1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Hapfelmeier1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Investigation of the particular cell types that interact with <italic>Yersinia</italic> during intestinal colonization and the utilization of mouse models enabling dendritic cell depletion are likely to provide further insight into the mechanism of <italic>Yersinia</italic> spread to internal tissues.</p><p>That higher in vitro cytotoxicity of <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> can lead to markedly reduced virulence is somewhat surprising, particularly since we observed reduced cytokine production as well as increased cell death in mice infected with the more cytotoxic, YopP-expressing bacteria. An alternative hypothesis for the requirement for intermediate levels of cytotoxicity during <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> infection is that proinflammatory cytokines produced during wild-type <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> infection could contribute to bacterial spread by promoting tissue destruction. This could be blocked during infection with YopP-expressing <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> due to death of cytokine-producing cells. In support of this model, recent work has shown that mice infected with the attenuated &#x00394;<italic>pla</italic> strain of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> control the infection without producing high levels of cytokines in contrast to wild-type infected mice, which fail to control the infection despite high levels of cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Lathem1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations may reflect the possibility that appropriate control of bacterial replication must occur very early during the infection process. The outcome of a bacterial infection depends on the interplay between host clearance mechanisms and bacterial virulence factors; misregulation of bacterial virulence factors as we observed with expression of YopP in place of YopJ therefore appears to shift the balance strongly in favor of the host.</p><p>In addition to implications for the evolution of bacterial virulence, this work sheds further light on mechanisms of Type III secretion in <italic>Yersinia</italic>. It has been suggested that mRNA sequence determines the secretion of TTSS effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Anderson1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative proposal is that the amphipathic character of the N-terminal amino acids controls the extent of secretion of TTSS effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Lloyd2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>; this latter study further demonstrated that seemingly minor changes in the amino acid sequence of a synthetic secretion signal could result in dramatically different levels of secretion of a reporter fusion construct. In agreement with this study, we demonstrate that in the case of YopJ/P, the amino acid sequence plays a key role in controlling secretion. It may be that alteration of IS to SP at positions 10 and 11 generates a more optimal amphipathic sequence leading to enhanced secretion and translocation of YopP relative to YopJ. There may nonetheless be a contribution from the mRNA sequence that is not revealed directly by these studies. Indeed, the replacement of <italic>yopJ</italic> noncoding sequences with those of <italic>yopP</italic> to generate YopPJn from YopJn led to markedly higher translocation of the corresponding GSK fusion protein and secretion of the full length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000067.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We further observed that YopE was also secreted at higher levels by <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> than <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, the <italic>yopE</italic> coding sequences are identical between the two bacterial species. This suggests that the rules governing the secretion of proteins that possess dedicated chaperones (such as YopE) may differ from those that do not (such as YopJ/P). Individual type III effector proteins may therefore differ in the degree to which their secretion is governed by mRNA or primary amino acid sequences.</p><p>It is notable that while bacteria secreting either YopJ or YopP show cytotoxicity toward macrophages, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Monack2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Mills1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, only bacteria secreting YopP or hypersecreted mutants of YopJ were cytotoxic toward DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000067-g003">3</xref>). This potent cytotoxicity exhibited by <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> toward DCs may be a confounding factor in the interpretation of some of the data describing the inhibition of particular aspects of DC biology such as maturation and phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Erfurth1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Autenrieth1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

A recent study indicates, however, that YopJ of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> can inhibit differentiation of monocytes into DCs and also interferes with the ability of DCs to stimulate T cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Lindner1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of these studies were performed with a monocytic cell line which can be differentiated in vitro into DC-like cells or with human monocytes isolated from peripheral blood samples. Dendritic cells <italic>in vivo</italic> are not a uniform cell population, but rather comprise a diverse array of closely related cells that differ in their activation and antigen-presentation properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Niess2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Sato1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.

Experimental differences observed with different systems may reflect potential differences between DC subsets in vivo. Different subsets of DCs may therefore exhibit different maturation or survival properties when targeted by <italic>Yersinia</italic> during in vivo infection.</p><p>Macrophage resistance to cell death in response to inflammatory stimuli such as LPS or bacterial infection is mediated by both NF-&#x003ba;B and p38 MAPK-dependent transcription of a variety of anti-apoptotic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Hsu1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Park1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.

We did not observe differences in the ability of <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> to inhibit I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; degradation in either macrophages or DCs (data not shown). These findings indicate that DCs and macrophages are differentially susceptible to host cell death induced by <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection, and this may depend on differential inhibition of MAPK pathways or differential regulation of MAPK-dependent genes in macrophages and dendritic cells during <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection. Data corroborating these observations have also recently been reported by Adkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000067-Adkins1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our work uncovers a previously unappreciated feature of YopJ-dependent cell death in the context of <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection.
