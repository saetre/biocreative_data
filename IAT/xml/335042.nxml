The maximum distance between the purine ring and the azido group estimated for the two probes is 16-17 and 23-24A, respectively. Binding and cross-linking of the uncharged, modified tRNAs to E. coli ribosomes have been studied with and without poly(A,U,G) as a message, under conditions directing uncharged tRNAs preferentially to the P-site. The modified tRNAs retain their binding activity and upon irradiation bind covalently to the ribosome with very high yields. Protein S7 is the major cross-linking target for both modified tRNAs, in the presence or absence of poly(A,U,G). Protein L1 and to a lesser extent proteins L33 and L27 have been found to be cross-linked with the short probe. Cross-linking to 168 rRNA reaches significant levels only in the absence of the message.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0359.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8767"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0360.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8768"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0361.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8769"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0362.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8770"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0363.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8771"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0364.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8772"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0365.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8773"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0366.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8774"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0367.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8775"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0368.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8776"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0369.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8777"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0370.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8778"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0371.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8779"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0372.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8780"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0373.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8781"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0374.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8782"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
