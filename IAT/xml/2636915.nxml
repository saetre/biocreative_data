Emerging links between inflammation and metabolic disease progression suggest that PPAR and LXR signaling may alter macrophage function and thereby impact systemic metabolism. In this study, the function of macrophage PPAR and LXR in Th1-biased C57BL/6 mice was tested using a bone marrow transplantation approach with PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, PPAR&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, PPAR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and LXR&#x003b1;&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Despite their inhibitory effects on inflammatory gene expression, loss of PPARs or LXRs in macrophages did not exert major effects on obesity or glucose tolerance induced by a high-fat diet. Treatment with rosiglitazone effectively improved glucose tolerance in mice lacking macrophage PPAR&#x003b3;, suggesting that cell types other than macrophages are the primary mediators of the anti-diabetic effects of PPAR&#x003b3; agonists in our model system. C57BL/6 macrophages lacking PPARs or LXRs exhibited normal expression of most alternative activation gene markers, indicating that macrophage alternative activation is not absolutely dependent on these receptors in the C57BL/6 background under the conditions used here. These studies suggest that genetic background may be an important modifier of nuclear receptor effects in macrophages. Our results do not exclude a contribution of macrophage PPAR and LXR expression to systemic metabolism in certain contexts, but these factors do not appear to be dominant contributors to glucose tolerance in a high-fat-fed Th1-biased bone marrow transplant model.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PPAR</kwd><kwd>LXR</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>immune phenotype</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Published, JLR Papers in Press, September 4, 2008.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Macrophages play an important role in innate and acquired immune responses. They can be directed to acquire distinct phenotypes through classical (M1) or alternative (M2) pathways of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Depending on the trigger for macrophage activation, different outcomes in the adaptive immune response, inflammation, and gene expression result. For instance, macrophages activated classically by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (M1 phenotype) promote a Th1 T cell response, characterized by the release of inflammatory cytokines and the activation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The Th1 response is primarily geared toward the phagocytosis and killing of pathogens. Macrophages activated by alternative stimuli such as IL-4 (M2 phenotype) are less inflammatory and foster a Th2 response by directing the proliferation and differentiation of B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The biological impact of these distinct pathways of macrophage activation has been studied in mouse models that favor either Th1 or Th2 immune responses. The widely used C57BL/6 mouse strain preferentially mounts Th1-biased immune responses, including classical macrophage activation, leading to robust inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). By contrast, the more Th2-permissive BALB/C strain is more susceptible to alternative macrophage activation and does not exhibit such a dominant inflammatory reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>).</p><p>Recent work suggests that macrophage-dependent inflammatory pathways are linked to the development and possibly treatment of insulin resistance. In particular, adipose tissue inflammation has attracted widespread interest as a potential causal factor in insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Type 2 diabetes is associated with low-grade or chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), and adipose tissue is now recognized to be a major producer of bioactive signaling molecules, known as adipokines, some of which may contribute to chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). In addition, macrophages have been shown to accumulate in adipose tissue of obese mice and humans, where they are postulated to contribute to inflammatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In fact, studies have consistently revealed elevated expression of inflammatory genes such as TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6, and iNOS in adipose tissue of obese mice, and tissue macrophages appear to be a prime source of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence support a causal role for macrophage inflammatory signaling in insulin resistance. For example, inhibition of TNF&#x003b1; signaling in obese mice improves insulin sensitivity, whereas exogenously administering TNF&#x003b1; worsens insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Furthermore, blocking macrophage inflammatory gene expression through genetic deletion of IKK&#x003b2;, an essential kinase in the NF-&#x003ba;B activation pathway, improves insulin sensitivity in obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Inhibiting macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue by deletion of MCP-1 expression in fat also improves insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>The observation that inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue is suppressed by systemic treatment with PPAR&#x003b3; agonists such as rosiglitazone has led several groups to investigate the impact of anti-inflammatory nuclear receptor signaling on diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Members of both the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and liver X receptor (LXR) subfamilies have emerged as important negative regulators of macrophage-mediated inflammation. PPAR&#x003b3;, PPAR&#x003b4;, LXR&#x003b1;, and LXR&#x003b2; are each expressed at high levels in murine macrophages, and numerous studies have addressed the potential for these receptors to alter macrophage inflammatory gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Recent studies in Th2-biased BALB/C mice have suggested that PPAR&#x003b3; is important for M2 macrophage activation and that genetic deletion of PPAR&#x003b3; in myeloid cells alters the balance between M1 and M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Moreover, BALB/C mice lacking PPAR&#x003b3; expression in macrophages are more susceptible to the development of diet-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Hevener et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) have also examined the consequence of loss of bone marrow (BM) PPAR&#x003b3; expression on a mixed genetic background. Similar to the previous study, loss of PPAR&#x003b3; was associated with increased expression of inflammatory genes as well as defective insulin signaling in target tissues such as adipose tissue, liver, and muscle. The contribution of macrophage PPAR&#x003b4; or LXR expression to systemic glucose metabolism has not been addressed previously.</p><p>C57BL/6 is the genetic background most widely studied in the context of metabolism&#x0003b; however, the importance of anti-inflammatory nuclear receptor function for obesity-linked insulin resistance in this strain remains unclear. Here we assess the impact of loss of BM expression of four different nuclear receptors on systemic glucose metabolism in C57BL/6 mice. BM genetically deleted for PPAR&#x003b3;, PPAR&#x003b4;, both PPAR&#x003b3; and PPAR&#x003b4;, or both LXR&#x003b1; and LXR&#x003b2; was isolated from C57BL/6 donors and transplanted into wild-type C57BL/6 recipients. Mice were fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity and insulin resistance. None of these nuclear receptors significantly altered obesity or glucose tolerance of transplanted mice in our study. In addition, treatment with rosiglitazone improved glucose tolerance in mice receiving PPAR&#x003b3;-null BM. Although our results do not exclude a contribution of macrophage PPAR and LXR expression to systemic metabolism in certain contexts, these factors do not appear to be dominant contributors to glucose tolerance in a high-fat-fed Th1-biased bone marrow transplant (BMT) model. Our data suggest that genetic background and diet may influence the metabolic consequences of nuclear receptor signaling in macrophages.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents and cell culture</title><p>The synthetic ligands for LXR (GW3965 and T1317), PPAR&#x003b1; (GW9544), PPAR&#x003b4; (GW742), and PPAR&#x003b3; (GW7845) were provided by GlaxoSmithKline.

Specifically, we crossed C57BL/6 mice with loxP sites flanking the second exon of PPAR&#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;fl/fl) with C57BL/6 mice expressing Cre recombinase downstream of the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; interferon-inducible (Mx) promoter. Cre recombinase activity was initiated by intraperitoneal injection of the Mx activator poly IC 3 to 4 weeks after birth. Interestingly, injection of poly IC at weaning age caused a permanent disruption of PPAR&#x003b3; in myeloid precursor cells&#x0003b; new myeloid cells generated postinjection remain PPAR&#x003b3;-null for the life of the mouse. Typically, we analyzed macrophages from these mice at least 4 weeks after inducing recombination to reduce any potential effects of the poly IC. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that the Mx Cre system was extremely efficient, yielding nearly complete (&#x0003e;95%) deletion of PPAR&#x003b3; exon 2 in vivo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). As expected, induction of PPAR target genes (aP2, ADRP, PGAR) by PPAR&#x003b3; but not PPAR&#x003b4; agonists was lost in Mx Cre PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Induction of the Mx promoter effectively disrupts PPAR&#x003b3;, whereas LysM Cre cannot efficiently delete PPAR&#x003b3; exon 2.

A: Thioglycollate-elicited wild-type and Mx Cre PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> peritoneal macrophages were treated with PPAR&#x003b3; or PPAR&#x003b4; ligands (GW7845 or GD742, respectively&#x0003b; 100 nM each) overnight.

Known PPAR&#x003b3; target genes (aP2, ADRP, and PGAR) were tested to confirm loss of ligand response in PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages.

PPAR&#x003b3; exon 2 could still be detected in PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, and PGAR, a known PPAR&#x003b3; target gene, could still be induced by PPAR&#x003b3; ligand in these cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02).

Unlike Mx Cre, LysM Cre is constitutively active. However, compared with the Mx Cre system, the LysM Cre system was not as efficient in recombining PPAR&#x003b3; to create a disrupted gene in our hands. After harvesting peritoneal macrophages from wild-type and LysM Cre PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we treated the cells with PPAR&#x003b3; ligand to test whether disruption of PPAR&#x003b3; was able to prevent PPAR&#x003b3; target gene regulation. We found that PPAR&#x003b3; exon 2 could still be detected by quantitative real-time PCR and that PGAR, a PPAR&#x003b3; target gene, could be regulated by ligand even in PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In contrast, the Mx Cre system yields cell populations with complete deletion of PPAR&#x003b3; exon 2 expression, and more importantly, these cells are unable to respond to PPAR&#x003b3; ligand and do not regulate target genes. Consequently, we opted to use the Mx Cre system for our studies.</p><p>Recent work suggests that PPARs mediate inflammatory signaling pathways in macrophages and may affect inflammation associated with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). To address this issue in our genetic loss-of-function system, thioglycollate-elicited PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, PPAR&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, or PPAR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> peritoneal macrophages were isolated and pretreated with either PPAR ligand or LXR ligand overnight.

B: Macrophages were analyzed for inflammatory gene expression. iNOS was markedly upregulated in macrophages with deleted PPARs&#x0003b; in wild-type cells, treatment with LXR ligands consistently suppressed inflammatory genes, whereas treatment only with PPAR&#x003b3; and not PPAR&#x003b4; ligand resulted in repression. C: Additional inflammatory genes were tested in response to LPS and PPAR ligand treatments. Similar to iNOS, both IL-6 and MCP-1 expression was repressed by PPAR&#x003b3; ligand. However, IL-1&#x003b2; has a different expression profile compared with the other genes and highlights inconsistencies in PPAR signaling in inflammation.

Moreover, the combined deletion of both receptors had an additive effect, i.e., inflammatory gene expression was most responsive in the double knockouts. Interestingly, the combined loss of PPAR&#x003b3; and PPAR&#x003b4; affected the expression of some inflammatory markers more than others. For example, in contrast to IL-6, MCP-1, and iNOS, expression of IL-1&#x003b2; was not altered in the wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the impact of BM PPAR expression on systemic glucose metabolism in C57BL/6 mice, we used wild-type, PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, PPAR&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, or PPAR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BM (from mice more than 10 generations backcrossed to C57/BL6) to reconstitute irradiated wild-type mice.

Furthermore, administration of thiazoladinediones reverses macrophage infiltration, presumably by activating PPAR&#x003b3;. We therefore investigated whether the lack of macrophage PPAR&#x003b3; would affect macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. To our surprise, we found that there was no change in the numbers of macrophages present in adipose tissue when we compared wild-type and PPAR&#x003b3; BMT mice (data not shown). Additionally, the size of adipocytes was similar in wild-type and PPAR&#x003b3; BMT mice and we did not observe any obvious differences in body composition (data not shown).</p><p>Previous work has established that both LXR&#x003b1; and LXR&#x003b2; are expressed at high levels in macrophages, and both isotypes have strong anti-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, the anti-inflammatory effects of LXRs are especially prominent in vitro. We hypothesized that loss of LXR receptor expression in BM cells might exacerbate inflammatory signaling in vivo and impact glucose metabolism. We therefore transplanted BM cells from wild-type and LXR&#x003b1;&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice into irradiated wild-type recipients. As with the mice used for PPAR studies, the animals used for these experiments were also more than 10 generations backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice. After 4 weeks of recovery, the BMT mice were challenged with a 60% fat diet to induce obesity and insulin resistance. All groups consumed similar amounts of food and gained weight at similar rates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). We confirmed that the reconstituted animals had been repopulated with LXR&#x003b1;&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BM by harvesting thioglycollate-elicted peritoneal macrophages and performing real-time PCR to examine the expression of LXRs and their downstream target genes.

We also verified that LXRs had maintained their anti-inflammatory abilities after reconstitution by stimulating macrophages with LPS in the presence or absence of LXR ligand.

Studies have demonstrated that PPAR&#x003b3;-deficient macrophages express low levels of M2 marker genes and are not effectively alternatively activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). As a result, these cells may be more inflammatory and may act as contributors to worsened insulin sensitivity.

This was true not only for PPAR&#x003b3;, which has been reported to play a role in insulin resistance in BALB/C mice, but also for PPAR&#x003b4;, LXR&#x003b1;, and LXR&#x003b2;, which have not been previously studied in this context. Using a BMT approach, we found that loss of PPAR&#x003b3;, PPAR&#x003b4;, both PPAR&#x003b3; and PPAR&#x003b4;, or both LXR&#x003b1; and LXR&#x003b2; did not alter weight gain in mice challenged with a 60% fat diet or have a significant effect on glucose tolerance. We also found that administration of rosiglitazone to PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMT mice improved glucose tolerance, suggesting that BM expression of this receptor is not absolutely required for the therapeutic effects of thiazolidinediones in C57BL/6 mice.</p><p>Previous work has reported that macrophage PPAR&#x003b3; expression affects the development of obesity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). It is important to point out that our studies were conducted in parallel to those of Glass and Chawla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and were not designed to replicate the experimental conditions used in either of these reports. Therefore, our results are not necessarily in conflict with those of prior work, and there are a number of factors that may have contributed to the differences in experimental outcomes.</p><p>One possible contributor is the influence of genetic background. The macrophages in prior work were derived from either BALB/C or mixed-background mice. Genetic background in mice contributes to the dominance of M1 or M2 activation of macrophages and can bias how mouse models respond to specific stimuli. For example, the BALB/C mouse strain is Th2-permissive and is more susceptible to diseases that require an aggressive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Conversely, C57BL/6 mice are dominant for Th1 signaling and display more-robust inflammatory signaling and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes. The C57BL/6 strain is most widely used for the study of metabolic disorders because of its susceptibility to diet-induced insulin resistance and atherosclerosis.</p><p>Another plausible explanation for the difference between our results and those of the Chawla and Glass groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) is environment and the immune status of the mice. All animal facilities are different, and mice at different sites may therefore be exposed to a range of different pathogens and commensal bacteria. It is conceivable that such differences alter the immune systems of experimental mice in ways that may affect macrophage responses.</p><p>Another notable difference between our study and prior work is the diet employed. Hevener et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) reported more-significant differences in blood glucose levels between wild-type and PPAR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMT mice fed a chow diet rather than a high-fat diet. Odegaard et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) employed a 36% fat diet. We chose to use a 60% fat diet because our aim was to study PPAR/LXR function in obese models. However, it is possible that our high-fat diet may have been too robust a diabetic stimulus and therefore masked differences otherwise seen on a chow diet.</p><p>Finally, the BMT approach employed in our study may have contributed to differences in results. Prior studies employed a LysM Cre approach to delete PPAR&#x003b3; expression from macrophages. We chose to use Mx Cre-mediated deletion coupled with BMT because of incomplete deletion by LysM Cre in our hands (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). However, it is possible that the BMT procedure itself has a confounding effect on systemic metabolism. Furthermore, although we confirmed reconstitution of recipient mice with the appropriate donor BM cells, there is a possibility that the tissue macrophage reconstitution was not complete at the time we performed our studies. Prior work has shown that adipose tissue macrophages and hepatic Kupffer cells are effectively replaced by BM cells in the time frame employed in our study (more than 4 months). However, the possibility that some wild-type macrophages may have remained and affected our results cannot be excluded.</p><p>While this paper was under review, two additional studies reported an impact of loss of PPAR&#x003b4; expression on glucose tolerance and alternative macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Some of the findings reported in these studies also differ from the results we report here. As outlined above for PPAR&#x003b3;, it is likely that a number of factors may contribute to the prominence of PPAR&#x003b4; signaling in different experimental contexts. Additional studies will be required to more precisely define the role of both PPAR&#x003b3; and PPAR&#x003b4; in macrophage inflammatory signaling in the context of metabolic disease.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies suggest that the in vitro anti-inflammatory activities of nuclear receptors alone are not predictive of in vivo metabolic effects. Macrophage LXRs show profound anti-inflammatory effects in vitro but do not dramatically influence systemic glucose metabolism under the conditions used here. Furthermore, our results suggest that careful consideration of the immunological differences between mouse strains is warranted in the context of metabolic disease studies. Inherent biases in mouse strains can steer immune responses and affect the outcomes of various disease models in different ways. Finally, our data indicate that the influence of BM nuclear expression on systemic metabolism may differ between experimental context and genetic background and that these factors may not be obligatory components of disease pathogenesis or thiazolidinedione therapeutic action in all contexts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Jon Collins and Tim Willson of GlaxoSmithKline for the synthetic ligands for LXR (GW3965 and T1317), PPAR&#x003b1; (GW9544), PPAR&#x003b4; (GW742), and PPAR&#x003b3; (GW7845).
