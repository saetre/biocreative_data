Using a bovine interspecies model with a single nucleotide polymorphism, we assessed the imprinting status of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) gene in bovine embryos produced by artificial insemination (AI), <italic>in vitro </italic>culture (IVF) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and correlated allelic expression with the DNA methylation patterns of a differentially methylated region (DMR) located on the SNRPN promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the AI group, SNRPN maternal expression is silenced at day 17 and 40 of development and a third of the alleles analyzed are methylated in the DMR. In the IVF group, maternal transcripts were identified at day 17 but methylation levels were similar to the AI group. However, day-40 fetuses in the IVF group showed significantly less methylation when compared to the AI group and SNRPN expression was mostly paternal in all fetal tissues studied, except in placenta. Finally, the SCNT group presented severe loss of DMR methylation in both day-17 embryos and 40 fetuses and biallelic expression was observed in all stages and tissues analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Together these results suggest that artificial reproductive techniques, such as prolonged <italic>in vitro </italic>culture and SCNT, lead to abnormal reprogramming of imprinting of SNRPN gene by altering methylation levels at this locus.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The procedure of SCNT in mammals results in pregnancy rates much lower than those obtained <italic>in vivo </italic>after insemination and from transfer of embryos derived <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, cloned fetuses that survive to term often have disorders such as oversized organs, increased or decreased overall growth, respiratory failure and limb malformations. In cattle and other ruminants, these abnormal phenotypes are known as the large offspring syndrome, or LOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Detailed examination of the extra embryonic membranes of SCNT pregnancies often highlights numerous placental abnormalities, including a reduction in the number of cotyledons, and a decrease in chorio-allantoic blood vessels. These observations are also consistent with other reports where placentomes were absent in the placenta in pregnancies that were lost between days 30 and 60 of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that improper development of the placenta may play a major role in the fetal abnormalities and low pregnancy rates in cattle SCNT. It has been suggested that the pathological phenotypes in the placental and fetal development of clones are associated with abnormal reprogramming by the host ooplasm of the donor cell used for nuclear transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These abnormalities often disturb the epigenetic regulation mechanisms inherited from the differentiated donor cell, by altering the dynamic nature of DNA methylation and chromatin modification patterns during embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>One of the most studied epigenetic modifications is DNA methylation of cytosine residues within CpG dinucleotides; these are often associated with transcriptional repression and implicated in maintaining genomic stability, as well as silencing repetitive elements. DNA methylation is also implicated in the regulation of genomic imprinting, genes that are exclusively expressed from only one parental allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. To date, only a few imprinted genes have been characterized in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and most play essential roles in fetal development and placental function. The bicistronic gene SNURF-SNRPN, referred here as SNRPN, has been extensively studied in mice and humans due to the correlation between disorders within the SNRPN differentially methylated region (DMR) and the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders known as Prader-Willi Angelman syndrome. Interestingly, decreased levels of the maternal allele methylation in the SNRPN DMR has been observed in children conceived by assisted reproductive technologies (ART), suggesting that the SNRPN methylation pattern is affected by <italic>in vitro </italic>culture systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As demonstrated previously in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the SNRPN gene is also maternally imprinted in pre-implantation bovine embryos, with a characterized DMR. However, little is known about the effect of altered DNA methylation patterns on allelic expression of the SNRPN gene. A bovine interspecies model [<italic>Bos indicus </italic>(paternal genome) &#x000d7; <italic>Bos taurus </italic>(maternal genome)] that is widely used in warm climate animal breeding practices was applied to assess genomic imprinting through parental-specific polymorphisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our objective here was to characterize the imprinted status of SNRPN before (day 17) and after (day 40) implantation, to determine whether the pattern of gene expression is associated with DNA methylation levels, and finally to examine short and mid term effects of <italic>in vitro </italic>culture on imprinting status of SNRPN gene in embryos produced by IVF and SCNT.</p><p>In this study, we show that SNRPN is maternally imprinted in pre- and post-implantation <italic>in vivo </italic>development. Moreover, <italic>in vitro </italic>culture and somatic cell cloning lead to decreased methylation of the DMR and consequently biallelic expression of the SNRPN gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Development during early gestation</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows the results of blastocyst development, day-17 and day-40 recoveries for all experimental groups. To obtain samples that were not exposed to <italic>in vitro </italic>culture conditions (control groups), we artificially inseminated (AI) a superovulated heifer to harvest 3 intact elongated-stage embryos at 17 d after insemination (only whole embryos were used); 4 other heifers were inseminated to recover day-40 <italic>in vivo </italic>fetuses (3) and their respective placentas. The <italic>in vitro </italic>development of IVF and SCNT embryos was assessed at day 8 of <italic>in vitro </italic>culture and showed that development rate to the blastocyst stage was similar for both groups. These results indicate that the prolonged handling of the oocytes during SCNT was not detrimental to the early stages of development <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that the SCNT protocol used did not disturb early development. To examine the development <italic>in vivo </italic>of <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived SCNT and IVF blastocysts, during the first week after transfer, groups of 10 blastocysts were transferred non-surgically to synchronous recipients and recovered at day 17 after estrus. Similar percentages of day-17 embryos were collected from the SCNT and IVF groups (P &#x0003e; 0.05), indicating that pre-implantation development was not affected by cloning. Nonetheless, SCNT embryos were smaller, e.g. less elongated, than their IVF counterparts, indicating that the proliferation of the trophoblasts was somewhat retarded in this group. To obtain day-40 fetuses in the IVF and SCNT groups, 1&#x02013;2 embryos were transferred per recipient and viability was checked the day before slaughter. As expected survival rates at day 40 were slightly higher in the IVF group than in the SCNT group, indicating that cloned embryos are less able to sustain development beyond implantation.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Survival rates of bovine oocytes subjected to AI, IVF and SCNT at pre- and postimplantation stages of development.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center" colspan="2">Embryos recovered from uterus</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Group</td><td align="center">Blastocyst development to day 7.5</td><td align="center">day 17*</td><td align="center">day 40*</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">AI</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">3 (75%)**</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IVF</td><td align="center">27 (34%)</td><td align="center">5 (50%)</td><td align="center">3 (50%)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">SCNT</td><td align="center">26 (28%)</td><td align="center">6 (45%)</td><td align="center">3 (30%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* percentage of embryos were calculated from the total number of transferred embryos.</p><p>** percentage of pregnancy was calculated from the total number of AI.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Identification of a polymorphism for allele-specific transcript analysis</title><p>DNA and RNA were extracted, purified and used as a template for sequencing and searching for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) between the <italic>Bos taurus </italic>and <italic>Bos indicus </italic>subspecies.

Furthermore, we characterized alterations to the transcription patterns and DMR methylation of SNRPN cause by exposing early stage embryos to <italic>in vitro </italic>culture conditions and SCNT, demonstrating that ART can significantly disturb the epigenetic control of imprinted genes.</p><p>Imprinted gene profiles have been previously reported in ruminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and the interest in these genes arises from their implication in embryo and fetal development. In many clinical cases in humans or livestock animals, an association of abnormalities found in pregnancies resulting from ART and abnormal expression of imprinted genes is often found. A better knowledge of imprinted genes could provide clues to understand and improve <italic>in vitro </italic>culture conditions. Ultimately, in SCNT, imprinting analysis is essential to define the mechanisms underlying the ability of the oocyte to reprogram the epigenetic memory of somatic donor cells.</p><p>The maternally imprinted SNRPN gene has been extensively studied in mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] due to its association to Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes; it has now also been putatively linked to ART and infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although ART has been extensively used in the bovine species, little is known about SNRPN imprinting status. Although we confirm previous findings that the DMR methylation pattern in IVF embryos is not different from the AI group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], we have found bi-allelic SNRPN expression at day 17 in preimplantation IVF embryos subjected to <italic>in vitro </italic>culture up to day 8. Recently, bi-allelic expression of SNRPN and a number of other imprinted genes was found in day-8 bovine blastocysts, suggesting that mono-allelic expression may not be required for most imprinted genes during preimplantation development and occur in a gene- and time-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, results from our AI control showed no sign of bi-allelic expression, whereas the bi-allelic expression found in day-17 IVF embryos was also observed at post-implantation stages, suggesting that placenta tissues might be more susceptible to the effects of <italic>in vitro </italic>embryo culture. In our study, bi-allelic expression extended to post-implantation development in day-40 placenta, and since pre-implantantion embryos are mostly composed of extraembryonic tissue, this indicates that imprinting was already perturbed during earlier development. In the placenta, imprinting is probably regulated by mechanisms other than DNA methylation. In fact, studies in mice have revealed that imprinting establishment of <italic>Xist </italic>gene does not require the DNA maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Instead, the process of X chromosome inactivation is rather dependent on histone modifications associated with transcriptional repression by histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me) and 27 (H3K27me) as well as the Polycomb H3K27 methyltransferase complex, which is involved in the maintenance of transcriptional repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In support of these results we found the lowest association between methylation and allelic expression in placenta (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8f</xref>). However, DMR methylation levels were diminished also in most embryonic tissues and we do not exclude the possibility of further complications due to loss of methylation. A wide range of genes can be affected by <italic>in vitro </italic>embryo culture, as reported for preimplantation mouse embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Nonetheless, these results provide support for the hypothesis that placental tissue is more affected by <italic>in vitro </italic>culture than embryonic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and pregnancy abnormalities could relate to problems observed later during gestation, when the placenta becomes more important to fetal development.</p><p>SNRPN DMR in SCNT embryos and fetuses showed severe loss of methylation and maternal expression of around 30% in day-17 embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Bi-allelic expression also persisted in day-40 extra-embryonic and embryonic tissues, although maternal expression was less pronounced than in day-17 embryos. It is likely, therefore, that problems with pregnancies are initially due to defects at the early stages of placenta development, which are aggravated as the embryo develops further. In support of this hypothesis, some underdeveloped blastocysts (less elongated) were found at day 17 in SCNT but not in the IVF group. However, at day 40 no pathologies were found in SCNT embryonic tissues, e.g. their sizes were normal and pregnancy progressed until collection, but their placenta had no visible placentomes and limited signs of vascularization of the choriallantoic membrane. Similar observations have been previously reported in cross-species clones by Dindot <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These results found in pre-and post-implantation trophoblastic tissue raise the question whether abnormal expression observed in embryonic tissues is a consequence of donor cell reprogramming failures, or if placenta malfunction would eventually account for abnormal expression of imprinted genes observed in day-40 fetal tissues. Another possibility is that defects caused by SCNT, other than those related to genomic imprinting, affect cell fate choices in early development and that cells with more anomalies (competence, cell division, polyploidy) are preferentially incorporated into the trophectoderm rather than the inner cell mass, as seen in tetraploid complementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, loss of methylation in embryonic tissues seems to be associated with reprogramming failures of the donor cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Studies indicate that the methylation of imprinted genes is maintained throughout embryo development and determines either the repression or expression of these genes while the rest of the genome becomes demethylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Probably failures in donor cell reprogramming and detrimental effects of <italic>in vitro </italic>culture could together account for the severe abnormalities found in the placentas of SCNT.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare methylation directly with imprinting status in different tissues during pre- and post-implantation stages of development. More studies are needed to determine whether, in cattle, there are other DMRs acting on the same locus, or if another imprinting mechanisms, i.e. histone acetylation, play a role as important as DNA methylation in the control of SNRPN expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bi-allelic SNURF-SNRPN gene expression was found in IVF and SCNT preimplantation embryos subjected to <italic>in vitro </italic>culture, which persisted only in fetal tissues of cloned cattle.

Results are expressed in percentages of individual cloned sequences possessing the maternal (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) over the total number of clones analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square test. For methylation analysis, data was analyzed by computing frequency of methylated sites over the number of unmethylated CpGs islands. For gene expression, data was analyzed using Bioedit software aligning program and frequency of paternal computed over maternal allele SNP. For both cases the level of significance was set at P &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JS carried out the allelic expression studies, IVM, IVF and SCNT, participated in data statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript. JT and FF carried out DNA methylation analysis and participated on sample collection. AKG carried out the data statistical analysis and helped to draft the manuscript. RL carried out superovulation, synchronization of recipients, embryo transfer and sample collection.
