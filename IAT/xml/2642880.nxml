Among mammals, as well as yeast and higher plants, recombination preferentially occurs at highly delimited chromosomal sites 1&#x02013;2 kb long known as hotspots. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the roles various proteins play in carrying out the molecular events of the recombination process, relatively little is understood about the factors controlling the location and relative activity of mammalian recombination hotspots. To search for <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors controlling the positioning of recombination events, we compared the locations of crossovers arising in an 8-Mb segment of a 100-Mb region of mouse Chromosome 1 (Chr 1) when the longer region was heterozygous C57BL/6J (B6) &#x000d7; CAST/EiJ (CAST) and the remainder of the genome was either similarly heterozygous or entirely homozygous B6. The lack of CAST alleles in the remainder of the genome resulted in profound changes in hotspot activity in both females and males. Recombination activity was lost at several hotspots; new, previously undetected hotspots appeared; and still other hotspots remained unaffected, indicating the presence of distant <italic>trans</italic>-acting gene(s) whose CAST allele(s) activate or suppress the activity of specific hotspots. Testing the activity of three activated hotspots in sperm samples from individual male progeny of two genetic crosses, we identified a single <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulator of hotspot activity, designated <italic>Rcr1</italic>, that is located in a 5.30-Mb interval (11.74&#x02013;17.04 Mb) on Chr 17. Using an <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> cloning assay to characterize the molecular products of recombination at two of these hotspots, we found that <italic>Rcr1</italic> controls the appearance of both crossover and noncrossover gene conversion events, indicating that it likely controls the sites of the double-strand DNA breaks that initiate the recombination process.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Recombination is an essential aspect of meiosis, ensuring proper contact and exchange of genetic material between homologous parental chromosomes, as well as their subsequent segregation to produce haploid gametes.

These DSBs provide the sites at which chiasmata and crossovers form, events that are necessary for proper chromosome alignment and segregation in Meiosis I. When the repair of a DSB involves a homologous chromatid, the outcome can be recognized genetically as either a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between the homologous chromatids (a crossover &#x0005b;CO&#x0005d;), or alternatively as the unidirectional acquisition of genetic information by the initiating chromatid from its non-initiating partner (a noncrossover &#x0005b;NCO&#x0005d;, sometimes referred to as a gene conversion) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000036-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000036-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

In yeast, hotspots have been classified into three groups based on their presumed activation requirements. Activation of &#x0201c;&#x003b1;&#x0201d; hotspots requires transcription factors; the &#x0201c;&#x003b2;&#x0201d; hotspots require the presence of nuclease-sensitive chromatin (a necessary, but not sufficient, condition); and the &#x0201c;&#x003b3;&#x0201d; hotspots are dependent on the G&#x0002b;C content of DNA (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000036-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;). Many yeast hotspots can be assigned to more than one class due to multiple mechanisms involved in the initiation of recombination. There is no obvious consensus sequence defining hotspots in either <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</named-content> with the exception of the class of hotspots in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content>, which have an 18-bp consensus sequence containing the CRE-heptameric cyclic AMP response element ATGACGT &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000036-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000036-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. However, this sequence accounts for only a minority of hotspots in <italic>S. pombe</italic>; the defining elements of the remainder are unknown. A 13-bp consensus sequence has been identified that is present in 41&#x00025; of human hotspots &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000036-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;; although this sequence is highly enriched in hotspots, its presence alone is not sufficient to initiate hotspot activity, suggesting that other presently unknown factors are also required.

In doing so, we found hotspots whose activity was either dependent upon, or suppressed by, the presence of CAST alleles at distant loci, whereas other hotspots were unaffected. Assaying the activity of specific hotspots in the sperm of males segregating in genetic crosses, we found that the activity of several hotspots depended on a single Mendelian factor we have designated <italic>Recombination regulator 1</italic> (<italic>Rcr1</italic>) that maps to a 5.30-Mb region on proximal Chr 17.

In the second cross, hereafter referred to as the congenic cross, B6 were mated to B6.CAST-1T, a congenic strain carrying 100 Mb of CAST DNA sequences from distal Chr 1 introgressed into C57BL/6J (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details of this strain); the resulting F1 hybrids were then backcrossed to B6. In both crosses, the F1 hybrids shared the same heterozygous 100-Mb segment on Chr 1.

The B6xCAST recombination map utilized the products of 6,028 meioses occurring in F1 animals (3,002 offspring of female F1 and 3,026 offspring of male F1) and was part of the entire map of Chr 1 described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000036-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Among these offspring, 735 contained a single CO event in the 8-Mb region (264 arising in female F1s and 471 in male F1s), producing a total sex-averaged map length of 12.2 cM (8.8 cM in females and 15.6 cM in males), or 1.52 cM/Mb (1.1 cM/Mb and 1.95 cM/Mb in females and males, respectively). The B6xB6.CAST-1T map utilized 2,083 meioses (1,173 offspring of female F1 and 910 offspring of male F1), of which 175 meioses provided a single CO event in the 8-Mb region (83 from females and 92 from males). The sex-averaged map length of the region in this cross was 8.4 cM (7.1 cM in females and 10.1 cM in males), or 1.05 cM/Mb (0.89 cM/Mb and 1.26 cM/Mb in females and males, respectively). To test for any possible effect of genomic imprinting on recombination rates, half of the offspring of each cross were derived from F1 animals in which the dam was B6 and the sire was CAST or B6.CAST-1T, and the other half were derived from a reciprocal parental combination; there were no significant differences in hotspot locations between these reciprocal crosses.</p><p>The COs occurring in the 8-Mb region of Chr 1 were mapped to hotspot-level resolution using the same markers for both crosses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000036-g002">Figure 2</xref> presents the female and male recombination maps obtained.

Although the total recombination rate across this 8-Mb region is somewhat lower in the congenic cross compared to the interstrain cross, presumably due to the loss in the congenic cross of several hotspots that were highly active in the interstrain cross, this appears to be a localized effect as the overall recombination rate across the larger interval 169&#x02013;193 Mb was the same in both crosses (unpublished data).</p><p>Some of the hotspots in the 8-Mb tested region remained active in both crosses, leaving open the question of what controls their activity. Presumably, these hotspots are activated either by the B6 allele of <italic>Rcr1</italic>, which was always present, or by other <italic>trans</italic>-acting genes. Previous observations suggest that there are approximately 13,500&#x02013;14,000 hotspots across the mouse genome active in the same B6xCAST cross used in this study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000036-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, and the known variation in hotspot usage among different mouse crosses suggests a potentially even higher number for the species as a whole.

Given these high numbers, it is unlikely that each hotspot is controlled by its specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting gene, and it is more likely that, as in the present case, a <italic>trans</italic>-acting gene controls a family of hotspots.
