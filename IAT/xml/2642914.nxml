In this study, we investigated the expression of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in the retina during endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>EIU was induced in male Wistar rats by intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The severity of the EIU was evaluated by clinical and histopathological examination.

The inflammation peaked at 24 h and resolved by seven day. After an intravitreal LPS injection, the expression of Kir4.1 in the retina showed a significant decline at both the protein and mRNA levels. In the early stages of EIU, the expression of Kir4.1 mRNA decreased sharply, reaching a minimum at 12 h (31%, p&#x0003c;0.001). It then increased gradually and had partially recovered 14 days after LPS injection (92%, p&#x0003e;0.05). The expression of Kir4.1 protein decreased significantly, reaching a minimum at three days after the LPS injection (43%, p&#x0003c;0.001). Thereafter, it increased slightly but was maintained at a low level until 14 days after LPS injection (64%, p&#x0003c;0.001). In contrast, the expression of AQP4 mRNA remained almost unchanged after LPS treatment (p&#x0003e;0.05). The expression of AQP4 protein was only slightly reduced at one day (82%, p&#x0003e;0.05) after LPS injection and then increased gradually and had nearly recovered to the basal level at 14 days after LPS injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>EIU differently alters the expression of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in the retina. The differential expression of Kir4.1 and AQP4 during EIU implies a disturbance of water and potassium transport in the retina, which may contribute to the retinal edema during ocular inflammation.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinal edema is characterized by excessive fluid accumulation in the retina (macula) and is considered to be a serious complication of ocular inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. It is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in patients with uveitis, with an incidence varying between 24% and 52% depending on the etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Inflammatory retinal edema is considered to occur primarily after the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), which is associated with retinal vascular leakage, resulting in vasogenic edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. However, other reports have suggested that water accumulation within the retinal M&#x000fc;ller cells (cytotoxic edema) may also contribute to macular edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology of retinal edema in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) have only been partly clarified.</p><p>Recent studies of glial potassium channels and water channels have increased our understanding of the mechanisms of retinal edema under different pathological conditions. It has been shown that M&#x000fc;ller cells play an important role in K<sup>+</sup> spatial buffering in the retina which is known as "K<sup>+</sup> siphoning". In this model, the M&#x000fc;ller cells take up the excess extracellular K<sup>+</sup> ions released during neuronal activity and extrude them into the blood and the vitreous body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. The inwardly rectifying potassium channels, particular the subtype of Kir4.1, have been critically implicated in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. The Kir4.1 is enriched and highly restricted in the endfoot membranes of the M&#x000fc;ller cells facing the vitreous body and the retinal blood vessels. It shows rather weaker rectification than that of strong inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels such as Kir2.1, allowing either inward or outward K<sup>+</sup> currents in dependence on the membrane potential and on the concentration of extracellular K<sup>+</sup>. The polarized distribution and weak rectification enable Kir4.1 to extrude K<sup>+</sup> from the M&#x000fc;ller cell endfeet into blood and vitreous, which is very important for K<sup>+</sup> siphoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Recent reports show a decreased expression of Kir4.1 protein in M&#x000fc;ller cells during retinal ischemia reperfusion, uveoretinitis, and diabetic retinopathy. The M&#x000fc;ller cells in the retinas under these pathological conditions display a downregulation of inward K<sup>+</sup> currents and a hypotonic cell swelling, which may contribute to the development of cytotoxic macular edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is the most abundant water channel in the brain and retina. It has been suggested to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of brain edema under various injurious circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. In the retina, AQP4 shows a similar polarized distribution with Kir4.1 in the endfoot membranes of M&#x000fc;ller cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], which facilitates the water flux at the glio-vascular and glio-vitreal interfaces. The role of AQP4 in retinal edema still remains unclear. It has been shown the deletion of AQP4 in mice significantly reduces retinal edema and preserves the retinal function and architecture after retinal ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. However, there is only a slight downregulation of AQP4 expression in the postischemic rat retina, which does not support the idea that retinal edema after ischemia is due to changes in AQP4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p><p>EIU is an animal model of human ocular inflammation, and is induced by the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. To investigate the roles of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in the development of inflammatory retinal edema, we used the animal model of EIU produced by the intravitreal injection of LPS to analyze the changes in Kir4.1 and AQP4 expression in the retina.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal procedures</title><p>All experiments were performed on male Wistar rats (6-8 weeks). LPS from Escherichia coli 026:B6 (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Rats (n=78) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of mixture of ketamin (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). A single dose of 5 &#x003bc;l of diluted LPS solution was injected intravitreally into one eye of each rat using a Hamilton microinjector (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) under a dissecting microscope. PBS (5 &#x003bc;l) was administered to the other eye as sham-treated control. Thirteen rats were left untreated.

The intensity of clinical ocular inflammation was scored on a scale of 0-4 using the scoring system devised by Ruiz-Moreno et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] as follows: 0, no inflammatory reaction; 1, discrete inflammatory reaction; 2, moderate dilation of the iris and conjunctival vessels; 3, intense iridal hyperemia, with flare in the anterior chamber; 4, same clinical signs as 3 plus the presence of fibrinoid exudation in the papillary area, with intense flare in the anterior chamber.</p><p>For histopathological examination, the rats were anesthetized, and killed by transcardial perfusion with heparinized isotonic saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The eyes were removed and the anterior segments were dissected, postfixed for 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then rinsed in saline equilibrated through a sucrose gradient (10-30% in PBS), and embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek, Inc., Torrance, CA). Serial frozen sections (10 &#x003bc;m thick) were prepared. Some of the sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and the others were stained immunohistochemically. The sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin were observed with an Olympus BX51 light microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Infiltrating inflammatory cells, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils and mononuclear cells, were observed in the anterior chamber angle, iris-ciliary body stroma, and retina of the eyes of EIU rats. EIU was histopathologically scored using Cousins's classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] on the following scale: 0, between zero and nine inflammatory cells within the entire microscopic section, and the absence of other stigmata of inflammation; 1, more than nine inflammatory cells within the entire microscopic section but less than 25 inflammatory cells within any given high-power (40X) field, or at least five inflammatory cell in the entire cross-section accompanied by anterior chamber protein and iris hyperemia; 2, more than 25 but less than 60 inflammatory cells in a high-power field (40X) with the densest concentration of infiltrate; 3, 60 or more inflammatory cells in a single high-power field (40X).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For immunohistochemical studies, the sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature.

All were diluted in PBS with 5% goat serum plus 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C, the sections were washed and incubated with Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody or Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:500 for 2 h at room temperature. After the sections had been washed with PBS, they were mounted and observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope (TCS4D, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction</title><p>After the rats were killed, the total RNA was extracted from freshly dissected sensory retinas using the TRIzol&#x000ae; Total RNA Isolation System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Ocular changes, such as dilation of the iris and conjunctival vessels, iridal hyperemia, and cells and flare in the anterior chamber, were observed as early as 6 h after LPS injection. These signs peaked at 24 h, then subsided gradually during the following period, and had nearly disappeared by day 7. EIU clinical grades were 1.9 at 6 h, 3.7 at 12 h, 4 at 1 day, 2.5 at 3 day, 0.3 at 7 day, and 0 at 14 day (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The eyes of the rats were enucleated at 6, 12, 24 h, and 3, 7, and 14 days after the intravitreal injection of LPS or PBS and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Compared with the no-treatment eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), some inflammatory cells appeared in the anterior chamber and posterior chamber as early as 6 h after the LPS injection. At 12 h after the intravitreal injection of LPS, inflammatory cells appeared in the stroma of the iris-ciliary body and the retina, as well as the anterior chamber, posterior chamber, and vitreous body. These changes became more intense and reached a peak 24 h after the injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

In the hippocampal slices from &#x003b1;-syntrophin-null mice, the K<sup>+</sup> clearance was significantly delayed, probably resulting from the mislocalization of AQP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. It was proposed that a concomitant water flux through perivascular AQP4 is required to sustain the efficient removal of K<sup>+</sup> after neuronal activation. Another piece of evidence for the functional coupling of water transport and K<sup>+</sup> clearance is that the stimulus-induced extracellular K<sup>+</sup> elevation in sensorimotor cortex causes cell swelling accompanied by shrinkage of the extracellular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. In the normal retina, Kir4.1 and AQP4 strictly colocalize in the endfoot membranes of the M&#x000fc;ller cell facing the vitreous body and the retinal blood vessels, suggesting that AQP4-mediated water transport by M&#x000fc;ller cells is coupled to Kir4.1-mediated K<sup>+</sup> siphoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. We have shown here that the expression of Kir4.1 was significantly reduced, whereas that of AQP4 was only slightly reduced in retinas after an intravitreal LPS injection. This differential expression of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in the retina suggests that water transport becomes uncoupled from K<sup>+</sup> siphoning. Since the Kir4.1 channel is predominantly expressed in membranes through which K<sup>+</sup> ions flow out of M&#x000fc;ller cells and enter "extracellular sinks" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], the downregulation of Kir4.1 may disturb the efflux of K<sup>+</sup> from the endfeet into blood vessels and vitreous body, followed in turn by an accumulation of K<sup>+</sup> within the M&#x000fc;ller cells. Subsequently, the increased intracellular K<sup>+</sup> causes an osmotic gradient which drives water from the blood and vitreous into M&#x000fc;ller cells, via the AQP4 in the endfeet which is almost unchanged, leads to a swelling of the M&#x000fc;ller cells (cytotoxic edema). This hypothesis was also supported by a recent experiment, which showed that M&#x000fc;ller cells in retinas from LPS-treated eyes displayed a hypotonic cell swelling, and a downregulation of inward K<sup>+</sup> currents associated with a decreased expression of Kir4.1 protein in retina slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Moreover, we assumed that the decreased K<sup>+</sup> efflux might parallel a decreased water efflux to blood and vitreous, which may impair the absorption of vasogenic edema during EIU.</p><p>It has been shown that Kir4.1 and AQP4 share a similar polarized distribution and cocluster in M&#x000fc;ller cell membranes by association with the multiprotein dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Meanwhile, recent studies also suggested that the Kir4.1 and AQP4 have different clustering mechanisms and are regulated independently under different pathological conditions. For example, in the &#x003b1;-syntrophin-deficient mouse, AQP4 is largely mislocalized from the endfoot membranes of the M&#x000fc;ller cells, whereas Kir4.1 localization is unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. This finding suggests that &#x003b1;-syntrophin is partly responsible for anchoring AQP4 but is not involved in anchoring Kir4.1 in the glial endfoot membranes. The different redistribution patterns of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in low- and high-grade human brain tumors also supports the hypothesis of separated mechanisms for the clustering of Kir4.1 and AQP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Our experiment shows the mislocation of Kir4.1 in the endfoot membranes of M&#x000fc;ller cells and an unchanged AQP4 localization in EIU. This differential expression pattern implies different regulatory mechanisms for Kir4.1 and AQP4 in ocular inflammation, which might be due to their different clustering mechanisms. In addition, the change of Kir4.1 mRNA was several hours earlier than that of Kir4.1 protein, suggesting that the decrease in the synthesis and/or degradation of Kir4.1 mRNA proceeded faster than that of Kir4.1 protein. On the other hand, there was a slight reduction in AQP4 protein level without a marked change in mRNA level, which might suggest that the downregulation of AQP4 protein was caused by decreased synthesis of AQP4 protein or accelerated protein degradation during inflammation.</p><p>In vitro experiments have shown that an increase in the extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration upregulates LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>] but inhibits tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-&#x003b1;) and IL-6 production in activated astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Moreover, TNF-&#x003b1; causes a marked reduction in inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> currents in cultured astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. These results suggest that there might be a complicated interaction between potassium ions and inflammatory mediators in the brain. It is known that EIU is accompanied by a subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins, NO, and arachidonic acid metabolites in the uvea and retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. In our experiments, the expression of Kir4.1 in the retina decreased significantly in the early stages of EIU and the reduction persisted for a long time, even when the inflammation had subsided. Because the changes in Kir4.1 expression and the intensity of ocular inflammation were not in parallel, the role of Kir4.1 in the inflammatory process of EIU requires further investigation.</p><p>In summary, our results show the differential expression of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in the retina during EIU in rats, which implies an uncoupling of AQP4-mediated water transport from Kir4.1-mediated K<sup>+</sup> siphoning. This may result in a disturbance of potassium and water homeostasis in the retina, which in turn leads to M&#x000fc;ller cells swelling (cytotoxic edema) and impairment of the absorption of vasogenic edema during EIU. Moreover, the differential expression of Kir4.1 and AQP4 implies different clustering mechanisms of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in the endfoot membranes of M&#x000fc;ller cells. The disturbed potassium homeostasis might be involved in the inflammatory process in the retina by interacting with the inflammatory mediators released during EIU. Further investigation of these mechanisms may lead to a new understanding of EIU, as well as to novel concepts for the therapeutic management of retinal edema.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr T.
