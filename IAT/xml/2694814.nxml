Endotoxin is known to reduce tissue levels of cAMP and low levels of cAMP have been associated with renal injury.

Immunohistochemistry also showed that PDE3B was expressed in the distal tubule in the controls and LPS caused PDE3B expression in the proximal as well. However, PDE3A was not expressed in the kidney either in the control or LPS treated groups. Tissue level of cAMP was decreased after LPS and was associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, ultrastructural proximal tubular changes, and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the endotoxemic kidney. In septic animals the phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, amrinone, preserved the tissue cAMP level, renal structural changes, and attenuated the increased blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and iNOS expression in the kidney.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest a significant role for PDE3B as an important mediator of LPS-induced acute kidney injury.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Acute renal failure (ARF) frequently occurs in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

Two sections were cut from each sample and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The paraffin sections were cut to 5 &#x003bc;m in thickness, mounted on silane-coated glass slides, and stored for 1 h at 60&#x000b0;C. The slides were deparaffinized with xylene, three times, 5 min each, and were rehydrated with graded alcohols (100, 95, 70 and 50%) for 5 min, respectively. After washing with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min, the sections were digested with Proteinase K (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) at room temperature for 20 min, and were washed twice with distilled water for 2 min each. The endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in PBS for 5 min; the slides were rinsed twice with PBS for 5 min. Sections for positive control were treated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and reacted with DNase I (1&#x02013;2 U) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min, then washed twice with PBS. For negative controls, sections were covered with reaction buffer alone and incubated following same conditions. The sections were incubated 1.5 h with polyclonal antibodies against goat PDE3A and PDE3B (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at a concentration of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml.

After trimming the PolyBed mix resin blocks, ultrathin sections (100 nm) were cut. Sections were examined using an electron microscope (Hitachi H-7100, Hitachi Co., Japan). Five representative areas of five samples per group were photographed. Two morphologic patterns, intracellular edema and mitochondrial integrity, were graded with a 5-point scale as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]: 0, no abnormality; 1, mild lesions affecting 10% or less of kidney samples; 2, lesions affecting 25% of kidney samples; 3, lesions affecting 50% of kidney samples, and 4, lesions affecting 75% or more of kidney samples.

Increased expression of PDE3B along with decreased cAMP in the exdotoxemic kidneys were associated with reduced renal function, alteration of renal tubular cell morphology, and increased iNOS expression. The present data suggested that the PDE3 inhibitor, amrinone, may have a protective role in endotoxemic rats with restoration of tissue levels of cAMP and reduction of iNOS expression, associated with improved renal function and morphology.</p><p>PDE3A is highly expressed in the cardiovascular system, whereas PDE3B is expressed in adipocytes and hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the present study, PDE3B was expressed only in the distal tubule in the control group, and it was highly expressed in the proximal tubule when endotoxin was administered. However PDE3A was not detected in the kidney in either control or LPS pretreated groups. Although amrinone is a selective PDE3 enzyme inhibitor, it does not discriminate between PDE3A and PDE3B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We only found PDE3B in the kidney, and thus presumably amrinone was inhibiting only PDE3B, suggesting that PDE3B may have a role in endotoxemic kidney injury.</p><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can cause a decrease in tissue cAMP concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The present study also showed decreased cAMP concentration in the kidney tissue after endotoxemia and it was preserved by an infusion of amrinone. An increased tissue cAMP level has been shown to protect against hypoxemia induced endothelial injury by preserving endothelial barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], to improve post-ischemic recovery in the liver and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and to regulate mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Increasing cAMP attenuates iNOS expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, preserved cAMP by the PDE3 inhibitor may attenuate iNOS expression which in turn may reduce endotoxin-induced kidney injury.</p><p>The pathophysiology of sepsis-induced acute renal failure is still under investigation. Several mediators such as activated protein C, Caspase 1, Caspase 3, and ICAM-1 do play a pivotal role in animal models of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Activated protein C and caspase 3 were linked to iNOS in a septic kidney model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Sepsis causes vasodilation in the systemic circulation that is mediated by iNOS activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Peritubular capillary dysfunction has a significant role in renal cortical perfusion during endotoxemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Inhibition of iNOS by specific iNOS inhibitor has been shown to preserve renal cortical perfusion during endotoxemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Futhermore, upregulation of renal inducible nitric oxide synthase during human endotoxemia and sepsis is associated with proximal tubule injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The generation of oxygen radicals during sepsis may cause peroxynitrite-related tubular injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the present study, the PDE3 inhibitor, amrinone, raised tissue levels of cAMP and attenuated LPS-induced increased renal iNOS protein expression as well as restoring renal function. Specific iNOS inhibitors are effective in attenuating kidney injury with LPS induced renal dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Taken together, downregulation of iNOS by the PDE3 inhibitor may account for attenuated proximal tubule damage and preserved renal function.</p><p>Light microscopic examination of renal tissue revealed normal histology (data not shown) similar to the findings of others using high dose of LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However ultrastructural changes were present in all endotoxemic rat kidneys similar to that shown by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In the proximal tubule, intracellular edema and loss of mitochondria integrity were observed in the LPS pretreated rat kidney. Amrinone infusion attenuated these ultrastructural change as well as restoring serum BUN and creatinine.</p><p>In contrast to an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the PDE3 inhibitor is effective at preventing LPS induced kidney injury. The difference between the two studies are LPS dose, whether the rats were anethetized or not, and the use of different types of PDE3 inhibitor. A lower dose of LPS (1 mg/kg) was used in the present study compared to the other (4 mg/kg). Rats were anesthetized in the present study which may account for the lower baseline MAP and and anesthesia may also lead to less activation of sympathetic nerve system resulting in less inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Furthermore the PDE3 inhibitor, milrinone, was used in the former study and it is known to have less anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Taken together, all of above factors may contribute conflicting results with the previous study.</p><p>Increased cAMP increases muscle contractions in myocardium and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], so amrinone may lead to lowering of blood pressure. Although LPS did not cause significant hypotension throughout the experiment, amrinone significantly reduced MAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, MAP remained above 80 mm Hg throughout the experiment in the amrinone group. Therefore the amrinone dose in our study inhibited PDE3 without serious hemodynamic changes. Amrinone inhibits both PDE3A and PDE3B. PDE3A is present in cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] but was not detectable by us in the kidney, and Amrinone had little or no effect on kidney function in control rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. PDE3B which is an important regulator of insulin secretory processes and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] was found by us in the kidney. Therefore, the combined positive inotropic and vasodilating property of amrinone are due to inhibition of PDE3A. Thus attenuation of LPS induced acute kidney injury was likely accomplished by inhibition of PDE3B. Furthermore, amrinone has significant anti-inflammatory activity independent of its hemodynamic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, LPS caused a decrease in renal tissue cAMP that was associated with an increased expression of PDE3B, but not PDE3A. The PDE3 inhibitor, amrinone, averted the fall in tissue cAMP levels, prevented the rise in iNOS expression, and attenuated the renal tubular injury induced by LPS. Taken together, it is suggested that PDE3B inhibition may have a clinical potential in the treatment of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ARF: Acute renal failure; ANOVA: Analysis of variance; BUN: blood Urea Nitrogen; cAMP: cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: hydrogen peroxide; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MAP: mean arterial pressure; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; PDE: phosphodiesterase; RT-PCR: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WIC was responsible for carrying out the experiments, for data analysis, and for drafted this manuscript; KYK and JWS was responsible for the analysis and design for the histologic study; JB oversaw the animal experiments, instructed WIC in his implementation; DAQ and CAH is an expert in sepsis experiment and assisted in the experimental design and the data analysis and interpretation.
