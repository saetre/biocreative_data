TNFRSF25 (TNFR25) signals are required to exert T helper cell 2 (Th2) effector function in Th2-polarized CD4 cells and co-stimulate interleukin (IL)-13 production by glycosphingolipid-activated NKT cells. In vivo, antibody blockade of TNFSF15 (TL1A), which is the ligand for TNFR25, inhibits lung inflammation and production of Th2 cytokines such as IL-13, even when administered days after airway antigen exposure. Similarly, blockade of TNFR25 by a dominant-negative (DN) transgene, DN TNFR25, confers resistance to lung inflammation in mice. Allergic lung inflammation&#x02013;resistant, NKT-deficient mice become susceptible upon adoptive transfer of wild-type NKT cells, but not after transfer of DN TNFR25 transgenic NKT cells. The TNFR25/TL1A pair appears to provide an early signal for Th2 cytokine production in the lung, and therefore may be a drug target in attempts to attenuate lung inflammation in asthmatics.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: HE, hematoxylin and eosin; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; tg, transgenic; TNFRSF, TNF receptor superfamily.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>TNF receptor superfamily 25 (TNFRSF25 [TNFR25]) was cloned by several groups under the names Wsl-1, Apo3, LARD, TRAMP, DR3, and TR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) as a member of the TNF-receptor family with a typical death domain. Transfected TNFR25 has been shown to induce rapid apoptosis by activating the caspase cascade through interaction with TRADD and FADD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Like other TNF receptor family members, TNFR25 is also able via TRADD and TRAF2 to induce NF-&#x003ba;B and promote cell survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). TNFR25 is expressed constitutively in the form of randomly spliced transcripts, primarily in lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) but also in other cells, including tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p><p>The ligand for TNFR25 has recently been identified as TL1A (TNFSF15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). TL1A has co-stimulatory activity for TNFR25-expressing T cells through the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and suppression of apoptosis by up-regulation of c-IAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). TL1A expression is detected on human umbilical vein endothelial cells and mediates antiangiogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Up-regulated expression of TL1A is also found on macrophages and lymphocytes in human inflammatory bowel disease and correlated with the severity of inflammation, implying that TL1A/TNFR25 signals may be involved in inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). TL1A synergizes with IL-12 and -18 to promote IFN-&#x003b3; production in human T cells and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Whether TL1A/TNFR25 signals play a role in Th2-mediated functions and disease pathology has not been investigated.</p><p>Germ line deletion of TNFR25 in mice displayed a partial defect in negative selection of thymocytes; however, no phenotypic changes were observed in TNFR25-deficient peripheral T cells compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>Allergic, atopic lung inflammation is thought to be one of the underlying causes for airway hyperreactivity and asthma. It is characterized by IL-13 production by NKT and T cells; by Th2 polarization of CD4 cells associated with elevated IgE levels; by cellular, prominently eosinophilic, infiltration into the peribronchial space and bronchoalveolar fluid; and by goblet cell hyperplasia and increased mucus production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). In this study, we show that TNFR25 is a molecular trigger for amplified Th2 cytokine production by polarized CD4 cells and for IL-13 production by NKT cells, and that blockade of TNFR25 inhibits allergic lung inflammation, a cardinal feature of asthma, in murine models.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>TNFR25 is constitutively expressed on NKT cells and co-stimulates IL-13 production</title><p>To study the biological functions of TNFR25 and its cognate ligand TL1A, hamster anti&#x02013;mouse monoclonal antibodies to TNFR25 were generated by standard protocols and used to measure TNFR25 expression by flow cytometry on primary lymph node and spleen cells. TNFR25 was detected at low levels on naive CD4 T cells, and at even lower levels on CD8 T cells. In contrast, NKT cells expressed high levels of TNFR25 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). A subpopulation of CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and NK cells were also TNFR25 positive, whereas B cells were negative. We confirmed previous data that activated CD4 and CD8 T cells up-regulated TNFR25 expression (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In the thymus, single-positive CD4 and CD8 cells expressed TNFR25 at levels similar to naive peripheral T cells. CD4/CD8 double-positive and -negative thymocytes did not express TNFR25 (unpublished data). The high level of constitutive TNFR25 expression on NKT cells suggested that TNFR25 may have important functions in NKT co-stimulation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>TNFR25 is constitutively expressed on resting NKT cells and co-stimulates IL-4 and -13 cytokine production.</bold> (A) Expression of TNFR25 in lymph node cells.

Details of the method for intracellular cytokine staining are given in Materials and methods. In negative controls for unspecific staining, anti&#x02013;IL-13 was blocked with recombinant IL-13 before use in intracellular staining (see Materials and methods) and were given values of &#x0003c;1%. Data for intracellular staining of IL-13 and IFN-&#x003b3; in NKT cells were obtained by gating on NK1.1 and CD3 double-positive cells. Data are taken from two experiments.

NKT cells have been implicated in Th1/Th2 polarization and in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), autoimmunity, and antitumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Using an agonistic anti-TNFR25 antibody (4C12), we determined whether signals emanating from TNFR25 on NKT cells had effects on their secretion of Th1 or Th2 cytokines. NK/NKT cells were enriched from pooled spleen cells of 10 mice by positive selection using a mouse pan-NK-Positive Selection kit (StemCell Technologies), resulting in a population composed of 65% NK and 35% NKT cells. NK cells express CD1d and therefore are able to present lipids to the TCR of invariant NKT cells. NKT cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of the glycosphingolipid OCH or with anti-CD3, with and without co-stimulation of TNFR25 by the agonistic anti-TNFR25 antibody 4C12. OCH is a derivative of &#x003b1;-galactosylceramide with a shortened sphingosine chain. After 2 d of stimulation with increasing concentrations of OCH in the presence or absence of agonistic anti-TNFR25 (4C12), the supernatants were harvested and analyzed for IL-13, IL-4, and IFN-&#x003b3; by ELISA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). TNFR25 signals co-stimulated lipid-dependent IL-13 production and, to a lesser extent, IL-4 production, but had no effect on IFN-&#x003b3; production. In the absence of lipid, anti-TNFR25 alone did not induce production of any of the cytokines (unpublished data). TNFR25 signals also up-regulated the frequency of IL-13&#x02013;secreting NKT cells, as detected by intracellular staining and gating on NK1.1/CD3 double-positive cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). TNFR25-mediated IL-13 co-stimulation was most pronounced at an anti-CD3 concentration of 0.3&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;g/ml, suggesting sensitivity of TNFR25 co-stimulation to antigen concentration. IFN-&#x003b3; responses occur at lower anti-CD3 concentrations, but are not subject to TNFR25 co-stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>TL1A is expressed on activated CD4 and CD8 T cells and activates NF-&#x003ba;B and apoptosis in TNFR25-transfected cells</title><p>To study the ligand for TNFR25, we generated monoclonal antibodies to murine TL1A for flow cytometry and functional studies.

Invariant NKT cells producing IL-13 have previously been shown to be essential for the induction of lung inflammation and airway hyperreactivity in the murine ovalbumin model for allergic, atopic lung inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). We therefore tested whether blockade of TNFR25 signals in vivo would have effects on lung inflammation in the classical ovalbumin model. Blockade of TNFR25 signals in vivo can be achieved by blocking the cognate ligand TL1A with an antagonistic TL1A antibody (L4G6) or by genetic means, generating dominant-negative (DN) mutants of TNFR25.</p><p>To test TNFR25 blockade with anti-TL1A, mice were immunized twice with ovalbumin in alum on day 0 and 5, and were airway challenged on day 12 with aerosolized ovalbumin. 1 d before airway challenge, and for the next 3 d, 50 &#x003bc;g anti-TL1A-IgG L4G6 or control hamster IgG was administered i.p., and the mice were analyzed the next day. L4G6 administered in this way at the time of aerosol challenge strongly inhibited lung inflammation, as indicated by decreased cellular exudation into BALF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and by reduced mucus production as detected in tissue section by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

Using Taqman PCR assays, we found IL-13 mRNA to be up-regulated by &#x0003e;100-fold and IL-5 mRNA to a lower degree in lung tissues of ovalbumin-aerosolized mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Anti-TL1A administration started 1 d before aerosol blocked the up-regulation of Th2 cytokine mRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether TL1A blockade of lung inflammation was effective even when started after airway antigen reexposure, we compared the effect of TL1A blockade on inflammation by beginning antibody administration from 24 h before to 72 h after ovalbumin aerosol exposure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Anti-TL1A fully blocked lung inflammation when administration started at &#x02212;24, 0, and &#x0002b;24 h relative to airway antigen exposure. Significant inhibition of lung inflammation by anti-TL1A was still observed, even when the antibody was administered 48 and 72 h after aerosol exposure. The 72-h time point allowed for only 4 h of in vivo action of anti-TL1A, but was still able to significantly reduce eosinophil infiltration by &#x0223c;50%, suggesting potential therapeutic activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The rapid reduction of eosinophils in BALF within 4 h after anti-TL1A administration suggests that anti-TL1A disrupts an ongoing inflammatory reaction recruiting eosinophils and/or supporting their maintenance. Histopathology by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and PAS staining of the lung revealed decreased numbers of infiltrating cells around blood vessels and bronchioli and decreasing mucus already within 4 h of TL1A blockade (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>). The relative frequency of CD4 and CD8 cells detected in the lymphoid gate in the lung parenchyma is slightly increased after 4 h TL1A blockade and decreases upon longer L4G6 presence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, F and G</xref>). The early, relative increase in the frequency of CD4 and CD8 cells after only 4 h of TL1A blockade may be caused by the rapid loss of eosinophils that represent a large proportion of infiltrating cells. The frequency of NKT cells varied in the lymphoid gate in all samples without a clear tendency of change (unpublished data). Anti-TL1A, present for 4 and 24 h, suppressed IL-4, -5, and -13 mRNA but did not affect IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, H and J</xref>).

In WT CD4 cells, cytokine production is co-stimulated by TNFR25 signals elicited with the agonistic anti-TNFR25 antibody 4C12.

Adoptive transfer of WT NKT cells to NKT-deficient, J&#x003b1;18 KO mice restores lung inflammation and airway hyperreactivity in the ovalbumin model. Akbari et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) also showed that adoptive transfer of NKT cells from IL-13-deficient mice did not restore lung inflammation in J&#x003b1;18 KO mice, demonstrating the importance of IL-13 production by NKT cells in the induction of lung inflammation. Because our data indicated that IL-13 production by NKT cells is co-stimulated by TNFR25, we hypothesized that adoptive transfer of DN TNFR25-tg NKT cells likewise would not be able restore lung inflammation in NKT-deficient mice.</p><p>We purified NK/NKT cells by positive selection from the spleens of 10 mice, and we adoptively transferred i.v. 1 million DN TNFR25-tg NKT cells, corresponding to 3 million NK/NKT cells, into ovalbumin-primed, NKT-deficient (J&#x003b1;18 KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Adoptive transfer of 1 million WT NKT cells served as controls. On the day after adoptive transfer the mice were subjected to aerosolized ovalbumin. 3 d later, lung inflammation was measured by the degree of eosinophil exudation into the BALF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>) and by cytokine mRNA expression in lung parenchyma and bronchial draining lymph nodes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>). Although adoptively transferred WT NKT cells restored lung inflammation and BALF eosinophilia upon airway antigen challenge, the same number of DN TNFR25-tg NKT cells was unable to do so (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The diminished BALF eosinophilia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>) observed in DN TNFR25-tg NKT cell-transferred mice was associated with diminished Th2 cytokine mRNA induction in lung tissues and in bronchial draining lymph nodes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>). In lung tissue, IL-13 mRNA was markedly reduced, whereas in bronchial lymph nodes, IL-4 and -5 mRNA were also strongly affected by the absence of functional TNFR25 on NKT cells. In addition, TL1A mRNA was twofold higher in mice receiving WT NKT cells, suggesting positive feedback amplification of TL1A expression by TNFR25-induced Th2 cytokine production. The data demonstrate that TNFR25 signals in NKT cells are necessary and sufficient for triggering lung inflammation during airway antigen exposure of sensitized mice even under conditions when normal TNFR25-signals can be elicited on CD4 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>TNFR25 signals on NKT cells are required for induction of lung inflammation.</bold> NKT-deficient J&#x003b1;18 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) were primed with ovalbumin and alum as in our standard protocol in Materials and methods.

Our study indicates that an essential trigger for IL-13 secretion by NKT cells and Th2 cytokine production in the lung is TNFR25. This conclusion is supported by the evidence that TNFR25 in vitro acts as a co-stimulus for IL-13 secretion by NKT, together with the activation of the invariant TCR by glycosphingolipid or low concentration of anti-CD3. TNFR25 signals also increase the number of IL-13&#x02013;producing NKT cells, by inducing IL-13&#x02013;producing cells at intermediate TCR stimulation. The effect of TNFR25 co-stimulation on NKT cells appears to be specific for IL-13, and to a lesser extent IL-4, whereas IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by NKT cells is not co-stimulated by TNFR25.</p><p>The importance of TNFR25 signals in lung inflammation is further supported by in vivo blocking experiments using an antagonistic anti-TL1A antibody and by genetic blockade of TNFR25 signals with a DN mutant TNFR25 transgene. In vivo, blockade of TNFR25 results in inhibition of all signs of lung inflammation, including down-regulation of IL-4, -5, and -13 mRNA in lung parenchyma and bronchial lymph nodes, diminished Th2 cytokine production after ex vivo antigen restimulation of draining bronchial lymph nodes, diminished BALF eosinophilia, and diminished mucus production. The potent effect of anti-TL1A on BALF eosinophilia is noteworthy. 4 h of TL1A blockade, from 72 to 76 h after airway antigen exposure, was reproducibly able to significantly reduce BALF eosinophilia by &#x0223c;50%. It is known that eosinophil-accumulation peaks on day 3 after airway antigen exposure. In culture, eosinophils are short lived unless IL-5 is added, which supports eosinophil survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Thus, TL1A may be needed for stimulation of TNFR25 signals for continued IL-5 and -13 production, thereby sustaining continued survival and/or migration of eosinophils into BALF. In support of this hypothesis, we found that in vitro continuous anti-CD3 stimulation of CD4 cells maintains high levels of TL1A expression for &#x0003e;4 d. Withdrawal of TCR stimulation results in TL1A down-regulation within 24 h (unpublished data). Alternatively, eosinophils may express TNFR25, which has not been studied so far, and it may act as a direct survival factor. Finally, it has been reported that TL1A is expressed by certain endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), and thus may be involved in eosinophil migration and extravasation.</p><p>The data also indicate that TNFR25 co-stimulation during secondary activation of CD4 cells greatly amplifies Th2 cytokine production. According to recent reports, Th2 polarization involves gain of Th2 effector function, followed by ITK-mediated signals that are required for the exertion (amplification) of Th2 effector function upon TCR restimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). The upstream signals leading to ITK activation have not been identified. It is possible that TNFR25 signals play a role in this sequence; a hypothesis is currently under investigation. In support, we have found that functional TNFR25 transgenes on T cells result in spontaneous Th2 production of CD4 cells upon primary activation (unpublished data). The strong effects of TNFR25 blockade on lung inflammation, therefore, appear to be caused by the dual action of TNFR25, first at the level of NKT cells and second at the level of polarized CD4 T cells.</p><p>We were able to further support the role of TNFR25 on NKT cells through adoptive transfer experiments of NKT cells into NKT-deficient mice. NKT-deficient mice are resistant to lung inflammation, but can be rendered susceptible by adoptive transfer of WT NKT cells before airway antigen exposure. On the other hand, adoptive transfer of IL-13&#x02013;deficient NKT cells is unable to restore lung inflammation in NKT-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>); similarly, we show that adoptive transfer of DN TNFR25-tg NKT cells is unable to restore lung inflammation. This finding is consistent with the interpretation that TNFR25 signals in vivo are required to trigger IL-13 secretion by NKT cells in the ovalbumin model of lung inflammation. Absence of either IL-13 or TNFR25 signals triggering IL-13 release by NKT cells results in aborted lung inflammation upon airway antigen exposure of primed mice.</p><p>TNFR25 is triggered by ligation to TL1A, as indicated by the antibody blockade using antagonistic anti-TL1A. TL1A is not detectable by PCR in the normal lung, but is up-regulated on the mRNA level as measured by Taqman assays in bronchial lymph nodes and lung tissue during lung inflammation. CD4 and CD8 T cells and APC can express TL1A upon activation. It is known that TL1A can be released as soluble ligand after proteolytic cleavage. Therefore, it is possible that TL1A may act as soluble mediator or as cell-bound ligand to trigger TNFR25 on NKT and T cells.</p><p>Regardless of the specific details of TL1A expression as soluble or cell-bound molecule, our data add an important molecular component (TNFR25/TL1A) to our understanding of the pathogenesis of lung inflammation, a cardinal feature of asthma. Our data support and extend previous findings of the importance of NKT cells and IL-13 in lung inflammation and in airway hyperreactivity. We present evidence that TNFR25 is the essential trigger for IL-13 release by NKT cells and for amplification of the Th2 response by Th2-polarized CD4 cells. These functions distinguish TNFR25 from Ox40, which supports survival of Th2-polarized CD4 T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). In contrast, TNFR25 specifically promotes the exertion of effector function of Th2-polarized cells, in addition to triggering IL-13 production by NKT cells. Whether Ox40 has any effects on NKT cells is not known.</p><p>Attenuation of lung inflammation is an important goal for the treatment of atopic asthma, which is inexorably rising in incidence and severity. Our data show that lung inflammation can be inhibited by TNFR25 blockers in mice that have already been primed and sensitized. Importantly, TL1A blockade even 72 h after airway antigen reexposure of sensitized mice, for 4 h before analysis, attenuates lung inflammation. This finding, and the observation that TNFR25 appears to be very far upstream in the inflammatory sequence, may make it a valuable target for drug development for the treatment of asthma patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Media and reagents.</title><p>Cells were cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), 10 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen), and 50 &#x003bc;M &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

Cells were seeded into round-bottom 96-well plates at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well and cultured with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml ovalbumin for 4 d. Supernatants were collected for cytokine ELISA assays as described.</p><p>Cytokine mRNA levels were measured by quantitative Taqman PCR. Before the homogenizing procedure, lungs and lymph nodes were suspended in 3 and 1.5 ml, respectively, of ice cold lysing buffer RLT (RNeasy mini kit; QIAGEN). Homogenization was performed in a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube, using a 12-mm generator attached to a standalone Polytron PCU-2 (Brinkman) homogenizer unit. Tubes were maintained on ice throughout the homogenization process. Subsequently, 0.7 ml of homogenized tissues was further homogenized using QIAshredder Mini Spin columns (QIAGEN). Extraction of RNA was performed using the RNeasy mini kit following the manufacturer's recommendations for purification of total RNA from animal tissue. An on-column DNase digestion was also performed using RNase-Free DNase (QIAGEN). The quality of RNA was assessed by capillary chromatography and quantitated by spectrophotometry. Reverse transcription of 1 &#x003bc;g of RNA per sample, was performed using the Quantitect reverse transcription kit (QIAGEN), following recommendations from the manufacturer. Real-Time PCR was performed in a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using dual-labeled fluorogenic probe-based Taqman technology. Gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) for IL-4 (Mm00445259_m1), IL-5 (Mm00439646_m1), IL-10 (Mm00439616_m1), IL-13 (Mm00434204_m1), IFN-&#x003b3; (Mm00801778_m1), and TL1-A(Mm00770031_m1) were performed and normalized to GAPDH (part number 4352932E; Applied Biosystems) gene expression, and fold differences calculated using the &#x00394;Ct method.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cytotoxicity assay.</title><p>Soluble TL1A supernatants harvested from P815-TL1A transfected cells were added to <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled P815-TNFR25 transfected target cells.

Lotze (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) with permission from M. Taniguchi (Ciba University, Ciba, Japan). NKT cells from WT and DN TNFR25-tg mice were enriched from pooled spleen cells from 10 mice by positive selection using the EasySep mouse Pan-NK-Positive Selection kit (StemCell Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ratio of NK to NKT cells in the enriched population was 65:35.3 million cells containing 1 million WT or DN TNFR25-tg NKT cells were adoptively transferred i.v. through the tail vein to ovalbumin-primed mice, and the mice were aerosolized on the next day and analyzed 2 d later.</p><p>NK/NKT cells were isolated in the same way for in vitro analysis of cytokine co-stimulation by agonistic anti-TNFR25. 200,000 cells were incubated for 48 h in flat bottom, 96-well microtiter plates in triplicate in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-15 with 0, 20, 100, or 500 ng/ml of the glycosphingolipid OCH. The lipid OCH is identical to &#x003b1;-galactosylceramide except for a shorter sphingosine chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Co-stimulation was achieved with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml agonistic anti-TNFR25 antibody 4C12. After 48 h, supernatants were harvested and analyzed by ELISA for IL-13, IL-4, and IFN-&#x003b3;.</p><p>For intracellular cytokine staining, enriched NK/NKT cells were cultured at 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 96-well, flat-bottom plates for 72 h in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3, as indicated in the figures with or without anti-TNFR25 at 5 &#x003bc;g/ml. Activated cells were harvested after 67 h, washed twice in media, and counted. Cells were replated at 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 96 flat-bottom well plates for 5 h in the presence of PMA (at 10 nM) and ionomycin (at 0.25 &#x003bc;M) and Monensin (at 2 &#x003bc;M). After the 5 h, cells were harvested (not counted) and transferred directly into staining tubes (3&#x02013;4 wells worth of cells per tube &#x0003d; 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells). Staining began with cell surface stain with CD3 PerCP and NK1.1 FITC. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized at room temperature, followed by an incubation with the specific intracellular cytokine stain (IL-13 Alexa Fluor 647 and IFN-&#x003b3; Pacific Blue) or isotype control. For the IL-13 staining control, 1 &#x003bc;g rIL-13 was used to preblock anti&#x02013;IL-13, which then proceeded to stain as with the unblocked IL-13 antibody. All antibodies and reagents used for the intracellular cytokine stain were purchased from eBioscience, except for the CD3 PerCP which was purchased from BD Biosciences. Data were acquired on BD LSRII with BD DIVA software. Files were then converted and analyzed using Cell Quest.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Statistical analyses.</title><p>Statistical analyses using a two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic> test were performed with GraphPad Prism Software.
