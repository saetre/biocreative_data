When DNA is damaged or perturbed during replication, the cells respond by the activation of evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways that delay the progression of the cell cycle and induce repair of the damaged DNA. These signal transduction pathways include protein sensors that recognize aberrant DNA structures and activate kinases, thereby inducing phosphorylation cascades that ultimately lead to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Failure of this cell cycle surveillance mechanism can cause genomic instability which eventually leads to the formation of cancer in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>hRad9 protein is the human homologue of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe </italic>Rad9, a member of the checkpoint <italic>rad </italic>genes (<italic>rad1+</italic>, <italic>rad3+</italic>, <italic>rad9+</italic>, <italic>rad17+</italic>, <italic>rad26+</italic>, and <italic>hus1+</italic>) which are required for the S phase (DNA replication) and G2 (DNA mitosis) check points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Like its yeast counterpart, hRad9 forms a ring-shaped, heterotrimeric complex with the hRad1 and hHus1 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Each member of hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 complex (also known as the 9-1-1 complex), shares sequence homology with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a homotrimer that encircles the DNA and tethers DNA polymerase &#x003b4; during DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. PCNA is loaded onto DNA by the pentameric protein complex replication factor C (RFC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which is composed of one large subunit and four smaller subunits. In a manner analogous to PCNA and RFC, 9-1-1 complex is loaded onto DNA by a complex between hRad17 and the four small subunits of RFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Since DNA damage induces hRad17-dependent association of 9-1-1 complex with chromatin, the 9-1-1 complex is believed to be involved in the direct recognition of DNA lesions during the initial stages of the checkpoint response; the 9-1-1 complex may thus be associated with chromatin following DNA damage to transduce signals for DNA damage-activated checkpoint signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In mammalian cells, the signal initiated by the sensors, two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKK), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR), plays a central role in the checkpoint signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. ATM and ATR are activated by downstream signaling proteins, genotoxins and phosphorylation including Chk1 and Chk2, two protein kinases that regulate checkpoint responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. hRad9 is highly modified by phosphorylation in at specific points of the cell cycle after DNA damage, and it also plays a critical role in checkpoint signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. ATM-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-272 of hRad9 is required for IR-induced G1/S checkpoint activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; Other phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region are also essential for Chk1 activation following hydroxyurea (HU), IR, and UV treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], although the exact function of hRad9 in cell cycle control has not yet been completely characterized.</p><p>The tumor suppressor gene <italic>TP53 </italic>controls cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and genomic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A defect in the pathway, involving p53, is essential for the malignant progression of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. When cells with wild-type <italic>TP53 </italic>are exposed to DNA-damaging agents, p53 is functionally activated, p53 protein level rises, and p53 binds to and transcriptionally activates the promoters of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These target genes include; <italic>P21</italic>, <italic>MDM2</italic>, <italic>GADD45</italic>, <italic>BAX</italic>, <italic>IGF-BP3 </italic>and <italic>CYCLIN G</italic>. The <italic>P21 </italic>gene product was originally identified, as a potential target for the p53 tumor suppressive activity (WAF1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is either an inhibitor of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (Cip1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], or an inhibitor of DNA synthesis that is expressed during cellular senescence (SDI1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is known that p21 is a major effector of the G1 cell cycle checkpoint. Therefore, p53 is a negative regulator of the cell cycle progression and it controls the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This report demonstrates that hRad9 plays a role in the modulation of <italic>P21 </italic>transcription by direct interaction with p53. Furthermore, the substitution of the phosphorylation sites on hRad9 to Ala resulted in an alteration of the regulation of <italic>P21</italic>. The present study supports the hypothesis that hRad9 plays a role in the modulation of <italic>P21 </italic>transcription, presumably via competition with p53, that involves its C-terminus, which would be essential for the cellular response to DNA damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>P21 is activated immediately after UV treatment</title><p>Several previous studies have shown that genotoxic stress induces the stabilization and transient accumulation of wild-type p53 protein in mammalian cells, leading to an increase of expression of p53 down-stream genes, including <italic>P21 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Employing RT-PCR, the level of <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA expression of human embryonic kidney 293 cells was examined in these experiments. The level of <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA expression substantially increased at 30 min after UV irradiation and reached maximal levels at 1 hr thereafter. At that time, the mRNA levels were reduced but still detectable until 72 hr after UV exposure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Next, using the protein equivalent to each time points, a Western blotting analysis was performed to examine the time course of p21 protein expression. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, a substantial increase of p21 was seen at 3, 12, and 24 hr following exposure to UV. These results indicate that the accumulation of both <italic>P21 </italic>transcript and p21 protein occurred, and G1/S checkpoint was activated after UV irradiation. Since 293 cells are immortalized by E1B, derived from human adenoviral proteins, and might be defective in p53 signaling, another MRC5 fibroblast cell line with wild-type p53 was examined, and observed that <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA increased about 3.3 fold after UV irradiation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), thus suggesting that exposure to UV leads an increase of <italic>P21 </italic>expression of both cell lines similarly under these conditions. This expression pattern of <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA and p21 protein suggests that the G1/S checkpoint is activated immediately after DNA damage, and inhibits damaged cells from progressing through the cell cycle and entering the S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. After the peak of activation, <italic>P21 </italic>transcription declined as observed in a recent report that indicated that p21 can be degraded during excision repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This suggests that more than the arrest of the cell cycle at G1 or a broad time period could thus be involved in the decrease of <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA and protein following UV exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of hRad9 in p53-dependent P21 activation through its C-terminus</title><p>Utilizing the <italic>P21 </italic>promoter-luciferase reporter system, the functional aspect of regulation of <italic>P21 </italic>by hRad9 was assessed. Since phosphorylation of hRad9 is required for DNA damage checkpoint activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the requirement of phosphorylation of hRad9 for <italic>P21 </italic>transcription was investigated using wild-type and the following phosphorylation-defective <italic>RAD9 </italic>mutants: 1) <italic>RAD9</italic>-S272A, with a substitution of Ser-272 with an Ala residue, 2) <italic>RAD9</italic>-9A, with substitutions of C-terminus phosphorylation sites including Ser-272, Ser-277, Ser-328, Ser-336, Ser-341, Ser-355, Ser-375, Ser-380, and Ser-387, with Ala, and 3) <italic>RAD9</italic>-8A, with substitutions of all C-terminus phosphorylation sites except for Ser-272, with Ala. Western blotting was performed to confirm the expression of the protein in wild-type and mutants,. Wild-type Rad9 was detectably expressed as a series of large proteins, suggesting the phosphorylated form(s) of hRad9 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Rad9-S272A also expressed with a similar series of large proteins, presumably corresponding to different phosphorylated species of hRad9, with a gradient of phosphorylation excluding the Ser272 residue. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The transfection of <italic>RAD9</italic>-8A or <italic>RAD9</italic>-9A resulted in a reduced phosphorylation compared to wild-type Rad9 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 4 and 5, compared with lane 2). The results indicate that phosphorylation-defective mutants are substantially expressed and retain the capacity for reduced phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Afterward, the promoter region of <italic>P21 </italic>was fused to a luciferase reporter (WWP-Luc-<italic>P21 </italic>promoter) and it was cotransfected along with plasmids into cells as indicated. Background levels of expression were low, as demonstrated by a control transfection of empty vector and promoter-less pGL3-basic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, column 1). By using the reporter vector, containing the p53-binding consensus sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the introduction of p53 expectedly induced luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, column 7). The introduction of the wild-type Rad9 also induced the positive luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, column 3), although not as intensively as p53. The co-expression of p53 and wild-type Rad9 induced luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, column 8) at an intermediate level in comparison to that seen when each protein is transfected independently. Considering these data, in association with the previous report of the potential transactivating property of hRad9 for the <italic>P21 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], these results support the concept that hRad9 can stimulate the transcription of <italic>P21 </italic>and it may modulate the p53 function. The luciferase activity was comparable among wild-type and phosphorylation-defective mutants following the plasmid introduction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, columns 4 to 6, compared with 3), and was lower in the co-expression of mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, columns 9 to 11, compared with 8), suggesting that the phosphorylation of hRad9 is involved in regulation of p53-dependent <italic>P21 </italic>transcription. Yin <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] reported that wild-type hRad9 activates <italic>P21 </italic>transcription and that the co-expression of p53 and wild-type hRad9 results in the intermediate transcriptional activity by p53 or hRad9 alone, consistent with the present results. This suggests that phosphorylation may thus play a possible role in p53 dependent <italic>P21 </italic>transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Knock down of endogenous hRad9 increases the transcription of P21</title><p>Endogenous hRad9 was knocked down using siRNA to address the role of hRad9 for the transcription of <italic>P21 </italic>in response to UV exposure. A Western blot analysis showed that siRNA treatment resulted in the reduction of endogenous p53 or hRad9 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In addition, hRad9 siRNA did not increase p53 protein compared to mock treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Using RT-PCR, the <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA level was determined. The knockdown of <italic>hRAD9 </italic>resulted in an increase in the level of <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, column 3), whereas the knockdown of <italic>TP53 </italic>showed levels of <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA comparable to mock-treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, column 2, compared with 1). This suggests that hRad9 plays a role in modulating <italic>P21 </italic>transactivation. After UV treatment, the mock-treated cells showed an increase of <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, column 4), compared with UV (-) control, under these conditions. <italic>TP53 </italic>siRNA transfection resulted in an obvious reduction of <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, column 5), thus suggesting that the effect of p53 reduction was appreciable after UV-induced damage under those conditions. In contrast, <italic>hRAD9 </italic>knockdown resulted in an apparent increase of <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA after UV exposure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, column 6). The UV treatment was not simply additive to the <italic>hRAD9 </italic>knockdown in <italic>P21 </italic>transactivation, thus suggesting that the reduction of endogenous hRad9 resulted in a profound effect in UV damage-dependent and -independent <italic>P21 </italic>pathway. Furthermore, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and PCR-Southern blotting was performed to confirm the effect of Rad9 siRNA, and similar results were obtained (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2B</xref>). Using <italic>TP53</italic>-deficient MEFs, real time RT-PCR was used to confirm the effect of knockdown of Rad9 in <italic>P21 </italic>transcription, and this demonstrated an increase in <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA after knockdown of Rad9 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2C</xref>), thus supporting the concept that Rad9 is not only an activator, but also a modulator in this pathway. The transactivation of <italic>P21 </italic>in the absence and reduction of the p53 and Rad9 may be due to transcription factors, such as sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, a p53-deficient cell line TE-7, with transcriptionally inactive <italic>TP53 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], was used to study the effect of the introduced hRad9 and p53 proteins under p53 negative background. TE-7 cells were transfected with wild-type or phosphorylation-defective mutant <italic>RAD9</italic>, and <italic>TP53 </italic>plasmids, and the expression of each protein was confirmed by Western blotting; the exogenous expression of wild-type and mutant <italic>RAD9 </italic>elicited the induction of <italic>P21 </italic>mRNA and its product, associated with Ser15 phosphorylation of transfected p53, whereas endogenous p53 and its phosphorylated form were undetectable without transgene introduction (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3A, 3B</xref>, and data not shown), thus suggesting that Rad9 may play a role in the p53-dependent p21 transactivation and Rad9-p53 might express a certain active function in p53 negative cancer cells, compatible with the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. One might speculate that Rad9-p53 has a high affinity for the p21 promoter; rather than the induction of p21, the transfection could result in the reduction of p21 in endogenous p53-positive cells, and might stimulate p21 in p53-negative background. It also should be noted that numerous or uncharacterized, additional alterations might accumulate in cancer-derived cell lines. Taken together, the present data indicate that the transfection of hRad9 plays a role in <italic>P21 </italic>transcription, depending on the co-expressed p53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and the knockdown of hRad9 can stimulate <italic>P21 </italic>transactivation, thus suggesting that the protein level of hRad9 may be involved in modulation and regulation of <italic>P21 </italic>transactivation. Considering that other studies show that hRad9 accumulation after DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] may enhance the modulation of <italic>P21 </italic>promoter activation, this supports the hypothesis that hRad9 may regulate <italic>P21 </italic>transcription in concert with p53, and that the reduction of hRad9 might elicit the checkpoint response. Recent studies with tumors indicate that the <italic>hRAD9 </italic>gene is located in a chromosomal region at 11q13. This genomic region is amplified and both mRNA and protein are frequently overexpressed in breast, lung, head and neck cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This up-regulation is correlated with tumor size and local recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, silencing <italic>hRAD9 </italic>by RNA interference inhibits cell proliferation <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These observations are consistent with the findings of the present study. Nevertheless, there is still insufficient data to determine whether hRad9 might be involved directly or indirectly in p53-dependent <italic>P21 </italic>activation. Therefore, the assessment of the direct association of hRad9-p53 is the next step.</p></sec><sec><title>hRad9 associates with p53</title><p>The data reported above indicate that transfection of hRad9 modulates p53-dependent <italic>P21 </italic>promoter activation, and that knockdown of hRad9 stimulates p53-dependent <italic>P21 </italic>promoter activation. Therefore, the association of endogenous hRad9 with endogenous p53 was examined using immunoprecipitation. Endogenous hRad9 was co-immunoprecipitated with p53 from 293 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The hRad9-p53 association was then assessed in another MRC5 cells using immunoprecipitation and similar results were obtained (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>), thus suggesting that the association is not specific to the cell type. Considering these results, along with those of the pull-down assay of GST-fusion p53 with [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine-labeled <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated hRad9 protein (data not shown), the findings of the present study strongly suggests that hRad9 acts as a modulator of <italic>P21 </italic>transcription through a direct association with p53. To investigate whether phosphorylation of hRad9 affects the binding to p53, wild-type or phosphorylation-defective <italic>RAD9 </italic>mutants were transfected, and immunoprecipitation was performed. The results showed p53 to be associated with hRad9, in both the wild-type and phosphorylation-defective mutants (<italic>RAD9</italic>-S272A, <italic>RAD9</italic>-8A, and <italic>RAD9</italic>-9A). However the association with <italic>RAD9</italic>-8A or <italic>RAD9</italic>-9A was somewhat reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The data implicate the substantial association of p53 with intact hRad9, and that the hRad9 mutants might be altered in capacity for p53 binding, presumably due to conformational changes and affinity of complex, which would result the release of immunoprecipitated components after extensive washes.</p><p>Previous studies have showed that p53 protein can be phosphorylated at Ser-15 within 1 hr after DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. A Western blot analysis indicated that Ser-15 of p53 was phosphorylated 5 min after UV treatment in the present experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The time course of this reaction was examined to determine whether the association of hRad9 and p53 might be altered after UV irradiation. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> demonstrates that the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 in the immunoprecipitated components increased at 5 min and reached a maximal level at 6 hr after UV treatment, and declined, consistent with the Western blot findings in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, whereas the total amount of Rad9-p53 interaction did not increase. In addition, other phosphorylation sites of p53, including Ser-6, Ser-9, Ser-20, Ser-37, Ser-46, and Ser-392 were also examined and they were phosphorylated temporally, regardless of the positive association of hRad9 with p53 over the time course, as observed Ser-15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, and data not shown). These results indicate that the binding of hRad9 and p53 is not significantly affected by phosphorylation, though it is possible that the modifications of the phosphorylation in these amino acid residues are not involved in the binding of the components.</p><p>The present immunoprecipitation study revealed hRad9 to be associated with p53, and the association was detected regardless of degree of phosphorylation of p53 and presumably of hRad9. A previous report also demonstrated that constitutive phosphorylation of hRad9 does not influence the stability of the 9-1-1 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is suggested that hRad9, as a complex with p53, may be involved in the transactivation of <italic>P21 </italic>and that the phosphorylations of hRad9 and p53 might modulate the transactivation activity of the complex. Whereas none of the phosphorylation sites of hRad9 targeted in the present study have been previously reported to be required for genotoxin-induced chromatin binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the present data suggest that hRad9 phosphorylation might be involved in binding affinity for p53-consensus binding sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation of hRad9 affects the preference of p53 for binding sites</title><p>The effects of alterations of the affinity of hRad9/p53 for p53-consensus binding sites of <italic>P21 </italic>promoter for chromatin remodeling after UV treatment were investigated. Previous studies show that hRad9 specifically binds to a p53-consensus DNA-binding sequence in the <italic>P21 </italic>promoter and regulates <italic>P21 </italic>at the transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. A ChIP assay was used to evaluate whether the affinity of hRad9/p53 complex for p53 binding sites may increase after UV treatment, and whether the phosphorylation of hRad9 affects the affinity for binding sites. The human <italic>P21 </italic>promoter contains two p53-binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), and the treatment with 5-fluorouracil significantly enhances the recruitment of p53 protein to both upstream and downstream <italic>P21 </italic>promoter regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Therefore, each of the two p53-binding sites was observed. A ChIP assay with anti-p53 and anti-Rad9 antibodies showed that their binding to each of upstream and downstream <italic>P21 </italic>promoters was increased 15 to 30 min after UV treatment, whereas ChIP with anti-acethylated histone H4 antibody indicated that the acetylation around the <italic>P21 </italic>promoter was not altered significantly in the those conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), thus suggesting that the association of p53 and hRad9, and its subsequent complex with <italic>P21 </italic>promoters is correlated with the regulation of transcription after UV exposure. Next, ChIP assays were performed with transfectants of the wild-type or phosphorylation-defective <italic>RAD9 </italic>plasmids. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, hRad9 and p53 binding to the downstream site was inhibited by introduction of phosphorylation-defective mutants (as shown as asterisks). The association was increased after UV treatment, in all cases except for cells transfected with the <italic>RAD9</italic>-8A plasmid which showed a low affinity to the binding site. This suggests the possibility that systematic, scheduled or sequential phosphorylation of Ser residues in hRad9 might be necessary for efficient binding to p53-consensus DNA sequences. ChIP binding of hRad9 seems to be reduced slightly, compared to that of p53, which might be due to the specificity of the antibodies. Similar results with hRad9 and p53 were obtained at the upstream binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). The present results suggest that the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of hRad9 may play a role in modulation of the affinity for binding its consensus sites.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the multifunctional roles of hRad9 a DNA damage sensor in the 9-1-1 complex, a G2/M checkpoint via the phosphorylation of Chk1, in DNA repair via DNA polymerase &#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] or flap endonuclease 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and in apoptosis via potential binding to Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The present study, demonstrated the direct association of Rad9-p53 and the regulatory role of phosphorylation in the activation of <italic>P21 </italic>transcription, thus indicating that hRad9 is an important modulator, but not a unique player with a single function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>hRad9 has a complex role in response to DNA damage, acting not only as an activator but also as a modulator in <italic>P21 </italic>transcription and contributing to the regulation of genomic integrity. If hRad9 was regulated inaccurately, the <italic>P21 </italic>could not regulate the appropriate G1/S transition and replication, thus resulting in the occurrence of unscheduled replications after DNA damage. Such events can contribute to the accumulation of pathological conditions and genomic instability in carcinogenesis and tumor progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, immortalized by E1B protein, derived from a part of the human adenovirus, and MRC5 fibroblasts with wild-type p53 status were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal cow serum (FCS).
