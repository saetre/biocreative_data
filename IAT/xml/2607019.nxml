In particular, after viral integration into the host genome, stochastic fluctuations in viral gene expression amplified by the Tat positive feedback loop can contribute to the formation of either a productive, transactivated state or an inactive state. In a significant fraction of cells harboring an integrated copy of the HIV-1 model provirus (<italic>LTR-GFP-IRES-Tat</italic>), this bimodal gene expression profile is dynamic, as cells spontaneously and continuously flip between active (Bright) and inactive (Off) expression modes. Furthermore, these switching dynamics may contribute to the establishment and maintenance of proviral latency, because after viral integration long delays in gene expression can occur before viral transactivation. The HIV-1 promoter contains <italic>cis</italic>-acting Sp1 and NF-&#x003ba;B elements that regulate gene expression via the recruitment of both activating and repressing complexes. We hypothesized that interplay in the recruitment of such positive and negative factors could modulate the stability of the Bright and Off modes and thereby alter the sensitivity of viral gene expression to stochastic fluctuations in the Tat feedback loop. Using model lentivirus variants with mutations introduced in the Sp1 and NF-&#x003ba;B elements, we employed flow cytometry, mRNA quantification, pharmacological perturbations, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to reveal significant functional differences in contributions of each site to viral gene regulation. Specifically, the Sp1 sites apparently stabilize both the Bright and the Off states, such that their mutation promotes noisy gene expression and reduction in the regulation of histone acetylation and deacetylation. Furthermore, the NF-&#x003ba;B sites exhibit distinct properties, with &#x003ba;B site I serving a stronger activating role than &#x003ba;B site II. Moreover, Sp1 site III plays a particularly important role in the recruitment of both p300 and RelA to the promoter. Finally, analysis of 362 clonal cell populations infected with the viral variants revealed that mutations in any of the Sp1 sites yield a 6-fold higher frequency of clonal bifurcation compared to that of the wild-type promoter. Thus, each Sp1 and NF-&#x003ba;B site differentially contributes to the regulation of viral gene expression, and Sp1 sites functionally &#x0201c;dampen&#x0201d; transcriptional noise and thereby modulate the frequency and maintenance of this model of viral latency. These results may have biomedical implications for the treatment of HIV latency.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>After HIV genome integration into the host chromosome, the viral promoter coordinates a complex set of inputs to control the establishment of viral latency, the onset of viral gene expression, and the ensuing gene expression levels. Among these inputs are chromatin structure at the site of integration, host transcription factors, and the virally encoded transcriptional regulator Tat. Importantly, transcriptional noise from host and viral transcriptional regulators may play a critical role in the decision between replication versus latency, because stochastic fluctuations in gene expression are amplified by a Tat-mediated positive transcriptional feedback loop. To evaluate the individual contributions of key transcription factor binding elements in gene expression dynamics, we employ model HIV viruses with mutations introduced into numerous promoter elements. Extensive analysis of gene expression dynamics and transcription factor recruitment to the viral promoter reveals that each site differentially contributes to viral gene expression and to the establishment of a low expression state that may contribute to viral latency. This systems-level approach elucidates the synergistic contributions of host and viral factors to the dynamics, magnitudes, and stochastic effects in viral gene expression, as well as provides insights into mechanisms that contribute to proviral latency.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIV-1 can establish rare, latent infections in cells, and the resulting viral reservoirs represent the most significant barrier to elimination of virus from a patient since they persist for decades and can reactivate at any time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000260-Blankson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In particular, stochastic effects most commonly become important in slow chemical reactions or with low concentrations of chemical species, both of which apply early in HIV gene expression when basal expression and Tat concentrations are low.

Therefore, the fraction of cells that expresses GFP at intermediate or Mid fluorescence levels (i.e., the Mid:On ratio, where On is the sum of Mid and Bright regions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000260-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) is a measure of stochastic fluctuations in Tat expression. Mutations that further stabilize the Off or Bright mode would be predicted to result in a lower Mid:On ratio and reduced &#x0201c;flipping&#x0201d; between the two stabilized states. In contrast, mutations that destabilize the Off and Bright modes would yield an increase in the Mid:On ratio, via increasing the rate of flipping between the two &#x0201c;less stable&#x0201d; transcriptional states and thereby creating a noisier promoter. At early times after infection, the Mid:On ratio is high, as the gene expression of infected cells ramps up, but it later settles into an informative steady state value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000260-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Over the three week time course, the Mid:On ratios for each of the Sp1 mutants remain 3- to 4-fold higher than WT. These data indicate that each of the Sp1 sites in the WT promoter may stabilize the Bright and potentially the Off mode, and that a reduction of this stabilization (consistent with the observed decrease in the Bright Mean position, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000260-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) may increase the rates of switching between Off and Bright expression modes. Thus, based on the Mid:On ratio as a metric for stochastic behavior in the Tat-feedback circuit, the Sp1 sites appear to control promoter noise, with potential implications for viral latency.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Mutants suggest distinct roles for the two &#x003ba;B sites</title><p>In parallel experiments to the <italic>LGIT</italic> Sp1 mutants, mutation of each of the two &#x003ba;B sites in the HIV promoter reveals the roles of each site in stabilizing the Bright modes (Bright Mean) as well as dynamic flipping between modes (Mid:On ratio).

The heat map indicates the distribution of GFP fluorescence (y-axis) for each <italic>LGIT</italic> variant and how this distribution changes over time (x-axis). The heat map reflects the GFP fluorescence beyond the autofluorescence threshold, which is set at 2.0 relative fluorescence units (RFU).

WT <italic>LGIT</italic> was stimulated with TNF-&#x003b1; (20 ng/ml, incubated for 30 minutes before crosslinking), and ChIP was performed using p50 and RelA antibodies. Since TNF-&#x003b1; induces nuclear localization of RelA, for the purposes of an approximate calculation, all NF-&#x003ba;B bound to the &#x003ba;B sites of the LTR can be approximated as p50-RelA heterodimer and none as p50-p50 homodimer. With this assumption, and the supposition that stimulation with TNF-&#x003b1; results in the maximum induced levels of p50 and RelA bound to the HIV LTR, we calculated the maximum normalized concentrations of p50 (p50<sub>max</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.86) and RelA (RelA<sub>max</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7.6). The ratio of induced measurements of RelA to p50 (7.6/1.86&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4.1) corresponds to the relative efficiency in RelA and p50 immunoprecipitations. Let the variables <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> be the concentrations of p50-p50 homodimer and p50-RelA heterodimer, respectively. Let <italic>z</italic> be the total concentration of NF-&#x003ba;B, so that <italic>z</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>x</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>y</italic>. Since RelA only exists in the p50-RelA heterodimer form, <italic>y</italic> is equal to be the normalized measurement of RelA from ChIP.
