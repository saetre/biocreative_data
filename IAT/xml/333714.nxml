The maximum distance between the pyrimidine ring and the azido group estimated for the two probes employed in this study is 10-11 A and 18-19 A, respectively. Cross-linking of the uncharged, modified tRNAs has been studied with poly(A, U, G) as a message, under conditions directing uncharged tRNAs preferentially to the ribosomal P-site. Modified tRNAs bind covalently to both ribosomal subunits with high yields upon irradiation of the respective non-covalent complexes. Proteins S7, L33 and L1 have been consistently found cross-linked to tRNAs modified with both probes, and S5 and L5 to tRNA modified with the longer probe. Surprisingly, an S5-tRNA cross-linking product is reproducibly found in a protein fraction prepared from the purified 50S subunit. Cross-linking to rRNAs is significant only for the longer probe and is stimulated 2-4 fold in the presence of poly(A,U,G). The cross-linking sites are located between nucleotides 1302 and 1398 in 16S rRNA and between nucleotides 2281 and 2358 in 23S rRNA.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00240-0112-a" xlink:role="806"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00240-0113-a" xlink:role="807"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00240-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="801"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00240-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="802"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00240-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="803"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00240-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="804"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00240-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="805"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00240-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="806"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00240-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="807"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00240-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="808"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
