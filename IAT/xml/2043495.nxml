The latter cycle is mediated by the Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor GDI, which can selectively extract GDP-bound Rab proteins from donor membranes, and then reload them on target membranes.

Molecules internalized by the clathrin pathway, and by at least some of the other routes, are delivered to early endosomes, where sorting occurs. Some molecules are then recycled back to the plasma membranes, e.g. housekeeping receptors, or transported to the trans-Golgi network, while others, like the downregulated signaling receptors, are transported to late endosomes and then lysosomes for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Gruenberg1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further, many of these &#x0201c;endocytic&#x0201d; kinases also function in various signaling pathways, strengthening the notion that endocytosis and signaling are tightly coupled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Pelkmans1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The small GTPase Rab5 plays a crucial role in the cross talk between endocytic membrane traffic and signaling. This GTPase regulates early endocytic events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Zerial1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, and coordinates entry into the cells by endocytosis and macropinocytosis, in particular via its effector Rabankyrin-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Schnatwinkel1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Like other GTPases, Rab5 cycles between GTP- and GDP-bound states, and, interacts in the active GTP-bound state with its effectors, which mediates Rab5-dependent functions. In addition, GTPases of the Rab family can also cycle between membrane and cytosol via the Guanine nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor (GDI). GDI has the capacity to extract Rab proteins in their inactive GDP-bound state from cellular membranes, and then to deliver them to their appropriate target membranes. We previously found that p38MAPK phosphorylates GDI and thereby increases GDI capacity to capture early endosomal Rab5, which in turn stimulates endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Cavalli1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-SteeleMortimer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, presumably by increasing Rab5 cycling rates. Similarly, long term depression (LTD) triggers p38MAPK activation and leads to AMPA receptor endocytosis, probably by stimulating GDI&#x02236;Rab5 complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Huang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> or by directly activating Rab5 at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Brown1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. p38MAPK activation is also required and sufficient for endocytosis of the &#x000b5;-opioid receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Mace1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Vergarajauregui1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Zwang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, via phosphorylation of the Rab5 effector EEA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Mace1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Zwang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, respectively.

This suggests that a minor fraction only of these proteins formed a presumably transient complex&#x02014;endogenous TXNL1 could not be immunoprecipitated with our antibodies. Importantly, however, after gel filtration of rat liver cytosol, the bulk of endogenous TXNL1 was recovered in high MW fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g001">Fig 1A</xref> fractions 4-5, red symbols), well separated from the position of the TXNL1 monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g001">Fig 1A</xref>, fraction 8-9).

The bulk of p38MAPK eluted at the position of the monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g001">Fig 1A</xref>, fractions 8-9), as expected since p38MAPK is involved in many cellular responses and only a minor fraction of total p38MAPK may be involved in this pathway. In addition, p38MAPK association with the complex may be relatively labile.

We thus tested whether, cytosolic Rab5 (bound to GDI) co-purified after pulldown with WT GST-TXNL1 or with the GST-TXNL1<sup>C34,37S</sup> mutant, which presumably mimics a constitutively oxidized state. Surprisingly, Rab5 co-purified with both WT and mutant forms, but only in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This was not due to artificial cross-linking via <italic>trans</italic> disulfide bridges, since Rab5 mobility was unaffected in non-reducing gels (not shown). Neither were these interactions due to differences in the amounts of GDI pulled down by WT GST-TXNL1 or GST-TXNL1<sup>C34, 37S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g003">Fig 3D</xref>).

This interaction required full-length TXNL1, since neither the catalytic active N-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g001">Fig 1D</xref>) nor the C-domain alone pulled down GDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g003">Fig 3E</xref>). We thus conclude that, while TXNL1 can interact with GDI independently of its redox state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g003">Fig 3D</xref>), peroxide triggers or stabilizes direct or indirect interactions with the GDI&#x02236;Rab5 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

Knockdown of TXNL1 with dicer-generated siRNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g003">Fig 3F</xref>) did not interfere with HRP uptake, except perhaps by causing a small, marginal increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g004">Fig 4A</xref>) in line with the inhibitory effect of reduced TXNL1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Strikingly, overexpression of TXNL1<sup>C34,37S</sup>&#x02014;the catalytically inactive mutant that presumably mimics the oxidized state&#x02014;caused a marked (&#x02248;200&#x00025;) increase in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g004">Fig 4B</xref>), consistently with observations that oxidative conditions accelerate endocytosis and facilitate Rab5 capture by GDI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001144-Cavalli1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> as well as TXNL1 interactions with the GDI&#x02236;Rab5 complex.

Consistently, TXNL1 overexpression did not cause Rab5 release from membranes (not shown), hence did not lead to GDI activation, demonstrating that TXNL1 levels are not limiting. By contrast, overexpression of TXNL1 or TXNL1<sup>C34,37S</sup> did not stimulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the transferrin receptor to any significant extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g004">Fig 4D</xref>)&#x02014;a marginal increase was observed with the TXNL1<sup>C34,37S</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001144-g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These observations suggest that the massive increase in HRP endocytosis after TXNL1<sup>C34,37S</sup> or WT TXNL1 overexpression occurred primarily via a clathrin-independent pathway, presumably macropinocytosis.

Briefly, BHK cells were homogenized in the presence of 10 &#x000b5;g/ml aprotinin, 10 &#x000b5;M leupeptin, 1 &#x000b5;M pepstatin, 1 mM Vanadate and 1 mM &#x000df;-Glycerophosphate. After fractionation by flotation in a sucrose step gradient, 5 &#x000b5;g early endosomes were lysed in 1&#x00025; TX100 and used in the assay.

Briefly, 0.13 mM bovine insulin were mixed with 5 &#x000b5;M recombinant protein in 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 7.0, 2 mM EDTA. The reaction was started by adding 2.5 mM DTT and insulin reduction was monitored by recording the absorbance at 600 nm at RT. The nonenzymatic reduction of insulin by DTT was recorded as a control.
