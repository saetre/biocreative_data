The <italic>SRY </italic>gene, located on Y chromosome, functions as the dominant genetic switch for testis development. The <italic>SRY </italic>gene is specifically expressed in a subpopulation of somatic cells (pre-Sertoli cells) of the developing urogenital ridge for a brief period during gonadal differentiation. Despite this tight spatiotemporal expression pattern, the molecular mechanisms that regulate <italic>SRY </italic>transcription remain poorly understood. <italic>Sry </italic>expression has been shown to be markedly reduced in transgenic mice harboring a mutant GATA4 protein (a member of the GATA family of transcription factors) disrupted in its ability to interact with its transcriptional partner FOG2, suggesting that GATA4 is involved in <italic>SRY </italic>gene transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Although our results show that GATA4 directly targets the pig <italic>SRY </italic>promoter, we did not observe similar action on the mouse and human <italic>SRY </italic>promoters. In the mouse, Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) is an important regulator of both <italic>Sry </italic>and M&#x000fc;llerian inhibiting substance (<italic>Amh/Mis</italic>) expression and in humans, <italic>WT1 </italic>mutations are associated with abnormalities of sex differentiation. GATA4 transcriptionally cooperated with WT1 on the mouse, pig, and human <italic>SRY </italic>promoters. Maximal GATA4/WT1 synergism was dependent on WT1 but not GATA4 binding to their consensus regulatory elements in the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter and required both the zinc finger and C-terminal regions of the GATA4 protein. Although both isoforms of WT1 synergized with GATA4, synergism was stronger with the +KTS rather than the -KTS isoform. WT1/GATA4 synergism was also observed on the <italic>AMH </italic>promoter. In contrast to <italic>SRY</italic>, WT1/GATA4 action on the mouse <italic>Amh </italic>promoter was specific for the -KTS isoform and required both WT1 and GATA4 binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data therefore provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the <italic>SRY </italic>and <italic>AMH </italic>genes in both normal development and certain syndromes of abnormal sex differentiation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In eutherian mammals, the gene responsible for triggering testis development, and hence male sex determination, is <italic>SRY </italic>(<underline>S</underline>ex Determining <underline>R</underline>egion, <underline>Y</underline> chromosome) which encodes a putative transcription factor containing a high mobility group box DNA binding domain. SRY initiates the male pathway by triggering the differentiation of Sertoli cells in the genital ridge, the precursor of the developing gonad. During normal mammalian development, the tightly regulated spatiotemporal expression of <italic>SRY </italic>within the indifferent genital ridges is required for testis determination to proceed. Deregulation of this expression, either via insufficient <italic>SRY </italic>mRNA concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], delayed <italic>SRY </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], expression of different SRY isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and/or the contribution of autosomal loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], can result in partial or complete failure of testis determination and the formation of ovotestes or ovaries within XY individuals. <italic>SRY </italic>expression is now described within the genital ridges of several eutherian mammals (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). In the mouse, <italic>Sry </italic>mRNA is first detected by RT-PCR within the somatic cells of the indifferent genital ridges of male embryos at e10.5, with a peak of expression seen at e11.5 followed by a dramatic extinction of expression by e12.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These results have been confirmed by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Expression of the human <italic>SRY </italic>transcript is first seen within the indifferent male genital ridge beginning at 41 to 44 days post ovulation, corresponding to Carnagie stages 17&#x02013;18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast to the mouse, human <italic>SRY </italic>expression is maintained at low levels within the developing testes for the remainder of gestation, a finding supported by immunohistochemistry results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The genital ridge expression of <italic>SRY </italic>has now been additionally described for the pig, sheep, dog and goat, and collectively reveals the initiation of <italic>SRY </italic>transcription within the indifferent male genital ridge followed by a gradual trailing off of expression more similar to the human model of expression than to the mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Although the essential functional role of SRY has been established for some time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], surprisingly very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate its spatiotemporal expression. The ability of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) and the nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1/SF-1/Ad4BP) to bind and transactivate the human or pig <italic>SRY </italic>promoters has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], suggesting that these factors contribute to the tissue-specific expression profile of SRY. Moreover, more recent data have shown that the SRY-related factor SOX9 can also transactivate the pig <italic>SRY </italic>promoter via a consensus SOX9 binding site about 205 bp upstream of the ATG translational start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. After the <italic>SRY </italic>gene is turned on, testis differentiation ensues; Sertoli cells organize into cord structures that encircle immature germ cells termed gonocytes. At the same time, Leydig cells present in the interstitium of the testicular cords differentiate and begin to secrete testosterone. The next stage of male development is sex differentiation, which takes the form of M&#x000fc;llerian duct (female reproductive tract) regression and Wolffian duct (male reproductive tract) development. These events rely on two hormones produced by the fetal testis: testosterone, secreted by Leydig cells, and M&#x000fc;llerian inhibiting substance (AMH/MIS), produced by Sertoli cells. Absence of AMH in humans causes persistent M&#x000fc;llerian duct syndrome, a form of pseudohermaphroditism characterized by the retention of M&#x000fc;llerian duct structures.</p><p>The genital ridge expression of <italic>AMH </italic>is described in the human (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]), as well as the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], pig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. <italic>AMH </italic>expression is restricted to the pre-Sertoli cells of the male genital ridge, always after the initiation of <italic>SRY </italic>expression and commitant to the time of histological testis cord formation. Once <italic>AMH </italic>expression is initiated it continues to be expressed at high levels for the duration of the gestational period. The transcriptional regulation of the <italic>AMH </italic>gene has been studied in detail. Interestingly, several transcription factors involved in primary sex determination (SF-1, WT1, SOX9 and GATA4) are also recruited as important regulators of <italic>AMH </italic>transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Much like <italic>SRY</italic>, however, our understanding of how these factors work together to direct the sex-specific expression of the <italic>AMH </italic>gene remains incomplete.</p><p>A common regulatory factor important for transcription of the <italic>SRY </italic>and <italic>AMH </italic>genes is WT1. WT1 is a zinc finger transcription factor having both DNA and RNA binding properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. There are at least 24 different WT1 isoforms due to alternative transcription start sites, RNA editing, and 2 alternative splicing sites. The first alternative splicing site inserts or removes exon 5, which encodes a 17 amino acid segment upstream of the zinc fingers. The second alternative splicing site, at the end of exon 9, inserts or removes three amino acids (KTS) between zinc fingers 3 and 4. Previous studies have shown that WT1 isoforms with or without the KTS tripeptide have distinct biological functions, whereas the alternative splicing site exon 5 has a modulatory role on WT1 function. Although WT1 was first identified as a tumor-suppressant gene of Wilms' tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], subsequent studies revealed that WT1 is also essential for embryonic development, especially the kidney and gonads (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). In humans, <italic>WT1 </italic>gene mutations are responsible for two urogenital diseases: Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) and Frasier syndrome. DDS is caused by exonic point mutations in the <italic>WT1 </italic>gene, and is characterized by mesangial sclerosis with early kidney failure, high risk of Wilms' tumor, and varying degrees of gonadal dysgenesis associated with insufficient AMH production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. On the other hand, Frasier syndrome, characterized by focal segmental sclerosis, delayed kidney failure and XY gonadal sex reversal, is associated with heterozygous point mutations in intron 9 that cause a shift in the ratio of WT1 isoforms (+/-KTS) towards the -KTS forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The importance of WT1 during gonad development has also be demonstrated by <italic>Wt1</italic>-null mice, which lack kidneys, gonads, and adrenals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Moreover, mice lacking the WT1(+KTS) splice variant show complete XY sex reversal and a dramatic reduction in <italic>Sry </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Consistent with a role in <italic>SRY </italic>and <italic>AMH </italic>transcription, in vitro studies have shown that WT1(-KTS) can bind and activate the respective gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, since WT1 starts to be expressed in the developing gonadal primordium of the mouse (e9.5&#x02013;e10.5) somewhat before the <italic>Sry </italic>and <italic>Amh </italic>genes are actually first turned on (e10.5&#x02013;e12.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and since WT1 is present in several organs where SRY and AMH are not, other factors must cooperate with WT1. Due to its overlapping expression pattern with WT1 in the developing urogenital system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], GATA4 is an interesting candidate.</p><p>GATA4 is a member of the GATA family of zinc-finger transcription factors that recognize the consensus nucleotide sequence WGATAR (called the GATA motif) in the promoter region of target genes. In the mouse, GATA4 is strongly expressed in the somatic cell population of the developing gonad prior to and during the time of sex determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This expression pattern coincides with the <italic>SRY </italic>and <italic>AMH </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], suggesting that GATA4 plays a predominant role in their expression. This hypothesis is supported by <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments, where mice carrying a GATA4 mutation that disrupts its ability to interact with its transcriptional partner FOG2, display abnormal testis development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. On a molecular level, this is apparently due to a significant reduction in <italic>Sry </italic>transcription and a block in <italic>Sox9 </italic>and <italic>Amh </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Thus GATA4, much like WT1, appears to play a predominant role in both primary sex determination and sex differentiation via <italic>SRY </italic>and <italic>AMH </italic>gene regulation. However, since GATA4 is rather broadly expressed, and more specifically, is found in tissues that do not express either <italic>SRY </italic>or <italic>AMH</italic>, it too cannot account by itself for the tight spatiotemporal expression of these genes. Interestingly, the developing gonad is a location where GATA4 and WT1 co-localize with both SRY and AMH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In this study, we provide the first molecular evidence that a physical and functional cooperation between WT1 and GATA4 contributes to the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>SRY </italic>and <italic>AMH </italic>gene promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Species-specific regulation of SRY promoter activity by GATA4</title><p>There are multiple consensus GATA regulatory motifs within the first 2 kilobases of 5' flanking sequences of the mouse, pig, and human <italic>SRY </italic>genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Although numerous GATA binding sites are present in the different <italic>SRY </italic>promoters, they are not necessarily species conserved which is to be expected as <italic>SRY </italic>5' flanking sequences are generally poorly conserved between mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, we tested the ability of GATA4, at varying doses, to transactivate the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter from these three species by transient transfection assays in the heterologous HeLa epithelial cell line. HeLa cells do not express GATA4 making it a convenient cell line model for promoter regulation studies involving this factor. Of the three species tested, the pig <italic>SRY </italic>promoter was the most responsive to GATA4 with an activation of about 3-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, middle panel). This was followed by the mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter which was activated by 2-fold in the presence of GATA4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, left panel). This 2-fold activation approached significance but was not significant (P &#x0003e; 0.05). Interestingly, the human <italic>SRY </italic>promoter was not activated by GATA4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, right panel), and this despite the presence of multiple consensus GATA binding motifs and the fact that GATA4 could be strongly overexpressed in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Similar results were obtained in other heterologous cell lines such as CV-1 fibroblasts (data not shown). The absence or relatively weak ability of GATA4 to activate the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter suggested that the factor might not bind to <italic>SRY </italic>GATA motifs with high affinity. However, EMSA analysis revealed the contrary. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, GATA4 was able to strongly bind to all four GATA motifs of the proximal pig <italic>SRY </italic>promoter. Similar results were obtained with the GATA binding elements of the mouse and human <italic>SRY </italic>promoters (data not shown). Thus, the mechanism of GATA4 in <italic>SRY </italic>gene regulation is unlikely one of direct transcriptional activation by GATA4 alone.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Transcriptional properties of GATA4 on the mouse, pig, and human <italic>SRY </italic>promoters</bold>.

An EMSA was performed with recombinant GATA4 protein and a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the first consensus GATA motif (GATA site 1) of the pig <italic>SRY </italic>promoter. Competition with an oligonucleotide containing a mutated GATA motif (GATA to GGTA) was used to confirm the specificity of GATA4 binding (GATA<sub>mut </sub>site 1).

The sequences of the putative WT1 binding sites are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>. The TCC repeat elements common to the mouse, pig, and human <italic>SRY </italic>sequences have been shown to be recognized by both the -KTS and +KTS isoforms of WT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The only exception is the human WT1 binding site 1 (5'-GAGGGGGTG-3') which appears to be preferentially recognized by WT1(-KTS) and not WT1(+KTS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The WT1 isoforms, much like GATA4, were capable of activating the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter on their own; the magnitude of the activations, however, was greater than GATA4 being on the order of 10&#x02013;20 fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, open bars). Since the WT1 and GATA binding elements lie in close proximity to one another, we tested whether GATA4 could transcriptionally cooperate with WT1 on the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter by performing co-transfection experiments in heterologous HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, black bars). The three species-specific <italic>SRY </italic>promoter constructs used in the co-transfection experiments contained both WT1 binding sites and 4 or more consensus GATA elements. On the mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter, both WT1 isoforms strongly synergized with GATA4 with activations reaching 30-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, left panel). Interestingly, the level of GATA4/WT1 synergism was higher with WT1(+KTS) than with WT1(-KTS). Similar results were also observed on the pig <italic>SRY </italic>promoter where activations reached nearly 50-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, middle panel), as well as in other cell lines such as TM4 mouse Sertoli cells (data not shown). In contrast to the mouse and pig, the human <italic>SRY </italic>promoter was strongly activated by WT1(-KTS) alone and synergism with GATA4 only occurred with the WT1(+KTS) isoform (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, right panel). Western blot analysis confirmed the heterologous nature of HeLa cells since they are null for both GATA4 and WT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). It also showed that the GATA4/WT1 synergism was not due to variable expression of either GATA4 or the WT1 isoforms since all proteins (whether expressed individually or in combination) were present at similar levels when overexpressed in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>GATA4 and WT1 transcriptionally cooperate to activate the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter</bold>.

Interestingly, the -340 bp <italic>Sry </italic>promoter construct (containing an intact proximal WT1 site and no consensus GATA sites) was synergistically activated by GATA4 and WT1 to the same extent as the full-length (-1090 bp) <italic>Sry </italic>construct. This suggests that GATA4 binding to its consensus sites on the <italic>Sry </italic>promoter is dispensable for maximal synergism with WT1. Deletion or mutation of the proximal WT1 site, however, abolished the activation by WT1 alone and markedly decreased the synergism between GATA4 and WT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Thus, in contrast to GATA4, binding of WT1 to its consensus element is critical for GATA4/WT1 synergism on the mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter. Interestingly, GATA4/WT1 synergism was not completely abrogated with the WT1 mutant constructs. The remaining synergism is likely due to two low affinity (not perfect consensus) GATA binding motifs present within the -340 to -70 bp sequence since a further deletion to -40 bp eliminated all WT1/GATA4 synergism (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These two GATA motifs, named sites A (GTATCT) and B (GTATCT), are unique to the mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter sequence. Although these sites only weakly bind GATA4 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), they are nonetheless functional as revealed by transfection assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The remaining GATA4/WT1 synergism observed on the -340 bp <italic>Sry </italic>construct harboring the WT1 site mutation (-340 bp WT1 mut.) was abolished when a truncated wild-type GATA4 protein (aa 201&#x02013;440) was substituted with two GATA4 mutants (C294A or &#x00394;T279) that we have previously shown to be unable to bind to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Thus, GATA4 binding to these two low affinity GATA motifs likely contributes to the observed GATA4/WT1 synergism on the mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter. We still cannot rule out the possibility, however, of additional unknown regulatory elements (present between -340 and -70 bp) that might be indirectly activated by GATA4/WT1 overexpression in our heterologous HeLa cell line model.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter requires an intact proximal WT1 binding site for full transcriptional synergism by GATA4 and WT1</bold>.

Thus, these results demonstrate that the proximal WT1 site (site 1) is efficiently bound by both WT1 isoforms. The functional importance of the proximal WT1 binding site was confirmed using homologous (WT1 and GATA4-expressing) PGR 9E11 cells, a pig genital ridge cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

The essential nature of this interaction is all the more evident given that GATA4 binding to its consensus motifs is not required for maximal synergism with WT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To map the domains of the GATA4 protein that interact with WT1 and are important for synergism on the <italic>Sry </italic>promoter, a series of truncated GATA4 proteins were constructed as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>. The GATA4 protein contains two independent activation domains that flank its DNA-binding domain. Deletion of the N-terminal region (aa 1&#x02013;200) had no significant effect on the transcriptional synergism between GATA4 and WT1(+KTS) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). However, GATA4/WT1 synergism was lost using proteins consisting solely of the N-terminal region (aa 1&#x02013;133), zinc finger region (aa 201&#x02013;322) or C-terminal domain (aa 302&#x02013;440). Thus, the zinc finger and C-terminal domains of the GATA4 protein are both required for its ability to transcriptionally cooperate with WT1. Next, the domain of the GATA4 protein involved in the direct physical interaction with WT1 was mapped using in vitro pull-down assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Consistent with the transcription data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), the WT1 protein (- or +KTS) could physically interact with the intact (wild-type) GATA4 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, far left panel) but not with mutant GATA4 proteins that removed the zinc fingers or C-terminal portions of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> rightmost panels). Thus, the zinc finger and C-terminal domains of GATA4 are also essential for the physical interaction with WT1. The ability of GATA4 to interact with WT1 in the absence of DNA-binding was further confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>The zinc finger domains and C-terminal region of the GATA4 protein are required for the transcriptional cooperation and direct interaction with WT1</bold>.

Another obvious target in the sex determination/sex differentiation pathway is the <italic>AMH </italic>gene since its proximal promoter region contains species-conserved binding elements for both GATA4 and WT1 [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Both factors are known regulators of <italic>AMH </italic>transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], which is mediated through their direct association with the proximal <italic>AMH </italic>promoter as shown by ChIP (ref.

To better define the role of GATA4 as a transcriptional partner for WT1 in the cell-specific and developmental regulation of the <italic>AMH </italic>gene, we tested whether GATA4 and WT1 could synergistically activate the <italic>AMH </italic>promoter. In our co-transfection experiments, we used the mouse -180 bp A<italic>mh </italic>promoter which contains the GATA and WT1 binding sites in their normal context, as well a series of synthetic constructs containing either GATA and/or WT1 elements placed upstream of the minimal <italic>Amh </italic>promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Although crucial for <italic>Amh </italic>transcription <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], GATA4 by itself is a poor activator of the <italic>Amh </italic>promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). While WT1 alone weakly activated the <italic>Amh </italic>promoter, and in contrast to the <italic>Sry </italic>promoter, only the -KTS isoform was transcriptionally active. In the presence of both proteins, however, a strong synergistic activation was observed not only on the native -180 bp <italic>Amh </italic>promoter but also a synthetic reporter consisting of two consensus GATA motifs placed upstream of the minimal (-65 bp) <italic>Amh </italic>promoter containing an intact WT1 binding element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).

Similarly, no GATA4/WT1 synergism was observed on a construct containing an intact WT1 binding site but deleted of the GATA motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>).

This lack of synergism was not related to the stability or expression level of the mutant protein (data not shown). Rather, the lack of synergism is most likely attributable to a decrease in DNA binding affinity of the mutant WT1 protein for its binding element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. This result therefore supports our previous observation that GATA4/WT1 synergism on the <italic>AMH </italic>promoter absolutely requires binding of both factors to their respective regulatory elements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

Although its critical developmental function has been established for more than 15 years now [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the molecular mechanisms that regulate its tight spatiotemporal expression in the developing genital ridge have remained elusive. Although a number of transcriptional regulators including SF-1, SOX9 and WT1 have been proposed to participate in <italic>SRY </italic>gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], the sum of these factors still do not explain its highly restricted expression pattern. We report here, a novel transcriptional cooperation between WT1 and the GATA4 transcription factor. This important cooperation not only markedly enhances transcription from the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter but also targets the promoter of the <italic>AMH </italic>gene involved in male sex differentiation. Thus, our data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control the tissue- and developmental-specific expression of these two critical genes and identify GATA4 as a potential causative factor in cases of abnormal human sex development such as Frasier syndrome (XY male-to-female sex reversal with intact <italic>SRY </italic>gene) and DDS syndrome (incomplete sex differentiation associated with reduced AMH levels).</p><p>In the mouse, GATA4 is strongly expressed in the somatic cell population of the developing gonad prior to and during the time of <italic>Sry </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]; GATA4 is also detected in Sertoli cells of the early fetal testis in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Moreover, more recent knockout data in the mouse revealed that a functional GATA4 protein is required for <italic>Sry </italic>expression and hence normal testis cord formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], suggesting that GATA4 is essential for either the onset or up-regulation of <italic>Sry </italic>transcription in the developing male genital ridge. Although the <italic>SRY </italic>promoters from mouse, pig and human all contain multiple consensus GATA regulatory motifs, only the mouse and especially the pig <italic>SRY </italic>5' flanking sequences were activated by GATA4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This was not surprising knowing that while SRY function is highly conserved across all mammalian species, <italic>SRY </italic>promoter regulatory sequences are not. Thus, it is entirely conceivable that GATA4 might directly regulate <italic>SRY </italic>transcription in some mammalian species (such as the pig and mouse) but not others (such as the human). For these other species, GATA4 likely contributes to <italic>SRY </italic>transcription through interactions with other transcriptional regulators. Due to its implication in many clinical cases of abnormal human sex development, an interesting candidate for this GATA4-interacting factor is WT1. Indeed, a previous study using transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the <italic>Sry </italic>promoter has shown that <italic>Sry </italic>is expressed only in somatic cells of the mouse genital ridge that also co-express GATA4 and WT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Consistent with its role in <italic>SRY </italic>gene regulation, WT1 has been reported to activate the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Much like GATA4, however, it alone cannot account for the highly restricted <italic>SRY </italic>expression pattern since WT1 is found in tissues where SRY is not. Given the co-localization of GATA4 and WT1 in the genital ridge, we surmised that both factors might cooperate to regulate the <italic>SRY </italic>gene. Indeed, GATA4 strongly synergized with WT1 to activate the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter of all three species tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Thus, we propose that <italic>SRY </italic>expression is controlled by a GATA4/WT1 transcriptional cooperation rather than by the action of GATA4 or WT1 alone. Although this mechanism helps us to better understand the proper spatiotemporal expression of the <italic>SRY </italic>gene, other factors must also participate. This includes SOX9, SF-1, and especially FOG2. <italic>Fog2</italic>-null mice have disrupted testicular development and markedly reduced <italic>Sry </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. FOG2 was originally cloned as a cofactor for GATA4 and this interaction is essential for normal testis differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Although most in vitro studies point to FOG2 acting as a co-repressor for GATA4 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], whether this is actually the case in vivo remains to be shown.</p><p>Our results provide strong evidence that both the WT1(-KTS) and WT1(+KTS) isoforms act as transcriptional activators of the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter. It is generally accepted, however, that WT1(-KTS) functions as a transcriptional regulator whereas WT1(+KTS) plays a role in other cellular processes, such as RNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Indeed, to date, only a few genes have been identified as potential transcriptional targets of WT1(+KTS). For example, transactivation of the <italic>CDH1 </italic>(cadherin 1/E-cadherin) gene, which encodes a calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein, is enhanced by WT1 (+KTS) through GC-rich and CAAT box sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Moreover, WT1(+KTS) can activate the promoter of the human <italic>MYC </italic>(<italic>C-MYC</italic>) gene via two WT1 binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. We found that the mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter contains two possible WT1 binding sites, a distal site at -940 bp (5'-GGAGGA-3') and a proximal one at -50 bp (5'-GGAGGAGGGA-3') upstream of the transcription start site. Their sequences are antisense to a TCC-repeat element which has been identified as a binding motif for both WT1(-KTS) and WT1(+KTS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Indeed, our results showed that WT1(+KTS) binds to the proximal site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and activates mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter activity alone and in association with GATA4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Thus taken together, although the target genes of WT1(+KTS) are limited in comparison to WT1(-KTS), WT1(+KTS) nonetheless appears to be an important transcriptional regulator of the <italic>SRY </italic>gene. This is not surprising given that the best known human <italic>WT1 </italic>mutation associated with sex reversal (Frasier syndrome) produces a shift in the WT1 +/-KTS ratio that favors the -KTS isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the level of GATA4/WT1 synergism on the <italic>SRY </italic>promoter was much stronger when the WT1(+KTS) isoform was used. Importantly, this observation might improve our understanding of <italic>Sry </italic>regulation in mutant mice as reported by Hammes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. They showed that mutant mice that express only WT1(-KTS) or WT1(+KTS) have distinct functions in sex determination and gonad development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The mouse mutant lacking the WT1(+KTS) isoform exhibited a reduction in <italic>Sry </italic>expression (less than 25% of wild-type) leading to a block in testis development. In contrast, the mouse mutant lacking WT1(-KTS) still showed modest expression of male specific genes (<italic>Sox9 </italic>and <italic>Amh</italic>) downstream of <italic>Sry</italic>, suggesting that WT1(+KTS), and not WT1(-KTS) is essential for <italic>Sry </italic>expression and consequently normal testis development. We show here that the level of GATA4/WT1(+KTS) synergism on the mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter was more than twice that of GATA4/WT1(-KTS). Thus, our findings suggest that the reduction in <italic>Sry </italic>expression seen in the mouse lacking WT1(+KTS) might be the result of a lack of appropriate GATA4/WT1(+KTS) synergism and hence, insufficient activation of the <italic>Sry </italic>promoter. The importance of WT1 in male sex determination has also been well-documented in the human since several diseases have been shown to be associated with <italic>WT1 </italic>mutations, such as DDS and Frasier syndrome. Male-to-female sex reversal seen in patients with Frasier syndrome is caused by heterozygous mutations in exon 9 of <italic>WT1</italic>, which as previously mentioned, results in reduced levels of the WT1(+KTS) isoform and an concomitant increase in WT1(-KTS). Thus, WT1(+KTS) is believed to be critical for testis determination in the human as in the mouse. Contrary to these in vivo data, however, previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], as well as our present in vitro studies show that the human <italic>SRY </italic>promoter to be comparatively less responsive to WT1(+KTS) than WT1(-KTS). Despite this observation, we found that GATA4 enhances WT1(+KTS) action on the human <italic>SRY </italic>promoter; an effect that was not observed with the WT1(-KTS) isoform (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), suggesting that WT1(+KTS) also likely contributes to human <italic>SRY </italic>transcription in cooperation with GATA4.</p><p>In the mouse, immediately after sex determination (testis differentiation), male sex differentiation ensues with the onset of <italic>Amh </italic>expression by the newly differentiated Sertoli cells. To date, four transcription factors, all acting within the first 180 bp of 5' flanking sequences, have been proposed to be involved in the sex-specific regulation of the <italic>Amh </italic>gene: SF-1, WT1, SOX9, and GATA4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Based on several in vitro and in vivo studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], up-regulation of <italic>Amh </italic>gene expression in the fetal testis appears to require the presence of both SF-1 and WT1. Moreover, it has been reported that SOX9 binding to its specific response element is essential for the initiation of <italic>Amh </italic>transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Studies from our group and others have also shown GATA4 to be an important player in <italic>AMH </italic>gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. We now show that the WT1-dependent regulation of the <italic>Amh </italic>promoter, much like the <italic>Sry </italic>promoter, is markedly enhanced by GATA4. An important difference, however, was the promoter-specific response to the WT1 isoforms. Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], WT1(-KTS) was the transcriptionally active isoform on the <italic>Amh </italic>promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and data not shown). Thus, WT1(+KTS) and WT1(-KTS) appear to have different actions on the <italic>SRY </italic>and <italic>AMH </italic>promoters as has been described for other WT1 target genes involved in the sex determination pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our data not only provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the <italic>SRY </italic>and <italic>MIS </italic>genes but also highlight the importance of GATA4 a key regulator of gonadal development by acting a two levels in the mammalian sex determination and differentiation cascade.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The mouse, pig and human <italic>SRY </italic>promoters were amplified by PCR using the corresponding species-specific genomic DNA as template and the following pairs of primers: mouse (forward: 5'-CGGGATCCGCTGTATTGTCAATAAAACAG-3', reverse: 5'-GGGGTACCGACAATTGTCACCAGTCCC-3'); pig (forward: 5'-CGGGATCCTTTGAGTTCCAAGG-3', reverse: 5'-GGGGTACCGAAAAGGGGGAGGAAGCG-3'); human (forward: 5'-CGGGATCCAATTCATATAGCTTTTTGTGTCC-3', reverse: 5'-GGGGTACCTCAACACCCCCTCAAC-3'). The different promoters fragments were subsequently cloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI/<italic>Kpn</italic>I site of a modified luciferase expression vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Deletion constructs for the mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter were generated by PCR using the following pairs of primers: -820 bp (forward: 5'-CGGGATCCGCCGTAGTAGACTATGATAC-3', reverse: 5'-GGGGTACCGACAATTGTCACCAGTCCC-3'); -340 bp (forward: 5'-CGGGATCCCTTTCCACTACTTTTGCA-3', reverse: 5'-GGGGTACCGACAATTGTCACCAGTCCC-3'); -40 bp (forward: 5'-CGGGATCCTTACACACGTTAAATATTAAAATC-3', reverse: 5'-GGGGTACCGACAATTGTCACCAGTCCC-3'). Promoter fragments were then cloned into the luciferase reporter as described above. The -340 mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter construct with a specific deletion of the WT1 response element (&#x00394;WT1) was achieved by cloning a -340 to -70 bp <italic>Sry </italic>promoter fragment, obtained by PCR (forward primer: 5'-CGGGATCCCTTTCCACTACTTTTGCA-3', reverse primer: 5'-GAAGATCTCTAGTCCAGCCCAACTAATC-3'), in front of the minimal mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter construct. A -340 bp mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter construct harboring a mutation that inactivates the WT1 element (GGAGGAGGGA to GGTGTTGGGT) was generated using the QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacture's recommendations along with the following oligonucleotides &#x02013; sense: 5'-GACTAGGGAGGTCCTGAAGGTGTTGGGTTAAATATTTTCTTACAC-3'; antisense: 5'-GTGTAAGAAAATATTTAACCCAACACCTTCAGGACCTCCCTAGTC-3'. The natural and synthetic murine <italic>Amh</italic>-luciferase promoter constructs have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

The human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell line was maintained in 1:1 DMEM/Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were transfected in 24-well culture plates using the calcium phosphate precipitation method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. PGR 9E11 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada). In brief, 2.5 &#x003bc;g of <italic>SRY </italic>promoter-luciferase reporters were transfected with 2.5 &#x003bc;l of LipofectAMINE reagent per well in serum- and antibiotic-free media. A renilla (phRL-TK) luciferase plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as an internal control. Complete medium was added 5 h after transfection. The next day, the cells were harvested and analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system from Promega. The data reported represent the averages of at least three experiments, each done in duplicate.

Recombinant GATA4 protein was also used to assess the affinity of GATA4 binding to two non-consensus GATA motifs (named sites A and B) in the proximal mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter. For this specific experiment, the consensus GATA element of the proximal murine <italic>Star </italic>promoter (sense: 5'-GATCCACTTTTTTATCTCAAGTGA-3'; antisense: 5'-GATCTCACTTGAGATAAAAAAGTG-3') was used as labeled probe. Competition using oligos corresponding to sites A (sense: 5'-GTTCTTTGTATCTTAATACT-3'; antisense: 5'-AGTATTAAGATACAAAGAAC-3') and B (sense: 5'-CTTGACAGTATCTAGGTTCA-3'; antisense: 5'-TGAACCTAGATACTGTCAAG-3') was used to assess the affinity of GATA4 binding to these two sites. A similar approach was used to demonstrate WT1 binding to the proximal WT1 element in the mouse <italic>Sry </italic>promoter. In vitro translated WT1(-KTS) and WT1(+KTS) proteins were prepared using the TNT system (Promega).

The lysed cells were sonicated on ice using a BRANSON 450 Sonicator for 5 cycles of 30-sec pulses at 3.5 output control and 80% duty cycle in order to obtain DNA fragments between 200 bp and 1000 bp in size.
