Robustness of the cytoplasmic membrane is required for it to function as a barrier between the inside of the cell and the environment. Bacteria have therefore evolved a number of systems to maintain membrane integrity, one of which is the phage shock protein (Psp) response, highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Psp genes are organized in a regulon (<italic>pspF pspABCDE</italic> and <italic>pspG</italic>) that is under the control of a sigma54-dependent promoter activated by PspF, positively controlled by PspBC and negatively regulated by PspA (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Model <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Darwin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Wigneshweraraj <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Psp expression is induced upon inner membrane (IM) stress which dissipates the proton motive force (pmf) (potentially resulting in a reduced energy status of the cell). Psp effector proteins (e.g. PspA &#x02013; effector upon stress, PspD and PspG) subsequently help to conserve pmf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kleerebezem <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Understanding the mechanism of Psp induction and its biological function is important since the Psp system is significant in protein translocation and in the growth and virulence of pathogenic enterobacteria (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Darwin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Rowley <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The PspA homologue Vipp1 has been shown to be essential in plants and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> for thylakoid biogenesis and hence photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Westphal <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Further, PspA homologues have been reported in Gram-positive bacteria and archea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bidle <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Vrancken <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). PspA therefore appears to have a fundamental role in the three domains of life.</p><p>The nature of the stress signal and how it is detected by the Psp system remains unknown (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Darwin, 2005</xref>). Previously we observed that ArcB (the sensor kinase of the two-component ArcAB system) is required for full protein IV (pIV)-dependent <italic>psp</italic> expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> and proposed that <italic>psp</italic>-inducing stresses that dissipate pmf may activate ArcB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The ArcAB system regulates the transition from aerobic to anaerobic respiration and fermentation (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Malpica <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) where ArcB has been shown to sense the redox state of the cell through changes in the ubiquinone : ubiquinol (UQ : UQH<sub>2</sub>) ratio (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Georgellis <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Malpica <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Increased levels of UQH<sub>2</sub> attenuate inhibition on ArcB kinase activity imposed by UQ, thus enabling ArcB to phosphorylate ArcA (the response regulator). Phosphorylated ArcA (ArcA-P) then represses genes involved in aerobic respiration and upregulates genes involved in anaerobic respiration and fermentation. Notably, the ArcAB system is also known to be of particular importance under microaerobic growth conditions, where oxygen is limiting rather than being completely absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alexeeva <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Activation of ArcAB is required for robustness of pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression.

Regulation of the ArcAB system. ArcB is an IM-localized dimer. Its kinase activity is diminished by UQ and elevated in the presence of UQH<sub>2</sub> leading to reduction of the ArcB Cys180 and Cys241 thiol groups (in this article functionally equivalent to ArcB* form) in PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain and an increased interaction between the two ArcB TM domains. (PAS domains are signalling domains and they function as input modules in proteins that sense oxygen, redox potential, light and several other stimuli.) Reduction of ArcB is followed by autophosphorylation of H292 (H1) and phosphorelay via D576 (D1) and H717 (H2) to residue D54 (D2) within the response regulator ArcA. C. Bipartite role of ArcB activation in pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression. Induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression in &#x00394;<italic>arcB</italic> (MVA63), &#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic> (MVA79) and a double mutant &#x00394;<italic>arcAB</italic> (MVA94) strains expressing ArcB<sub>WT</sub>, ArcA<sub>WT</sub> and their mutants was measured using &#x003b2;-Gal assays under microaerobic conditions in the absence or presence of pIV.

We therefore explored further the relationship(s) between the Psp and Arc system under different growth conditions and now report that involvement of Arc is conditional, consistent with both observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Seo <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). We find that ArcAB is required to propagate pIV-dependent induction of the Psp response under microaerobic, but not under aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions. The Arc system appears to be important for Psp-signal amplification, via the ArcB&#x02013;ArcA phosphorelay. In addition, activated ArcB is by itself observed to elevate <italic>psp</italic> expression. Further, we have identified a direct binding interaction between ArcB and PspB that supports part of a Psp-specific signal transduction pathway used under microaerobic growth conditions. Notably in anaerobiosis, pIV-dependent <italic>psp</italic> expression is largely independent of PspBC (two positive regulators of the Psp response) and ArcAB, suggesting either that the repressive PspA&#x02013;PspF complex is itself capable of recognizing inducing signals, or that PspBC and ArcAB are substituted by other gene products.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression under different growth conditions</title><p>We measured pIV-dependent <italic>psp</italic> induction in strains with different complements of <italic>arc</italic> and <italic>psp</italic> genes grown under aerobic, microaerobic and anaerobic conditions (see <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>) where the ArcAB proteins are known to have differing importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). We found that <italic>psp</italic> induction is dependent on ArcAB only in microaerobiosis and on PspBC (positive regulators) in microaerobiosis and aerobiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). In aerobiosis, a requirement for the ArcAB system is not apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Under anaerobic growth, full pIV-dependent <italic>psp</italic> induction is largely independent of PspBC and the Arc system, when compared with microaerobiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). These differing dependencies on Arc are consistent with the ArcAB system functioning as a microaerobic redox regulator, required under microaerobic but not aerobic or anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alexeeva <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Notably, under microaerobic growth conditions, the requirement for ArcB is more pronounced then for ArcA. Importantly, control reactions demonstrate that the different growth conditions <italic>per se</italic> do not affect the activity from the <italic>psp</italic> promoter since <italic>psp</italic> expression in &#x00394;<italic>pspA</italic> cells is similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Further since the level of <italic>psp</italic> expression in control strains &#x00394;<italic>pspA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>arcB</italic>&#x003c6;(<italic>pspA&#x02013;lacZ</italic>) and &#x00394;<italic>pspA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic>&#x003c6;(<italic>pspA&#x02013;lacZ</italic>) are unaffected by ArcB and ArcA, we infer that the Arc proteins may contribute to relieving PspA-negative regulation in microaerobiosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). In <italic>psp</italic> induction assays we used the outer membrane (OM) secretin, pIV, to induce <italic>pspA&#x02013;lacZ</italic> expression. It is believed that pIV mislocalizes to the IM thereby impairing cell membrane integrity and resulting in a <italic>psp</italic>-inducing stress signal similar to that caused by PulD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Guilvout <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). To ascertain that the strains assayed were exposed to equivalent (pIV-induced) levels of &#x02018;stress&#x02019;, we tested pIV expression and determined the amount of pIV localized within the IM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, pIV expression did not change greatly in the different backgrounds tested or when the cells were grown under differing aeration. Additionally, the distribution of pIV between the IM and OM was similar in microaerobiosis in the wild-type (WT), <italic>arcA</italic>, <italic>arcB</italic> and <italic>pspBC</italic> deletion backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression under different growth conditions. pIV secretin (from pGJ4) induced <italic>psp</italic> expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>[MG1655 &#x003c6;(<italic>pspA&#x02013;lacZ</italic>); MVA44] cells grown under aerobic, microaerobic or anaerobic conditions as measured using a &#x003b2;-Gal assay (see <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>).

The results show that pIV changes oxygen consumption in an ArcB-dependent manner and that among the global regulators, the Arc system has the greatest effect on <italic>psp</italic> expression, supporting the idea of specific cross-talk between the Psp and ArcAB systems. Taken together, these results indicate a growth condition-specific requirement for ArcAB and PspBC proteins in <italic>psp</italic> induction. In addition, since under anaerobiosis induction of <italic>psp</italic> is independent of the PspBC-positive regulators we suggest that the PspA&#x02013;F regulatory complex may itself be capable of perceiving a pIV-dependent inducing signal. Importantly, all subsequent experiments reported here were conducted under the microaerobic conditions where the roles of PspBC and ArcAB were most prominent.</p></sec><sec><title>Activation of ArcA facilitates pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression</title><p>To further assess the roles of ArcAB in pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression in microaerobiosis, we constructed mutants of ArcB (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and ArcA that: (i) had a constitutively active kinase: ArcB<sub>C180A/C241A</sub> (termed ArcB*), (ii) disrupted the phosphorelay from ArcB to ArcA: ArcB<sub>H292A</sub>, ArcB<sub>H717A</sub>, ArcB*<sub>H292A</sub> and ArcB*<sub>H717A</sub>, and (iii) inactivated ArcA (by disrupting phosphorylation and preventing binding to target promoters): <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mmi0074-0016-mu1.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). Initially we determined that WT and mutant forms of ArcB proteins were similarly expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2Ai</xref> and data not shown) and appropriately localized within the IM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2Aii</xref> and data not shown). As a further measure of functionality, we showed that the WT and certain mutant ArcB and ArcA proteins (only those with intact phosphorelay systems) were able to activate ArcA-P-dependent <italic>pfl</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). We then assayed the ability of Arc mutants to complement &#x00394;<italic>arcB</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic> mutations and support pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>, ArcB<sub>WT</sub> and ArcB* or ArcA<sub>WT</sub> fully complemented &#x00394;<italic>arcB</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic> mutations, respectively, for pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression. None of the phosphorelay mutants in ArcB or the inactive ArcA variant fully supported pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), indicating that ArcA-P has a role in promoting pIV-dependent induction. Importantly, control reactions demonstrated that similar levels of pIV secretin were present in all the samples tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref> and data not shown). Overexpression of ArcB proteins in a &#x00394;<italic>arcAB</italic> strain showed that in the absence of ArcA<sub>WT</sub>, the ArcB<sub>WT</sub> and ArcB* similarly to ArcB* phosphorelay mutants cannot fully support pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression (compared with results obtained with a &#x00394;<italic>arcB</italic>) and that ArcB* and its phosphorelay mutants promote an ArcA- and pIV-independent low-level induction of <italic>psp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). These data indicate that ArcB has an activity with respect to Psp that is partially ArcA-independent.

Conditional use of ArcAB can explain results in which involvement of Arc in <italic>psp</italic> induction was not evident under aerobic growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Seo <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that in anaerobiosis, the more reducing environment in the cytoplasm will decrease the <italic>psp</italic>-inducing signal threshold resulting in increasingly Arc-independent pIV-dependent <italic>psp</italic> expression, consistent with the cellular redox state (as defined by the NADH/NAD ratio) favouring a reducing environment in anaerobiosis versus an oxidizing environment in aerobiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">de Graef <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). In addition, under anaerobic conditions, the contribution of UQ to the respiratory chain is significantly lower (and is replaced by menaquinone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gennis and Stewart, 1996</xref>) and so may contribute to a decreased requirement for Arc in pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression. Hence, Arc-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression under pIV stress depends on specific growth conditions. Other examples of conditional effects of Arc on certain genes are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Mika and Hengge, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ArcB communicates with PspB</title><p>There appear to be two separate actions of the Arc system in pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression. One is related to activation of ArcA (and subsequent control of ArcA-P target genes) required for full <italic>psp</italic> induction under pIV stress. The other action relates to a more direct effect of activated ArcB that promotes low-level induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression, where ArcB*, in the absence of pIV, can induce low-level <italic>psp</italic> expression in a &#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic> strain as can ArcB* phosphorelay mutants in &#x00394;<italic>arcB</italic> cells. We demonstrated that ArcB interacts with PspB and that this interaction is dependent on the integrity of the PspB leucine zipper motif. Further, mutational analysis revealed that the PspB leucine zipper is important for pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression, but not required for direct binding interactions between PspB and PspC, suggesting that PspB may be directly involved in receiving (or transducing) an inducing signal from activated ArcB.</p><p>The linker region of ArcB connects the <italic>trans</italic>-membrane (TM) domain with the catalytic domain of ArcB (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A and B</xref>) and contains a putative leucine zipper motif (conserved leucine residues at positions 73, 80, 87 and 94) and a PAS domain, the former of unknown function for ArcB activity. It has been suggested that Leu87 functions in intramolecular signal propagation in ArcB kinase activation (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Malpica <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Here we show that the ArcB leucine zipper motif is functionally important in intramolecular activation of ArcB. Our results indicate that the ArcB leucine zipper mutant (ArcB<sup>LeuZm</sup>) is in a constitutive &#x02018;kinase on&#x02019; state, capable of inducing the <italic>pfl</italic> promoter, but not if the phosphorelay residues H292 or H717 are compromised (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mmi0074-0016-mu9.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>). ArcB<sup>LeuZm</sup> also facilitates pIV-dependent and increases pIV-independent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression. However, induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mmi0074-0016-mu10.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (for example) is significantly lower when compared with ArcB*<sub>H717A</sub>. In addition, the ArcB<sup>LeuZm</sup> mutant exhibits a decreased affinity for PspB, further suggesting that under specific <italic>psp</italic>-inducing conditions, the leucine zipper motifs of both ArcB and PspB are involved in ArcB&#x02013;PspB communication.</p><p>The PAS domain of ArcB may allow ArcB to respond to a number of factors related to changes in, e.g. oxygen supply and associated metabolic processes. To date only the interaction between ArcB and UQ has been reported (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Malpica <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Since ArcB specifically interacts with PspB, in principle this would allow PspB to respond to signals received by ArcB, and vice versa. A similar relationship between signalling and control components has been described for other systems (e.g. for PhoP and PmrD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kato <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) where communication often occurs through membrane interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Szurmant <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Integration of the Arc system in the PspB/C-specific signalling pathway</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> it has been shown that PspB, PspC and PspA and PspA and PspF interactions occur under non-stress conditions (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Darwin, 2005</xref>). Here, we show that ArcB and PspB interact, potentially within one or more ArcB&#x02013;Psp[B/C/A/F] regulatory complexes or subcomplexes. Stress-induced activation of ArcB may result in conformational changes in either PspB or PspC (or both) and presumably through altered protein&#x02013;protein interactions releases the PspA-imposed negative regulation of PspF.</p><p>The precise nature of the signal(s) that induces <italic>psp</italic> expression remains to be determined. It is possible that under stress conditions, besides changes in the integrity of the IM and/or &#x00394;<italic>&#x003c8;</italic> (pmf), the redox state of respiratory chain components specifically quinones, may also contribute to Arc-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression. One possibility is that alongside Arc-independent signalling, <italic>psp</italic>-inducing stimuli reduce UQ and, following an increased diffusion of H<sup>+</sup> into the cytosol, the consequent dissipation of the pmf, may then activate ArcB. This view is supported by the observation that both UQ and ArcAB are required to detect a drop in &#x00394;<italic>&#x003c8;</italic> in the presence of pIV, although UQ may be required for the structural integrity ArcB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; this study). Notably induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression and a significant downregulation of aerobic respiration and pmf occur simultaneously in cells undergoing contact-dependent growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Aoki <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In microaerobiosis, activation of the Arc system greatly facilitates pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression in a PspBC-dependent manner. However, since part of the induction process is Arc-independent but still PspBC-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) it seems likely that one (or both) of the <italic>psp</italic> encoded sensors (PspB and/or PspC) can receive a signal. Therefore, a &#x02018;double check point&#x02019; potentially exists to regulate pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression. This arrangement of sensors would help the Psp system maintain specificity to stimuli, as described for unorthodox two-component systems which maintain their robustness to noises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kim and Cho, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PspA&#x02013;PspF is a minimal Psp system</title><p>This study clearly shows that in anaerobiosis, pIV-dependent induction of <italic>psp</italic> expression is PspBC-independent, consistent with the observation that some <italic>psp</italic>-inducing stimuli are PspBC-independent (e.g. extreme heat shock, CCCP) or only partially PspBC-dependent (ethanol treatment and hyperosmotic shock) [(reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Model <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Darwin, 2005</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>]. These results strongly suggest either (i) that PspA (and/or PspF) can directly receive the inducing signal and relieve the PspA-imposed negative regulation or (ii) that other factors substitute for PspBC and ArcAB. That a minimal PspA&#x02013;PspF system is capable of responding to extracytoplasmic stimulus is consistent with a regulated PspA stress response in Gram-positive bacteria and archebacteria where PspBC are absent [(reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Darwin, 2005</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bidle <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Vrancken <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>].

In all these organisms, PspA homologues often respond to stress conditions similar to those described for inducing the Psp response (e.g. via extreme heat shock, ethanol treatment, hyperosmotic shock, CCCP) in a partially PspBC-dependent or -independent manner in enterobacteria.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.
