To determine the etiology of this disease, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell hybridomas were generated from inflamed tissue&#x02013;derived CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. A majority of T cell hybridomas were specific for myelin protein 0 (P0), which was the principal target of autoantibody responses targeting nerve proteins. To determine whether P0-specific T cell responses were sufficient to mediate disease, we generated a novel myelin P0&#x02013;specific T cell receptor transgenic (POT) mouse. POT T cells were not tolerized or deleted during thymic development and proliferated in response to P0 in vitro. Importantly, when bred onto a recombination activating gene knockout background, POT mice developed a fulminant form of peripheral neuropathy that affected all mice by weaning age and led to their premature death by 3&#x02013;5 wk of age. This abrupt disease was associated with the production of interferon &#x003b3; by P0-specific T cells and a lack of CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells. Collectively, our data suggest that myelin P0 is a major autoantigen in autoimmune peripheral neuropathy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammatory demyelinating lesions of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that cause devastating neurological deficits and paralysis. Multifocal demyelination associated with perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates in the PNS is the pathological hallmark of GBS and CIDP, and autoreactive T and B cell responses are believed to be essential in both diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Defining self-antigens targeted by the autoimmune response can lead to a better understanding of the immunopathology of the disease and can potentially lead to antigen-specific tolerogenic therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>); however, progress has been limited by the paucity of animal models. We previously described the first spontaneous model of autoimmune disease of the PNS, called spontaneous autoimmune peripheral polyneuropathy, in autoimmune-prone nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice deficient for the co-stimulatory molecule B7-2 (NOD-B7-2KO mice) or mimicked many pathophysiological characteristics of GBS and CIDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). NOD-B7-2KO mice exhibit a progressive and generalized limb paralysis associated with severe demyelination and axonal damage caused by an autoimmune attack of the PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Inflammatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are essential for the development of autoimmune peripheral neuropathy, and NOD-B7-2KO mice deficient for IFN-&#x003b3; were protected from disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In this report, we examined the antigen specificity of autoreactive T cells infiltrating the nerves of neuropathic mice and found that myelin protein 0 (P0) is a dominant self-antigen recognized by T cells and autoantibodies. We generated a TCR transgenic (TCR-Tg) mouse specific for a P0 epitope and demonstrated that these T cells were sufficient to induce a fulminant form of peripheral neuropathy.</p><sec sec-type="results and discussion"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Generation of peripheral nerve&#x02013;specific T cell hybridomas</title><p>We previously demonstrated that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from neuropathic NOD-B7-2KO mice could transfer disease, suggesting that the site of infiltration and tissue destruction would be enriched in pathogenic autoreactive T cells specific for nerve antigens.

Expanded CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from nerves were fused with TCR<sup>&#x02212;</sup> BW1100 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) to generate antigen-specific T cell hybridomas. Stable CD4<sup>+</sup> TCR<sup>+</sup> T cell hybridomas, responsive to anti-CD3 stimulation, were tested further for their ability to be activated by protein lysates prepared from sciatic nerves. A small subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell hybridomas (11 out of 56) derived from the infiltrated nerves of neuropathic mice responded to sciatic nerve antigens as measured by up-regulation of CD69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). 1 out of these 11 hybridoma responded to an antigen shared between the PNS and central nervous system (CNS; Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082113/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082113/DC1</ext-link>), supporting the previous finding that neuropathy in NOD-B7-2KO mice preferentially targeted the PNS without affecting CNS tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). As expected, up-regulation of CD69 on T cell hybridomas in response to nerve lysate was inhibited in the presence of anti&#x02013;MHC class II blocking mAbs (Fig. S1), confirming that the response of T cell hybridomas to nerve antigens was dependent on recognition of a peptide&#x02013;MHC class II complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Antigen specificity of nerve-derived CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell hybridomas</title><p>Neural proteins targeted by autoantibodies in NOD-B7-2KO mice were determined to identify potential targets of autoreactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Protein extracts prepared from the sciatic nerve were immunoblotted with sera from neuropathic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). The majority of sera (27 out of 50; 54%) from individual neuropathic T reg cell&#x02013;depleted NOD-B7-2KO mice reacted strongly against an antigen migrating at &#x0223c;25&#x02013;30 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Immunoprecipitation was performed on columns containing protein G agarose coupled to sera from neuropathic animals, followed by peptide mass fingerprinting, and unequivocally identified the 28-kD protein P0, a major component of the myelin sheath expressed exclusively in the PNS but not in the CNS. 6 out of 11 hybridomas that were activated by peripheral nerve lysate up-regulated CD69 in the presence of P0 peptides, suggesting that P0 is a major autoantigen targeted by T cells in neuropathic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Of these six P0-specific hybridomas, four recognized P0 peptides in the putatively extracellular portion of the protein (peptide pool #1), whereas the other two hybridomas were specific for P0 peptides located in the cytoplasmic portion of the protein (peptide pool #4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Three out of the four extracellular P0-specific hybridomas were responsive to the same P0 peptide (amino acids 1&#x02013;25), suggesting the presence of an immunodominant epitope in this portion of the P0 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref> and not depicted). We should emphasize that the four hybridomas specific for P0 1&#x02013;25 were generated from distinct T cell clones, because the TCR V&#x003b1; and V&#x003b2; combination was unique to each hybridoma (Table S1).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Myelin P0 is targeted by the autoimmune response in NOD-B7-2KO mice.</bold> (A) Immunoblotting of sciatic nerve extracts with serum from individual anti&#x02013;B7-1&#x02013;treated NOD-B7-2KO neuropathic mice (lanes 1&#x02013;9), nonneuropathic NOD mice (lanes 10 and 11), or BALB/c controls (lanes 12 and 13).

The POT mice showed no difference in the total cell numbers of the spleen cells or thymocytes as compared with non-Tg littermates (unpublished data). The percentages of CD4 and CD8 single-positive cells were decreased in the thymus in POT mice as compared with control littermates, and the CD4/CD8 ratio was slightly increased (4.9 &#x000b1; 0.8% compared with 3.6 &#x000b1; 0.2%, respectively; P &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, left). Similar data were observed in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, right). Analysis of TCR expression confirmed the expression of the Tg TCR and showed very efficient allelic exclusion in POT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, right). Indeed, &#x0003e;90% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were V&#x003b2;11<sup>+</sup> in the spleen of POT mice versus &#x0003c;10% in non-Tg littermates (90.6 &#x000b1; 5.4% in POT mice versus 6.5 &#x000b1; 0.5% in controls). Conversely, POT splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contained &#x0003c;2% V&#x003b2;8<sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas V&#x003b2;8<sup>+</sup> T cells represented &#x0003e;20% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in control littermates (1.2 &#x000b1; 1.3% in POT mice versus 22.8 &#x000b1; 1.2% in controls). These results suggested that T cells expressing the POT TCR were positively selected to generate a normal population of mature T cells in the periphery, similar to other TCR-Tg mice specific for autoantigens such as islet-specific BDC2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Analysis of POT mice, crossed onto a RAGKO background to eliminate the potential influence of endogenous TCR &#x003b1; chains on the thymic selection, confirmed that TCR-Tg T cells were positively selected in the thymus, although the cell numbers were greatly reduced compared with RAG<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> or POT-RAG<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082113/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082113/DC1</ext-link>), suggesting a more effective negative selection induced by P0-expressing thymic stromal cells in this setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Although the total spleen cell number was reduced in POT-RAGKO compared with POT mice, the majority of mature T cells from POT-RAGKO mice were CD4<sup>+</sup>V&#x003b2;11<sup>+</sup> T cells, with few CD8<sup>+</sup>V&#x003b2;11<sup>+</sup> T cells (a mean ratio of 10.6 &#x000b1; 1.2% versus 3.7 &#x000b1; 0.3% in POT-RAG<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref> and Fig. S2). Thus, P0-specific POT TCR-Tg T cells successfully survived thymic selection to generate a population of mature autoreactive T cells in the periphery even on a RAGKO background. Finally, we examined the presence of T reg cells and the activation status of TCR-Tg T cells in POT mice. There was no difference in the expression of CD69, CD62L, and CD44 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from POT mice compared with non-Tg littermates (unpublished data), showing that POT T cells were not activated in the periphery. Furthermore, a similar percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed the T reg cell marker Foxp3 in POT mice compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). However, CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells could not be detected in the spleen and thymus of POT-RAGKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>; and Figs.

Furthermore, POT T cells displayed a similarly strong proliferation when cultured with P0 protein (including the P0 peptide 1&#x02013;25) but not with another myelin protein (P2), confirming the P0 specificity and demonstrating that the T cells are fully functional and not anergic in the periphery. We examined the capacity of activation of PNS-specific autoreactive T cells to proliferate in NOD (resistant) versus NOD-B7-2KO (susceptible) mice. POT T cells proliferated extensively in several lymph nodes in NOD-B7-2KO but not NOD recipients, including brachial, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>; and Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082113/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082113/DC1</ext-link>), illustrating a clear dichotomy between NOD and NOD-B7-2KO mice, as the development of diabetes versus neuropathy directly correlates with the ability of islet versus nerve antigen-specific autoreactive T cells to proliferate in relevant lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Finally, we detected high levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 in the culture supernatant of POT T cells upon in vitro stimulation in the absence of any skewing culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Surprisingly, intracellular cytokine staining revealed that 40&#x02013;50% of T cells isolated from POT-RAGKO mice produced IFN-&#x003b3; but no IL-17 ex vivo, whereas only 2.5% of POT T cells on a RAG-sufficient background produced IFN-&#x003b3; and &#x0003c;1% produced IL-17, similar to what was observed in NOD littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). This result suggested that cytokine production observed in a RAG-sufficient background was influenced by endogenous TCR &#x003b1; chains and/or regulatory cell populations that could limit the activation and differentiation of autoreactive POT T cells.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Proliferation and cytokine production of P0-specific NOD-POT T cells.</bold> (A) Proliferation of CFSE-labeled NOD-POT T cells in the presence of APCs alone (gray histogram) or APCs and the indicated stimulus (black histograms).

However, adoptive transfer of in vitro&#x02013;activated or CD25-depleted POT T cells led to peripheral nerve infiltration and induced neuropathy in immunodeficient recipients (unpublished data). These results suggested that the lack of spontaneous neuropathy in POT mice may have been a consequence of increased numbers of antigen-specific Tg<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells as compared with Tg-negative NOD mice. Thus, we examined T reg cell&#x02013;deficient POT-RAGKO mice for tissue infiltration and clinical disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>; and Figs. S3 and S4). POT-RAGKO mice displayed a dramatic phenotype characterized by early weight loss and premature death by 3&#x02013;5 wk of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>; and not depicted), and spontaneously developed a fulminant form of neuropathy that started as early as 18 d and affected all mice by 3&#x02013;4 wk of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>).

Development of neuropathy was accompanied by a heavy infiltrate in the sciatic nerves of NOD-RAGKO-POT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and E</xref>), as well as myelin destruction (Fig. S6).

Finally, the peripheral neuropathy induced by P0-specific POT TCR-Tg T cells was extremely severe and led to death of the animals, usually within 24 h after clinical disease onset, either spontaneously in NOD-RAGKO-POT mice or after adoptive transfer of T cells from NOD-RAGKO-POT or NOD-POT mice (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Spontaneous development of a fulminant form of neuropathy in NOD-RAGKO-POT mice.</bold> (A) Quantification of infiltration in the nerves of indicated mice at 3&#x02013;4 wk of age.

Importantly, the development of an abrupt form of disease in NOD-RAGKO-POT mice reveals that P0-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were sufficient to induce catastrophic damage in the PNS and suggests that P0-specific T cells could play a central role in inducing tissue destruction in autoimmune neuropathy. P0 is a major component of the PNS that represents &#x0003e;50% of the peripheral myelin protein content. Experimental autoimmune neuritis can be induced in rats and mice by immunization with P0 protein or peptides in adjuvant or by adoptive transfer of P0-specific T cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). However, these models involve active immunization and powerful adjuvants, which does not mirror the spontaneous disease in individuals genetically prone to autoimmunity. Reports of immune responses to P0 in GBS and CIDP patients have generated conflicting results that could be explained by different techniques and patient populations. Nevertheless, of all neural proteins tested, P0 has been the most consistent reactivity detected in the serum of patients with active GBS or CIDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Khalili-Shirazi et al. initially reported proliferative responses to P0 protein or peptides in 9 out of 19 GBS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). More recently, P0-specific T cell responses measured by proliferation or ELISPOT were not statistically different in GBS and CIDP patients as compared with nonautoimmune neuropathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), whereas another report described P0-specific IL-10 production in GBS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), raising the possibility that immune responses to P0 may be regulatory rather than pathogenic. These findings were reminiscent of the glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-kD isoform (GAD65) autoantigen in type 1 diabetes. Similar to P0, autoantibodies to GAD were readily detected in type 1 diabetes patients and in the NOD mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), and GAD-specific T cells could adoptively transfer diabetes in the NOD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). However, GAD-specific TCR-Tg or retrogenic mice revealed that GAD-specific T cells did not induce diabetes but rather exerted a protective effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In contrast, our report of an aggressive form of peripheral neuropathy spontaneously occurring in P0-specific POT TCR-Tg mice strengthens the potential role of P0 as a central autoantigen involved in disease development and tissue damage in autoimmune neuropathy. While this paper was being reviewed, Kim et al. published a report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) showing that autoimmune neuropathy in NOD-B7-2KO mice could be prevented by tolerance induction using a specific P0 peptide. Although the peptide specificity (P0 180&#x02013;199) was different from the POT TCR epitope (P0 1&#x02013;25), the epitope overlapped with two of our peripheral nerve&#x02013;specific hybridoma clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>; and Table S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082113/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082113/DC1</ext-link>). In their report, the adoptive transfer of a P0-specific line only led to very mild disease (grade 1). The difference with our results may be because of the specificity differences or their use of a T cell line.</p><p>Our results suggest that neuropathy induced by P0-specific POT T cells involves mainly IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing Th1 cells in agreement with a central role of IFN-&#x003b3; in the development of peripheral neuropathy in NOD-B7-2KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Furthermore, elevated serum levels of IFN-&#x003b3; have been reported in GBS patients, and the percentage of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was markedly increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of CIDP patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Th17 cells have been suggested to play a major role in multiple sclerosis and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Although increased levels of IL-17 have been described in the spinal fluid of CIDP patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), it is still unclear whether Th17 cells are important for autoimmune peripheral neuropathies. We found that low levels of IL-17 were produced by POT T cells on a RAG-sufficient background in vitro. It was recently reported that Th1 and Th17 cells may have different abilities to infiltrate the CNS and cause experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis depending on the level of local tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Thus, our report does not preclude a role for IL-17 in spontaneous autoimmune peripheral polyneuropathy and other PNS autoimmune diseases but suggests that IFN-&#x003b3; is the dominant cytokine associated with peripheral neuropathy induced by P0-specific POT T cells.</p><p>Another important insight revealed by our report is the control of P0-specific T cells and, hence, the development of neuropathy by CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells. Indeed, the development of the fulminant form of neuropathy in POT-RAGKO mice was associated with a complete absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells, suggesting that antigen-specific T reg cells are key to controlling the disease. Because the percentage of T reg cells has been shown to be lower in the peripheral blood of GBS and CIDP patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), our findings suggest that immunotherapy using P0-specific T reg cells may be an important future therapeutic option for these patients, as similar treatments are now being developed for several autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>NOD and NOD-SCID mice were purchased from Taconic.
