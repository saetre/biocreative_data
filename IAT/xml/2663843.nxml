The virus, consisting of 24 different serotypes, is transmitted to its vertebrate host by a few species of biting midges of the <italic>Culicoides</italic> genus (<italic>Diptera</italic>: <italic>Ceratopogonidae</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Mellor1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. BT is a reportable disease of considerable socioeconomic concern and of major importance in the international trade of animals and animal products. From 1998 through 2005, at least 6 BTV strains belonging to 5 serotypes (BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4, BTV-9, and BTV-16) were continously present in the Mediterranean Basin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Barros1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Breard1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Mellor2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Since August 2006, BTV-8 has caused severe epizootic outbreakes in northern Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Saegerman1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The emergence of BT in parts of Europe never before affected was attributed mainly to climate change and linked to the Northern expansion of the major Old World vector <italic>Culicoides imicola</italic>. Additionally, there is also evidence for the involvement of other novel indigenous European vector species of <italic>Culicoides</italic> (<italic>C. obsoletus</italic> and <italic>C. pulicaris</italic> ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Purse1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>BTV has a genome composed of ten linear segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and is classified as the type species of the genus <italic>Orbivirus</italic> within the family <italic>Reoviridae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Mertens1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The BTV genome encodes 7 structural (VP1 through VP7) and 4 nonstructural proteins (NS1 through NS3/NS3A). The outer capsid is composed of two major structural proteins, VP2 and VP5 (segments 2 and 6, respectively), involved in cell attachment and virus entry. VP2 is known to contain the major neutralization determinant of BTV while VP5 influences virus neutralization through its conformational interaction with VP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-DeMaula1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The outer capsid covers the inner capsid that is composed of two major structural proteins VP3 and VP7 (encoded by segments 3 and 7, respectively) and three distinct minor proteins (VP1, VP4, and VP6 corresponding to segments 1, 4, and 9 respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Verwoerd1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, in addition to the viral genome. Four other nonstructural proteins, produced during the viral cycle (NS1, NS2, and NS3/NS3A) (segments 6, 8, and 10 respectively), are more conserved among serotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Verwoerd2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Studies involving the natural hosts of BTV are limited by the complexity of the system, the scarce knowledge of their immune system, and the need to have an animal facility with biosafety level 3. To circumvent some of these problems, an adequate system would be the use of adult mice because of the knowledge of its genetics and its manageability. BTV infects newborn mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Brewer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Letchworth1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Carr1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, but an adult mouse model will be necessary to allow studies of acquired immune responses and vaccination against BTV.</p><p>Bluetongue virus is a potent interferon alpha (IFN-&#x003b1;) inducer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Jameson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Fulton1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-MacLachlan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a temporal relationship between viremia and IFN-&#x003b1; activity has been observed in sheep infected with BTV, where IFN peak concentrations induced approximately a 90&#x00025; decrease in virus titer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Foster1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. IFN-&#x003b1; plays an essential role in the antiviral innate immune response. Virus-derived dsRNAs are detected by Toll-like receptors on type I IFN-producing cells (mostly notably on plasmacytoid dendritic cells). Secreted IFNs bind to the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) on the surface of neighbouring cells, activating the Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) signalling pathway. This in turn induces the transcriptional activation of target genes, the products of which render the cells resistant to virus replication through various mechanisms, including degradation of viral mRNAs, inhibition of viral translation, and inhibition of cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Schindler1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Staeheli1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Muller1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Sen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

While all nonimmunized animals died, 100&#x00025; of the immunized animals were protected against a lethal challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005171-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

No Infectious viruses were detected in immunized mice; however, we observed titers up to 3&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> PFU/ml in nonimmunized animals at day 5 post-challenge. In addition, we analyzed by RT-qPCR the presence of BTV genomes in the blood of inmmunized and nonimmunized IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice challenged with BTV-4. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005171-t001">Table 1</xref>. BTV genomes were readily detected in nonimmunized mice at days three and four after BTV infection (C<italic>t</italic>: 27&#x02013;29) and increased (C<italic>t</italic>: 23&#x02013;26) thereafter until the death of the animal.

Natural hosts, although excellent tools for studies of pathogenesis and vaccination, are expensive and required specialized laboratories. Here, we characterize a new animal model based on adult IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice that support the <italic>in vivo</italic> growth of BTV-4 and BTV-8 after intravenous inoculation. A tremendous advantage of this mouse model is the availability of a wide variety of reagents that can be used to study many aspects of the immune response to the virus. In addition, we propose this animal model as an adequate system for testing BTV vaccines, an important issue because the cost of testing new vaccines in target species is a major obstacle for laboratories and industries. The new mouse model for the study of BTV infection has unique features that open the possibility to study in the same host-virus system susceptibility, virulence, immunobiology of infection, and vaccine efficacy, in ways that are not approachable with the natural host.</p><p>BTV infects newborn mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Brewer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Letchworth1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Carr1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Franchi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, but an adult animal model will be necessary to allow studies of acquired immune responses and vaccination against BTV. Different approaches have been followed to avoid this problem. The protective effects of baculovirus expressed BTV-10 minor and non-structural proteins were assessed by measuring virus titers in the ovaries of mice challenged with homologous recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV). Protection mediated by CTLs specific for the BTV minor or nonstructural proteins could not be evaluated by challenging mice with BTV-10, as the virus does not cause disease in adult mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Jones1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The infection of fetal mice with BTV leads to severe cerebral malformation. Infection of 2-week-old mice resulted in very limited multiplication without sequelae, and infection of 4-week-old mice did not show clinical disease and no viral multiplication was detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Narayan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the use of highly immature mice results in pathologies that do not resemble those found in the natural host. Another aspect to consider is the route of inoculation that may determine the outcome of infection. In this work, we have used the intravenous inoculation to resemble the natural infection route by mosquito biting. Thus, mice infected with BTV i.v. develop clinical symptoms, as it happens in natural hosts. This makes the mouse model even more atractive to be used as a tool for studying immune response to BTV and vaccination strategies.</p><p>Up-regulation of type I IFN is one of the earliest cellular responses upon contact with infectious agents. The rapid induction of type I IFN reflects the crucial role that this cytokine plays in the inhibition of viral spread before the generation of a specific immune response. Given that viruses must at least partially circumvent the IFN response, it is not surprising that an inability to do this can restrict host range. There are many examples where this is known. For example, neither measles virus nor polio virus will replicate efficiently in mouse models unless the IFN system has been compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Ohka1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Mrkic1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. BTV is a potent type I interferon inducer in mice and cattle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Jameson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-MacLachlan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Jameson2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results show that BTV is pathogenic for IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice mainly due to the lack of the IFN-I receptor, allowing the virus to circumvent the IFN-I response in the host. In addition, IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice serve as a good animal model for BTV, reproducing many aspects of its natural host infection. First, IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice infected with BTV showed viremia and disease symptoms, in contrast with C57BL/6 mice, which did not show them, even when these animals were infected at the highest viral dose tested (10<sup>6</sup> PFUs/mouse). The appearance of viremia after inoculation in infected IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice was dependent on the viral dose, althought the highest titers observed in blood were not dose-dependent. Second, the differential virulence of serotypes 4 and 8 were maintained in this animal model. Some BTV serotypes such as serotype 8, which recently caused infection in northern Europe, exhibit enhanced virulence in cattle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Saegerman1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, in contrast to BTV-4 that usually exhibits subclinical infections in this species. In infected IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice, BTV-8 killed 100&#x00025; of the animals with a dose as low as 10 PFUs per mouse. In contrast 10<sup>3</sup> PFUs of BTV-4 were needed to kill 100&#x00025; of the mice. In addition, the virus titers found in the blood of infected mice were similar at the same virus doses for the animals infected with BTV-8 than with BTV-4, indicating that BTV-8 exhibited a higher virulence than BTV-4 in the IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> model, as is observed in cattle, one of the BTV natural hosts. Third, BTV dissemination in IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice reproduced BTV infection in cattle and sheep. High titers of BTV are present in the lungs, precapsular and mesenteric lymph nodes, thymus, and spleen of infected calves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-MacLachlan2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-BarrattBoyes1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice, the virus was detected in spleen before was isolated from other organs, including blood. Release of BTV from spleen was followed by an increased in viremia and dissemination to other organs (lymph nodes, lung and thymus), followed by its dissemination to lymph nodes, lung, and thymus after intravenous infection. This has been suggested also for calves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-BarrattBoyes1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> indicating a similar BTV spreading pattern in IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice. Histological analyses of BTV infected mice at 48 h.p.i. showed many similarities with lessions described in natural hosts. The permeability disorders of the vascular system described for ruminants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-SchwartzCornill1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> is reflected in the petecheias observed in spleen in BTV infected mice. The enlargement of lymph nodes reflects an ongoing immune response. However, the observed lymphoid depletion suggests that other cells are migrating to these organs or that a general aedema results in organ enlargement. The lungs are especially susceptible to permeability disorders of the vasculature induced by BTV, and this is consistent in BTV infected mice as well as in ruminants. In general, pathology in natural hosts has not been profoundly studied. The described pathology similarities between IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice and ruminants after infection with BTV indicate that our mouse model may be a good tool to study new findings in BTV pathology.</p><p>The cost of testing new vaccines in target species is a major obstacle for laboratories and industries. For this reason, the intracerebral inoculation of newborn mice with BTV vaccines has been used as an animal model to evaluate the level of attenuation of live attenuated BTV vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Franchi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results show that adult IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice serve as a good animal model to test BTV vaccines. Even though the lack of type I interferon signals may have an effect in the development of acquired immune responses, our results and previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Muller1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Fiette1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Ohka1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Ohno1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Bouloy1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Waibler1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> show that the IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> infection model is useful for the definition of effective vaccine candidates against BTV. Indeed, in our study all immunized animals developed an antibody response specific of BTV-4 with the production of neutralizing antibodies against the same serotype, indicating a successful immunization. The protection mediated by inactivated whole BTV vaccine in IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice infected with a lethal dose of BTV-4 was complete, and 100&#x00025; of the animals did not show any symptoms associated with infection or died. Viremia was not detected in the blood of immunized animals after challenge with BTV-4 when analyzed by plaque assay. The presence of BTV genomes in the blood of immunized mice after BTV-4 challenge analyzed by RT-qPCR, a more sensible method than the plaque assay, showed the presence of viral genomes in the blood of some of the immunized mice but in all the cases, the <italic>C</italic>ts were higher than in the nonimmunized mice and those that were RT-qPCR positive reverted to negative at day seven post-challenge. Similar RTqPCR results have been observed in cattle and sheep vaccinated with ZULVAC-BTV-4 inactivated BTV-4 preparation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005171-Paradell1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> These results strongly support the involvement of BTV in the pathological processes described in this work and, moreover, suggest that the mouse model is adequate to evaluate vaccine candidates. Future work will determine whether the ability to protect mice with other vaccine formulations mimics the capacity to protect the natural host.</p><p>In summary, we have characterized a novel small animal model for BTV infection based on IFNAR<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> adult mice that reproduces many aspects of its natural host infection. This animal model may facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms of BTV pathogenicity in its natural host and a faster advance in the development of new BTV vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Virus and cells</title><p>Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21), and Vero cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2mM glutamine and 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (FCS).
