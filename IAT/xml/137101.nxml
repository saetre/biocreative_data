Detecting alternatively spliced transcripts is difficult when they are rare. In addition, edited transcripts often differ from the genomic sequence by only a few nucleotides. Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) is routinely used for single nucleotide polymorphism detection and we used this method to detect alternatively spliced or edited transcripts. As the sites of RNA editing appear to be conserved within gene families, we investigated whether editing sites are conserved in the murine homologue of the <italic>Drosophila cacophony</italic> transcript encoding the &#x003b1;1 subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel that is edited at 10 independent positions. Although DHPLC analysis detects RNA editing at as low as 3&#x00025; in control transcripts, no evidence of RNA editing was found in the analysed murine transcript. However an alternative exon was identified at the 3&#x02032; end of the mouse Cacna1&#x003b1; transcript and an alternative micro-exon encoding only two amino acids (<italic>NP</italic>) was found in the extracellular loop before the IVS4 helix in the same transcript.

Post-transcriptional processes such as alternative splicing play an important role in creating a complex proteome and recent estimates suggest that 35&#x02013;59&#x00025; of human genes undergo alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c3">3</xref>). Since alternative splicing of a transcript can vary during development and between different tissues and considering that in several cases human genes can produce hundreds or thousands of different mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c5">5</xref>), the probability remains that some alternative splicing has gone undetected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c4">4</xref>). Therefore methods are necessary for detecting the full range of different transcripts that a gene can encode. At present there are various techniques for detecting alternatively spliced products, of which the alignment of multiple expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is perhaps the most accurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c6">6</xref>). In the last few years, bioinformatics studies have identified more alternative splicing events than were previously found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c6">6</xref>), but since most of the ESTs correspond to the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; ends of transcripts many alternatively spliced exons remain undetected. In fact, the greatest disadvantage of the bioinformatics method is the risk of a high rate of false negatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c4">4</xref>).</p><p>Another post-transcriptional event that can increase the complexity of the proteome is RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c8">8</xref>). The difficulty of detecting edited transcripts is similar to the problem of detecting micro-exons as editing creates very subtle changes in the sequence. The most abundant type of RNA editing found in higher eukaryotes is the conversion of adenosine to inosine by the ADAR (<underline>a</underline>denosine <underline>d</underline>e<underline>a</underline>minases that act on <underline>R</underline>NA) family of enzymes (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c9">9</xref>). The abundance of inosine in poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA has been estimated at one base in 17 000 in rat brain and one in 33 000 in rat heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c10">10</xref>). Since very few edited transcripts have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c7">7</xref>), this suggests that many edited transcripts remain to be found. Inosine is read as if it were guanosine by the translation machinery and editing can change the encoded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c11">11</xref>). This can have dramatic effects on the function of the protein, as has been observed both in the glutamate-gated ion channel and serotonin receptors (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c8">8</xref>). With one exception, editing at a specific position is not 100&#x00025; efficient so RT&#x02013;PCR from an edited transcript produces a heterogeneous pool of cDNAs with adenosine&#x0002f;guanosine differences at the edited site. To confirm that this difference between cDNAs is truly RNA editing and not a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) a comparison of cDNAs and the corresponding genomic sequence must verify an adenosine at the edited position in the genomic sequence. A screen for editing events based on chemical modification of inosine in RNA molecules has been developed by Bass and colleagues but this is not a rapid method and many cDNAs and genomic DNA have to be sequenced to eliminate false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c12">12</xref>).</p><p>Editing sites in vertebrate glutamate-gated ion channel receptor transcripts are conserved at the same positions in different genes of the glutamate receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c13">13</xref>). Screening homologues of known edited transcripts thus offers one possible approach to find new targets of RNA editing. The Dmca1A (<italic>cacophony</italic>) transcript that encodes the &#x003b1;1 subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is edited at 10 positions causing 10 amino acid changes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c15">15</xref>). The amino acid sequence of the edited regions is well conserved in homologous vertebrate calcium channel transcripts as are the intron&#x02013;exon boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c15">15</xref>), suggesting that RNA editing sites might also be conserved. Voltage-gated ion channel receptors play a significant role in human diseases and as drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c16">16</xref>). Therefore it is important to determine how much transcript diversity is introduced by RNA processing events such as alternative splicing and RNA editing.</p><p>In this report we describe the application of a heteroduplex detection method, which is extensively used for genomic SNP and mutation detection, to search for RNA editing and alternative splicing within an ion channel transcript in the mouse brain. Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) detects heteroduplexes in PCR products by subjecting the crude PCR products to ion pair reverse-phase liquid chromatography under partially denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c18">18</xref>). We show that this method is sufficiently sensitive to detect RNA editing at a specific position at a frequency as low as 3&#x00025;, in control experiments, as well as detecting subtle splicing events. A micro-exon of two amino acids was found in the mouse Cacna1&#x003b1; transcript as well as an alternative exon in the C-terminus that is the same length as the exon it replaces.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Isolation of genomic DNA</title><p>DNA was extracted by standard procedures from adult BALB-C mouse tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c19">19</xref>).

If more than one PCR product was present after electrophoresis on an agarose gel we processed only the RT&#x02013;PCR product that corresponded to the size of the predicted product as we were not interested in analysing alternative exons that can be distinguished by size.</p></sec><sec><title>DHPLC analysis</title><p>The search for hypothetical editing events or alternative splicing was performed by DHPLC scanning on an automated HPLC instrument (Transgenomic WAVE&#x02122; DNA Fragment Analysis System). To generate heteroduplex molecules, PCR products were subjected to denaturation for 3 min at 95&#x000b0;C followed by a gradual reannealing for 30 min in the thermal cycler. Aliquots of 5&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;l of reannealed PCR product was loaded on a DNASep column (Transgenomic, Santa Clara, CA). PCR products were eluted from the column using an acetonitrile gradient in a 0.1 M triethylamine acetate (TEAA) buffer, pH 7, at a constant flow rate of 0.9 ml&#x0002f;min. The gradient was created by mixing buffers A and B (buffer A, 0.1 M TEAA, 0.1 mM Na<sub>4</sub>EDTA; buffer B, 25&#x00025; acetonitrile in 0.1 M TEAA). The start and end points of the gradient depend on the size of the PCR fragments and on the composition of the DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c22">22</xref>).

PCR products, containing heterogeneity, are denatured and allowed to reanneal slowly so that some heteroduplex molecules are formed. This DNA mixture is chromatographed over a DNA affinity resin under partially denaturing conditions of high temperature within a linear acetonitrile gradient. Heteroduplexes having internal sequence variation display reduced column retention times (<italic>x</italic>-axis) relative to their homoduplex counterparts; the eluted DNA fragments were detected by an UV detector at 254 nm and converted to millivolts (<italic>y</italic>-axis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c23">23</xref>).</p><p>The DHPLC method has been used successfully for detecting point mutations at very low percentages of heterogeneity, as low as 0.5&#x02013;5&#x00025;, in mitochondrial DNA and genomic DNA samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c25">25</xref>). To verify that this method can be used to study RNA editing (A&#x02192;G conversion), we did control experiments using wild-type and edited clones amplified from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> calcium channel Dmca1A (<italic>cacophony</italic>) transcript (exon 15) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf516tb1">1</xref>). Equal amounts of PCR products of 500 nt amplified from edited and unedited cDNA clones were mixed, denatured and reannealed to allow some heteroduplex formation. This PCR product mix was chromatographed over a DHPLC column and the heteroduplex was readily detected. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f2">2</xref> shows merged DHPLC profiles of the unedited (green line) and edited (red line) clones and the blue line represents the 50&#x00025; mixture of the two products. To determine if PCR product length affects detection of editing, experiments were also performed with different primers producing PCR products of different lengths. Edited and unedited PCR products of 200, 500 or 800 nt or 1 kb (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf516tb1">1</xref>) were mixed at different ratios of edited to total fragments (3, 6, 10, 25, 40 and 50&#x00025; edited) and analysed by DHPLC using experimental conditions suggested by the software provided by Transgenomic. An editing event could be detected when the edited product comprised as little as 3&#x00025; of the total transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f3">3</xref>B). Mixing experiments using different percentages of unedited and edited PCR products of 200 nt are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f3">3</xref>. The retention time of the heteroduplex peaks is written over the peaks; this value is only given when a true peak is recognised above background. The resolution of the 3 and 6&#x00025; experimental points can be increased using different running conditions and temperatures, but even the simple conditions suggested by the Transgenomic program are sufficient to detect heterogeneous products.</p><p>The multiple peaks of the 10&#x02013;50&#x00025; mix population, under the same running conditions but at a different temperature, reflect the different nature of the duplex molecules that have been formed, such as two distinguishable heteroduplex and homoduplex peaks (edi:edi, wt:wt, edi:wt and wt:edi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c26">26</xref>). The different heights of the peaks in the DHPLC profiles reflect the difference in the amount of PCR product loaded over the DNAsep column in the different experiments (see Materials and Methods). The retention time, between 4 and 5 min, is equivalent for all the samples in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f3">3</xref>, reflecting the same length of PCR product analysed (200 nt).</p><p>These mixing experiments were performed on cDNA. A potential problem with DHPLC analysis of RT&#x02013;PCR products is that a true representation of the RNA population may not be obtained. To address this question nested primers were designed so that 6 nt of random sequence were incorporated close to the 3&#x02032; end of the product. Six separate RT&#x02013;PCRs were performed with these primers and the products were subcloned and sequenced. In five independent experiments each cDNA had a unique hexamer tag sequence and the number of clones sequenced was 26, 24, 27, 26 and 29. The only occasion when clones were not independent was when more than 35 PCR cycles were required to obtain a good product yield from a rare transcript. Therefore RT&#x02013;PCR products generated in less than 30 PCR cycles represent the mRNA population with an accuracy more than sufficient for DHPLC analysis. On average 25 PCR cycles were used in this study as all PCR products gave a good yield.</p><p>To test this method on RT&#x02013;PCR products made from transcripts that are edited <italic>in vivo</italic>, we extracted total mRNA from the brain of inbred BALB&#x0002f;C mice. Transcripts encoding the GluR-5 subunit of the kainate receptor are edited at the Q&#x0002f;R site to 40&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c27">27</xref>). Primers flanking the Q&#x0002f;R editing site in GluR-5 were used to generate RT&#x02013;PCR products (261 nt) that were denatured, reannealed and analysed by DHPLC or directly sequenced. After 7 min of DHPLC analysis the RT&#x02013;PCR product of GluR-5 displays a double peak indicating the presence of a heterogeneous population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f4">4</xref>A), as predicted. However, when the same RT&#x02013;PCR product is analysed directly by sequencing the heterogeneity at this edited position is not observed due to low resolution of the A&#x0002f;G mix bases and cannot be distinguished over background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f4">4</xref>B). This problem of detecting editing events by sequencing RT&#x02013;PCR products has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c28">28</xref>). The 40&#x00025; editing of the GluR-5 transcript, in our sample, was confirmed by sequencing independent clones.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of micro-processing events by DHPLC analysis</title><p>The hypothetical secondary structure of the pore-forming &#x003b1;1 subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channels is diagrammed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f1">1</xref>. These large proteins contain four repeats of the same domain (I&#x02013;IV) and a large intracellular domain at the C-terminus. Each repeated domain contains six hydrophobic transmembrane segments; in particular, the S4 helix contains positively charged residues critical for voltage gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c16">16</xref>). Most of the RNA editing in the <italic>Drosophila cacophony</italic> transcript that is preferentially expressed in the CNS change the amino acids close to or within the transmembrane domains III and IV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c14">14</xref>). In addition, micro-exons have been identified before the IVS4 helix in this fly channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c14">14</xref>). The amino acid sequence is highly conserved among vertebrate and invertebrate voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c29">29</xref>), therefore we used DHPLC to analyse the homologous vertebrate ion channel transcript from mouse brain for subtle evidence of RNA processing events such as RNA editing or the presence of micro-exons. The mouse Cacna1&#x003b1;, which encodes the &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub> subunit of the P&#x0002f;Q type calcium channel (GenBank accession no. U76716), is the vertebrate homologue of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dmca1A gene so we choose its transcript to investigate if it undergoes micro-processing events such as RNA editing and splicing. Like <italic>cacophony</italic>, this is a CNS-specific transcript and the <italic>tottering</italic> mutation in the mouse Cacna1&#x003b1; gene causes defects in movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c30">30</xref>), as do mutations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dmca1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c31">31</xref>).</p><p>Regions of the Cacna1&#x003b1; transcript corresponding to the edited regions in the <italic>cacophony</italic> transcript were amplified from RNA from whole mouse brain to generate a set of seven RT&#x02013;PCR products (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf516tb1">1</xref>, fragments tot1&#x02013;tot7). Each product was separately denatured, reannealed and analysed by DHPLC using the conditions of temperature and buffer gradients that were calculated based on the sequence of each fragment. For five out of seven PCR products only a single homogeneous peak was obtained at different temperatures (one example is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f5">5</xref>A), indicating that there was no evidence of micro-processing in these products. However, two of the PCR products (tot3 and tot6) did show heterogeneity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f5">5</xref>B and C). To confirm the DHPLC data, 25&#x02013;40 independent clones of each of the seven RT&#x02013;PCRs were sequenced confirming the presence of heterogeneous products only in the tot3 and tot6 products.</p><p>The sequence analysis of tot3 revealed the presence of two different products that differ by the inclusion or exclusion of a micro-exon of 6 nt, encoding just two amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f6">6</xref>A). We found that 40&#x00025; of the sequences analysed contained the insertion of the 6 nt resulting in a modification of the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments IVS3 and IVS4 of the mouse Cacna1&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f1">1</xref>), changing the amino acid sequence GNNF to G<italic>NP</italic>NNF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f6">6</xref>A).</p><p>The second heterogeneous RT&#x02013;PCR product tot6 spans a region within the intracellular C-terminal domain of Cacna1&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f1">1</xref>). Sequencing individual clones of this PCR product revealed the presence of an alternative exon of identical length to the exon that is replaced (96 nt) in 30&#x00025; of the sequences analysed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f6">6</xref>B). What is interesting about these mutually exclusive alternative exons is that they are very homologous at the amino acid level with only 10 out of 32 amino acids being different.</p><p>RT&#x02013;PCR was performed to generate PCR products that included the IVS3 transmembrane segment and the C-terminus of the mouse brain Cacna1&#x003b1; transcript encompassing both tot3 and tot6. Sequencing of these PCR products revealed that the C-terminus alternative exon and <italic>NP</italic> micro-exon were present together in &#x0223c;25&#x00025; of the analysed sequences but also both exons were found on their own at a very low frequency.</p></sec><sec><title>Micro-exons and editing events in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are developmentally regulated</title><p>It has been reported that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> calcium channel &#x003b1;1 subunit gene, Dmca1A, produces different transcripts by alternative splicing and RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c14">14</xref>). In particular, the extracellular IVS3&#x02013;IVS4 loop can be modified by the inclusion of micro-exons encoding one, two or three amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c14">14</xref>). In addition, there is an editing event (N&#x02192;S) in the same extracellular loop one amino acid after the micro-splicing insertion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f7">7</xref>B). Thus, in this small region there is the potential for significant transcript variability.</p><p>Introns 22 and 23 covering the region of the micro-exon were sequenced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and an exon of 6 nt encoding histidine and aspartate (the HD micro-exon) was found 2 kb downstream of the 5&#x02032; splice site, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c14">14</xref>). An additional new exon of 3 nt encoding aspartate (the D micro-exon) was found a further 3.14 kb downstream. These micro-exons have canonical consensus splice sites. Two independent RT&#x02013;PCRs were performed on poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA from embryo, larva and adult and 46&#x02013;70 independent clones were sequenced to investigate which micro-exon was preferentially included during a particular stage of development. We found that the micro-exons are either included or excluded apparently independently of one another so that mRNA may encode none, two, one or three extra amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f7">7</xref>). The HD micro-exon was included more frequently than it was excluded during all stages of development and the percentage of inclusion in adult fly is 47.9&#x00025;. In addition, we found that the percentage of editing at position 4106, one amino acid after the micro-exon, increases from embryo to adult with 36.1&#x00025; editing in adult fly (L.P.Keegan and A.Gallo, unpublished results) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f7">7</xref>).</p><p>It is intriguing that from fly to mouse in the homologous calcium channel transcript we found a micro-exon, of only two amino acids, present at &#x0223c;40&#x00025;, in the same position in the adult stage. Surprisingly we did not find any RNA editing in the mouse channel transcript close to the micro-exon as occurs in adult fly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f7">7</xref>), considering that this position is highly edited in adult flies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>DHPLC as a method for detecting micro-processing events in transcripts</title><p>Alternative splicing and RNA editing are essential biological processes that generate multiple different transcripts from the same pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c7">7</xref>). Aberrant splicing as well as failed editing of precursor transcripts has been associated with human diseases and pathological status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c34">34</xref>). In the future, analysis of all transcripts that a gene can encode in different cells or tissues will provide important insights into normal cellular physiology as well as into some disease processes.</p><p>DHPLC has been used successfully for SNP analysis but has not previously been used to search for sequence variation in transcripts. The single base pair changes caused by RNA editing are among the most subtle sequence alterations that can occur during RNA processing. Detection of editing clearly benefits from using a very sensitive method like DHPLC that can detect editing occurring at a very low percentage (3&#x00025;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f3">3</xref>) as well as subtle splicing events (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f5">5</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively spliced exons can be detected by different methods, one of the most commonly used being the alignment of multiple ESTs to the genomic sequence using specific databases such as ISIS, TAP or HASDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c37">37</xref>). The limitation of this method is the misdetection of rare splicing events that are amplified less efficiently or splicing events localised far from the 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends of the mRNA, considering that most of the ESTs correspond to the ends of the transcripts. In addition, the risks of chimeric ESTs and sequencing artefacts have to be considered. To determine how sensitive bioinformatics is to detect micro-exons, we looked for a micro-exon (<italic>NP</italic>) in the mouse genomic sequence of Cacna1&#x003b1; between exons 27 and 31. Bioinformatics programs did not detect the micro-exon, although it is present in brain cDNAs. In addition, there are still gaps in the mouse genomic sequence. This emphasises the importance of alternative methods to detect micro-exons.</p><p>However, despite these disadvantages, bioinformatics does provide a large source of &#x02018;hypothetical&#x02019; new spliced variants, but fast and cheap methods are necessary to verify all this potential. One method, routinely used at present, is based on RT&#x02013;PCR of hypothetical spliced products and gel electrophoresis, but this method fails in detecting mutually exclusive exons of the same length or micro-exons, as identified in this study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f6">6</xref>). In addition, direct sequencing of RT&#x02013;PCR products fails to detect RNA editing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f4">4</xref>B).</p><p>Microarray technology takes advantage of bioinformatics to detect alternative splicing using oligo probes that span specific exon&#x02013;exon junctions. However, if bioinformatics fails to detect splice sites, microarray techniques reflect these limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c38">38</xref>). Microarrays cannot be used to screen all the post-transcriptional modifications that a single gene can produce and cannot be used to detect unknown splicing events.</p><p>DHPLC is a very sensitive method that can detect one base change directly in a crude RT&#x02013;PCR. The major advantages of this method are that single nucleotide substitutions, deletions and insertions are detected successfully within 3&#x02013;7 min in unpurified RT&#x02013;PCR products (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f3">3</xref>), the sample loading and analysis are essentially automated and a few nanograms of RT&#x02013;PCR products are required for the analysis. These features and its low cost make DHPLC one of the most powerful tools for the analysis of different transcripts. Using DHPLC to detect subtle RNA processing events will be most useful in situations where the primer sets and DHPLC conditions are established for the same transcript that can be analysed in different tissues or during different stages of development or to compare the same transcript between normal and diseased tissue.</p><p>Identifying rare post-transcriptional events that happen in a subset of cells in a particular tissue is becoming very important. The combination of single cell RT&#x02013;PCR with DHPLC analysis could be used instead of sequencing a large number of cDNAs considering that DHPLC is a fast method and at least 10 times less expensive than sequencing reactions due to savings in reagent and labour costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c39">39</xref>).</p><p>In this study we have been able to take advantage of inbred mouse strains to reduce the background due to genomic SNPs. One problem with using DHPLC to analyse human transcripts is that the heterogeneity observed for the A&#x02192;G substitution could be due to SNPs. Our use of inbred mice in this study largely eliminates this problem. Now that both genomic and cDNA sequences are becoming available from the same species, DHPLC could become a powerful tool in analysing mouse transcripts to develop a full catalogue of alternatively spliced and modified transcripts. Genes with shared functions in two distantly related organisms should maintain a level of conservation within the coding sequence and splicing variants during evolution, so that the analysis of mouse transcripts by DHPLC could define a prototype for transcript complexity in mammals.</p></sec><sec><title>Alternative splicing events detected in Cacna1&#x003b1; transcripts by DHPLC</title><p>The PCR product tot3 when analysed by DHPLC showed an altered peak (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f5">5</xref>B) due to a mixture of PCR products that either did or did not contain the 6 nt insertion (two amino acids, <italic>NP</italic>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f6">6</xref>A). This micro-exon is present in 40&#x00025; of the sequences analysed and it consists of an insertion in the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments IVS3 and IVS4 of the Cacna1&#x003b1; transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f1">1</xref>). The <italic>NP</italic> micro-exon was previously identified in exactly the same position in the rat orthologue of this ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c41">41</xref>). In particular, it was found that &#x0002b;NP and &#x02013;NP transcripts are expressed in different regions of the rat nervous system and the &#x02013;NP variant activates a calcium channel at a rate 1.7-fold faster compared with the &#x0002b;NP variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c41">41</xref>). A micro-exon of two amino acids (HD) is also found in 47.9&#x00025; of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b1;1 subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel Dmca1A at the same position (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f7">7</xref>A).</p><p>The region just in front of the helix IVS4 in the voltage-gated calcium channel is very important for the physiology of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c40">40</xref>). It is interesting that this region of the transcript is the target for subtle RNA processing events such as RNA editing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or the inclusion of a micro-exon in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The high frequency of inclusion of these micro-exons of only two amino acids in vertebrates and invertebrates suggests that perhaps the length of the extracellular loop between IVS3 and IVS4 is critical.</p><p>Another PCR product (tot6) of the Cacna1&#x003b1; ion channel also displayed an altered DHPLC profile. This PCR product gave a single homogeneous band by gel electrophoresis but analysis by DHPLC revealed that it was a mixed PCR population. Sequencing the PCR products revealed the presence of two exons of the same length but different in nucleotide composition. Of the sequences analysed, 30&#x00025; contained this mutually exclusive exon, located in the C-terminus immediately after the fourth repeated domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f1">1</xref>). What is surprising is that it is very homologous at the amino acid level to the exon that it replaces with only 10 amino acids different out of a total 32 residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f6">6</xref>B). The sequence is different at the nucleotide level, suggesting that there is high selective pressure to retain these amino acids. This alternative exon is in a region of the ion channel identified by homology as a &#x02018;calcium binding region&#x02019; and could be involved in binding of a specific protein&#x0002f;modulator with different affinities for the two different protein isoforms. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that a similar alternative exon, with 96&#x00025; amino acid identity, is also present at the same position in the homologous human channel (GenBank accession no. O00555).</p><p>In 25&#x00025; of the sequences analysed both the <italic>NP</italic> micro-exon and the alternative C-terminus exon were present. The NP micro-exon in rat brain transcript has been found in specific areas of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c41">41</xref>). Considering we found a correlation between <italic>NP</italic> micro-exon splicing and the C-terminus exon, it is possible that both exons are preferentially expressed in mouse Cacna1&#x003b1; in specific regions or cell subsets of the mouse brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Non-conservation of RNA editing targets between vertebrates and invertebrates?</title><p>RNA editing of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcript encoding the &#x003b1;1 subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel is targeted mainly to the transmembrane regions that come together to form the ion pore and voltage sensor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf516f1">1</xref>). The transmembrane regions of the ion channels are strongly conserved throughout the gene family and only a few amino acid changes can be tolerated without affecting the function of the channel. We searched for evidence of RNA editing in the same regions of the homologous mouse Cacna1&#x003b1; transcript within seven RT&#x02013;PCR products using DHPLC. No editing was found in the homologous mouse transcript in regions corresponding to portions of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ion channel where editing produces amino acid changes. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Cacna1&#x003b1; mouse channel could show additional post-transcriptional modifications to the ones that we found in this study, considering that we analysed RT&#x02013;PCRs from RNA from whole mouse brain and not specific RNA products from a selected subset of cells of the mouse brain.</p><p>Why is the edited form of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> channel not conserved in the mouse transcript at the same positions? One explanation could be that these channels have evolved by sequential duplication events in chordate genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c29">29</xref>); in this situation the genome can produce a large number of different transcripts by alternative splicing and not require RNA editing to generate variability. This hypothesis is intriguing if we think that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> there are a small number of genes encoding voltage-gated calcium channels and the editing could be a method to create diverse transcripts in combination with alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf516c14">14</xref>). As of yet we do not understand why the fly edits transcripts encoding the voltage-gated calcium channel and what biological role the isoforms have. It is possible that their function is very specialised and unique to flies. Therefore if this function is not required in vertebrates, the ability to edit voltage-gated calcium transcript has been lost.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf516f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Schematic representation of the &#x003b1;1 subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel.
