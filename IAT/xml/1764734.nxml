AAH and Humbug expression were significantly increased in response to insulin and IGF-I stimulation, and these effects were associated with increased directional motility. However, over-expression of AAH and not Humbug significantly increased motility. Treatment with chemical inhibitors of Akt, Erk MAPK, or cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk-5) significantly reduced IGF-I stimulated AAH and Humbug expression and motility relative to vehicle-treated control cells. In addition, significantly increased AAH and Humbug expression and directional motility were observed in cells co-transfected with Cdk-5 plus its p35 or p25 regulatory partner. Further studies demonstrated that activated Cdk-5 mediated its stimulatory effects on AAH through Erk MAPK and PI3 kinase.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>AAH and Humbug are over-expressed in SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells, and their mRNAs are regulated by insulin/IGF-1 signaling through Erk MAPK, PI3 kinase-Akt, and Cdk-5, which are known mediators of cell migration.

AAH is a member of the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family of molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and catalyzes the hydroxylation of specific aspartyl and asparaginyl residues in EGF-like domains of certain proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The consensus sequence for AAH hydroxylation is present in Notch, Jagged, and extracellular matrix molecules such as laminin and tenascin, which have demonstrated roles in cell motility or adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The proposed AAH hydroxylation reaction uses molecular oxygen to form succinate, carbon dioxide, and 3-hydroxyaspartic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The catalytic domain resides within the carboxyl terminus and corresponding ~52 kD cleavage product of AAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The ~200 kB AAH gene encodes 3 proteins, AAH, Humbug, and Junctin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], which are generated by alternative splicing and exon sharing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There are two AAH mRNA transcripts that encode identical proteins, which differ only in length of the 3'-untranslated region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Humbug is derived from the first 13 exons of the AAH gene, and lacks the C-terminal region that is responsible for catalytic activity in AAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Junctin is the smallest of the 4 transcripts, and contains Exons 1A, 2, 3, 4A, and 5A of the AAH gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, all 3 AAH-related proteins share common N-terminal exons that encode a trans-membrane domain in addition to a portion of the cytoplasmic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] but differ in the length and function of the C-terminus.</p><p>AAH is abundantly expressed in a broad range of malignant neoplasms and transformed cells lines, including those of hepatic, biliary, breast, intestinal, pulmonary, pancreatic, and neural origin, whereas most normal mature tissues have relatively low levels of AAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, placenta is a notable exception in that motile and invasive trophoblasts express high levels of AAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Initial studies established a convincing role for AAH in malignancy by demonstrating transformation of NIH3T3 cells that were stably transfected with the human AAH cDNA, and partial reversal of the transformed phenotype in cells that were transfected with a dominant negative AAH mutant that lacked catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In situ studies demonstrated that the highest levels of AAH immunoreactivity were localized at the infiltrating margins of malignant neoplasms, rather than in their centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The peripheral distribution of prominent AAH immunoreactivity was not correlated with zonal differences in cell viability or proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and correspondingly, proliferation states that were un-related to transformation, such as hepatocyte or bile duct regeneration, and pre-malignant conditions such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, were found to have low (normal) levels of AAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, enhanced AAH expression is not correlated with cell proliferation per se. Instead, the findings of increased AAH immunoreactivity along the infiltrating margins of tumors and in metastatic foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], together with the high levels of AAH in trophoblastic cells, which are normally motile and invasive, led us to hypothesize that AAH has a functional role in cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Humbug is also abundantly expressed in malignant neoplasms of diverse histogeneses, including carcinomas of hepatic, biliary, colonic, and pulmonary origin, as well as various transformed cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Humbug can bind calcium, and over-expression of Humbug results in increased intracellular levels of calcium due to its release from intracellular stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus far, Junctin expression has been characterized in skeletal and cardiac muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but not in malignant neoplastic cells. Like Humbug, Junctin has a role in regulating calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, Junctin can physically associate with the ryanodine receptor complex, and may have an important role in stabilizing the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Compared with AAH, less is known about the possible function and expression of Humbug and Junctin in relation to malignancy, tumor progression, and motility.</p><p>In previous studies, a role for AAH in relation to motility was demonstrated in part by the significantly reduced levels of both AAH and directional motility observed in cells that were transfected with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides that targeted the 5'end of AAH mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the molecular characterization of Humbug, its structural relationship to AAH, high-level expression in malignant neoplasms, and the realization that the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides used in those experiments would have also inhibited Humbug, prompted us to further examine the expression and regulation of AAH, Humbug, and Junctin, and determine if Humbug has a role in cell motility. The strategy for examining the regulation and function of AAH and related genes evolved from a series of independent experiments demonstrating that: 1) IGF-1 promotes migration of immature neuroblastic and neuroblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; 2) IGF-I can stimulate AAH expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; and 3) cyclin dependent kinase-5 (Cdk-5) is an important regulator of neuronal migration in the developing central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The present work characterizes IGF-I regulation and downstream signaling pathways through Erk MAPK, PI3 Kinase-Akt, and Cdk-5 that modulate AAH, Humbug, and Junctin expression and directional motility in SH-Sy5y human neuroblastoma cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>SH-Sy5y human neuroblastoma cells, and PNET1 and PNET2 human CNS derived primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 4 mM L-glutamine, 5 mM glucose, and 100 &#x003bc;M non-essential amino acids (Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY). PNET1 cells are poorly differentiated and exhibit rapid rates of proliferation, while PNET2 cells can be differentiated and exhibit intact growth factor-mediated signaling, similar to normal brain neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To examine growth factor modulation of AAH, Humbug, and Junctin expression, sub-confluent cultures were serum starved for 12 hours, then stimulated with IGF-1 (25 nM) for up to 24 hours. Parallel cultures were stimulated with insulin (50 nM) since insulin and IGF-1 share common signaling mechanisms, or nerve growth factor (NGF; 2.5 ng/ml), which has distinct signaling mechanisms, but promotes a range of neuronal functions including neurite extension and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. To identify the signaling pathways likely to mediate growth factor stimulated effects on AAH, Humbug, and Junctin expression, the cells were serum-starved over-night, then treated with a chemical kinase inhibitor (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), followed by IGF-1 stimulation (serum-free medium) for 24 hours. The cells were analyzed for AAH, Humbug, and Junctin mRNA expression as described below.

In each case, the cause of death was underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease, and the post-mortem intervals were less than 12 hours. The brain tissue samples were originally collected and banked for use in research. Adjacent blocks of fresh tissue were either fixed in neutral buffered formalin or snap frozen in a dry ice-methanol bath and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin and histological sections stained with Luxol Fast Blue-Hematoxylin and Eosin were used to confirm the intactness of brain parenchyma. The fresh frozen tissue was used to isolate RNA and measure gene expression by real time quantitative RT-PCR. The use of human postmortem tissue in these studies was approved by the Rhode Island Hospital-Lifespan Committee on the Protection of Human Subjects Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec><title>Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies were used to measure relative mRNA abundance of AAH, Humbug, and Junctin.

As control, cells were transfected with recombinant plasmid expressing the luciferase gene (pLuc) that was ligated into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) in which gene expression was regulated by a CMV promoter.</p><p>To examine the effects of AAH or Humbug over-expression on directional motility, parallel cultures seeded into 35 mm<sup>2 </sup>wells with 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well were transiently transfected with 4 &#x003bc;g plasmid DNA expressing AAH (pAAH), Humbug (pHMBG), or luciferase (pLuc; negative control), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To evaluate the role of Cdk-5 in relation to AAH, Humbug, and Junctin expression and motility, SH-Sy5y cells were transiently transfected with recombinant plasmids expressing Cdk-5, its regulatory partners, p25 or p35, Cdk-5+p25, or Cdk-5+p35, each of which was under the control of a CMV promoter. Cells were transfected with 2 &#x003bc;g of each recombinant plasmid. However, to over-express a single gene, cells were co-transfected with 2 &#x003bc;g recombinant plasmid + 2 &#x003bc;g empty vector. The use of Lipofectamine 2000 resulted in transfection efficiencies of 50%-60% in SH-Sy5y cultures, as demonstrated by co-transfection with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter construct and fluorescence microscopy. In addition, transfection efficiency, time course, and peak period of gene expression were determined by luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI) of cells co-transfected with equivalent amounts of pLuc (0.5 &#x003bc;g). Finally, studies were performed to demonstrate that trypsinization and re-seeding of transiently transfected cells into fresh chambers did not significantly alter the course of transgene expression (luciferase activity) (data not shown), indicating that transiently transfected cells could be used in directional motility assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Motility Assay</title><p>Directional motility was measured using the ATP Luminescence-Based Motility/Invasion (ALMI) assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Briefly, 200 &#x003bc;l of medium containing 25 nM IGF-1 was placed in the bottom of each blind well chamber (Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg, MD). An 8 &#x003bc;M pore diameter polycarbonate membrane was seated just above the trophic factor-containing medium and tightly fixed in place with the screw cap that formed the upper chamber. 100,000 viable cells (demonstrated by Trypan Blue exclusion) were seeded into the upper chamber in serum-free medium. Migration was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C in a conventional CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. The ATPLite assay (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT) was used to quantify the number of cells remaining on upper surface of the membrane (non-migrated), located on the under-surface of the membrane (migrated, adherent), or distributed in the lower chamber (migrated, non-adherent) since the ATP levels are linearly correlated with cell number between 10<sup>3 </sup>and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>To measure ATP luminescence, non-motile cells were removed from the upper surface of the membrane using a cotton swab.

Completeness of cell harvesting was monitored microscopically. Cells adherent to the undersurface of the membrane were harvested and lysed by submerging the wiped membrane in 200 &#x003bc;l of diluted ATP lysis solution in a second well of a black microplate. Cells in the lower chamber were resuspended and added directly to 25 &#x003bc;l of undiluted ATP lysis solution in a third well of a black microplate. After 5-minutes incubation with agitation to ensure complete cell lysis, ATPLite substrate (25 &#x003bc;l) was added to each well. The reactions were mixed for 2 minutes by gentle platform agitation. Subsequently, the plates were dark adapted for 5 minutes and then luminescence was measured in a TopCount Microplate reader (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). The percentages of non-motile, motile adherent, motile non-adherent cells were calculated for each assay.

PNET2 cells, which are of CNS origin, had similar profiles of AAH, Humbug, and Junctin mRNA transcripts compared with normal infant brains. The significantly higher levels of AAH and Humbug in SH-Sy5y and PNET cells compared with normal brain are consistent with previous reports demonstrating considerably higher levels of AAH and Humbug in transformed compared with non-transformed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, the higher levels of AAH, Humbug, and Junctin in infant compared with adult human brains suggest that AAH-related molecules are developmentally regulated in the CNS.</p></sec><sec><title>AAH Promotes SH-Sy5y Cell Motility</title><p>The structural relationship of Humbug to AAH raised the possibility that Humbug may also promote cell motility. In previous studies, we used antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against the 5'end of the AAH mRNA to demonstrate AAH's role in directional motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, since those reagents would have also inhibited Humbug expression, further studies were needed to determine if AAH alone or together with Humbug mediated cell migration. Herein, we demonstrated that SH-Sy5y cells transfected with pAAH, and not pHMBG, had significantly increased motility relative to pLuc-transfected control cells. Real time RT-PCR studies confirmed that increased motility was associated with increased AAH and not Humbug or Junctin expression. However, these findings did not entirely exclude a role for Humbug since the endogenous expression levels were already high, and further increases may have had a negligible effect. In this regard, Humbug has a demonstrated role in regulating intracellular calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], and although Humbug may not directly mediate cell motility, its modulation of intracellular pools of calcium may be critical for cytoskeleton reorganization that may be required for cell migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Growth Factor Regulation of AAH, Humbug, and Junctin Expression</title><p>Previous observations suggested that AAH expression was modulated by growth factor stimulation. Since AAH, Humbug, and Junctin are transcribed from the same gene, it was of interest to determine the degree to which each of these mRNA transcripts is regulated by growth factor stimulation, particularly insulin and IGF-1. Our focus on insulin and IGF-1 signaling pathways stemmed from earlier studies demonstrating over-expression of AAH in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and in transgenic mice that over-express IRS-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The experiments herein demonstrated that AAH and Humbug mRNA's were increased in response to insulin or IGF-1 stimulation, and that Humbug but not AAH expression was increased by NGF stimulation. In addition, the studies showed that Junctin mRNA levels were not significantly modulated by insulin, IGF-1, or NGF. These results indicate that AAH and Humbug expression are transcriptionally regulated by growth factor stimulation, and that since the responses to growth factors are similar but not identical, AAH and Humbug may be differentially regulated by growth factor signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Downstream Mediators of AAH and Humbug Expression in SH-Sy5y cells</title><p>The stimulatory effects of insulin and IGF-1 are mediated by ligand binding and activation of the intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], which then tyrosyl phosphorylates exogenous cytosolic proteins, including insulin receptor substrate molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Tyrosyl phosphorylated IRS molecules transmit signals downstream to promote a broad range of functions including growth, survival, energy metabolism, and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. The studies herein demonstrated expression of IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-4 in SH-Sy5y cells, but substantially higher levels of IRS-1 followed by IRS-4 compared with IRS-2, suggesting that most of the insulin/IGF-1 mediated signaling is transmitted through IRS-1. In the normal human brain, the pattern of IRS expression differed from that observed in SH-Sy5y cells in that the overall levels of IRS gene expression were significantly lower, and IRS-1 was the least abundant while IRS-2 was the most abundant of the three transcripts. This alteration in IRS gene expression, particularly with regard to the up-regulation of IRS-1 in SH-Sy5y cells, is reminiscent of the findings in hepatocellular carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], and suggests that IRS protein levels may be critical for regulating robustness of insulin and IGF-1-transmitted signals, including those that stimulate AAH. In this regard, it is noteworthy that in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, IRS-1 over-expression is associated with increased insulin and IGF-1-stimulated growth and survival signaling, in addition to AAH over-expression relative to the normal liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that growth factor stimulated cell motility is mediated by signaling through the Erk MAPK and PI3 kinase-Akt pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In addition, a probable role for Cdk-5 in relation to neuronal migration during development was demonstrated in mice that were deficient for the Cdk-5 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. A potential link between insulin and IGF-1 signaling and Cdk-5 activation was suggested by the previous finding that p35 expression was increased by IGF-1 stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Our studies demonstrated prominent IGF-1 stimulation of AAH and Humbug, and significant inhibition of these responses in cells treated with chemical inhibitors of Erk MAPK, Akt, or Cdk-5. These results suggest that IGF-1 stimulated AAH and Humbug expression are signaled through Erk MAPK, Akt, and Cdk-5, and that the effects of these kinases on AAH and Humbug expression are mediated at the level of transcription. The finding that chemical inhibitors of Erk MAPK or PI3 kinase blocked the Cdk-5 stimulated AAH and Humbug expression provides evidence for convergence of these pathways in the regulation of gene expression. Finally, we also observed significantly increased AAH protein but not mRNA expression following LiCl treatment, which inhibits GSK-3&#x003b2;, independent of Akt. The mechanism of this effect is under investigation, but preliminary results suggest that GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylation of AAH protein leads to its degradation [Cheng, Tong, and de la Monte, Unpublished].</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated a definitive role for growth factor stimulated MAPK mediated cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Erk MAPK signaling can mediate motility of neoplastic cells by activating Rac1 and RhoA GTPases, which promote membrane ruffling, actin-cytoskeletal reorganization, and attendant formation of lamellopodia and filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Similarly, the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway regulates the assembly and re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>] and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] by activating Rac1/Cdc42 in response to growth factor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. The downstream effects of Rac1 on cell motility are mediated through Pak1 phosphorylation of LIM kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>], which phosphorylates targets such as cofilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>], which in turn promotes actin depolymerization, thereby allowing changes in cell shape and structure. In addition, Rac1 functions through Cdk-5 and p35 to phosphorylate and down-regulate Pak1, which then results in increased neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Therefore, growth factor stimulated Rac1 function has an important role in dynamically regulating cytoskeletal reorganization as required for cell migration. Importantly, the convergence of pathways mediating IGF-1 stimulated AAH and Humbug expression may occur through Rac1 and RhoA signaling.</p><p>The finding that Cdk-5 activity has a functional role in positively regulating AAH and Humbug expression in SH-Sy5y cells is of particular interest because previous studies provided in vivo evidence that Cdk-5 mediates neuronal migration in the brain during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In this regard, mutant mice lacking either the p35 or Cdk-5 gene have low levels of Cdk-5 activity and exhibit severe defects in neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Cdk5 and its regulatory partner, p35 or p39, have also been implicated in growth cone motility during axon extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. One mechanism of Cdk-5-mediated neuronal migration involves interactions between Cdk5-p35 and Rac GTPase, which is required for growth cone motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Cdk-5 can mediate its effects on neuronal migration through POU domain-containing transcription factors such as Brn 1 and Brn 2, which have roles in neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] or MEF-2, which is a target of Cdk-5-mediated phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], and has a known role in cellular differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. Although Cdk-5-mediated neuronal migration has been studied mainly in post-mitotic neurons, the present work demonstrates that Cdk-5 signaling is also relevant to immature proliferating and transformed neuronal cells. Our results demonstrating that increased Cdk-5 activity results in increased AAH and Humbug expression are consistent with the concept that Cdk-5 mediates neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>], and further suggest that AAH and Humbug are downstream targets of Cdk-5 signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>AAH and Humbug are over-expressed in SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells, and their mRNAs are regulated by insulin/IGF-1 signaling through Erk MAPK, PI3 kinase-Akt, and Cdk-5, which are known mediators of cell migration.
