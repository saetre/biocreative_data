Differential gene expression analysis of CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes from subjects infected with HIV-1 revealed increased expression of sialoadhesin (Sn, CD169, Siglec 1), a cell adhesion molecule first described in a subset of macrophages activated in chronic inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We analyzed sialoadhesin expression on CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes by flow cytometry and found significantly higher expression in subjects with elevated viral loads compared to subjects with undetectable viral loads. In cultured CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes isolated from healthy individuals, sialoadhesin expression was induced by interferon-&#x003b1; and interferon-&#x003b3; but not tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;. Using a stringent binding assay, sialoadhesin-expressing monocytes adsorbed HIV-1 through interaction with the sialic acid residues on the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120. Furthermore, monocytes expressing sialoadhesin facilitated HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic> infection of permissive cells, which occurred in the absence of monocyte self-infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Increased sialoadhesin expression on CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes occurred in response to HIV-1 infection with maximum expression associated with high viral load. We show that interferons induce sialoadhesin in primary CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes, which is consistent with an antiviral response during viremia. Our findings suggest that circulating sialoadhesin-expressing monocytes are capable of binding HIV-1 and effectively delivering virus to target cells thereby enhancing the distribution of HIV-1. Sialoadhesin could disseminate HIV-1 to viral reservoirs during monocyte immunosurveillance or migration to sites of inflammation and then facilitate HIV-1 infection of permissive cells.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood monocytes constitute an important immune cell population that is adversely impacted by HIV-1 infection. Monocytes originate in the bone marrow from myeloid precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Fogg1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and are released to circulation where their half-life in humans is about three days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Whitelaw1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. During their short life span, monocytes can differentiate to become either macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Leon1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> with prolific degradative capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Delamarre1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> or dendritic cells (DCs), which effectively prime T cells by presenting antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Trombetta1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. While macrophages and DCs are readily infected by R5 HIV-1 strains, monocytes are considered refractory to HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-McElrath1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> with &#x0003c;1&#x00025; of blood monocytes infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Sonza1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Even at this low rate of infection, HIV-1 appears to enter the central nervous system (CNS) via infiltrating monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-FischerSmith1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Liu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, which through the release of neurotoxins initiates the neurodegenerative processes that may end in HIV-associated dementia (HAD).</p><p>While the frequency of HAD has decreased with prevalent use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), neurocognitive impairment remains a reality in a substantial number of individuals infected with HIV-1. A link between viral load and impaired neural function is suggested by a recent study in non-human primates indicating that monocytes may be the link between HIV-1 in the periphery and HAD. Using an SIV-infected macaque model, Williams et al., reported that neuronal injury was coincident with viremia and an activated monocyte subset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Williams1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. By lowering the systemic viral load with antiretroviral therapy, there was a commensurate reduction in the number of infected and activated monocytes and a dramatic improvement in neuronal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Williams1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations establish a compelling link between high viral load, activated monocytes, an increased frequency of monocyte trafficking and a direct, negative impact on neuronal function.</p><p>To identify cellular factors that might contribute to HIV-1 invasion of the CNS, we examined gene expression profiles of CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes from individuals infected with HIV-1. Using high-density cDNA microarrays, we compared gene expression profiles from subjects with high viral load (&#x0003e;10,000 RNA copies/ml), subjects with low viral load (&#x0003c;10,000 RNA copies/ml) and HIV-1 seronegative controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Pulliam1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed a monocyte gene expression profile related to HIV-1 infection that indicated a &#x0201c;hybrid&#x0201d; monocyte with increased expression of macrophage-associated markers: monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2), CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), and sialoadhesin (Sn, CD169, Siglec 1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Pulliam1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This was the first report of Sn expression in circulating CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes.</p><p>Sialoadhesin was first described as a lymphocyte cell adhesion molecule expressed on macrophages localized in secondary lymphoid organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-vandenBerg1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and later as a protein restricted to a subset of activated macrophages related to inflammatory responses associated with rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Hartnell1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, Sn has been implicated in diverse pathogenic processes including rhinovirus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Kirchberger1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Vanderheijden1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In HIV infection, Sn is induced to high levels on CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes shortly after infection, possibly contributing to dysregulation of the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-vanderKuyl1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, shorter Siglecs bind sialic acid conjugates in a <italic>cis</italic> orientation.</p><p>In this study, we report that HIV-1 infection drives monocyte expression of Sn, which correlates with viral load in the periphery. We identify interferons (IFN), which have been detected in the periphery of individuals infected with HIV-1, as inducers of Sn expression in cultured monocytes. Furthermore, using a constitutive Sn-expressing cell line and IFN-stimulated primary monocytes, we describe how Sn avidly binds HIV-1 and effectively facilitates <italic>trans</italic> infection of permissive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sialoadhesin expression correlates with viral load</title><p>We previously reported elevated Sn gene expression on CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes from subjects infected with HIV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Pulliam1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine if Sn was differentially expressed on peripheral monocytes, immunomagnetically sorted CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes from HIV-1 seropositive subjects (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;24) and HIV-1 seronegative controls (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) were analyzed by flow cytometry.

In a follow-up study, three seropositive subjects, initially with detectable viral loads and high Sn expression, were subsequently retested for Sn expression after successful HAART treatment suppressed viral replication to &#x0003c;50 copies/ml.

DC-SIGN has been shown to rapidly internalize intact HIV-1 into non-degradative compartments where the virus remains competent to infect permissive cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Kwon1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, it has been shown that DC-SIGN-mediated internalization is not required for <italic>trans</italic>-enhancement but instead DC-SIGN facilitates productive <italic>cis</italic>-infection of immature DCs and subsequent infection of T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Burleigh1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Also it has been reported that DC-SIGN is not required for DC-mediated <italic>trans</italic> infection based on observations that neither down-regulating DC-SIGN expression nor binding of an anti-DC-SIGN antibody adversely impacted DC-mediated <italic>trans</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Boggiano1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. By comparison, our experiments conclusively show that Sn-dependent <italic>trans</italic> infection is not due to productive infection of TSn cells since <italic>trans</italic> infection assays were done in the presence of indinavir, a potent HIV protease inhibitor. Furthermore, our results are consistent with Sn being solely responsible for <italic>trans</italic> infection since the anti-Sn mAb 7D2, which recognizes the Sn sialic acid binding region, effectively abrogates <italic>trans</italic> infection of the reporter cells.</p><p>A possible mechanism that would explain Sn-enhanced infectivity would be that by binding both virus and target cells, Sn effectively increases the localized virus concentration bringing HIV-1 in close proximity to CD4 and chemokine coreceptors on the target cell. Early characterization of Sn expressed on macrophages identified it as a lymphocyte adhesion molecule that binds sialic acid conjugates on T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-vandenBerg1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, specifically CD43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-vandenBerg2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Having clearly demonstrated that Sn binds HIV-1, Sn could possibly perform dual functions, with some Sn protein capturing free HIV-1 while other Sn molecules would engage sialic acid conjugates on the target cell. This interaction would overcome the electrostatic repulsive forces created by net negative charges on the virus and the target cell surface. Repulsive forces modulate virus-cell interactions as demonstrated by treating primary mononuclear cells with purified sialidase, which increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection by reducing electrostatic repulsion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001967-Sun1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The hypothesis is that desialylation enhances the interaction of viral gp120 and cell associated CD4/chemokine coreceptors thereby promoting HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation. These observations suggest that HIV-1 can exploit either condition: When sialic acid conjugates are intact, Sn binds the virus and subsequently delivers the virus to permissive cells. Or, if sialic acids are cleaved from gp120 by endogenous sialidase activity, the electrostatic repulsion is reduced permitting viral interaction with the cellular CD4/chemokine coreceptors.</p><p>In this study, we used human monocytes and a stably transduced cell line to demonstrate the capacity of Sn to bind HIV-1 and facilitate the <italic>trans</italic> infection of permissive cells. While the biological relevance of Sn expression on circulating monocytes remains to be determined, the potential impact of enhancing viral infectivity and possibility disseminating HIV-1 via monocyte trafficking to the CNS are clearly important considerations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Monocytes for <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were isolated from HIV-1 seronegative healthy donors (Blood Centers of the Pacific, San Francisco, CA).
