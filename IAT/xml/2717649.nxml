In the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryo, the centrosome, which is attached to the nucleus via ZYG-12, organizes the microtubule network. In this study, we investigate ZYG-12 function and microtubule organization before embryo formation in the gonad. Surprisingly, ZYG-12 is dispensable for centrosome attachment in the germline. However, ZYG-12&#x02013;mediated recruitment of dynein to the nuclear envelope is required to maintain microtubule organization, membrane architecture, and nuclear positioning within the syncytial gonad. We examined &#x003b3;-tubulin localization and microtubule regrowth after depolymerization to identify sites of nucleation in germ cells. &#x003b3;-Tubulin localizes to the plasma membrane in addition to the centrosome, and regrowth initiates at both sites. Because we do not observe organized microtubules around <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic> mutant nuclei with attached centrosomes, we propose that gonad architecture, including membrane and nuclear positioning, is determined by microtubule nucleation at the plasma membrane combined with tension on the microtubules by dynein anchored at the nucleus by ZYG-12.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue and organ architecture are key to biological function. Tissue architecture, in turn, is largely determined by constituent cell architecture, including global cell shape as well as subcellular positioning of the nucleus and other organelles. The cytoskeleton is responsible for generating and maintaining morphology and organelle organization in cells with a variety of shapes and functions (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li and Gundersen, 2008</xref>). We do not yet understand how diverse cells use a common set of cytoskeletal elements and similar basic tools to manipulate these elements to generate distinct architectures. Cells manipulate these cytoskeletal elements using regulatory proteins, including nucleators, depolymerases, severing proteins, and other binding proteins. Additionally, motor proteins transport cargo along cytoskeletal tracks, and anchored motor proteins pull on the cytoskeleton itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>) to achieve the desired organization.</p><p>Although all cytoskeletal components make significant contributions to the establishment and maintenance of architectural organization, dramatic changes in microtubule organization upon differentiation and the extensive diversity in microtubule organization among cell types speaks to their key role in cell architecture. The concept of a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), a site of &#x003b3;-tubulin localization that nucleates microtubule formation, is used to explain the origins of various microtubule arrangements. In dividing cells, the nucleus-attached centrosome nucleates a characteristic array with the plus ends of the microtubules extending radially toward the cell periphery. However, differentiated cells have various alternative organizations in which microtubules are nucleated at noncentrosomal sites via mechanisms that are less well understood. For example, during differentiation of myoblasts, the microtubule cytoskeleton is remodeled from a centrosome-nucleated radial structure to a series of parallel arrays along the long axis of the myotube that are likely nucleated at nuclei with plus ends extending to the poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tassin et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bugnard et al., 2005</xref>). Polarized epithelia provide a second dramatic example of an alternative microtubule cytoskeleton; epithelial cells contain linear arrays of microtubules oriented with minus ends at the apex and plus ends extending to the basal side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bre et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Meads and Schroer, 1995</xref>). In epidermal development, epidermal cells progress from a stage with a centrosomal array to a stage with a parallel array as microtubule-anchoring proteins are relocalized from the centrosome to the cell junctions near the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meng et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, dramatic alterations in microtubule organization often accompany differentiation. To comprehend the events that underlie cell differentiation and development of tissue architecture, it is important to understand how diverse microtubule arrays are organized.</p><p>We use the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> hermaphrodite gonad as a model to probe the molecular mechanisms that establish and maintain tissue architecture. The gonad consists of an orderly arrangement of nuclei within a large syncytium that is surrounded by somatic gonad sheath cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The global architecture of the gonad as well as the cell cycle state of the nuclei changes as nuclei progress from the distal gonad tips to the proximal region. A distal tip cell caps each gonad arm and acts to maintain a mass of mitotic nuclei. As new cell divisions push nuclei proximally and away from the distal tip cells, nuclei initiate a meiotic program in the transition zone. Each meiotic nucleus is maintained at the periphery of the gonad in a partially enclosed membrane compartment with a cytoplasmic bridge that connects to a central cytoplasmic pool, the rachis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hirsh et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hall et al., 1999</xref>). Nuclei progress through the pachytene region into the loop of the gonad where changes in cell shape, including acquisition of extra cytoplasm, and full cellularization lead to production of large oocytes. A transverse view of the distal gonad arm reveals &#x0223c;12 germline nuclei abutting the gonad sheath and surrounding the rachis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). When viewed from the lateral side, germline nuclei are evenly spaced at the periphery throughout the distal gonad arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). This regularly arrayed pattern of germline nuclei within the gonad seems important for proper oogenesis and reproduction. Nuclear position in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including that of germline nuclei, is subject to active control by the cytoskeleton and by extracellular matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hedgecock and Thomson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thompson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). However, the mechanisms that maintain the evenly distributed peripheral pattern of germline nuclei are mysterious.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>zyg-12(ct350ts)</italic> disrupts the regular arrangement of germline nuclei.</bold> (A and B) Schematic lateral (A) and transverse (B) view of germline nuclear position in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad.

Current models posit that conserved SUN domain proteins bind chromatin or the nuclear lamina in the nucleus and span the inner nuclear membrane to bind to a conserved KASH domain protein partner in the inter membrane space. The KASH domain proteins span the outer nuclear membrane and interact with cytoskeletal elements in the cytoplasm. Thus, a SUN&#x02013;KASH pair can facilitate interaction of the nucleus with a cytoskeletal system, including the microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Starr and Han, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo, centrosome&#x02013;nucleus attachment is maintained via the SUN&#x02013;KASH pair, SUN-1 and ZYG-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Malone et al., 2003</xref>). Two of three alternative ZYG-12 isoforms have a transmembrane-containing KASH domain and are localized to the nuclear envelope by SUN-1, but the third ZYG-12 isoform lacks the KASH domain and localizes to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Malone et al., 2003</xref>). Interaction of these nuclear and centrosomal isoforms is proposed to mediate centrosome&#x02013;nucleus attachment, and nuclear migration clearly depends on the connection between the nucleus and the centrosome MTOC. Dynein also plays a role in embryonic pronuclear migration; depletion of <italic>C. elegans</italic> dynein subunits DLI-1 or DHC-1 causes a penetrant pronuclear congression defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gonczy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yoder and Han, 2001</xref>). These data are consistent with a model in which dynein provides the force for movement of the centrosome, whereas ZYG-12 provides centrosome&#x02013;nucleus attachment, permitting nuclear movement. ZYG-12 also interacts directly with DLI-1, the light intermediate chain of dynein, and recruits DLI-1 to the nuclear envelope in the early embryo and the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Malone et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that ZYG-12 functions as a molecular anchor on the nuclear envelope for cytoplasmic dynein. However, the role of dynein at the nuclear envelope in embryos is not clear; a <italic>zyg-12</italic> allele (<italic>or577</italic>) that abrogates ZYG-12 homodimerization but retains the dynein interaction has migration and centrosome detachment defects as severe as those of <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic>, which disrupts the dynein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Malone et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that the key function for ZYG-12 in the embryo is centrosome&#x02013;nucleus attachment.</p><p>Both SUN-1 and ZYG-12 are expressed in the germline, but neither the role of these proteins nor the role of the microtubules in germline architecture, nuclear positioning, or centrosome attachment has been investigated in the gonad. Therefore, we started our investigation of germline cytoarchitecture with ZYG-12. In this study, we reveal that, in the gonad, ZYG-12 is dispensable for centrosome attachment. However, ZYG-12 recruitment of dynein to the germ cell nuclear envelope is critical for nuclear positioning. Because both ZYG-12 function and nuclear positioning in the gonad are independent of the centrosome, we examined alternative sites of microtubule nucleation. Based on the localization of &#x003b3;-tubulin and microtubule regrowth initiation at the cytoplasmic membrane after depolymerization, we propose that gonad architecture, including germline nuclear positioning, is determined by microtubule nucleation at the plasma membrane in combination with tension on these microtubules provided by dynein that is anchored to the nuclear membrane by ZYG-12.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mutation of <italic>zyg-12</italic> results in nuclear position and oogenesis defects in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad</title><p>In the embryo, nuclear positioning requires ZYG-12 at the nuclear membrane. ZYG-12 is also localized to the nuclear envelope of germline nuclei in the syncytial <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Malone et al., 2003</xref>). To determine whether ZYG-12 has essential function in the gonad, we examined <italic>zyg-12</italic> mutant gonads for defects. To avoid the early embryonic lethality associated with disruption of ZYG-12 function, we used a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>zyg-12</italic>. We shifted postembryonic, first larval stage (L1) <italic>zyg-12(ct350 ts)</italic> animals to the restrictive temperature (25&#x000b0;C) and examined the gonad of the adults. Intriguingly, we observed disruption of the regular arrangement of nuclei within the syncytial gonad of all mutant animals. Although germline nuclei are arranged in a regular array at the periphery of the gonad in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>), germline nuclei appear randomly distributed within the gonad of the <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Furthermore, large oocytes with multiple nuclei form in the proximal gonad arm of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>) in contrast to the single nucleus in each wild-type oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>).</p><p>We used immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy to further characterize nuclear mispositioning.

In wild type, germline nuclei are evenly arranged directly under the surface of gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), and no nuclei occupy the central rachis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In contrast, in the <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic> mutant, the nuclei are disarrayed at the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>), and large numbers of nuclei have collapsed into the central rachis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). We also observed abnormal clusters of small nuclei that do not appear to have undergone oogenesis in the proximal gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic> germline nuclei relocalize rapidly to the central rachis in response to a temperature shift.</bold> (A&#x02013;F) Confocal images of gonads from egg-laying adults incubated at 25&#x000b0;C for 6 h.

To rule out a mitotic defect in the rapidly proliferating germline as the underlying cause of the disruption in nuclear arrangement, we examined gonads at shorter intervals after the shift to the restrictive temperature. We transferred <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic> egg-laying hermaphrodites that had been maintained at 15&#x000b0;C to the restrictive temperature (25&#x000b0;C) for 1, 4, or 8 h and examined the postmitotic region of their gonads. Germline nuclei retained their position after 1 h at 25&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). However, within 4 h, germline nuclei were displaced in the distal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>) and the proximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 K</xref>) gonad. 8 h after the temperature shift, the gonad was heavily disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, I and L</xref>). The majority of the distal nuclei are unlikely to have undergone mitosis during the time course of the experiment. Moreover, the nuclei in the pachytene zone of the proximal gonad are postmitotic before the temperature shift and yet become mispositioned. Wild-type germline nuclei maintained their well-aligned position when cultured at the restrictive temperature starting in L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) or after 6 h at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>). The rapid nuclear repositioning throughout the gonad after 4 h at the restrictive temperature suggests that the phenotype is independent of any mitotic defect.</p></sec><sec><title>Germ cell membranes are also disrupted in <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic> mutant gonads</title><p>To further characterize the disrupted gonad phenotype caused by <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic>, we examined cell membranes.

Although the &#x003b3;-tubulin::GFP signal is weak, it demonstrates that the bulk of the &#x003b3;-tubulin in the distal region of the gonad syncytium localizes to the germ cell membranes and to the centrosome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902101/DC1">Fig. S5 A</ext-link>).

Microtubules were effectively depolymerized after 1 h of nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 H</xref>). Consistent with the idea that the microtubule network is critical for maintaining germline nuclear position and germ cell membrane organization, both are disrupted upon microtubule depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 H</xref>). Within 30 min of nocodazole removal, staining for microtubules reveals numerous puncta that are associated with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 I</xref>; and Fig. S5, C&#x02013;E). No microtubules are observed along the circumference of the nuclear membrane at these early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 I</xref>; and Fig. S5, C and E) with the exception of those at the centrosome (Fig. S5, G and H). However, microtubules do localize along the circumference of the nuclear membrane by 1 h after nocodazole removal (Fig. S5 F). This temporal pattern of microtubule regrowth suggests that the plasma membrane is a primary microtubule nucleation site. Microtubule nucleation at the centrosome is also observed in disorganized gonads of the <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic> mutants (Fig. S5 I), again suggesting that the centrosome has the capacity to nucleate some microtubules but is insufficient to organize the global germline microtubule array.

Electron micrographs of the proximal gonad reveal several interesting features. First, there is a striking uniformity in cytoplasmic contents in the partially cellularized germ cells and the rachis, consisting primarily of an abundance of free ribosomes, some mitochondria, and rather little ER or yolk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Second, organelles such as mitochondria cross the cytoplasmic bridge from germ cell to rachis, illustrating the need for holding the larger nucleus in place and restricting its proximity to the rachis bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Third, nuclei are maintained in close proximity to the outer membrane of the germ cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Fourth, microtubule organization in the germ cells is nonuniform. There are relatively few microtubules, and they are not found in parallel arrays. They criss cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>) and approach both the plasma membrane and the nucleus, specifically contacting the nucleus at areas of electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>) in proximity to the nuclear pores (not depicted). Microtubules also contact (unpublished data) the rachis along its structural support feature, &#x0201c;the rachis coat&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hall and Altun, 2008</xref>). The coat is an electron-dense structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A, D, and E</xref>) that covers the outer surface of the rachis, with slight thickening near each germ cell opening. The coat is comprised principally of hemicentin, which is required to prevent early germ cell membranes from encapsulating multiple nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001</xref>). Mitochondria (and other potential cargoes) are often observed to lie very near to microtubules by transmission EM (TEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). Finally, bundles of microtubules cross the cytoplasmic bridge between the germ cell and the rachis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>TEM reveals microtubule organization in the germline.</bold> (A) Low power view of the distal arm of the gonad seen in lengthwise view.

This tension could explain the major structural features of the distal gonad, including the peripheral position of the nuclei in the gonad, with a central rachis devoid of nuclei, and the architecture of the plasma membrane that appears to be pulled around each nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hall et al., 1999</xref>).

ZYG-12 homodimerization is essential to maintain the nucleus&#x02013;centrosome interaction in the embryo, permitting control of nuclear positioning.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200902101_RGB_Fig9"/></fig><p>If the only considerations in the distal gonad were positioning nuclei near the edge and bringing plasma membrane extensions between nuclei, other arrangements of microtubules might work equally well. For example, microtubules could be nucleated at or near the nucleus and be pulled on by interactions with the cell cortex. This general arrangement is used frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Siegrist and Doe, 2007</xref>). However, the distal gonad is not simply a storage shed for future oocyte nuclei; it is hypothesized to function as a nurse compartment that provides material to the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wolke et al., 2007</xref>). Oocytes, which are transcriptionally quiescent, are packed with material for early embryogenesis via actin-based cytoplasmic streaming from the rachis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wolke et al., 2007</xref>). The transcriptionally active germline nuclei distal to the developing oocytes are thought to synthesize the rachis cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Starck, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gibert et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wolke et al., 2007</xref>). The high free ribosome density observed in electron micrographs is consistent with a role for these cells in synthesizing material for loading into the oocyte during cytoplasmic streaming. Thus, most trafficking from the peripheral nuclei should be directed into the central rachis of the gonad, and this transport is likely to be microtubule based. Microtubule nucleation at the plasma membrane and tension along the side of microtubules by dynein at the nuclear envelope allows the tips of microtubules to extend past the nuclei into the rachis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>), whereas other microtubule arrangements that could account for peripheral localization of nuclei as mentioned previously, would not. Interestingly, microtubules appear to make closest contact with the nucleus at sites containing electron-dense projections that lie in proximity to the nuclear pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref> and not depicted). This may provide a link for trafficking from the nucleus to the rachis. Microtubule extension from the peripheral germ cells into the rachis has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wolke et al., 2007</xref>), but the organizing factors were not known. Interactions between microtubules and the rachis coat are also likely to contribute to the integrity of the membrane in the area of the bridge to the rachis. The rachis coat appears to reinforce the tubular shape of the rachis and probably the cytoplasmic bridges between the germ cells and the rachis, as the coat covers the rachis surface with slight thickening at each opening but never extends over the surface of the germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hall et al., 1999</xref>). Interactions between this coat and local microtubules could maintain each rachis opening between a germ cell and the syncytium as the maturing germ cell migrates proximally along the rachis.</p><p>Several other biologically important features of the gonad are likely to be facilitated by anchoring nuclei at its outside edge. Unanchored nuclei could float through cytoplasmic bridges to the rachis, as observed for mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). This might block the bridge or disrupt cytoplasmic streaming in the rachis. It could also result in multiple nuclei streaming into the oocyte as seen in <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>).

The gonads of these mutants appear superficially similar to that of <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic>. However, molecular analyses suggest that these phenotypes are caused by different mechanisms such as a mitotic defect or malformed membranes.</p><p>Aspects of the phenotype observed after loss of dynein from the nuclear envelope in <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic> are also consistent with a plasma membrane&#x02013;nucleus tension model for architecture of the distal gonad. After loss of dynein from the nuclear envelope in the <italic>zyg-12(ct350)</italic> mutant, the distal gonad is rearranged such that the microtubule network encapsulates groups of nuclei while excluding others. The excluded nuclei with no surrounding microtubules clearly illustrate the lack of microtubule-organizing activity by the nuclei and their attached centrosomes. The nuclei that are encapsulated by the microtubule network no longer pull membrane around themselves and are not pulled to the periphery because tension between nuclei and the membrane is lost.</p><p>Although the proposed model for microtubule arrangement seems to make sense for the biology of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad, it appears to conflict with what is known about microtubule arrays in other cell types. Typically, microtubule minus ends are thought to be near the center of the cell and plus ends at the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Siegrist and Doe, 2007</xref>). However, the canonical rearrangement is reversed in oocyte development in other animals. For example, in the middle of <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> oocyte development, microtubules are rearranged so that minus ends emanate from the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Steinhauer and Kalderon, 2006</xref>), although in this case, the principles that underlie the arrangement of microtubules have not been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Steinhauer and Kalderon, 2006</xref>). Further afield, minus ends are also known to be far from the cell center in mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baas et al., 1988</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stone et al., 2008</xref>) neurons. In all of these examples, the positioning of the nucleation sites is not well understood. This system will provide an opportunity to identify, using a simple genetic organism, how these sites are regulated and to test whether this regulation is the key to setting up different types of architecture in different regions of a single organ.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Maintenance and culture of <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>Wild-type N2 animals were maintained at 20 or 15&#x000b0;C.
