In haem biosynthesis, the haem precursor protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) must be accumulated into the mitochondrial matrix across the inner membrane, but its mechanism is largely unclear. Here we show that adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the inner membrane transporter, contributes to haem biosynthesis by facilitating mitochondrial accumulation of its precursors. We identified that haem and PP IX specifically bind to ANT. Mitochondrial uptake of PP IX was inhibited by ADP, a known substrate of ANT. Conversely, ADP uptake into mitochondria was competitively inhibited by haem and its precursors, suggesting that haem-related porphyrins are accumulated into mitochondria via ANT. Furthermore, disruption of the ANT genes in yeast resulted in a reduction of haem biosynthesis by blocking the translocation of haem precursors into the matrix.

Haem biosynthesis is catalyzed by eight enzymes. The porphyrin ring structure is generated in the cytosol, and then the haem precursor protoporphyrinogen IX is transported into the intermembrane space of mitochondria. PP IX is generated from protoporphyrinogen IX by protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) on the outer surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Finally, haem is generated by ferrochelatase (FECH)-catalyzed iron insertion into PP IX on the inner surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003070-Ajioka1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Mitochondria are enclosed by two layers of membranes, the outer membrane and the inner membrane. In haem biosynthesis, haem precursors must be transported into the matrix across the two membranes. ABCB6 and PBR are candidate porphyrin transporters across the outer membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003070-Verma1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003070-Krishnamurthy1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

On the other hand, it is controversial how PP IX reaches the mitochondrial matrix through the inner membrane. It has been suggested that PPO binds to FECH across the inner membrane, and that this association permits the direct transfer of PP IX from PPO to FECH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003070-Koch1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Proulx <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the PPO/FECH complex formation is not essential for haem biosynthesis, because exogenous PP IX could be converted into haem independently of the PPO/FECH complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003070-Proulx1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore likely that there is another inner membrane transport system for PP IX.</p><p>We have studied on the mitochondrial accumulation of phosphorescent porphyrin derivatives. Using affinity latex beads, the mitochondrial transporter 2-oxoglutarate carrier (OGC) was identified as a protein binding to phosphorescent porphyrins and was shown to be responsible for the accumulation of phosphorescent porphyrins in mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003070-Kabe1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it remains unclear whether OGC has any effect on the transport of natural porphyrins and on haem biosynthesis. Here, we identified ANT as a novel mitochondrial protein binding to haem and its precursors. ANT is an inner membrane transporter that facilitates the exchange of ATP and ADP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003070-Palmieri1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although the detailed mechanism is not elucidated yet, there are several differences of the ANT-binding site between haem and atractyloside. It has been known that atractyloside interacts with R79, N87, K91, L127, V130, I183, R187, D231 and R234 of ANT1 from an atomic model of the complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003070-PebayPeyroula1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, while haem interacts with K22, R79 G182, I183 and R279 of ANT1 in our docking analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003070-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). ANT1 R79A mutant, which overlaps the binding site with haem or atractyloside, remained the haem-binding activity, but K22A and R279, the haem-specific binding residues, disrupted its binding completely. Haem might be transported into the matrix in the presence of atractyloside through recognizing the different ANT1 residues from the atractyloside-binding site.</p><p>We previously found that OGC binds to phosphorescent porphyrin derivatives and accumulates them into mitochondria. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis showed that the uptake of the ANT substrate ADP was more severely impaired by haem than the uptake of the OGC substrate 2-oxoglutarate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003070-g003">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). On the contrary, 2-oxoglutarate uptake was inhibited more strongly than ADP uptake by phosphorescent porphyrin derivatives such as palladium <italic>meso</italic>-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (PdTCPP) and palladium <italic>meso</italic>-tetra(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin (PdTAPP) in a competitive manner, with Ki constants of 15 &#x000b5;M and 1.9 &#x000b5;M, respectively (data not shown). Moreover, neither haem reduction nor haem precursor accumulation was detected in OGC-deficient yeast. These findings suggest that ANT is primarily involved in the transport of haem precursors and haem biosynthesis, while OGC is involved in the mitochondrial accumulation of synthetic phosphorescent porphyrins. ANT may recognize the haem-related porphyrin structure, while OGC may bind to the tetraphenyl-porphyrin structure.</p><p>We showed that the disruption of ANT homologues in yeast resulted in a 40&#x00025; reduction in haem content and a two-fold increase in the level of PP IX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003070-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). On the other hand, ATP synthase component ATP3-deficient yeast had the same levels of haem and PP IX as the wild-type strain. This indicates that ANT contributes to haem biosynthesis by accumulating the haem precursor in mitochondria independently of energy production or metabolic events. On the other hand, CP III accumulation was observed in ATP3-deficient yeast, but amount of PP IX and haem was not changed. However, the detailed mechanism is not elucidated yet, the CP III accumulation was observed commonly in ANT- or ATP3-deficient yeast, both which were abolished the energy production of mitochondria. CP III amount might be affected by energetic status of mitochondria, but haem or PP IX amount would not. Furthermore, we also showed that haem and ADP uptake in mitochondria was not affected by NaN3 or the uncoupling reagent FCCP, or by the omission of the electron transport substrate succinate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003070.s002">Fig S2</xref>). This suggested that the inner mitochondrial membrane potential is not necessary for haem or ADP transport. Previously, it has been suggested that PP IX accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix is mediated by the PPO/FECH transmembrane complex. However, our results strongly suggest that ANT contributes to haem biosynthesis by serving as an alternative PP IX transport pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>Haemin, PP IX, and CP III were purchased from Porphyrin Products.
