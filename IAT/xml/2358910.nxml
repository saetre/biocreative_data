In <italic>M. tuberculosis furA-katG </italic>constitute a single operon, whereas in <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>a single mRNA covering both genes could not be found. In both species, specific 5' ends have been identified: the first one, located upstream of the <italic>furA </italic>gene, corresponds to transcription initiation from the <italic>furA </italic>promoter; the second one is the <italic>katG </italic>mRNA 5' end, located in the terminal part of <italic>furA</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this work we demonstrate by in vitro transcription and by RNA polymerase Chromatin immunoprecipitation that no promoter is present in the <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>region covering the latter 5' end, suggesting that it is produced by specific processing of longer transcripts. Several DNA fragments of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>were inserted in a plasmid between the <italic>sigA </italic>promoter and the <italic>lacZ </italic>reporter gene, and expression of the reporter gene was measured. A polypurine sequence, located four bp upstream of the <italic>katG </italic>translation start codon, increased beta-galactosidase activity and stabilized the <italic>lacZ </italic>transcript. Mutagenesis of this sequence led to destabilization of the mRNA. Analysis of constructs, in which the polypurine sequence of <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>was followed by an increasing number of <italic>katG </italic>codons, demonstrated that mRNA stability requires translation of at least 20 amino acids. In order to define the requirements for the 5' processing of the <italic>katG </italic>transcript, we created several mutations in this region and analyzed the 5' ends of the transcripts: the distance from the polypurine sequence does not seem to influence the processing, neither the sequence around the cutting point. Only mutations which create a double stranded region around the processing site prevented RNA processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first reported case in mycobacteria, in which both a polypurine sequence and translation initiation are shown to contribute to mRNA stability. The <italic>furA-katG </italic>mRNA is transcribed from the <italic>furA </italic>promoter and immediately processed; this processing is prevented by a double stranded RNA at the cutting site, suggesting that the endoribonuclease responsible for the cleavage cuts single stranded RNA.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>mRNA decay is known to play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in bacteria. Studies in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>indicated a possible model, in which the endoribonuclease RNase E binds and cuts the mRNA, followed by RNase II and/or PNPase that degrade the fragments generated by RNase E cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The accessibility of the 5' end of an mRNA to RNase E has been shown to be an important mediator of stability in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Much less is known about mRNA decay in other bacteria, particularly in gram positive species. Several studies, performed in <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>and <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic>, indicated that the 5' terminal leader sequence has a relevant role in mRNA stabilization, either by containing a polypurine rich sequence or by the presence of a predicted 5'-terminal stem-loop structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Extensive mutagenesis was used to define how these two motifs influence mRNA stability and the presence of an RNase E-like ribonuclease, acting on the 5' end, has been suggested. Its action may be blocked by either the stem-loop structure and/or ribosomes located in proximity of the 5' terminus of the transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In mycobacteria few examples of mRNAs stability control have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The most interesting is the stability of the DNA gyrase mRNA in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, which is 5' protected by a stem-loop structure, followed by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence for translation initiation. Disruption of the stem-loop caused loss of transcript stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In this work we report that the mycobacterial <italic>katG </italic>mRNA originates from specific processing of the longer bicistronic transcript, covering <italic>furA </italic>and <italic>katG</italic>. The <italic>katG </italic>mRNA encodes the catalase-peroxidase, responsible for the degradation of toxic oxygen compounds. In all studied mycobacterial species, the DNA region immediately upstream of <italic>katG </italic>encodes FurA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Fur-like proteins are ubiquitous in bacteria, and act as transcriptional repressors that exhibit an iron-dependent DNA binding activity and regulate several genes involved in iron metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In Mycobacteria this role is not achieved by FurA, but by the iron dependent transcription regulator (IdeR) which plays a critical role in maintaining the intracellular iron homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, genes directly or indirectly controlled by Fur-like proteins have been discovered, leading to the hypothesis that Fur proteins have a wider role in bacterial gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In mycobacteria, the organization of the <italic>furA-katG </italic>region is conserved, suggesting that it may constitute a single operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

The transcript of pMYS743, which carries a different sequence around the processing site, is normally processed at 443, whereas the transcript of pMYS749, in which a double stranded region is created, was no more correctly processed. In order to confirm that a double stranded RNA around 443 could not be processed, we constructed an other plasmid in which different bases were substituted in order to create a double stranded RNA, and also in this case processing at 443 did not occur (data not shown).

Moreover, neither promoter consensus sequences were present upstream of 443 nor this region could be recovered by RNA-polymerase ChIP assays.

Primer extension analysis also revealed the presence of a 5' end at 443, that is the same position in which the <italic>M. smegmatis furA-katG </italic>mRNA is cut. However, no primer extension signal was observed at 478. In fact, this latter 5' end was no longer detected in many primer extension experiments performed with RNAs extracted from mc<sup>2</sup>155 (unpublished data).

Considering our new findings, indicating the absence of any promoter and the presence of a stabilizing sequence upstream of the <italic>katG </italic>start codon, a new explanation should be given to previous results. We hypothesize that the reporter activity could be explained by the presence of an unknown promoter upstream of the cloning site in the vector sequence. Transcription starting from this promoter may produce a transcript that, upon processing at 443, is stabilized by both the polypurine sequence and translation initiation. This led to the expression of the downstream reporter gene. Thus, a reporter gene assay, usually used to identify promoter sequences, led us to detect an RNA stabilizing sequence.</p><p>Therefore, in agreement with what has been suggested by Pym <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], in <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and in <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>transcription of the <italic>katG </italic>gene may originate from the upstream <italic>pfurA </italic>promoter. A single transcript containing <italic>furA </italic>and <italic>katG </italic>is synthesized and processed to originate two different transcripts, one covering <italic>furA</italic>, the second covering <italic>katG</italic>.
