We experienced that this putative oncogene was a common target gene for growth-promoting cytokines in myeloma cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene expression of <italic>BCL3</italic> was studied in 351 newly diagnosed myeloma patients, 12 patients with smouldering myeloma, 44 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and 22 healthy individuals. Smaller material of samples was included for mRNA detection by RT-PCR, protein detection by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, and for cytogenetic studies. A total of eight different myeloma cell lines were studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Bcl-3 was induced in myeloma cell lines by interleukin (IL)-6, IL-21, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and IGF-1, and its upregulation was associated with increased proliferation of the cells. In a population of 351 patients, expression levels of <italic>BCL3</italic> above 75th percentile were associated with shorter 5-yr survival. When this patient population was divided into subgroups based on molecular classification, <italic>BCL3</italic> was significantly increased in a poor risk subgroup characterized by overexpression of cell cycle and proliferation related genes.

Myeloma cell growth factors mediate redundant effects since one growth factor can substitute for another <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). This observation led us to hypothesize that intracellular signals generated by myeloma growth factors target common genes important for growth and survival of myeloma cells. These genes may represent potential drug targets. Microarray experiments done in our laboratory showed that the myeloma cell growth factors interleukin (IL)-6, IL-21 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; all induced expression of the putative oncogene <italic>BCL3</italic> in the myeloma cell lines IH-1 and OH-2 (paper in preparation). These data supported previous studies done by Brocke-Heidrich <italic>et al.</italic> and Tsuyama <italic>et al.</italic>, who showed that <italic>BCL3</italic> is upregulated by IL-6 at mRNA level as well as at protein level in myeloma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). However, the expression of <italic>BCL3</italic> in myeloma patient samples has not been studied. Based on this we decided to study the role of <italic>BCL3</italic> in primary myeloma cells as well as in myeloma cell lines in more detail.</p><p><italic>BCL3</italic> was first identified through its involvement in the t (14;19) (q32;q13) translocation in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Leukemic cells from these patients had increased levels of <italic>BCL3</italic> mRNA, leading to the hypothesis that <italic>BCL3</italic> is a proto-oncogene contributing to leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). <italic>BCL3</italic> is overexpressed in breast cancers, subtypes of lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Supporting the notion that <italic>BCL3</italic> is an oncogene, Viatour <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>BCL3</italic> is sufficient to transform the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 and induce tumor growth subcutaneously in nude mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Physiologically, <italic>BCL3</italic> has been implicated to play a role during B-cell development and as a negative regulator of immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p><italic>BCL3</italic> encodes a protein denoted Bcl-3 that is a member of the inhibitory &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B)-family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The I&#x003ba;B proteins modulate the DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF&#x003ba;B), a family of transcription factors involved in apoptosis and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Activation of NF&#x003ba;B is implicated as an important mechanism for the development of antiapoptosis and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Depending on context, Bcl-3 either activates or inhibits NF&#x003ba;B-dependent gene transcription through interactions with homodimers of NF&#x003ba;B p50 or p52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). We here present evidence that <italic>BCL3</italic> is overexpressed in myeloma cells from a subset of myeloma patients, and that the high expression of <italic>BCL3</italic> at the time of diagnosis is associated with inferior prognosis. Furthermore, high expression of Bcl-3 in myeloma cell lines induced by growth-promoting cytokines is associated with increased proliferation of the cells. We propose that Bcl-3 contributes to regulation of NF&#x003ba;B-dependent gene transcription in myeloma cells, with potential oncogenic consequences.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>The human myeloma cell line ANBL-6 (gift from Dr D.

The ANBL-6, IH-1, INA-6 and OH-2 cell lines were starved overnight before they were stimulated with cytokines as indicated at time point 0 (T0). At this time point, cells that were not stimulated with cytokines were harvested. The viability of these cells as measured by propidium iodide-staining was 60&#x02013;80%, similar to the viability of cells grown in IL-6 enriched medium. CAG, JJN-3, RPMI-8226 and U-266 were stimulated with IL-6 immediately after seeding or left without cytokines in RPMI with 0.1% BSA for 24 h.

We found that both these proteins were present in the nucleus after TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, while TNF-&#x003b1; activated both p65 and p50, IL-6 activated p50 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). Hence, after IL-6 stimulation, p50 was activated, and this activation coincided with nuclear presence of Bcl-3. Simultaneously, there was a lack of p65 activation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This work shows for the first time that myeloma cells from MM patients express <italic>BCL3</italic> and that high expression of <italic>BCL3</italic> at the time of diagnosis is associated with reduced survival. Furthermore, in a comparison of molecularly defined subgroups, <italic>BCL3</italic> expression was significantly increased in a high risk subgroup characterized by overexpression of cell cycle-and proliferation-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Our data are consistent with the concept that high <italic>BCL3</italic> expression is an event associated with poor outcome.</p><p>We have not shown that <italic>BCL3</italic> is an independent adverse prognostic factor and the exact relevance of elevated expression of <italic>BCL3</italic> in myeloma high-risk disease is currently unclear. Interestingly, Annunziata <italic>et al.</italic> has shown that the high risk subgroup with high expression of <italic>BCL3</italic> has a very low average expression of NF&#x003ba;B signature genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). NF&#x003ba;B signature genes are genes that are activated by the classical and/or alternative NF&#x003ba;B pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the nuclear presence of Bcl-3 as after IL-6 stimulation activates a different set of genes than activation of the classical and/or alternative NF&#x003ba;B pathway in myeloma cells.</p><p>The array data was confirmed with qPCR in a material with 10 patients. In another randomly selected material with eight patients with MM, Bcl-3 protein was detected in seven of eight samples by Western blot. We also examined the expression of Bcl-3 at protein level by immunohistochemical staining of biopsies from MM patients and patients with plasmacytoma, and found that 11% (two of 18) of the biopsies stained positive for Bcl-3. This proportion of Bcl-3<sup>+</sup> plasma cell malignancies is similar to the proportion of B-cell lymphomas expressing Bcl-3 (6%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The discrepancy between the proportion of patient samples positive for <italic>BCL3</italic> at mRNA level and biopsies positive for Bcl-3 at protein level may be caused by lower sensitivity of immunostaining of biopsies, a well-known problem when using immunohistochemistry as detection method. However, the number of patient samples tested was small, and we cannot rule out that there is reduced translation or post-translational modifications.</p><p>Our data showed that stimulation of myeloma cells with various cytokines well-known to promote proliferation increased Bcl-3 expression. These data indicate that the gene encoding Bcl-3 is indeed a common target gene for growth promoting cytokines in myeloma cells. As growth-promoting cytokines are frequently present in the bone marrow of MM patients, cytokine signaling is a highly possible mechanism for upregulation of Bcl-3 in myeloma cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, and in concordance with the patient data, we found that the induction of Bcl-3 by cytokines was associated with increased proliferation of myeloma cells. However, in line with the results from Brocke-Heidrich <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), we could not show any effect on thymidine incorporation or apoptosis when down regulating Bcl-3 with siRNA in the INA-6 cell line (data not shown). These results are from only one cell line and further studies are needed to clarify the exact role of Bcl-3.</p><p>Additional potential mechanisms for upregulation of Bcl-3 in MM patients are gains/amplification of the <italic>BCL3</italic> gene, as described in patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or translocations involving chromosome 19, as found in patients with CLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Our studies substantiate that both these mechanism may be active in freshly isolated MM patients cells. The <italic>BCL3</italic> gene is located at chromosome 19, a chromosome with frequent trisomy in MM patients having a hyperdiploid tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).</p><p>In our study, intracellular localization of Bcl-3 was dependent of type of stimulus given to the cell. Nuclear accumulation of Bcl-3, as after IL-6 stimulation, has been shown to be associated with p50/Bcl-3- or p52/Bcl-3 dependent gene activation and subsequent proliferation in <italic>CYLD</italic>-lacking keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). It is possible that similar mechanisms are active in myeloma cells, and may explain why we observed activation of p50 in IH-1 after IL-6 stimulation.</p><p>The starting point of this study was our observation that IL-6, IL-21 and TNF-&#x003b1; induced expression of <italic>BCL3</italic> in the myeloma cell lines OH-2 and IH-1. Our study demonstrates that also the protein, Bcl-3, is produced in cell lines by cytokine stimulation and is associated with increased proliferation of the cells. We show for the first time that Bcl-3 is present in a subset of MM patients, and that the high gene expression at the time of diagnosis is associated with inferior prognosis as demonstrated in a large cohort of newly diagnosed patients. Our results indicate a potential role for Bcl-3 in the development of multiple myeloma, and further studies are needed to clarify this.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the Norwegian Cancer Society (A.T.B., U.M.F., T.B.R.), the Cancer Fund of St. Olavs University Hospital (A.T.B., A.S.
