We therefore explored this in more detail by measuring platelet reactivity to pathway specific activation by CRP-XL, thrombin and ADP in the presence of cross-linked anti-PECAM-1 antibody which we have previously shown to cause PECAM-1 phosphorylation <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, or isotype control. Following PECAM-1 cross-linking total platelet [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> reduced by 7.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.0% in response to CRP-XL, and 11.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.3% in response to thrombi. Similarly, peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was reduced by 6.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.2% and 10.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.8%, and final [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> reduced by 8.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3% and 14.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.0%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05, in all cases). Neither total nor peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in response to ADP were affected by PECAM-1 cross-linking (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). PECAM-1 cross-linking did not initiate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the absence of agonist (data not shown). Furthermore PECAM-1 cross-linking, across a range of CRP-XL concentrations inhibited P-selectin exposure by 11.2% (range: 2.7&#x02013;20.8%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.036) and fibrinogen binding to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 by 9.9% (range: 3.3&#x02013;17.4%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.046) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B and C). Similar magnitudes of inhibition were seen in response to both thrombin and ADP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B and C). The mean inhibition of P-selectin exposure in response to thrombin was 8.1% (range: 0.8&#x02013;14.9%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.021) and in response to ADP was 14.9% (range: 3.9&#x02013;22.7%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.013). Fibrinogen binding was inhibited by 9.3% (range: 6.1&#x02013;16.1%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.024) in response to thrombin and 10.7% (range: 2.8&#x02013;24.4%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.035) in response to ADP.</p><p>The inhibitory effect seen here was specific for cross-linked anti-PECAM-1 antibody. The level of stimulation achieved in the presence of the cross-linked isotype control was not significantly different to that seen in the absence of antibodies (data not shown) and no other combination of antibodies, apart from cross-linked anti-PECAM-1 antibody, caused any significant change to platelet activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Platelet response was not inhibited if incubated with the PECAM-1 antibody and F(ab&#x02032;) fragments of the cross-linking antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Furthermore, pre-incubation with IV.3 F(ab&#x02032;) fragments, to block the low-affinity receptor for IgG Fc&#x003b3;RIIA, did not alter the inhibitory effect of PECAM-1 cross-linking (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore the inhibition of platelet reactivity by PECAM-1 is not a generic antibody effect. As with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> no combination of antibodies caused any platelet activation in the absence of agonists (data not shown).</p><p>If PECAM-1 function is important for the regulation of platelet function, variation in the surface expression of the protein should impact on platelet reactivity. To test this we examined the relationship between surface expression of PECAM-1 on unactivated platelets and its association with P-selectin exposure and fibrinogen binding to platelets in response to CRP-XL, ADP and TRAP, in 89 healthy subjects <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Surface expression of PECAM-1 was negatively correlated with P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding in response to CRP-XL (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.009 and 0.003, respectively) and ADP (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.017 and 0.003, respectively) although not to TRAP (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While the strength of this association is modest, accounting for between 6% and 10% of the variation in platelet response to CRP-XL and ADP, it was of a similar magnitude to the positive association seen between platelet reactivity and GPVI or &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 surface expression. Associations of this magnitude are entirely expected in this context given that platelet activation is a multi-factorial process requiring the integration of multiple signaling steps. Variation in any of these steps will have a moderate impact on the final level of response. It is important here to separate out the information being given by the <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value and the <italic>P</italic>-value. <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> is the proportion of variation in platelet function explained by the regression model and gives information about the strength of the association, while the <italic>P</italic>-value gives information on whether that association is likely to have occurred by chance. Therefore given an appropriate sample size it is entirely possible, as is the case here, to identify weak associations that are statistically significant. The negative association identified here confirms our findings of an inhibitory role for PECAM-1 in CRP-XL and ADP induced platelet activation.</p><p>There is a clear dichotomy in these results. While PECAM-1 cross-linking inhibited platelet response to thrombin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), PECAM-1 expression showed no relationship with platelet activation following stimulation by TRAP in the association studies (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Subsequent investigation established that PECAM-1 cross-linking did not inhibit either fibrinogen binding or P-selectin expression in response to TRAP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These results support the findings of the association study, however, a discrepancy remains between the inhibitory effect of PECAM-1 on thrombin activation of platelets and its lack of effect on TRAP stimulation. This may stem from the involvement of glycoprotein (GP) Ib&#x003b1; in thrombin <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> but not TRAP (which is PAR-1 specific) induced platelet activation and may indicate a role for PECAM-1 in mediating the action of GPIb&#x003b1; during thrombin stimulation of platelets. PECAM-1 has previously been shown to be involved in GPIb&#x003b1; mediated activation of platelets, becoming tyrosine phosphorylated upon vWF binding to GPIb&#x003b1;, and PECAM-1 deficient mice show enhanced aggregation in response to vWF <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus it is not inconceivable that stimulation of PECAM-1 inhibits the action of GPIb&#x003b1; causing reduced thrombin induced platelet activation.</p><p>During thrombus formation platelets are exposed to a variety of stimuli simultaneously, including collagen, thrombin and ADP. It is, therefore, possible that the small inhibitory effects in multiple pathways, that we have described so far, interact resulting in a greater inhibition of platelet response and thrombus formation. This could be seen in the flow cytometry assay when comparing the response of platelets to CRP-XL in the presence and absence of inhibitors of endogenous thrombin, ADP, and thromboxane. PECAM-1 cross-linking had a greater inhibitory effect on CRP-XL (0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) stimulation in the absence of hirudin, apyrase and indomethacin, thereby allowing secondary activation pathways to play a role, than in the presence of these inhibitors; fibrinogen binding was reduced by 15.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.7% compared to 4.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.8%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002, and P-selectin expression was reduced by 15.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.8% compared to 6.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.9%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). A similar increase in inhibition was seen when comparing the effect of PECAM-1 cross-linking on platelets stimulated with CRP-XL (1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) in the presence of inhibitors or CRP-XL (0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) in their absence. While both treatments gave comparable levels of platelet activation with the isotype control, the level of inhibition resulting from PECAM-1 cross-linking was significantly greater in the absence of inhibitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>To identify the magnitude of the inhibitory effect of PECAM-1 in conditions that are more reflective of in vivo processes, thrombi were formed under arterial flow conditions in collagen coated micro-capillary slides. Following PECAM-1 cross-linking total thrombus volume was reduced by 49.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;9.9% (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002) compared to treatment with the isotype control, and the area of the glass capillary covered by thrombi was similarly reduced by 54.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7.9% (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0005) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The total amount of protein eluted from the slides following thrombus formation also decreased in the presence of cross-linked PECAM-1 by 16.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.3% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D).</p></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>The inhibitory action of PECAM-1 on collagen induced platelet activation has been well documented. However, the impact of PECAM-1 activation on platelet response to other agonists has been less well explored. In this study we confirm the inhibitory effect of PECAM-1 on GPVI signaling, and go further to show inhibition of thrombin and ADP induced platelet activation. In line with other reports PECAM-1 cross-linking exerts a relatively small effect corresponding to 5&#x02013;15% inhibition in platelet function. Similarly variation in the surface expression of PECAM-1 accounted for 6&#x02013;10% of the variation in fibrinogen binding and P-selectin expression in response to stimulation. To put this into context, we also show that 20&#x02013;21% of the variation in platelet response to CRP-XL is accounted for by variation in the surface expression of GPVI (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Clearly the inhibitory effect of PECAM-1 is subtle, and can even be overcome at the highest concentrations of agonists (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B and C: thrombin 1U/mL, and ADP 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>M). However, because PECAM-1 inhibits multiple activation pathways it is likely to be physiologically important. Therefore during thrombus formation the impact of PECAM-1 is more substantial than that seen on individual pathways in isolation. It is worth noting that, while the two systems are not strictly analogous, the inhibitory effect on thrombus formation of cross-linking PECAM-1 was of a similar magnitude to the increase in thrombus formation previously reported in the absence of PECAM-1 in knock-out mice <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The negative relationship between PECAM-1 surface expression and platelet response to stimuli provides independent confirmation of the physiological effect of PECAM-1. The specificity of this negative association between PECAM-1 and platelet responses is supported by the observation that GPVI and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 showed positive correlations, while GPIa expression did not exhibit any association. The magnitude of this PECAM-1 association is similar to that resulting from variation in GPVI or &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, and is entirely expected given that platelet response requires the integration of a large number of proteins and varies widely throughout the population <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Furthermore, the impact of PECAM-1 on platelet function may be underestimated in these studies because the reduced platelet&#x02013;platelet interaction in flow cytometric assays limits homophilic ligation.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the activation of PECAM-1, through cross-linking, inhibits platelet response to the collagen mimetic, CRP-XL, ADP and thrombin, and have confirmed the inhibitory action of PECAM-1, by showing an association between increased surface expression of PECAM-1 and decreased platelet response. The combination of a relatively small inhibitory effect on multiple signaling pathways results in a more dramatic inhibition of thrombus formation than may have been previously appreciated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><label>Appendix A</label><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at <ext-link xlink:href="doi:10.1016/j.febslet.2009.10.037" ext-link-type="uri">doi:10.1016/j.febslet.2009.10.037</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><label>Appendix A</label><title>Supplementary data</title><p><fig id="N0x1d02880N0x2e90150" position="anchor"><label>Supplementary Fig. S1</label><caption><p>Association between PECAM-1 surface expression and platelet reactivity.

In line with previous reports surface expression of GPVI is positively associated with platelet response to CRP-XL [25] accounting for approximately 20% of the variation in platelet response to this agonist. Surface expression of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 was also positively correlated with platelet fibrinogen binding in response to ADP and TRAP. Surface expression of PECAM-1 showed a negative association with both fibrinogen binding and P-selectin expression in response to CRP-XL and ADP.
