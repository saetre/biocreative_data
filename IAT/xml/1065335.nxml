Here we report that the heightened susceptibility of IFN-&#x003b3;R knock-out (KO) mice is associated with a functional impairment of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells. Treatment of wild-type mice with depleting anti-CD25 antibody after CFA-assisted immunisation with collagen type II (CII) significantly accelerated the onset of arthritis and increased the severity of CIA. This is an indication of a role of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the effector phase of CIA. IFN-&#x003b3;R deficiency did not affect the number of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells in the central and peripheral lymphoid tissues.

Because these mechanisms are potentially damaging to the host, an essential feature of the immune system is its ability to distinguish self from non-self antigens and to develop tolerance to the former. With regard to T cell tolerance, the immune system has evolved several strategies. Most autoreactive T cells are eliminated during (primary) maturation in the thymus, a process described as negative selection, resulting in central T cell tolerance. Autoreactive T cells that escape negative selection will nevertheless be prevented from being activated as they are confronted with auto-antigen in the periphery. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for this peripheral tolerance. One of those is suppression by a subset of T cells that express both CD4 and CD25. Evidence for the important role of these cells is overwhelming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For example, when CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells isolated from peripheral lymphoid tissues of normal mice are depleted of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells and injected into <italic>nu</italic>/<italic>nu </italic>mice, the recipients develop a high incidence of organ-specific autoimmune disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Co-transfer of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>population prevents the induction of disease. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells are therefore often designated as, respectively, T<sub>eff </sub>and T<sub>reg </sub>cells. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells are generated in the thymus. Their development is directed by relatively high-avidity interactions between the TCR and self-peptide ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cell population constitutes 5 to 10% of the mature CD4<sup>+ </sup>cell population in the adult thymus and the peripheral lymphoid tissue and blood.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic>, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells inhibit polyclonal T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The suppression is mediated by a cytokine-independent, cell contact-dependent mechanism that requires activation of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells via the TCR with specific antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, once stimulated, they are competent to suppress in an antigen-independent manner. Although the exact mechanism by which T<sub>reg </sub>cells exert their regulatory function is still unknown, there are indications that interaction of transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) with its receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], inhibition of IL-2 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] or downregulation of co-stimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] could be involved.</p><p>T<sub>reg </sub>cells have proved to be important in various animal models of autoimmune diseases. Administration of anti-CD25 antibody <italic>in vivo </italic>induces organ-localised autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Inoculation of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells depleted of CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells in <italic>nu/nu </italic>mice results in autoimmune diseases such as gastritis, thyroiditis and insulitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus, transfer of T<sub>reg </sub>cells prevents autoimmune gastritis after neonatal thymectomy, and inhibits gastritis induced by H/K ATPase-reactive effector T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. MBP-specific CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells prevent spontaneous autoimmune encephalomyelitis in TCR-transgenic mice deficient in the recombination activating gene RAG-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Similarly, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells suppress central nervous system inflammation during active experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a well-described animal model for rheumatoid arthritis. The disease is induced in genetically susceptible DBA/1 mice by immunisation with collagen type II (CII), and both T cell and B cell autoimmune responses are required for its development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; receptor knock-out (IFN-&#x003b3;R KO) mice have been found to suffer an accelerated and more severe form of CIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, knocking-out of the IFN-&#x003b3; gene makes genetically resistant strains of mice susceptible to CIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These data indicate that deletion of the IFN-&#x003b3; response somehow disrupts an endogenous protective mechanism against CIA.</p><p>Morgan and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] have recently demonstrated that CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells are important in the pathogenesis of CIA. In the present study we confirmed the importance of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the pathogenesis of CIA by rendering wild-type DBA/1 mice deficient in T<sub>reg </sub>cells by depleting anti-CD25 antibodies. Anti-CD25-treated mice developed a significantly more severe arthritis, comparable to the disease course in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice. Thus, we proposed that the higher susceptibility of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO DBA/1 mice to CIA might be ascribed to defects in the production (differentiation and homeostasis) or function of these CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells. We therefore determined the numbers of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in central and peripheral lymphoid organs of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice. We further investigated whether T<sub>reg </sub>cells of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice have defects in the ability to suppress TCR-induced <italic>in vitro </italic>proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>T<sub>eff </sub>cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice and experimental conditions</title><p>The generation and the basic characteristics of the mutant mouse strain (129/Sv/Ev) with a disruption in the gene coding for the &#x003b1;-chain of the IFN-&#x003b3; receptor (IFN-&#x003b3;R KO) have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

In fact, the disease course in antibody-treated mice was very similar to that of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The results were confirmed in an additional experiment with female mice. A third experiment was also performed on male animals. The data are plotted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>. Here again, anti-CD25-treated mice developed a higher incidence and a more severe form of arthritis than control-treated mice, whereas the onset of arthritis was not significantly earlier (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). The data from the three experiments were pooled and the percentages of limbs with the different scores from only arthritic mice in the two groups are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>. It can be seen that, at an early time point (day 27 after immunisation), the highest scores of arthritis (scores 3 and 4) were already present in anti-CD25-injected mice, but not yet in their control counterparts. On day 40 after immunisation, mice treated with anti-CD25 developed more limbs with a maximum score of 4 than control-treated mice. The mean limb score on the two days for the two groups are indicated and are significantly different (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05, Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test). The mean number of involved limbs, &#x000b1; SEM, on day 40 was 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.2 and 2.2 &#x000b1; 0.2 for the treated and control mice, respectively (<italic>P </italic>= 0.07; Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test). Representative pictures of the most severe case of arthritis of anti-CD25-injected and control mice on day 25 after immunisation are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>, respectively. To ensure that the more severe form of arthritis in the anti-CD25-treated mice was not merely due to oedema, some mice were killed at day 42 for histological evaluation. The presence of hyperplasia and infiltration of immunocompetent cells in the synovium, pannus formation and osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells confirmed the authenticity of arthritis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g</xref>).</p><p>On day 35 after immunisation, the titres of collagen-specific antibodies in the sera were determined. No differences in antibody levels in sera of mice treated with anti-CD25 or control IgG could be detected (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Number and phenotype of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice</title><p>To test whether T<sub>reg </sub>cells might be less numerous in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO than in wild-type mice &#x02013; because this might explain the differences in susceptibility to CIA &#x02013; we counted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells in thymus, lymph nodes and spleen by flow cytometry. IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice were immunised with CII in CFA on day 0. Thymocytes, splenocytes and lymph node cells were obtained on day 21, a time point at which the difference in severity of arthritis between the two groups of mice is most pronounced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Groups of naive IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice were also included. A typical CD4/CD25 staining pattern of thymocytes and lymph node cells from IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>cells are indicated. It can be seen that IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice did not have smaller proportions of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells in the thymus and lymph nodes. Immunised mice, whether wild-type or IFN-&#x003b3;R KO, had rather lower proportions of total CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells than naive counterparts (for example 31% versus 50% in wild types). However, the real numbers of CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells per organ were in fact higher after immunisation and did not differ in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO from those in wild-type mice. In fact, the lower percentages of CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells after immunisation were due to a still larger expansion of the myelopoietic population, a well-recognised phenomenon arising from the use of CFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>When over a total of six experiments (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) the numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells were expressed as fractions of total CD4<sup>+ </sup>cell numbers, it appeared that spleens and lymph nodes of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice, naive as well as immunised ones, contained slightly higher percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells. In spleens and lymph nodes of wild-type mice, 5 to 10% of the CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells were CD25<sup>+</sup>, conforming to previously published figures obtained in other mouse strains. Thymuses contained lower percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells. A possible explanation might be that thymic CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cell populations contain not only CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>- </sup>but also CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells, the latter being mostly CD25<sup>-</sup>. In the peripheral lymphoid organs of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice, the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells was higher (7 to 14%) than in the wild-type mice (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Because CD25 is expressed not only by T<sub>reg </sub>cells but also by other recently activated T cells, the slightly higher proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice is not synonymous with a higher proportion of T<sub>reg </sub>cells. In fact, even a lower proportion of such cells cannot be excluded. We therefore compared the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells from IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type DBA/1 mice for expression of various other activation markers. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a,b</xref> shows flow-cytometric expression patterns of CD69, CD62L, CD44 and cytolytic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4) in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells from naive and immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice. No major differences in expression levels of these activation markers could be detected between CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells from IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice and those from wild-type mice, whether naive or immunised. Thus, this analysis did not provide evidence for different proportions of any cell type, including T<sub>reg </sub>cells. A specific marker for T<sub>reg </sub>cells is Foxp3. We determined mRNA for this marker by quantitative PCR in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>cells, sorted from the lymph node cells of naive or immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type DBA/1 mice at day 21. In CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>cells Foxp3 mRNA levels were extremely low (less than 6), and not different between one group of mice and the other. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells, in contrast, displayed high expression levels. In cells from naive IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice, levels were comparable. However, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells of immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice contained levels of Foxp3 that were one-third of those of wild-type mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). This lower expression level might be indicative of a smaller proportion of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cell population or of a lower expression level per cell. To distinguish between these alternatives, a tagging anti-Foxp3 antibody would be needed.</p><p>Thus, after immunisation, IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice possessed a slightly higher percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells than wild-type mice. However, the actual T<sub>reg </sub>cells present in this population might be considerably less numerous or might be qualitatively different so as to express less Foxp3.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced suppressive activity of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells in arthritic IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice</title><p>To characterise the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells functionally, we measured their ability to suppress the anti-CD3-induced proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>T<sub>eff </sub>cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. The experiments were performed with CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>cells and ACs. T<sub>reg </sub>suppressive activity was presented by plotting the percentage of inhibition against the number of T<sub>reg </sub>cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a,c</xref>, the patterns of inhibition in naive IFN-gR KO and wild-type mice were very similar: in both cases 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>purified CD4+CD25+ cells were able to inhibit more than 90% of the proliferative response of 5 &#x000d7; 104 T<sub>eff </sub>cells. This result indicates that IFN-&#x003b3; is not required for T<sub>reg </sub>cells to be able to suppress anti-CD3-induced <italic>in vitro </italic>proliferation.</p><p>In a separate set of seven experiments we investigated the suppressive effect of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from mice that had been immunised with CII in CFA. IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type DBA/1 mice were immunised on day 0, and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells, T<sub>eff </sub>cells and ACs were isolated on day 21 after immunisation. The data of the individual experiments are plotted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref> and the means of the seven experiments are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>. It can be seen that the capacity to suppress TCR-triggered proliferation of T<sub>eff </sub>cells was significantly lower in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells isolated from immunised mice than in those of naive animals. Indeed, to obtain 40% inhibition of proliferation, 4.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from immunised wild-type mice were required, in comparison with only 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from naive wild-type mice. Moreover, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice were significantly less suppressive than those of immunised wild-type mice: 10<sup>4 </sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells were necessary to decrease T<sub>eff </sub>cell proliferation by 40%. In an additional experiment we verified whether the deficit in inhibition by CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice could be corrected by adding excess CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells. However, with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>and 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells the inhibition on T cell proliferation was 64.6% and 65.8%, respectively, indicating that a plateau level of suppressive activity had been reached.</p></sec><sec><title>Normal levels of TGF-&#x003b2; in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice</title><p>Several studies have shown the critical role of TGF-&#x003b2; in the induction of Foxp3 and the activity of T<sub>reg </sub>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Because IFN-&#x003b3; and TGF-&#x003b2; act antagonistically with each other (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]), it is possible that TGF-&#x003b2; is upregulated in wild-type mice as a homeostatic response to IFN-&#x003b3; produced by their activated T cells, and similarly in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice the decreased Foxp3 levels and the decreased suppressive activity of T<sub>reg </sub>cells might be due to inadequate amounts of TGF-&#x003b2; produced in the co-cultures or <italic>in vivo </italic>in mice. We therefore analysed the expression of TGF-&#x003b2; by quantitative PCR in T<sub>reg </sub>cells as well as in co-cultures and in spleens of naive and immunised mice. The following results were obtained. First, the levels of TGF-&#x003b2; from the sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice were not different from those of wild-type mice (normalised TGF-&#x003b2; mRNA levels were 179 &#x000b1; 16 and 193 &#x000b1; 22, respectively; mean &#x000b1; SEM for three measurements). Second, because TGF-&#x003b2; might be produced by ACs (or T<sub>eff </sub>cells), quantitative PCR was performed on cells obtained from co-cultures (T<sub>reg </sub>plus T<sub>eff </sub>plus ACs) from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice. It was found that the levels of TGF-&#x003b2; were even increased in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO cells in comparison with wild-type cells (2,184 versus 1,574, respectively, in the condition of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells, in a pool of eight mice). Third, the TGF-&#x003b2; levels were also analysed <italic>ex vivo</italic>; that is, in spleen tissue from IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice at day 21 after immunisation (thus at a time point at which T<sub>reg</sub>, T<sub>eff </sub>and ACs were isolated). Here again, the TGF-&#x003b2; levels were found to be slightly increased in spleens from IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice (816 &#x000b1; 129 and 633 &#x000b1; 40 for IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice, respectively). If these results are taken together, the defective activity of T<sub>reg </sub>cells from arthritic IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice (in comparison with those from wild-type animals) seems not to be associated with a defective TGF-&#x003b2; production.</p><p>It was notable that the TGF-&#x003b2; levels were higher in immunised mice than in their naive counterparts (for example, 633 &#x000b1; 40 and 205 &#x000b1; 19 for immunised and naive wild-type mice, respectively). These data suggest that the differences in suppressive activity of T<sub>reg </sub>cells from immunised versus naive mice cannot be explained by differences in the TGF-&#x003b2; production.</p></sec><sec><title>T<sub>reg </sub>cells from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice have the capacity to inhibit proliferation responses</title><p>We next investigated whether the lower capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice to downregulate proliferation responses is due to an intrinsic defect or to an altered activity of surrounding ACs and T<sub>eff </sub>cells. We measured the inhibition of anti-CD3-induced proliferation in co-cultures differently reconstituted of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>and ACs, derived either from the same or from different immunised wild-type or immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice. The combinations tested are indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>.</p><p>As expected, when all cells in the reconstituted co-cultures were of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mouse origin, suppressive activity was less than when all cells were of wild-type origin. In co-cultures of mixed composition, suppressive activity of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO-derived CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells was less than that of the wild type only when ACs were from IFN-&#x003b3;R KO origin, but not when they were of wild-type origin. However, such ACs of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice were unable to reduce the suppressive effect of wild-type T<sub>reg </sub>cells against wild-type or IFN-&#x003b3;R KO (data not shown) T<sub>eff </sub>cells. These data demonstrate that the defect in inhibiting CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>T<sub>eff </sub>cells acquired the presence of T<sub>reg </sub>cells from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice in combination with their autologous ACs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We and others have previously demonstrated that IFN-&#x003b3;(R) KO mice show an accelerated and more severe from of arthritis than their wild-type counterparts, indicating that endogenous IFN-&#x003b3; acts as a protective factor in CIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Because CIA has been defined as a Th1-driven disease (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]), the protective effect of IFN-&#x003b3; in CIA constitutes an enigma that compromises the Th1/Th2 paradigm as a basis for explaining the regulation of autoimmune diseases. A clue to the enigma seemed to be the use of CFA in the induction procedure of CIA. In the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;, CFA induces an extensive extramedullary myelopoiesis that goes together with an even more pronounced Th1 cytokine profile than in wild-type counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The data suggest that IFN-&#x003b3; can, under certain circumstances, be a strong Th2 inducer, a finding that has recently been confirmed by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this protective action of IFN-&#x003b3; is due to a stimulatory effect on T<sub>reg </sub>cells. Specifically, we addressed the following two questions. Are T<sub>reg </sub>cells important in modulating CIA? And, because we found that depletion of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in wild-type mice increased the severity of CIA, can the higher susceptibility of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice to CIA be explained by defects in the number or function of their T<sub>reg </sub>cells?</p><p>As to the first question, we found that administration of a T<sub>reg </sub>cell-depleting anti-CD25 antibody to wild-type DBA/1 mice after CFA-assisted immunisation with CII resulted in accelerated and more severe arthritis. In fact, the disease course in these mice was comparable to that in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The actual depletion of T<sub>reg </sub>cells was monitored by flow cytometry, and the authenticity of arthritis was verified histopathologically. These results are in line with those of Morgan and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], who showed that the administration of depleting anti-CD25 antibody before immunisation (days &#x02013;28, &#x02013;24, &#x02013;21 and &#x02013;14) hastened the onset of severe CIA. Because in our experiments antibodies were administered starting from day 11 or day 13 after immunisation, we can conclude that T<sub>reg </sub>cells are important in the pathogenesis of CIA, not only in the immunisation phase but also in the effector phase. In contrast to the findings of Morgan and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the accelerated and more severe course of arthritis was, in our experiments, not accompanied by a higher concentration of anti-collagen II antibodies, possibly due to the different regimen of anti-CD25 treatment. Indirect evidence for the involvement of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the pathogenesis of CIA comes from data of Min and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. They found that the immune tolerance induced by oral feeding of CII before induction of CIA was mediated by IL-10-producing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells. Notably, in proteoglycan-induced arthritis, another model of autoimmune arthritis, it has been shown that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells might not have a critical role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This might result from the use of a different auto-antigen.</p><p>To address the second question, we compared CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cell numbers and T<sub>reg </sub>cell function in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO DBA/1 mice with those in wild-type mice. According to our hypothesis we expected numbers of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice to be lower. Counter to this expectation, in each of the six experiments done, we found a trend for a higher proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells in the total CD4<sup>+ </sup>cell population. This was true for thymic, splenic and lymph node CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells, in both naive and immunised mice. Analysis of all data as one set revealed a significant difference of about 30% and 20% in naive and immunised mice, respectively. CD25 is not an exclusive marker of T<sub>reg </sub>cells: especially in immunised mice, part of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>population might be effector rather than regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Therefore, to exclude the possibility that we were comparing two completely different populations, we performed additional flow-cytometric characterisation studies on pre-sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells.</p><p>Expression of CD44, CD69, CTLA-4 and CD62L in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice did not differ from expression in cells from corresponding wild-type mice, whether naive or immunised. However, because T<sub>reg </sub>cells display an activated phenotype, activation markers might not be adequate to distinguish T<sub>reg </sub>cells from activated T<sub>eff </sub>cells. According to Fontenot and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] a specific marker for T<sub>reg </sub>cells is Foxp3, because it is highly expressed in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells and is virtually undetectable in both resting and activated T<sub>eff </sub>cells. We examined Foxp3 expression by determining mRNA levels with PCR. After immunisation, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells contained lower levels of Foxp3 mRNA than those of their naive counterparts. Moreover, mRNA levels in immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice were less than one-third of those in their wild-type counterparts, indicating that IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice have a smaller number of T<sub>reg </sub>cells or that expression of Foxp3 in each T<sub>reg </sub>cell is lower.</p><p>Recently, Bruder and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] have shown linked expression of neuropilin-1 and Foxp3, thereby identifying neuropilin-1 as a specific surface marker for CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells able to distinguish them from both naive and recently activated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>non-regulatory T cells.</p><p>Nishibori and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] demonstrated impaired development of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in naive signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT)-1-deficient mice, associated with an increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease. Because IFN-&#x003b3; is among the strongest activators of STAT-1, these observations seem to conflict with ours. However, several cytokines, other than IFN-&#x003b3;, can also activate STAT-1, including IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-9, IL-11, oncostatin M, leukaemia inhibitory factor and the chemokines RANTES and macrophage inflammatory protein 1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>To determine whether overall T<sub>reg </sub>cell activity would be lower in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice, we co-cultured increasing numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells with fixed numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>T<sub>eff </sub>cells and ACs in the presence of anti-CD3 antibody. We observed a dose-dependent inhibition of the proliferative responses by CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells. By estimating numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells required to attain a selected level of suppression, we could compare suppressive activity in the different groups of mice. In naive mice, the inhibition curves were almost identical, whether the T<sub>reg </sub>cells were derived from wild-type or IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice, indicating that endogenous IFN-&#x003b3; is not an important regulator of the function of constitutive CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells. In co-cultures of cells from immunised wild-type mice, the T<sub>reg </sub>suppressive capacity was about one-third of that in those from corresponding naive mice, and a further halving was noted in co-cultures of cells from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice.</p><p>The observation that immunisation renders T<sub>reg </sub>cells less suppressive is in line with results of Pasare and Medzhitov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], who found that microbial triggering of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway by lipopolysaccharide or CpG, which are ligands for TLR4 and TLR9, respectively, blocked the suppressive effect of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells. Because mycobacteria also contain TLR ligands, immunisation with CFA can be expected to affect T<sub>reg </sub>cell activity similarly. The decrease in suppressive activity that takes place after TLR4 or TLR9 triggering was found to be dependent on IL-6 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It might therefore be of interest to note that in our experiments, IL-6 production was enhanced after exposure to CFA-assisted immunisation, and this effect was even more pronounced in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice (P Matthys, unpublished data). This could provide an explanation for the fact that CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells are totally functional before immunisation but lose (part of) their function after immunisation. However, the most important observation is the lower T<sub>reg </sub>suppressive capacity in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO than in wild-type mice after CFA-assisted immunisation, because this supports our hypothesis that the protective effect of endogenous IFN-&#x003b3; against CIA could be mediated in part by its stimulatory effect on T<sub>reg </sub>cells.</p><p>Because the disease is barely detectable in wild-type mice on day 21 after immunisation, we investigated whether the decreased suppressive activity in immunised wild-type mice was further downregulated at a later time point (namely, day 35 after immunisation, when most of the animals show symptoms of arthritis). However, suppressive activity was not further downregulated to the level seen in homogeneous IFN-&#x003b3;R KO co-cultures, but was comparable to that seen in co-cultures from immunised wild-type mice on day 21 after immunisation (maximal inhibition 60%; data not shown). This indicates that the low suppressive activity as evident in immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice is restricted to conditions under which IFN-&#x003b3; is abrogated.</p><p>The implication is that the CIA immunisation schedule induces a decrease in T<sub>reg </sub>activity and that endogenous IFN-&#x003b3; largely counteracts this decrease. It therefore becomes important to know by what mechanism, direct or indirect, IFN-&#x003b3; influences T<sub>reg </sub>cell function. Addition of anti-IFN-&#x003b3; antibody to the co-cultures failed to affect suppressive activity (data not shown), indicating that the relevant IFN-&#x003b3; effect takes place <italic>in vivo </italic>before sampling of the T cells. To examine the role of the different cell components, we tested suppressive activity in mixed co-cultures. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice, confronted with T<sub>eff </sub>cells and ACs from immunised wild-type mice, were not less suppressive than wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>confronted with wild-type or IFN-&#x003b3;R KO T<sub>eff </sub>cells and ACs. This suggests that lower levels of suppression in homogeneous IFN-&#x003b3;R KO cultures result in part from the presence of IFN-&#x003b3;R KO-derived ACs. And, indeed, when CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>and T<sub>eff </sub>cells from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice were co-cultured with ACs from immunised wild-type mice, suppressive activity was not inhibited. Finally, ACs from IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice by themselves were unable to downregulate the activity of wild-type T<sub>reg </sub>cells acting on wild-type T<sub>eff </sub>cells. We therefore conclude that the <italic>in vivo </italic>effect of endogenous IFN-&#x003b3; that accounts for the greater suppressive activity in wild-type mice than in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice concerns reprogramming of both ACs and T<sub>reg </sub>cells.</p><p>Because CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice were not less suppressive than those of immunised wild-type mice in co-cultures with T<sub>eff </sub>cells and ACs from immunised wild-type mice, we can refute the proposition that the lower expression of Foxp3 in the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>population from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice is due to a smaller proportion of T<sub>reg </sub>cells and a larger number of activated T<sub>eff </sub>cells. Indeed, if the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>population from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice contained a higher proportion of activated T<sub>eff </sub>cells, suppression by these CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells should be lower, irrespective of the origin of the T<sub>eff </sub>cells and ACs. Another argument is that the addition of more CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells failed to improve suppression in co-cultures of cells from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice. Our data are therefore more in line with the proposition of a lower Foxp3 expression level per cell.</p><p>Expression of Foxp3 could be downregulated by the interaction of T<sub>reg </sub>cells with ACs. ACs might be source of TGF-&#x003b2;, which has been described to convert naive T cells into CD25<sup>+ </sup>suppressor cells by inducing Foxp3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Because IFN-&#x003b3; and TGF-&#x003b2; act antagonistically with each other, the low levels of Foxp3 in arthritic IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice might be due to inadequate amounts of TGF-&#x003b2; produced by ACs or other cells. However, quantitative PCR performed on isolated T<sub>reg </sub>cells, on cells obtained from co-cultures (T<sub>reg </sub>plus T<sub>eff </sub>plus ACs) and on splenocytes from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO and wild-type mice does not support the concept that the defective activity of T<sub>reg </sub>cells <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo </italic>is due to defects in the production of TGF-&#x003b2;. ACs have also been shown to be able to reverse suppression by CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells through the GITR/GITR-ligand system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. GITR (glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor) is expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells; GITR-ligand is initially upregulated on activated APCs. It remains to be determined whether this process involves a downregulation of Foxp3 expression. This or a similar mechanism might take place during the interaction of T<sub>reg </sub>cells and ACs from immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice. Co-cultures with ACs of immunised wild-type mice might possibly normalise Foxp3 expression in the T<sub>reg </sub>cells of immunised IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice, together with their T<sub>reg </sub>suppressive activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our experiments support a pathogenesis model that ascribes an important role to T<sub>reg </sub>cells as moderators of the disease course in CIA. In particular we show that T<sub>reg </sub>cells fulfil this role not only during the induction phase but also during the effector phase of the autoimmune response. Furthermore, we were able to refine the model by showing that, after the immunisation with CII in CFA, T<sub>reg </sub>cells lose part of their suppressive potential. This effect is more pronounced in IFN-&#x003b3;R KO than in wild-type mice, indicating that, in this system, IFN-&#x003b3; acts as an upregulator of T<sub>reg </sub>activity, which might be part of the explanation for the well-known protective effect of endogenous IFN-&#x003b3;. Finally, we present evidence that the mechanism underlying the effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on T<sub>reg </sub>cell activity is exerted in part via ACs.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACs = accessory cells; CFA = complete Freund's adjuvant; CIA = collagen-induced arthritis; CII = collagen type II; CTLA = cytolytic T lymphocyte-associated antigen; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; fetal calf serum = FCS; FITC = fluorescein isothiocyanate; GITR = glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor; IFN-&#x003b3; = interferon-&#x003b3;; IFN-&#x003b3;R KO = interferon-&#x003b3; receptor knock-out; IL = interleukin; MACS = magnetic-activated cell sorting; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; RT-PCR = reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; STAT = signal transduction and activators of transcription; T<sub>eff </sub>= effector T; TGF = transforming growth factor; TLR = Toll-like receptor; T<sub>reg </sub>= regulatory T.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BDK, HK and TM performed the CIA induction and evaluation.
