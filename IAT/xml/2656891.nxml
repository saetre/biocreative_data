Ligand binding stimulates homodimerization and heterodimerization of EGFR family members. The dimerization facilitates cross-phosphorylation of tyrosines within the cytoplasmic domains that become binding sites for downstream effector proteins. The proto-oncogene product ErbB2 is unique in that it does not bind soluble ligands and requires a heterodimer partner for ligand-dependent activation. ErbB3 is also unique because the kinase domain is catalytically inactive, so that ErbB3 also requires a heterodimerization partner for activity. Once activated, ErbB3 is strongly linked to prosurvival signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. ErbB3 has six binding sites for the p85 adaptor subunit of PI3K. PI3K catalyzes formation of 3' phosphoinositides that recruit the protein kinase Akt/protein kinase B to the membrane for activation by phosphorylation. The activated Akt is involved in cellular processes including survival, cell growth, and proliferation (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]).</p><p>The ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer, one of many possible ErbB heterodimer combinations, is important in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). ErbB3 is a preferred heterodimerization partner for the proto-oncogene ErbB2, and the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer is highly biologically active and pro-tumorigenic <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. ErbB2 and ErbB3 are often co-over-expressed in breast, ovarian, colorectal, and bladder cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recent advances in the treatment of cancers driven by ErbB alterations include the use of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antagonist antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Surprisingly, ErbB3 signaling is often crucial to the success or failure of ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitors, despite the lack of intrinsic ErbB3 kinase activity. In breast cancers with amplified <italic>ERBB2</italic>, ErbB3 augments ErbB2 signaling through strong coupling to survival pathways that complement the signals emanating from ErbB2, thus allowing the cancer cells to escape from inhibition therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In all likelihood, ErbB3 signaling will also contribute to resistance to single and dual specificity EGFR and ErbB2 inhibitors (for example, lapatinib) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], as they come into clinical use for trastuzumab-resistant <italic>ERBB2</italic>-amplified breast cancer, and to pertuzumab, an antibody inhibitor of ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells with mutated EGFR, amplification of the <italic>MET </italic>oncogene activates prosurvival ErbB3 signaling, which allows escape from tyrosine kinase inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]). Given these findings, downregulation of ErbB3 signaling in human cancers is critical to successful ErbB-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.</p><p>The importance of ErbBs in human breast cancer is linked to their importance in normal mammary gland biology. Understanding these normal functions and their regulators will lead to better prognostication and treatment decisions, and to identification of novel therapeutic targets. However, the individual role played by each receptor in mammary gland development has been difficult to determine. This is because the individual receptors and their agonists display complex and overlapping expression patterns, and because the receptors are required for multiple developmental activities, some of which are essential for prenatal viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Both EGFR and ErbB2 are highly expressed and co-localized in all major cell types in the pubescent mouse mammary gland, but at maturity they are differentially localized, with EGFR in the stroma and ErbB2 in the epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. ErbB3 and ErbB4 are only expressed at low levels in postpubescent mammary glands from virgin mice, but they are expressed at higher levels during pregnancy and lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. All four of the ErbBs are expressed in the late pregnancy and early lactation glands. This differential expression pattern implies important roles for EGFR and ErbB2 in the developing mammary gland, and for ErbB3 and ErbB4 in the later stages of mammary gland development and differentiation.</p><p>Early studies suggested that only ErbBs EGFR and ErbB2 are important in early postnatal mammary development, because ErbB3 and ErbB4 are expressed at very low levels, and because neuregulins (NRGs), growth factors that bind exclusively to ErbB3 and ErbB4, were difficult to detect at early stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Nonetheless, there is evidence for ErbB3 or ErbB4 signaling in the pubescent mammary gland. Implantation of Elvax ethylene vinyl acetate (Elvax Ethylene, Dupont, Wilmington, Delaware, USA) slow release pellets containing NRG1, normally expressed during pregnancy, promoted ductal growth and alveologenesis in mammary glands of pubescent mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Because NRG1 binds ErbB3 and ErbB4 but not EGFR or ErbB2, this suggested that ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 are functional (but not necessarily active) at puberty. <italic>ErbB4 </italic>null mice, with the essential cardiac function supplied by transgene-driven expression of ErbB4 cDNA exclusively in the heart, survive past birth and are defective in lactation, but undergo normal development at puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This indicates that ErbB4 is not essential during pubescent mammary gland development, and implies, by elimination, that ErbB3 is the active receptor in NRG1 implantation experiments.</p><p>Attempts to determine the role of ErbB3 in mammary gland development have been impeded by the embryonic lethality caused by <italic>ErbB3 </italic>gene disruption, which leads to cardiac and neurodevelopmental defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To determine the roles played by ErbB3 in mammary gland development, we chose to use a loss-of-function approach. Mammary buds isolated from <italic>ErbB3 </italic>null embryos at day 12.5 were transplanted into the cleared fat pad of prepubescent immunocompromised recipient mice. Transplanted <italic>ErbB3 </italic>null buds supported growth of an epithelial tree, but the ducts did not penetrate the fat pad to the same extent as ducts from a wild-type bud transplant. Also, the terminal end buds (TEBs) that pilot ductal extension through the mammary fat pad have an increase in apoptotic structures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mammary gland transplants</title><p>A null mutation was created at the <italic>ErbB3 </italic>gene locus by homologous recombination resulting in the deletion of amino acids 73 to 107.

Embryonic day 12.5 embryos (stage estimated from timed pregnancies) resulting from an intercross of <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+/- </sup>heterozygotes in a mixed 129/C57BL6/BalbC or a high C57BL6 strain background were harvested by Caesarean section. Immunoblot analysis of <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, and <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos verified dose-dependent expression of ErbB3 (Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Mammary gland transplants were performed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For each recipient mouse, one number four inguinal mammary fat pad was transplanted with a single mammary bud isolated from a <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>female, and the contralateral number four inguinal fat pad was transplanted with a mammary bud from an <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>or <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+/- </sup>female littermate. The fat pads containing transplants were harvested from virgin hosts at 4, 7, or 20 weeks after transplantation, or the recipients were bred and the glands harvested at 1 day postpartum. The overall take rate for transplanted buds was 74% and was not affected by the genotype of the donor embryo. All animal work was approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and followed internationally recognized guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphological analysis</title><p>Whole mount analysis was carried out as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Briefly, the total ductal outgrowth in digital images of glands was determined by drawing a line from the one edge of furthest ductal outgrowth to the opposite edge of furthest ductal outgrowth, and measuring the length of that line in arbitrary units. This analysis was done in triplicate for each gland and the average measurement is reported. The branchpoint analysis was done by counting the number of branchpoints within a box of fixed dimensions. The area of TEBs in digital images of carmine alum-stained whole mounted glands was determined by outlining the TEB using the elliptical or freehand selection tool in ImageJ imaging software. The epithelial area of the TEBs in the sections from paraffin-embedded glands were analyzed similarly, but areas of luminal and other vacuolated spaces were subtracted from the outer measurements to give the epithelial area only.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for E-cadherin, P-cadherin, &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (SMA) were performed as described by Jackson-Fisher and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], except a 1:200 dilution of primary antibody was used for SMA IHC. For E-cadherin IHC, seven +/+, four +/-, and 10 -/- glands were analyzed; and for SMA IHC six +/+, four +/-, and 10 -/- glands were analyzed. Mouse IgG was used as a negative control for both E-cadherin and SMA IHC. For P-cadherin IHC, seven +/+, four +/-, and 10 -/- glands were analyzed and goat IgG was used as a negative control.</p></sec><sec><title>BrdU and cleaved caspase 3</title><p>5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) analysis (n = 3 +/+, 1 +/-, and 6 -/-) was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. For cleaved caspase 3 IHC (n = 5 +/+, 3 +/-, and 7 -/- glands), rabbit polyclonal cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was used. The antigen was unmasked in a low pH citrate buffer under heat and pressure. The antibody was diluted 1:100 in Primary Antibody Diluting Buffer (Biomeda, Foster City, CA, USA), overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Endogenous peroxidases were inactivated with 1% hydrogen peroxide 10 minutes, and a 1:100 diluted biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody solution (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, PK-6101; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) was added. Peroxidase activity was detected with freshly prepared DAB solution (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Histological analysis of apoptosis</title><p>In a double-blind analysis, five TEBs on each hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) stained section were scored for total number of nuclei and for the number of apoptotic cells (n = 6 +/+ or +/-, and 7 -/- glands; 25 slides total). Slides were examined using an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NJ, USA). Mammary bud epithelial cell nuclei and apoptotic cells within a 100 square (1 mm &#x000d7; 1 mm) grid were counted manually on a laboratory counter (Denominator, Woodbury, CT, USA). Five separate mammary buds were counted for one tissue section per slide at 40&#x000d7;. The ratio of apoptotic cells to nuclei was determined.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Analysis of <italic>ErbB3 </italic>function in postnatal development of the mammary gland has been hampered by the embryonic lethality of <italic>ErbB3 </italic>knockout mice. <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>null mice die <italic>in utero </italic>at day 13.5 or as late as days 16 to 18, depending on the strain background, because of cardiac cushion abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, postnatal development of <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>epithelium in ErbB3 wild-type stroma can be analyzed by transplantation. Mammary buds from day 12.5 <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos were isolated and transplanted into prepubescent immunocompromised recipient mammary fat pads that had been surgically cleared of the endogenous epithelium. The contralateral gland of each recipient mouse was also cleared of epithelium and transplanted with an <italic>ErbB3 </italic>wild type (+/+) or heterozygous (+/-) mammary bud from a female littermate embryo as a positive control. At various times after transplantation, the transplanted glands were harvested from the recipient mice and the epithelial tree was visualized by carmine alum staining of whole mounted glands.</p><p>At 4 weeks after transplantation the epithelial trees resulting from <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+ </sup>(+/+ or +/-) transplant had filled a majority of the fat pad (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), whereas the <italic>ErbB</italic><sup>-/- </sup>transplant epithelial trees only filled a small fraction of the glands (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). The total ductal length was measured for each of the paired contralateral gland outgrowths (four pairs). The length of the <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+ </sup>outgrowths and the severity of the <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>penetration defect varied at 4 weeks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). The mean <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+ </sup>outgrowth length was 412; the mean <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>outgrowth was 140. At seven weeks after transplantation, most of the <italic>ErbB3</italic>+ outgrowths (eight glands) had completely filled the fat pad (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), but none of the <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>outgrowths (five glands) filled the fat pad (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The severity of the <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ductal penetration defects varied. At 7 weeks, transplantation yielded two 'paired' glands from mice in which both <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+ </sup>and <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>transplants were successful. For these pairs only, the mean <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+ </sup>outgrowth length was 721; the mean <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>outgrowth was 528 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). For all of the glands assayed, including a number of 'unpaired' glands from mice in which only one of the two transplants survived, the mean <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+ </sup>outgrowth length was 737; the mean <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>outgrowth was 406. This ductal penetration defect persisted in adult nonparous <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>glands (two glands; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>), and was not rescued by the influence of hormones during pregnancy or lactation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+ </sup>outgrowths (four glands) filled the fat pad and normal alveolar structures were evident at 1 day postpartum (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). Even though the <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>outgrowth did not reach the edges of the fat pad, normal alveolar structures were present at 1 day postpartum (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>; four <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+ </sup>glands and four <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>glands). On the histological level, the alveoli were distended, with milk in the lumens and lipid droplets in the cells, suggesting that both the differentiation and secretory pathways are normal in the <italic>+/+ </italic>and <italic>-/- </italic>glands (insets, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g,h</xref>). Analysis of lactation after 1 day postpartum is not possible because the epithelial outgrowth from the transplant is not attached to the nipple, so remodeling of the gland to the prepregnancy state occurs quite rapidly.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Whole mount analysis of ductal morphogenesis in transplanted glands.

Likewise, there was an increase in the number of TEBs in <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>glands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). TEBs are bulbous structures found at the invasive ends of an advancing ducts, and are major sites of proliferation and apoptosis in the pubescent mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Normally, TEBs regress once the developing epithelial tree has reached the edge of the fat pad. At 4 weeks after transplantation, several large TEBs are evident in whole mounts of <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+ </sup>outgrowths (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, top left). however, by 7 weeks after transplantation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, middle left) the TEBs have mainly regressed and they are not present at 20 weeks after transplantation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, bottom left).

The outer layer of cap cells at the advancing end of the buds merges into the more distal myoepithelial layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Cap cells are active sites for proliferation in the TEB and the progenitors for the myoepithelial cells that line the duct and the interior body and luminal cells. The second layer encompasses the inner, multilayered body cells that line the lumen and are thought to be major sites of apoptosis in TEBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Both of these cell types are apparent in <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>TEBs at 4 weeks after transplantation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). The single layer of cap (and myoepithelial) cells is marked by expression of SMA and the adhesion molecule P-cadherin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b,d</xref>), whereas multilayered body cells express the adhesion molecule E-cadherin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. There is a large lumen surrounded by the body cells in each of the consecutive stained sections from the <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>gland. The <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>TEBs have the same general organization, but they differ in the type and severity of the defect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, bottom four rows). The first <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>TEB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e&#x02013;i</xref>) has a single layer of cap cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4h</xref>) and a multilayered body cell compartment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4g</xref>); however, there are large vacuolated spaces between and the cap and body cell layers. The second <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>TEB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4j&#x02013;n</xref>) also has some spaces between the cap and body cell layers, and the lumen is filled with cells. There is an influx of cells that express smooth muscle actin in the body cell compartment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4l</xref>) and do not express E-cadherin like the surrounding body cells (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4m</xref>). In a more severely defective <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>TEB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4o&#x02013;s</xref>), there are fewer body cells. There is a single layer of cap cells surrounding a large space (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4q</xref>), and few body cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4p</xref>) that surround a small luminal space.

This phenotype is more severe than that induced by knockout of any of the three other ErbBs in mammary epithelium, underscoring the importance of ErbB3 in mammary development. The postnatal requirement of ErbB3 in the stroma was not addressed in this study. This ductal outgrowth/penetration phenotype varied in severity. Lobuloalveolar development was not affected in <italic>ErbB3</italic>-null glands. Lack of epithelial ErbB3 affected the phenotype of TEBs. TEBs were more numerous but smaller in size in the <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>outgrowths. Apoptotic cells were more common within the TEBs in the null glands, but there was no apparent change in the proliferative cells.</p><p>In related experiments, Qu and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] inhibited ErbB3 expression in the mammary gland by using Cre recombinase to invert a transcriptional suppressor integrated in an intron. Mammary glands, analyzed at 4 weeks and 8 weeks, had lower ductal density, fewer branches, and fewer TEBs. TEB morphology was not discussed, and neither was development at later time points. The limited analysis, the fact that the experimental approach involved reduction, not elimination, of ErbB3 expression, and other technical differences make it difficult to compare that report with the present study directly.</p><p>The pubescent epithelial outgrowth/penetration defect we obtained was accompanied by an increase in the branch density in <italic>ErbB3</italic>-null glands. Mammary branching is modulated by diverse factors, including members of the EGFR family (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]). The interaction between the ErbB family and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in particular, is known to be important in branching. The EGFR promotes activation of MMP-2 and MMP-14, which are important for lung branching and morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the mammary gland, MMP-2 is important for ductal elongation whereas MMP-3 promotes side branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Disruption of the MMP network by the lack of ErbB3 could result in decreased ability of the ducts to penetrate the surrounding stroma.</p><p>Despite the importance of branching, other abnormalities in the <italic>ErbB3</italic>-null glands are likely also to contribute to the outgrowth/penetration defect. TEBs are epithelial structures found at the end of a growing duct in the pubescent gland and are responsible for growth and penetration of the normal epithelial tree into the surrounding fat pad. TEBs are evident at the tips of the advancing ducts until the edge of the fat pad is reached, at which point they regress. In the <italic>ErbB3</italic>-null glands there was an increase in the number of TEBs, probably due to the increase in branching and consequently in the number of ducts, but a decrease in the overall size of the TEBs. On a histological level, the <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>TEBs had a range of structural abnormalities that could account for their small size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Some of the TEBs were relatively normal in organization, with an outer single layer of cap and myoepithelial cells marked by P-cadherin expression, an inner multilayered body cell compartment marked by E-cadherin expression, and a central cleared luminal space. A majority of the TEBs had some structural defect including large spaces between the cap/myoepithelial cell layer and the body cell layer, and/or filled in luminal spaces. The most severe TEB abnormalities were detected at 7 weeks after transplantation. The cap/myoepithelial cell compartment appeared to become multilayered and invaded or co-inhabited the body cell compartment, which itself was numerically diminished. This could occur through loss of normal compartmentalization boundaries, and even invasion of the inner layers by the outer layer, perhaps accompanying loss of body cells. Dysregulation of the P-cadherin or E-cadherin adhesion systems could account for some of these structural abnormalities, because they are important for maintaining the boundaries as is netrin/neogenin signaling. It is possible that changes in differentiation of progenitor cells alter the balance of these populations.</p><p>With the information available, the most likely source of the TEB aberrations is an increased rate of apoptosis. A change in the normal balance between proliferation and apoptosis in the TEBs of a pubertal mammary gland would affect the ability of the epithelial tree to fill the fat pad. The proliferative cap cells are typically located at the distal end of the TEB, whereas the apoptotic cells are located in the inner body cell layer surrounding the hollow lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The pattern of apoptotic cells in the TEBs suggests that apoptosis is responsible for clearing of the lumen within the growing duct. In the <italic>ErbB3</italic>-null glands, proliferation was not affected, but apoptosis as detected by cleaved caspase 3 immunohistochemistry and the presence of apoptotic figures in H&#x00026;E-stained sections was increased in comparison to <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>+ </sup>glands. ErbB3 has six binding sites for the p85 adaptor subunit of PI3K and is strongly linked to prosurvival signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. The uncoupling of ErbB3 from the PI3K/Akt pathway in <italic>ErbB3</italic>-null outgrowths could result in the increase in apoptosis detected in the TEBs. An increase in apoptosis would explain the large number of cells in the normally cleared luminal space at 4 weeks after transplantation and then the apparent decrease in body cells numbers in TEBs at 7 weeks in ErbB3-null glands.</p><p>The <italic>ErbB3</italic>-null pubescent mammary gland phenotype might not be predicted based on earlier studies showing only limited expression of ErbB3 in the pubescent gland. However, implantation of the NRG1 in the pubescent mammary gland stimulated epithelial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Hence, one of the NRG receptors ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 can function at this stage of mammary development. Because loss of ErbB3 function, but not loss of ErbB4 function, compromised pubescent mammary development, it is likely that ErbB3 was activated by the implanted ligand. However, ErbB3 is devoid of kinase activity and requires a heterodimerization partner for activation. Among the potential heterodimerization partners EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4, only EGFR and ErbB2 are required for ductal outgrowth in the pubescent mammary gland. EGFR is expressed in both the epithelium and stroma, but it is only required in the stroma during pubescent mouse mammary gland development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Hence, ErbB2 may be the unique co-receptor, but EGFR and ErbB4 may work redundantly with ErbB3.</p><p>The epithelial null phenotype for ErbB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] most closely resembles the phenotype for <italic>ErbB3 </italic>null, consistent with the importance of ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling at pubescence. <italic>ErbB2</italic>-null mammary buds transplanted into wild-type fat pads develop into ductal tree that grossly resembles the <italic>ErbB3</italic>-null phenotype. However, in contrast to <italic>ErbB3 </italic>nulls, the defect was present in the pubescent gland, but was not evident in adult glands or pregnancy. <italic>ErbB2</italic>-null TEBs also had structural defects in the TEBs, characterized by a decrease in body cell number, an increase in the presence of cap/myoepithelial-like cells in the prelumenal compartment, and the presence of large luminal spaces. The similar requirement for ErbB2 and ErbB3 in the epithelium of the pubescent mammary gland strongly implies that the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer is important in the epithelium at this stage in development.</p><p>The heterodimerization partner(s) dictates the range of ligands capable of activating ErbB3 in the pubescent mammary gland. Because ErbB2 does not bind soluble ligands, the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer would need to be activated by ligand-bound ErbB3. However, because growth factors in this family are activated by proteolysis, further work will be required to determine the importance of these agonists in pubescent mammary development. Knockout studies have shown that NRG1 isoform &#x003b1; is required, but in adult maturation of the mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>If ErbB3 is heterodimerized with EGFR, then other ligands could be responsible for transactivation of ErbB3. Of the known EGFR ligands, amphiregulin has been shown to be important and upregulated during pubescent mammary gland development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. With the mammary defects in amphiregulin-knockout mice, EGFR is probably signaling in the epithelium either as a homodimer or heterodimer with ErbB2 and/or ErbB3 in the pubescent mouse mammary gland.</p><p>ErbB family members are over-expressed because of amplification or have activating mutations in a variety of human cancers. Mutated <italic>EGFR </italic>has been found in a subset of NSCLCs, and <italic>ERBB2 </italic>is amplified and over-expressed in up to 30% of human breast cancers, which is associated with a poorer clinical outcome. In both contexts, the ErbBs are validated therapeutic targets. ErbB3 may be quite important in governing the signaling output of the activated ErbBs, initial response to therapies, and in the development of drug resistance. For example, some NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations with a good clinical response to EGFR inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib initially, but later develop resistance. In one study, half of these patients developed a second activating mutation, whereas the other half had amplified <italic>MET</italic>, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by hepatocyte growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]). The NSCLC tumors escaped tyrosine kinase inhibition because MET activates ErbB3 and the prosurvival PI3K kinase pathway. In human breast cancer cells that over-express ErbB2 and have also developed resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, there is active PI3K/Akt via ErbB3 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In summary, therapies that target ErbB tyrosine kinase activities, kinase inactive ErbB3 and the downstream PI3K/Akt signaling may evade inhibition. A better understanding of ErbB3 in normal mammary gland signaling will reveal the nature of endogenous regulators, and may be beneficial to development of future directed therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>ErbB3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mammary outgrowth defect was associated with a decrease in the size of the TEBs, and increases in branch density, in the number of terminal end buds, and in the number of luminal spaces.
