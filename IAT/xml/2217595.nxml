However, our understanding about how these parallel pathways develop is still in its infancy, because few molecular markers corresponding to individual RGC types are available. Previously, we reported a secretory protein, <italic>SPIG1</italic> (clone name; D/Bsp120I #1), preferentially expressed in the dorsal region in the developing chick retina. Here, we generated knock-in mice to visualize <italic>SPIG1</italic>-expressing cells with green fluorescent protein. We found that the mouse retina is subdivided into two distinct domains for <italic>SPIG1</italic> expression and <italic>SPIG1</italic> effectively marks a unique subtype of the retinal ganglion cells during the neonatal period. <italic>SPIG1</italic>-positive RGCs in the dorsotemporal domain project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), superior colliculus, and accessory optic system (AOS). In contrast, in the remaining region, here named the pan-ventronasal domain, <italic>SPIG1</italic>-positive cells form a regular mosaic and project exclusively to the medial terminal nucleus (MTN) of the AOS that mediates the optokinetic nystagmus as early as P1. Their dendrites costratify with ON cholinergic amacrine strata in the inner plexiform layer as early as P3. These findings suggest that these <italic>SPIG1</italic>-positive cells are the ON direction selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). Moreover, the MTN-projecting cells in the pan-ventronasal domain are apparently composed of two distinct but interdependent regular mosaics depending on the presence or absence of <italic>SPIG1</italic>, indicating that they comprise two functionally distinct subtypes of the ON DSGCs. The formation of the regular mosaic appears to be commenced at the end of the prenatal stage and completed through the peak period of the cell death at P6. SPIG1 will thus serve as a useful molecular marker for future studies on the development and function of ON DSGCs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are classified into at least 10&#x02013;15 types based on morphology and/or physiology in mammalian species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Masland1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Rockhill1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, little is known about how distinct RGC types are generated or how they develop these key features. Because of a lack of molecular markers to selectively label a specific type of RGC early enough in development, investigators had to infer what happened during the mosaic formation of RGCs by examining older tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Jayarasasingam1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Eglen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Past studies on mammals suggested that dendritic segregation into ON and OFF sublayers in the IPL is the result of selective elimination of branches by an activity-dependent mechanism following an initial stage of overgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Maslim1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Bodnarenko2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, subtypes cannot be readily distinguished by their morphology early in development. On the other hand, time-lapse imaging of zebrafish RGCs demonstrated that most RGCs precisely target synaptic strata within the IPL while each RGC subtype exhibits individual dendritic growth and arborization patterns. This implies that amacrine cells provide stratification cues for their RGC partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Mumm1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. To assess whether this mechanism of stratification is also applicable to some subtypes of the RGCs in mammals, molecular markers are required for distinguishing among the different types of RGCs.</p><p>Two types of RGCs are known to code the direction of image motion: the ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) and the ON DSGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Barlow1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Levick1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Both these types respond with many spikes to motion in a particular direction and with few spikes to the opposite motion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Taylor1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The ON DSGCs comprise three physiological subtypes distinguished by their preferred directions, corresponding roughly to upward, downward, and temporal to nasal in the visual field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Oyster1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Each physiological subtype is assumed to connect with a selective subset of cholinergic amacrine cells and other presynaptic neurons to achieve the specificity of preferred direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Fried1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>; however, how each subtype is generated and these circuits are organized during development remains totally unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Demb1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been assumed that the ON DSGCs provide the sole retinal input to the terminal nuclei of the accessory optic system (AOS), where directional signals from ON DSGCs underlie the optokinetic nystagmus that stabilizes an image on the retina in the presence of head movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Oyster2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The neurons in the medial terminal nucleus (MTN), a principal terminal nucleus of the AOS, respond best to either upward or downward movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Simpson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been puzzling that the distribution of MTN-projecting cells is almost random, because other types of RGCs usually form a regular mosaic with a clear exclusion zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Dann2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Cook2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previously, we described the dorsal-rich expression of a clone, tentatively named D/Bsp120I #1, in the developing chick retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Shintani1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. D/Bsp120I #1 is a secretory molecule of unknown function, which is composed of a follistatin (FS)-like domain, an extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain, and two immunoglobulin-like domains. Here we refer to this molecule as SPIG1 after <underline>S</underline>PARC (<underline>s</underline>ecreted <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>a</underline>cidic and <underline>r</underline>ich in <underline>c</underline>ysteine: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Yan1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>)-related <underline>p</underline>rotein containing <underline>i</underline>mmuno<underline>g</underline>lobulin domains. In the present study, we found that SPIG1-positive ganglion cells in the neonatal mouse retina form a regular mosaic in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) broadly in the ventronasal region, suggesting that they represent a single type of neuron. To characterize this type of RGC, we visualized <italic>SPIG1</italic>-expressing neurons by using genetically encoded <italic>green fluorescent protein</italic> (<italic>gfp</italic>) and examined their spatial organization, dendritic arborization, and axonal projection during the neonatal period. Our study revealed that the MTN-projecting cells form a superimposition of two distinct regular mosaics, and that SPIG1 marks a subtype of the ON DSGCs projecting to the MTN during development. Moreover, monitoring the GFP-labeled RGCs provided new insights into the developmental changes in dendritic stratification and mosaic formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression of <italic>SPIG1</italic> mRNA in the developing mouse retina is asymmetric along the dorsotemporal to ventronasal axis</title><p>We previously identified a catalog of topographic molecules through large-scale screening in the developing chick retina. <italic>SPIG1</italic> (formerly D/Bsp120I #1; GenBank accession number, AF257353 and EF692644) was identified as being preferentially expressed in the GCL in the dorsal region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Shintani1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

At P1, dendrites ramified widely across the vertical extent of the IPL, where it became evident that their distribution within the IPL was biased to the inner half. At P3, the dendrites monostratified at the ON sublamina. The monostratification trend became more pronounced at P6 and P8.</p><p>To quantify the stratification of dendrites, pixel intensity distribution for GFP as a function of the IPL depth was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g004">Figure 4E, F</xref>). The vertical spread of dendrites was expressed as the width at half maximum height (WHM). Average WHM values were relatively constant between P1 and P6 (Figure 4E, middle). However, when expressed as a percentage of the IPL, they showed a decrease with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, right).

From P3 to P8, there was significant overlap between the dendrites of GFP-positive cells and the cholinergic plexuses.

At P1, the DRP for near distances showed a reduction, indicating that the possibility that another cell is located nearby becomes lower: The leftmost bar in the DRPs corresponds to the density of tightly neighboring cells, because the somatic diameter of CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells is 12&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;m. After P3, the DRP for all the CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells shows a trough at around 20&#x02013;60 &#x000b5;m from the reference cell. This feature was maintained up to P12, although the overall density continues to decrease. The DRP for GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (second column) at P1, in contrast, already begins to show mosaic features. At P3, the mosaic features become more apparent although homotypic cell pairs still exist. At P6, homotypic cells at near distance are completely removed and a clear exclusion zone emerges.

We estimated DRP features of the respective ganglion array of the next developmental stages from the former stages based on the assumption that an isotropic expansion occurs by a factor corresponding to the increase in the retinal area, and a decrease in the overall population density of the MTN-projecting cells takes place independently of cell position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, red lines).

In this study, we followed developmental changes in the mosaic pattern of two subtypes of RGCs during the neonatal period in the pan-ventronasal domain of the retina. We have shown that both GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are already organized into a regular mosaic at P1, though neighboring GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are infrequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g004">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g006">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g008">Figure 8</xref>); the inclination of the exclusion at a distance of less than &#x0223c;50 &#x000b5;m is detectable from the DRP profile in both populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Because this sign was not observed at E17.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001533.s003">Figure S3</xref>) in GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, the exclusion was thought to begin during this period.

This strongly indicates that cell death is not the cause of the beginning of regular mosaics observed at P1. So far, three developmental mechanisms have been hypothesized for the formation of a mosaic by retinal neurons; (i) lateral inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Austin1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Waid1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, (ii) tangential migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Reese1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Reese3">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>, and (iii) cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Jayarasasingam1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Raven1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Resta1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Most of these insights come from studies on cholinergic amacrine cells and horizontal cells, because specific molecular markers only for these cell classes have been available in early development. Here we speculate that the lateral inhibition and/or tangential migration mechanisms is responsible for the formation of the mosaics observed at P1. The action of the Notch pathway is thought to be involved in specific cell-fate decisions via a lateral inhibitory mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Austin1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, ganglion cells are observed to migrate tangentially as much as 150 &#x000b5;m at this stage in the mouse retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Reese1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Reese2">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is possible to speculate that SPIG1-positive and -negative cells migrate tangentially in the GCL to yield a minimal distance between the homotypic cells. The tangential migration is suggested to be driven by short-range repulsive interactions between cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Reese3">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, SPIG1 could be a substance for recognition by the homotypic cells.</p><p>We found that the plateau densities for GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells exhibit a big difference at P1 (&#x0223c;180 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> vs. &#x0223c;110 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>), but become equal (&#x0223c;100 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g008">Figure 8B</xref>); during this period the retina increases in area by a factor of 1.40. Surprisingly, the population density of GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells at P3 indicates that their absolute number is increased during this period. Because the neurogenesis of RGCs ceases by E19 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Drger1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>, it cannot be explained by novel neurogenesis of SPIG1-negative cells. Here we propose two mechanisms that may explain the deviation of real DRP data of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells at P3 from the estimated values. The first conceivable mechanism is the cell-fate change; a fraction of SPIG1-positive cells turned SPIG1-negative by stopping the gene expression. Consistently, heterotypic cell pairs at a distance of less than 30 &#x000b5;m become evident between P1 and P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, rightmost panel at P3); this is also recognizable from the DRP profile of CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, leftmost panel). From these observations, we can speculate that GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells at P1 include the precursor population of GFP<sup>-</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b; </sup>cells, and they are further differentiated to establish a new distinct population at P3. However, it is difficult to experimentally examine whether the alteration of SPIG1 expression is directly relevant to the functional alteration of cell types, because the functional difference in MTN-projecting RGCs can be verified electrophysiologically only after P10, when neural connections with amacrine and bipolar cells have been established. The second mechanism concerns the difference in retrograde-labeling efficiency by CTB. It is possible that axons of GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells do not reach on the MTN fully until P3. If it were the case, only a fraction of GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were labeled with CTB at P1, and the density of GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells at P1 was underestimated.</p><p>Our data at P6 clearly demonstrate that closely-positioned homotypic cells are selectively lost and clear exclusion zone is developed between P3 and P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g008">Figure 8B, C</xref>). It is difficult to consider tangential migration as a mechanism for the formation of an exclusion zone between P3 and P6, because dendrites of SPIG1-positive cells were already monostratified at the ON cholinergic strata at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g004">Figure 4D&#x02013;F</xref>). Moreover, cells during migration were not observed during this period. In line with our view, it has been suggested that a spatially selective loss of ganglion cells is responsible for the increase in regularity of the RGC mosaic pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Jayarasasingam1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results also show that the dendritic stratification of SPIG1-positive cells takes place by P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g004">Figure 4D&#x02013;F</xref>) before the elimination of closely-positioned homotypic cells (between P3 and P6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). This suggests the possibility that dendritic stratification into specific sublaminas of the IPL is a prerequisite for the elimination of neighboring homotypic cells. Dendritic costratification with cholinergic cells indicates that SPIG1-positive cells may receive cholinergic inputs as early as P3. It has been shown that nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated spontaneous retinal waves during the neonatal period are involved in the refinement of retinocollicular projections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-McLaughlin1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref> and the dendritic stratification of RGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Bansal1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is worth examining whether acetylcholine receptor-mediated spontaneous retinal waves are necessary for the dendritic stratification and mosaic formation of the ganglion cell subtype marked by SPIG1 expression. On the other hand, the glutamate-mediated afferent activity seems not to be required for the elimination of neighboring cells, because ribbon synapses have not been established at this stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Olney1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Sherry1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. The cell loss between P6 and P12 occurs position-independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001533-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), implying that the increase of the exclusion zone between P6 and P12 is mainly due to the retinal growth.</p><p>In conclusion, we postulate that lateral inhibition of the cell fate decision and/or repulsive interaction during the lateral migration are the major factors responsible for the formation of the regular mosaics for the MTN-projecting RGCs, which are already observed at P1. After that spatially selective death of neighboring homotypic cells between P3 and P6 contributes to the completion of the mosaic. The latter is probably induced by an activity-dependent mechanism after the establishment of dendritic stratification on the cholinergic strata at P3, which roughly corresponds to the peak period of cell death (P2&#x02013;P5).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Direction-selective retinal circuit</title><p>Elucidating how a direction-selective system arises in the visual system is a general aim of systems neuroscience <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Demb1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

A glass pipette (tip diameter &#x0223c;30 &#x000b5;m) connected to a microinjector (IM-9B; NARISHIGE) was used for the tracer injection. The glass pipette was positioned on the stereotaxic head-holder (SG-4N; NARISHIGE) with an angle of 50&#x000b0; to avoid penetration of the microglass pipette into visual areas overlying the MTN as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Dann2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Retrogradely labeled retinas were removed and flat mounted, then the entire retina was photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Axiophoto2; Zeiss) with a 10x objective (NA, 0.3; Zeiss) to map all of the loci of labeled RGCs and GFP-positive cells in the GCL. Next, z-stack images of labeled RGCs at 0.45 &#x000b5;m steps were acquired to examine the colocalization of GFP and CTB-Alexa 555 signals using the confocal microscope with a 40x water immersion objective. The contrast of the final image was adjusted using Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization in conjunction with CTB labeling</title><p>We found that the Alexa dyes coupled to CTB maintain their fluorescence after prolonged heating inherent to the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization procedure.

One day after the injection of CTB-Alexa 488 unilaterally into the MTN, the mice were perfused with 4&#x00025; PFA and retinal sections at 16 &#x000b5;m were prepared for fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization.

The spatial organization of the labeled cells was investigated by obtaining the density recovery profile (DRP) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Rodieck2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The DRP describes the spatial autocorrelation within a single population of cells, or the crosscorrelation between two types of cells. For the DRP in the pan-ventronasal domain, three fields were sampled from the dorsonasal, ventronasal, and ventrotemporal quadrants (900&#x000d7;900 &#x000b5;m in the respective mid-peripheral region). For the DRP in the dorsotemporal domain, a similar field was sampled from the dorsotemporal quadrant. For the DRP, each cell in the field was considered as a reference cell and the distribution of distances of all other cells from the reference cell was plotted. A second cell was next treated as a reference cell, and a similar distribution measured. For the DRP of crosscorrelation between GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, each GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell was considered as a reference cell and the distribution of distances of all GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b7;CTB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from the reference cell was plotted. When the results were binned, the DRP shows the average distribution of distances from any chosen cell. In this study, the cells were binned at 10 &#x000b5;m intervals. When the cells are randomly distributed, the profile becomes flat with a value equal to the mean spatial density. Increasing values towards a reference cell indicate a clustering distribution, and decreasing values indicate anti-clustering. Estimated DRP graphs based on isotropic retinal growth and random cell death were obtained as follows. First, the DRP graphs were stretched along the Y-axis based on a retinal increase in length. A factor of the retinal increase in length was calculated by extracting the square root of the increase in a whole retinal area. Second, the graphs were scaled down along the X-axis based on decreases in cell density accounted for by a retinal increase in area and a reduction of MTN-projecting cells in a whole retina, assuming that the cell loss occurs independently of the distance from a reference cell. Thus the bin sizes of the estimated graphs are more than 10 &#x000b5;m. The obtained graphs were fitted to the real data of the respective next developmental stage. The size of the exclusion zone in the autocorrelation was quantified using the effective radius (ER) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001533-Rodieck2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In brief, the ER was obtained as the difference between (i) and (ii), where (i) is the shortest distance (D) for which the histogram of DRP reaches its average plateau density, and (ii) is the quotient of the integral of DRP between zero and D divided by the average plateau density. The ERs were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by a Fisher's PLSD post hoc test with StatView software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001533.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>GFP expression in the retina after eye opening.
