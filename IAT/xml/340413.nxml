Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 2061), we have isolated from a Balb/c mouse liver DNA library the mouse chromosomal gene and analyzed its overall structure. The gene occurs as a single copy in the haploid genome and contains four exons and three introns. The exon sequences almost completely match the cloned cDNA sequence. Interestingly, there is a fairly high degree of homology between mouse IL-4 and mouse IL-2 genes extending more than 200 bp upstream of a "TATA" like sequence located 20 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. These sequences may play an important role in the regulated expression of this gene in concanavalin A or antigen-stimulated T lymphocytes. The supernatant of COS7 cells transfected with plasmid DNA containing the entire gene exhibited both T cell growth factor and mast cell growth factor activities.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0340-a" xlink:role="336"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0343-a" xlink:role="339"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0337.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="333"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0338.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="334"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0339.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="335"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0340.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="336"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0341.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="337"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0342.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="338"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0343.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="339"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0344.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="340"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0345.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="341"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0346.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="342"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0347.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="343"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0348.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="344"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
