Introduction</title><p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT) is one of the most successful and leading bacterial pathogens that cause sexually transmitted infections; it infects and grows within the genital mucosal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Chlamydial infection is responsible for pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and endometritis, having significant impact on the reproductive health of women worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The developmental cycle of <italic>CT</italic> includes two forms: an infectious elementary body (EB) and a reticulate body that multiplies within the inclusion by binary fission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A third developmental form&#x02014;the persistent form and is considered as a mechanism of survival under stressful conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Persistence is induced in response to changes in the culture medium, including amino acid or iron deprivation and in the presence of antibiotics or cytokines such as gamma interferon (IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Iron is the most essential element because of its role in the chemistry related to bioenergetics, being involved in a myriad of biochemical events that are required for growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Excess iron promotes the generation of reactive radicals, which channelize pathogenic cascades that damage cells and tissues. Iron, as an essential nutrient and potential toxin, poses an exquisite regulatory problem in biological systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Iron homeostasis of cells is regulated posttranscriptionally by the binding of iron-regulatory proteins (IRP)-1 and -2 with iron-responsive elements (IREs). In iron-starved cells, binding of IRP to IRE stabilizes the transferrin-receptor (TfR) mRNA and inhibits the translation of mRNAs that encode the heavy (H) and light (L) chains of ferritin, thus promoting cellular iron uptake and preventing iron sequestration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Almost all cells and organisms exploit iron as a cofactor in a multitude of biochemical activities. CT EBs harvested from desferal-exposed polarized epithelial cells has a reduced infective potential, which is restored after replacement with iron-saturated transferrin medium, thus confirming the dependence of chlamydia on the host for its requirement of iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Chlamydial genomic annotation provides an idea about the iron-transporter analog of ExbB/D; however, an identifiable TonB is absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The <italic>CT</italic> divalent cation-dependent regulator is a distant relative of the ferric-uptake regulator family of iron-responsive regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The biphasic life cycle of chlamydia provides various opportunities for cross-communication with the host regulatory network. No study is available currently regarding the involvement of chlamydiae in the regulation of intracellular iron in infected HeLa cells. This study aims to provide a clue to the chlamydial modulatory effect on host cells at the interface of acquisition and commensal use of iron.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all the reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, Mo, USA) and antibodies, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, Calif, USA). Plastic wares and glasswares for tissue culture were obtained from Greiner, Germany.</p><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Culture of CT</title><p>CT, laboratory reference serovar D (D/UW-3/Cx), propagated in HeLa-229 cells as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], were purified and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in sucrose-phosphate-glutamate medium (pH 7.0). The inocula were confirmed to be free from contamination with Mycoplasma spp. using specific kits (Mycoplasma detection kit, Takara, Madison, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Infection Protocol</title><p>HeLa-229 (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) cells were seeded in 6-well tissue-culture plates (Greiner, Germany). Subsequently, the HeLa cell monolayer was washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and inoculated with chlamydial EBs at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 2. Next, the tissue-culture plates were placed on a rocker (Bangalore Genei Pvt. Ltd, Bangalore, India) for 2 hours at 35&#x000b0;C to obtain a homogeneous infectivity. The infected monolayer was washed twice with HBSS and supplemented with complete Dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Infected HeLa cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humid environment. Deferoxamine (DFX) and ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) were added after 16 hours postinfection (hpi) in the respective wells; after 24 hpi, the cells were withdrawn for analysis. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate with mock-infected cells as their respective controls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Cytosolic Extract Preparation</title><p>Infected (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) cells were lysed with 140 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of lysis buffer (20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N&#x02032;-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 25 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40, and 1 mM DTT) for 10 minutes on ice. Subsequently, the lysates were centrifuged (Platocraft, Rota 4R-V, Mumbai, India) at 15, 000 &#x000d7; g for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C to remove the cell debris and nucleus. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (BioRad Laboratories, USA), with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Electrophoretic Mobility-Shift Assay</title><p>A radiolabeled probe of the IRE was transcribed by the in vitro transcription method. The IRE sequence of 5&#x02032;GAGTTCCGTCCAAGCACUTGAAGCAGGAAACTCTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA3&#x02032; was used as the template, and the T7 sequence 5&#x02032;TATAGTGAGTCGTATTA3&#x02032; as the primer for the amplification step carried out using an in vitro transcription kit (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). The probe was treated with RNase-free DNase I to remove DNA contamination and subsequently extracted by the phenol-chloroform (1 : 1, v/v) method. The cytoplasmic extract (20 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g) was mixed with 10 ng of [<sup>32</sup>P] CTP-labeled IRE in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5% glycerol) and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. After incubation, the complex was resolved on a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. In a parallel experiment, samples were treated with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) at a final concentration of 2% before addition of the IRE probe, to allow the complete expression of IRE-binding activity. Amersham phosphoscreen was exposed to the gels for autoradiography and scanned using a PhosphorImager (Typhoon 9700, Amersham, Uppasala, Sweden). Band-shift experiments were carried out at least three times, and one representative experiment is shown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Immunoblotting of Proteins</title><p><italic>CT</italic>-infected HeLa cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently treated with lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, and 1 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride) containing the complete protease-inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (BioRad Laboratories) with BSA as standard. Extracted proteins (40 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g) were electrophoresed on 8&#x02013;12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membranes (BioRad Laboratories); the membranes were reversibly stained with Ponceau S (Sigma Aldrich) to confirm complete transfer. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-Tween-20 and incubated with rabbit anti-IgGs against TfR-1, ferritin heavy chain (FHC), IRP-1, and IRP-2; they were further incubated with the goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase.

Discussion</title><p>CT is one of the most successful bacterial pathogen in terms of intracellular survival due to its ability to modulate the host resources toward its own development. Both host and the pathogens have higher affinities for iron, the most essential element required for survival.</p><p>In accordance with previous studies, the current results showed a decline in the expression of TfR in <italic>CT</italic>-infected HeLa cells. In contrast to other intracellular pathogens, <italic>CT</italic> showed upregulation of TfR expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. TfR-mediated iron acquisition has been reported as an important mode of iron uptake, contributing the major part of the iron requirement in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Regulation of TfR is sensitive to various intracellular physiological conditions; secretory factors, such as IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, tumor necrosis factor-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6, downregulate the TfR level in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Experimental models of chlamydial infection have shown upregulation in the levels of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, these results may suggest the involvement of secretory factors in the downregulation of TfR in chlamydia-infected cell. Furthermore, the present study showed that TfR expression did not change significantly after addition of DFX and FAC. This result deciphers the modulation of the iron-regulatory machinery of cells infected with <italic>CT</italic>.</p><p>In this study, upregulation of FHC was observed in <italic>CT</italic>-infected cells, which did not alter significantly after addition of the iron chelator DFX. Physiological responses reported for TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-1, IL-6, and IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> include stimulation of H-ferritin expression and inhibition of TfR1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These results further explain the involvement of cytokines of the innate immune system in the upregulation of FHC. However, nonresponsiveness of the <italic>CT</italic>-infected cells to the iron chelator DFX might indicate modulation of the iron-regulatory system.</p><p>Chlamydia-infected HeLa cells showed the predominant expression of IRP-1 rather than IRP-2, in contrast to mock-infected cells. In iron-depleted condition, IRP-1/2 binding to IRE blocks ferritin-mRNA translation and simultaneously stabilizes the TfR mRNA, thus regulating the iron uptake and storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Because of the additional 73 amino-acid peptide sequence, IRP-2 is prone to proteosomal degradation in the presence of nitric oxide and iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Chlamydial infection induces the production of both nitric oxide and IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>/<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In response to the same stimulus, IRP-1 and -2 are regulated conversely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Hence, it may suggest that lower levels of IRP-2 might be due to the proteosomal degradation induced by nitric oxide or converse regulation by IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>.</p><p>In this study, Chlamydia-infected HeLa cells showed attenuation in IRP-IRE binding activity; however, the binding activity resumed after addition of chloramphenicol. Levels of TfR and ferritin are principally regulated through the binding of IRPs with IREs, and the binding activity of IRP-IRE is dependent on both the free reactive iron (labile iron pool) and the intracellular redox state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The labile iron pool regulates the binding of IRP-1/2 to IREs through distinct mechanisms. In the presence of high levels of iron, IRP-1 assembles in a cubane [4Fe-4S] cluster, inhibiting the IRE-binding activity, and converting IRP-1 to an aconitase. When cellular iron stress is low, IRP-1 binds to IRE targets as an apoprotein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. IRPs are also controlled by other effectors that include reactive oxygen species, which induce the disassembly of the Fe-S cluster of IRP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and nitric oxide and hypoxia, which affect both IRPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p> Serine phosphorylation is an iron-independent mechanism of IRP-1 regulation, which destabilizes the Fe-S cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The attenuated binding activity of IRP-1 leads to upregulation of FHC in Chlamydia-infected cells, in comparison to mock-infected cells, which is inhibited subsequent to DFX treatment. These results indicate that the level of intracellular free iron (Labile Iron Pool) is maintained at a critically functional state in chlamydia-infected cells; however, further study is required to establish this assumption. Iron restriction-induced chlamydial persistence is only achieved by DFX and not by exporter-dependent iron deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In a recent study, Nupur et al. have shown that <italic>Leishmania donovanii</italic> uses labile iron pool (LIP) as a dynamic source of iron inside the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These observations further extend the possible involvement of LIP as a source of iron for intracellular development of CT. Hence, this study showed that chlamydial infection has a modulatory effect on the activity of IRPs which leads to decreased TfR and increased FHC expressions thus limiting the intracellular availability of catalytic-free iron and finally reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, chlamydial infection may accelerate the recycling of TfR and transferrin to the surface, thus recharge the required iron in LIP by faster shuttling. Transiting iron in LIP may be sequestered in FHC as stored available iron for <italic>CT</italic> in HeLa infected cells. Thus, the current findings suggest that attenuation in the binding activity of IRP-1/IRE may be one of the mechanisms involved in modulation of iron homeostasis in <italic>CT</italic>-infected cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR, India) for financial assistance to H.
