Twist is necessary for the development of the mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], cell type determination and differentiation during myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], cardiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and also required for formation of the head mesenchyme, somites and limb buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Twist loses its function as a negative modulator during the differentiation of separate mesodermal layers, myogenesis, osteogenesis or neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Twist has also been implicated in neural tube closure and null mice mutants are embryonic lethal at E10.5, whereas TWIST is essential for normal development and promotes autosomal dominant defects characterized by minor skull and limb anomalies in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mutations in TWIST1 result in Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome (MIM #101400, SCS), known as an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, mutations in the helix domain of the <italic>TWIST1 </italic>gene can cause subcellular mislocalization and increased degradation of its protein product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Twist also acts as a key regulator of metastasis, and overexpression of TWIST1 in subsets of sporadic human breast cancer promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition through down-regulation of E-cadherin which was confirmed in a murine breast tumor model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Potential functions of TWIST1 are not well defined. Previous studies have shown that Twist functions as a transcriptional repressor and is regulated by its dimerization with other bHLH-containing transcriptional factors. For instance, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can alter the dimerization preferences of Twist, promoting either homodimer or heterodimer formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The Twist heterodimer can also act a transcription repressor, whereas Twist homodimer acts as a transcription activator in <italic>Drosophila </italic>mesoderm development and in human cranial suture patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In order for a protein to function as an activator and/or repressor of transcription of a target gene, efficient nuclear localization is essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Directed nuclear entry requires the presence of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that recognize and associate with the nuclear import receptors. Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) mediate active transport of protein into the nucleus selectively and efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, identification and functional characterization of TWIST NLSs would represent a necessary and important step in understanding the regulation of TWIST and its interaction with other bHLH proteins.</p><p>In this study, we identified two NLSs present at the N-terminal region of human TWIST rich in basic amino acids lysine and arginine. Using site directed mutagenesis and immunofluorescence assays, we studied the role of these two NLSs in nuclear localization. Yeast-two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays were also performed to identify TWIST-interacting proteins and gain a greater understanding of the mechanism responsible for H-TWIST localization and function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Comparison of various Twist proteins</title><p>H-TWIST contains 202 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A sequence comparison of human, mouse, rat, chicken, claw frog, zebra fish and fugu twist proteins based on homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], identified five highly conserved domains in twist proteins. Besides a novel NSEEE-domain (aa 19&#x02013;23), two potential NLSs, NLS1 and NLS2 found at the N-terminal region of the TWIST protein present at positions 37&#x02013;40 (RKRR) and 73&#x02013;77 (KRGKK), respectively with unknown function. These proteins share 80&#x02013;100% homology from different vertebrates, more specifically 93% identity in the bHLH regions, 100% in NLS1, 80% in NLS2, and 100% in NSEEE and WR domains. It is already well known that in H-TWIST, HLH region present on amino acid position 121&#x02013;160 is necessary for protein dimerization and the basic amino acid region present at the position 108&#x02013;120 is required for DNA binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Protein sequences comparison among vertebrate TWIST family members</bold>.

Transfection with pCMV alone was used as a negative control. No c-myc signals were detected with empty vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). As a positive control, we fused c-myc with &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-Gal).

A single 28-kDa protein band was recognized for c-myc-TWIST<sup>WT </sup>by an anti-c-myc antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). pCMV empty vector transfected in cells was used as a negative control along with c-myc-TWIST<sup>WT </sup>fusion construct in our first set of experiments. No signal was detected in cells transfected with the negative control plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p>Classical NLS motifs are composed of a basic amino acid stretch (K/R)4-6 preceded by a Gly, Pro, or an acidic amino acid residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The N terminal of M-TWIST which is an analogue of H-TWIST binds to p300/pCAF and decreases its histone acetyl-transferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Alignment of amino acid sequences encoded by the Twist gene from different species predicts two putative NLSs within H-TWIST at the N terminal with the most conserved segment containing lysine residues. Therefore, our hypothesis was that the lysine residues in the NLS motif might be essential in nuclear localization. Mutation in the NLS1 site strongly abrogated the nuclear localization of the fusion protein as the TWIST<sup>NLS1 </sup>mutant (K38R) was found to be no longer enriched in the nucleus but showed high expression in the cytoplasm of 93 out of 100 transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This provides experimental evidence that TWIST-NLS (37&#x02013;40 aa) is functionally significant for nuclear localization. Mutation in TWIST<sup>NLS2 </sup>at position K73R, and K77R also resulted in cytoplasmic expression (88% and 83%, respectively) as these transfected cells showed very low levels in the nucleus. In contrast, the subcellular localization of TWIST<sup>NLS2 </sup>K76R mutant was only observed in the nucleus, at levels consistent with the TWIST<sup>WT </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, 3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Mutational analysis of putative NLSs in H-TWIST were observed in U2-OS cells, the expression of c-myc-TWIST mutants were detected by fluorescence using anti c-myc antibody</bold>. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), and phalloidin (green) representing the actin cytoskeletal. Site-directed mutagenesis generated a single amino acid change, K38R, which was sufficient to block TWIST nuclear localization and, therefore, redistribute approximately 92% the mutant protein to the cytoplasm. Mutations in TWIST<sup>NLS2 </sup>at positions K73R and K77R also resulted in cytoplasmic expression, as approximately 83% and 87% of transfected cells had very low levels in the nucleus.

In these experiments, there were high levels of expression for the K38R and K73R mutants in the cytoplasmic lysate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), consistent with our microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We detected very low levels of the K76R mutant in the cytoplasm; a finding entirely consistent where the majority of staining is seen restricted to the nucleus. Interestingly, K77R showed expression in the cytoplasm, although our imaging results identified that it was not restricted to the nucleus. These results would indicate that this mutant that loses its nuclear targeting is either not soluble or expressed perhaps in intracellular organelles not solubilized by our protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Rescue of mislocalization of TWIST mutants by co-transfection with heterodimer partner E12</title><p>bHLH transcriptional factor proteins are able to form either a homodimer or heterodimer with other bHLH protein for DNA binding. Given this property, we selected E12, a bHLH protein which forms a heterodimer with other bHLH proteins and also has been shown to interact with Twist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Co-localization of TWIST with E12 protein was studied to determine the recovery of localization of TWIST NLS mutants in the nucleus. For this, E12 cDNA was subcloned into the eGFP-N1 vector in the same GFP reading frame and protein expression was examined in cells using fluorescence microscopy. In a control experiment, eGFP vector alone was transiently transfected into the cells and exhibited non-specific distribution of fluorescence protein throughout the cell (data not shown), while in contrast eGFP-E12 interaction was predominantly localized in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Rescue of mislocalization of TWIST mutant</bold>.

The same co-expression results were obtained using K73R and K77R with E12 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

An evolutionary alignment of Twist proteins amino acid sequences encoded from different species showed five different highly conserved regions NLS1, NLS2, NSEEE at N-terminal, WR at C-terminal and bHLH DNA binding domain. The HLH region is necessary and sufficient for protein dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Besides having two putative nuclear localization signals, the N-terminal of M-Twist which is an analogue of H-TWIST can also bind to p300/pCAF and decrease its histone acetyl-transferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, the C-terminus of Twist possesses a WR domain which is a RunX2-binding "Twist Box" and inhibit the RunX2 function during skeletal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><sec><title>Nuclear localization signals in TWIST</title><p>The regulation of protein transport into the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is mediated by specific nuclear localization signals (NLSs) recognized by protein import receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The NLS sequence consists of a cluster of basic residues, either monopartite or bipartite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This sequence is subsequently recognized by the heterodimeric import receptor complex comprising importin &#x003b1; and importin &#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Importin &#x003b1; is an adapter protein that consists of a small N-terminal &#x003b2;-binding domain. Importin &#x003b2; does not directly interact with the NLS cargo but acts to direct importin &#x003b1; to the nuclear pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of large molecules is normally mediated by classical NLSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and necessary for normal physiology and cellular trafficking. It might be that additional NLS sites exist in other domains of the proteins. Here, we show that N-terminal of H-TWIST contain 2 NLS motifs which are required for nuclear transport of this protein.</p><p>We mutated both of the predicted NLS lysine residues to determine their potential role in the importation of TWIST protein. The NLS1 mutant constructs were observed in the cytoplasm indicating that TWIST<sup>NLS1 </sup>is a functional NLS, which governs the nuclear import of TWIST. Previously, similar results were made for murine Dermo-1, a bHLH protein encoded by the <italic>TWIST2 </italic>gene, in which engineered replacement of the equivalent NLS (also containing the RKRR sequence) by four alanine residues impaired nuclear import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It is of particular interest that a novel mutation in the NLS1 of TWIST protein reported in SCS patients at C115G, resulting in an Arg39Gly mutation was not restricted to the nucleus, but found expressed in both nucleus and cytoplasm in COS-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These results are entirely consistent with our findings here, identifying this region as a core NLS motif.</p><p>We also examined the functional role of NLS2 by mutagenesis and found that NLS2 likewise NLS1, also played an essential role in the nuclear import of TWIST protein. Although in this study we focused on the lysine residues within the NLS1 and 2 motifs, it is also possible that other residues within these domains may also contribute to nuclear localization. From our findings, it is concluded that sequences at the 38, 73, and 77 amino acid positions within the NLS domains are critical residues. In contrast, the 76 amino acid does not appear to be critical for nuclear import.</p></sec><sec><title>Heterodimerization of TCF-4 with TWIST and co-localization in the mammalian cells</title><p>H-TWIST belongs to a class of bHLH protein known to form stable heterodimers with members of class a bHLH transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, Twist and MyoD interactions may prevent the specific activation of target genes for osteogenic differentiation, which has been proposed to result in the molecular pathogenesis of the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. E12 also known as TCF-3, a bHLH protein, has been reported to interact with H-TWIST and this heterodimerization could compensate the nucleus localization of TWIST having mutations in bHLH motif in a co-transfected Cos7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We utilized a similar approach in the case of mutated TWIST-NLSs to confirm the expected nuclear location of the wild-type TWIST protein and the TWIST-NLS mutants with E12 and reported that E12 interaction with TWIST compensates the non-functional NLSs.</p><p>In yeast-two-hybrid screening, we identified several novel proteins interacting with TWIST including a gene encoding the class I bHLH protein TCF-4 (transcription factor 4, also known as ITF-2; and SEF-2). The <italic>TCF-4 </italic>gene is conserved in many species, its expression found in adult heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, lung where TWIST is also highly expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. TCF4 is a bHLH transcription factor and contains two alternatively spliced forms of mouse TCF4 (ITF-2), termed ITF-2A and ITF-2B, that differentially regulate MyoD activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. An alignment of the N-terminal 83 amino acids with the N-termini of full-length E12 and full-length E47 and ITF-2B revealed that this domain is 51% identical among the three E type proteins and HLH domain was also highly conserved in all three proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The high expression levels of TCF4 in the brain suggests that it may regulate the activity of some neuron and neuro-endocrinology specific promoters, including the tyrosine hydroxylase enhancer and the somatostatin receptor II promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we confirmed the heterodimerization of TCF-4 with TWIST in NLS rescue assays and <italic>in vitro </italic>binding assay. Since the NLS mutant TWIST is unable to localize to the nucleus, this study illustrates that TWIST can form a functional complex together with overexpressed TCF-4, similar to that observed with E12, and that these interactions can restore nuclear localization despite the mutation in NLSs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It has already been reported that protein transcription factors may possess more than one NLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; presumably a multitude of NLS may increase the rate of protein factor-transporter protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Our study demonstrates the presence of two putative NLS motifs in H-TWIST and suggests that these NLS sequences are functional. These two NLSs may also operate in a cooperative manner for more efficient nuclear translocation. We also conclude that the mislocalization of NLS mutated construct could be restored with other bHLH proteins through heterodimerization with H-TWIST.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids construction</title><p>TWIST open reading frame (ORF) was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA using oligonucleotides CGCGGATCCGCGATGATGCAGGACGTGTCC and CCGGAATTCCGGCTAGTGGGACGCGGACAT, containing <italic>BamHI </italic>and <italic>EcoRI </italic>sites respectively.
