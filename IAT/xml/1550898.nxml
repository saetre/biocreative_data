Synthesis of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; in the myocardium is thought to play a central role in its pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Indeed, there is a large body of evidence that, in experimental models, over-expression of TNF-&#x003b1; in the myocardium is related to adverse cardiac effects such as postinfarct remodelling and ventricular dilatation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], transition from hypertrophic to dilated cardiomyopathy due to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and impaired postischaemic functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Additionally, local administration of soluble TNF-&#x003b1; receptor-1 gene reduced infarct size in a model of ischaemia/reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In a study conducted in a neonatal model of ischaemia of the hypertrophied left ventricle, inhibition of the biological activity of TNF-&#x003b1; significantly improved postischaemic contractile function, myocardial energetics and intracellular calcium handing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In humans there is a clear relationship between TNF-&#x003b1; expression in the myocardium and the severity of dilated cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) family of nuclear transcription factors is critical for the synthesis of TNF-&#x003b1; and for TNF-&#x003b1; induced secondary mediators of inflammation, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Inflammatory stimuli lead to activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by inducing the phosphorylation of its inhibitory protein I&#x003ba;B, allowing its translocation into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Activating protein (AP)-1 is another major transcription factor for many inflammatory mediators, including TNF-&#x003b1;. It comprises a family of related transcription factors, consisting of heterodimers and homodimers of Jun, Fos and activating transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. AP-1 activity is regulated through interactions with extracellular and intracellular signals including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), with phosphorylation of activating transcription factor-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which leads to expression of TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Upon activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 by inflammatory stimuli, expression of inflammatory genes such as that encoding TNF-&#x003b1; and of proinflammatory enzymes such as iNOS and COX-2 takes place. In the myocardium, activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, p38 MAPK and AP-1 causes myocardial cell damage resulting from TNF-&#x003b1; production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and it contributes to perfusion maldistribution and to myocardial damage by nitric oxide and eicosanoids, caused by the activity of iNOS and COX-2, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Our previous experimental studies showed that moderate hypothermia during cardiac surgery involving CPB is related to repression of TNF-&#x003b1;, and that this is related to increased synthesis of interleukin-10 in myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study we investigated the signalling pathways involved in this repression and found that the use of moderate hypothermia is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/AP-1 pathway but not with inhibition of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The study was approved by the supervising state agency for animal experiments. Twelve stress-resistant female pigs (deutsche Landrasse) weighing 40.3 &#x000b1; 1.4 kg (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) were included. The animals were housed in the institute for animal experimentation located in our university hospital for at least 8 days before experiments were begun; this was to guarantee quiet care before scheduled cardiac surgery. After clinical veterinary examination was conducted, which confirmed that the animals were in good health, the pigs were randomly assigned to a temperature group during CPB (six pigs in each group): moderate hypothermia (28&#x000b0;C) and normothermia (37&#x000b0;C). Core temperature was monitored using an oesophageal probe (probe 1651; Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corp., Helsinki, Finland).</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>General anaesthesia, and operative and CPB technique were as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Briefly, following sternotomy, cephotiam (50 mg/kg intravenously) and heparin were administered, and both caval veins, the aorta and the left atrium were cannulated and total CPB instituted for 120 minutes in all animals. This included 30 minutes perfusion during which animals subjected to moderate hypothermia during the operation were cooled down to 28&#x000b0;C; 60 minutes of perfusion during which the aorta was cross-clamped and right atriotomy performed; and 30 minutes of perfusion during which pigs undergoing hypothermic CPB were rewarmed to 37&#x000b0;C. In animals subjected to normothermia during the operation, perfusion was performed at 37&#x000b0;C for the 120 minutes. CPB was conducted with a flow index of 2.7 l/(minute. m<sup>2 </sup>body surface area) in all animals, with a target mean systemic arterial pressure of 60 mmHg. Immediately after aortic cross-clamping, cardioplegia was achieved by a single injection of cold (4&#x000b0;C) cardioplegic solution (Bretschneider solution; 30 ml/kg) into the aortic root. Additional topical cooling of the myocardium was performed by application of 500 ml cold (4&#x000b0;C) saline solution. Myocardial temperature during CPB was monitored using a needle probe placed into the ventricular septum (Temperature Sensing Catheter; Medtronic Hemotec. Inc, Englewood, CO, USA). At the end of CPB, anticoagulation was reversed with protamine, mediastinal drains were placed and the chest was closed.</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative care</title><p>The lungs of the pigs were mechanically ventilated until the end of the experiment. Postoperative monitoring included continuous registration of heart rate and rhythm, mean arterial blood pressure, left atrial pressure, oesophageal temperature and urine output, and measurement of arterial lactate levels and blood gases. Animals received dopamine and Ringer's lactate to optimize hemodynamics. Six hours after sternal closure the pigs were killed by phenobarbital overdose.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue sampling</title><p>Samples for RT-PCR, Western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were rapidly excised from the apex of the right ventricle before CPB, before aortic cross-clamping, before opening the aorta and immediately after death. Samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using Rneasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Hilden, Germany). RNA (3 &#x003bc;g) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers. Using specific porcine primers for TNF-&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;-actin, cDNA products were coamplified by PCR as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.8% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. The predicted lengths of amplification products for TNF-&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;-actin were 372 and 233 base pairs, respectively.

In the present study we found that the anti-inflammatory effects of moderate hypothermia with repression of TNF-&#x003b1; and of its secondary mediator COX-2 are present as early as 30 minutes after initiation of CPB. This observation is supported by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], who reported repression of TNF-&#x003b1; by hypothermia during ischaemia and early reperfusion periods in the liver.</p><p>The main aim of this work was to identify the upstream mechanisms that regulate the expression of TNF-&#x003b1; and COX-2, levels of which appear to be reduced by hypothermia. We therefore investigated both of the main signalling pathways involved in the expression of inflammatory mediators, namely the NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] pathways, and observed a differential effect of hypothermia on those transcription factors. Indeed, although in our series hypothermia led to reductions in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and AP-1 activation, it did not affect activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in the myocardium. This confirms our previous work showing that hypothermia does not inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B activation in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The inhibitory effect of hypothermia on p38 MAPK that we report here is supported by experimental work conducted in rat fibroblasts that showed inhibition of Raf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], a mitogen-stimulated protein kinase that is an important intermediate to p38 MAPK activation by cold stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Via inhibition of Raf, hypothermia suppresses the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK <italic>in vitro</italic>, thereby inhibiting phosphorylation of c-Jun and AP-1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Regulation of the activity of AP-1 occurs at two levels, depending on its concentrations and on the level of its phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the present study, there was no difference in levels of c-Jun in nuclear extract between the groups, but animals operated on in hypothermia exhibited lower phosphorylation of c-Jun and lower DNA binding activity of AP-1 during and after CPB than did those operated on in normothermia. Therefore, we suggest that hypothermia during CPB inhibits phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which in turn suppresses its nuclear targets, namely phosphorylation of c-Jun and activation of the transcription factor AP-1.</p><p>The clinical relevance of NF-&#x003ba;B and p38 MAPK/AP-1 activation in myocardium has been pointed out by several studies suggesting that both pathways are important actors in the failing heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B plays a central role in the myocardial inflammatory response, including TNF-&#x003b1; secretion by cardiomyocytes in response to systemic endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, NF-&#x003ba;B activation is also necessary for later preconditioning of the myocardium, and thus a potential role of this transcription factor for myocardial protection has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The important role played by p38 MAPK/AP-1 in the myocardial inflammatory response is widely recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Indeed, p38 MAPK activation is sufficient to induce inflammatory cytokine expression including TNF-&#x003b1; in cardiomyocytes <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] showed that the inhibition of p38 MAPK activities blocks TNF-&#x003b1; secretion in transgenic hearts. The congruency of the effect of moderate hypothermia on phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and activity of AP-1, and on expression of TNF-&#x003b1; suggests that, in our model, moderate hypothermia during CPB represses the expression of TNF-&#x003b1; in the myocardium by selective inhibition of the p38 MAPK/AP-1 pathway.</p><p>In a similar <italic>in vivo </italic>model, we previously showed that hypothermia during CPB confers myocardial protection by inhibiting intramyocardial expression of TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Cardiodepressive effects of TNF-&#x003b1; have been ascribed to immediate negative inotropic effects on cardiomyocytes mediated by sphyngosine, independent of NO, and to delayed NO-dependent negative inotropic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. High local concentrations of NO related to induction of iNOS are associated with myocardial cell damage and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the present study, hypothermia during CPB did not inhibit synthesis of iNOS in myocardium despite repression of TNF-&#x003b1;. That expression of iNOS in cultured cardiac myocytes does not increase in response to TNF-&#x003b1; and that TNF-&#x003b1; does not influence iNOS mRNA expression and NO release in the isolated rat heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] supports our observation. In addition, endotoxin-induced TNF-&#x003b1; depresses myocardial contractility of isolated rat hearts independent of NO synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>COX-2 is upregulated by various factors, including TNF-&#x003b1;, via the transcription factors NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The latter is the major promotor element involved in COX-2 expression in cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Significant expression of COX-2 has been demonstrated in the myocardium of patients with congestive heart failure and in rat heart after treatment with endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In our series expression of COX-2 paralleled the expression of TNF-&#x003b1; and activation of AP-1 during and after CPB, suggesting that COX-2 expression was mediated by TNF-&#x003b1; through AP-1. Myocardial depression in isolated rat hearts in response to staphylococcal &#x003b1;-toxin results from COX-2 derived thromboxane A<sub>2 </sub>liberation, leading to coronary vasconstriction and perfusion mismatch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In the present study, animals operated on under hypothermia did not differ from the other animals with respect to haemodynamics, but the fact that they had lower levels of lactate than did the pigs operated on under normothermia indicates that they had better tissue perfusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings suggest that myocardial repression of TNF-&#x003b1; and COX-2 related to moderate hypothermia during CPB is due to inhibition of the p38 MAPK/AP-1 pathway but not that of NF-&#x003ba;B.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; Hypothermia during cardiac surgery reduces myocardial inflammation</p><p>&#x02022; The anti-inflammatory effect of hypothermia relates to repression of TNF-&#x003b1; and COX-2</p><p>&#x02022; Hypothermia inhibits the p38/AP-1 pathway but not NF-&#x003ba;B</p><p>&#x02022; Mitigating the inflammatory response to cardiac surgery might improve postoperative outcome</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AP = activating protein; COX = cyclo-oxygenase; CPB = cardiopulmonary bypass; I&#x003ba;B = NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitory protein; iNOS = inducible nitric oxide synthase; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-&#x003ba;B = nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B; NO = nitric oxide; RT-PCR = reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; TNF = tumour necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>M-CS and MQ designed the study.
