Previous studies show that the initiation timing and elongation of chromosomal DNA replication are markedly impaired in Pol &#x003b5;-depleted <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg extracts, with reduced accumulation of replicative intermediates and products. This study shows that normal replication is restored by addition of Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme to Pol &#x003b5;-depleted extracts, but not by addition of polymerase-deficient forms of Pol &#x003b5;, including polymerase point or deletion mutants or incomplete enzyme complexes.

These are the first biochemical data to show the DNA polymerase activity of Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme is essential for chromosomal DNA replication in higher eukaryotes, unlike in yeasts.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Three structurally and functionally distinct DNA polymerases, known as DNA polymerases &#x003b1;, &#x003b4;, and &#x003b5; (Pol &#x003b1;,-&#x003b4;, and -&#x003b5;, respectively), are required for chromosomal DNA replication in yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The complex structure of each Pol &#x003b1;, -&#x003b4;, and -&#x003b5; is well conserved from yeast to human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], thus their function inside the cell is also believed to be conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>DNA primase initiates DNA replication by synthesizing a short oligo-ribonucleotide primer which is immediately elongated by Pol &#x003b1; to form short RNA-DNA fragments on both leading and lagging strand of DNA. Pol &#x003b4; elongates the short RNA-DNA fragment initiated by Pol &#x003b1;-primase to make a mature Okazaki fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To carry out processive DNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>, Pol &#x003b4; requires PCNA and its loader, Replication Factor-C (RF-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In cooperation with Fen1p (Rad27p), Dna2p and RPA, Pol &#x003b4; also plays a crucial role in processing RNA-linked Okazaki-fragments in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although the precise role of Pol &#x003b5; <italic>in vivo </italic>is still unclear, it has been implicated in DNA replication, repair, recombination, and mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Pol &#x003b5; has at least one essential function in both budding and fission yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and several lines of evidence suggest that Pol &#x003b5; plays an essential catalytic role during chromosomal DNA replication. Yeast cells harboring a temperature-sensitive <italic>pol2 </italic>allele are temperature sensitive for growth and express a thermolabile Pol &#x003b5; DNA polymerase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, Pol2p is associated with replication forks during S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and <italic>pol2 </italic>mutants fail to complete chromosomal DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, 3'&#x02013;5' exonuclease-deficient mutants of <italic>POL2 </italic>and <italic>POL3 </italic>(Pol &#x003b4;) accumulate strand-specific lesions in chromosomal DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These observations support models for chromosomal DNA replication in which Pol &#x003b5; and Pol &#x003b4; play leading strand- and lagging strand-specific roles during chromosomal DNA replication, respectively. Pol &#x003b5; has been proposed as the leading strand DNA polymerase because Pol &#x003b5; is a highly processive polymerase without PCNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and <italic>pol3 </italic>mutants have defects in maturation of Okazaki fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, it has been reported that the amino-terminal portion of budding yeast Pol &#x003b5; (Pol2p), which includes motifs required for DNA polymerase and exonuclease activities, is dispensable for DNA replication, DNA repair, and viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, this conclusion is controversial, because the polymerase active domain mutant (polymerase-dead-mutant) is lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and our studies showed that the deletion mutant confers temperature-sensitivity for growth, a defect in DNA elongation, premature senescence, and short telomeres. Furthermore, this pol2p deletion is lethal in combination with temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc2 </italic>and with exonuclease-deficient Pol &#x003b4; (<italic>pol3-01</italic>). These results suggest that Pol &#x003b5; plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In higher eukaryotes, the function of Pol &#x003b5; is much less clear than in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, although some reports showed that Pol &#x003b5; is required for cellular chromosomal DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In order to understand how Pol &#x003b5; involves in higher eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication, we have been characterizing DNA replication catalyzed by <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We have shown previously that both the initiation and elongation steps of chromosomal DNA replication are markedly impaired in Pol &#x003b5;-depleted <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg extracts, resulting in significant reduction of the overall DNA synthesis as well as accumulation of small replication intermediates. Moreover, despite the decreased DNA synthesis, excess amounts of Pol &#x003b1; are loaded onto the chromatin template in Pol &#x003b5;-depleted extracts, indicative of the failure of proper assembly of DNA synthesis machinery at the fork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although these experiments clearly demonstrate that Pol &#x003b5; is required for a normal chromosomal DNA replication in <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg extracts, they did not give any answer whether DNA polymerase activity of Pol &#x003b5; directly involves in chromosomal DNA replication process.</p><p>In the present report we show that the reconstituted and purified <italic>Xenopus </italic>Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme, which is proficient in DNA polymerase activity, fully complements DNA replication defect of Pol &#x003b5;-depleted <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg extracts, but neither DNA polymerase domain deleted Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme, DNA polymerase-dead-Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme, the catalytic subunit of Pol &#x003b5;, nor other subunits of Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme complements the defect at all. These results clearly prove that the DNA polymerase activity of Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme directly participates in chromosomal DNA replication in <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg extracts and that the products made by Pol &#x003b5;-depleted <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg extracts are not fully replicated DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of cDNA encoding each subunit of <italic>Xenopus </italic>Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme</title><p>A previous study reported cloning of a partial cDNA for the catalytic subunit (p260) of <italic>Xenopus </italic>Pol &#x003b5; (xPol &#x003b5;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and in this report, the corresponding full-length cDNA was cloned by 5' <underline>R</underline>apid <underline>a</underline>mplification of <underline>c</underline>DNA <underline>e</underline>nds (5' Race) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>). The fact that the full length cDNA encodes a 2285 amino acid residue protein whose predicted amino acid sequence is 81% identical to human p260 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and 62% identical to <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Pol2p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] within the polymerase domain (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>) confirms the identity of the cloned fulllength cDNA. Full length cDNA encoding p17 and p12 of xPol &#x003b5; were also cloned using 3' RACE, <italic>Xenopus </italic>ovary mRNA and partial cDNA clones 4783571(5') (GenBank ACC# <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BI349483">BI349483</ext-link>) and PBX0037B02(5') (GenBank ACC# <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AW635703">AW635703</ext-link>), respectively. The predicted amino acid sequences of p12 and p17 showed very high similarity to p12 and p17 of human Pol &#x003b5;, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>](see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 4</xref>), confirming the identity of the cloned cDNAs. cDNA encoding p60 of xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme was cloned previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; thus, with this report, full length cDNA clones have been isolated for all four subunits of xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>The C-terminal Zinc finger domain of p260 is required for binding p60 but not p12-p17</title><p>Deletion mutants of xPol &#x003b5; p260 were constructed and used to identify protein regions involved in the interfaces between p260 and the other subunits of Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme. For these experiments, p260 deletion mutants were fused to the FLAG epitope tag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and the following mutants were generated: (a) FLAG-p260full, (b) FLAG-p260&#x00394;C2157, (c) FLAG-p260&#x00394;C1054, (d) FLAG-p260D860N, and (e) FLAG-p260&#x00394;Cat (equivalent to yeast Pol2-16p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). The p260 mutants were co-expressed with xPol &#x003b5; p60, p12 and p17 using a baculovirus insect cell expression system and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> shows that anti-Flag antibodies co-immunoprecipitated p260, p60, p12, and p17 from crude extracts of insect cells expressing wild type p260, p60, p12, and p17. In contrast, in cells expressing p260&#x00394;C2157, p12 and p17 co-immunoprecipitated with the catalytic subunit but p60 did not, and in cells expressing p260&#x00394;C1054, no other subunits of Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme co-immunoprecipitated with the p260 mutant protein. These results suggest that p60, but not p12 or p17, interacts with p260 residues 2157 to 2285, which includes Zinc-finger motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), and that p12 and p17 interact with a motif or region between residues 1054 and 2157 of p260 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Both p260D860N (a DNA polymerase-dead-point mutant) and p260&#x00394;Cat did not interfere with formation of the xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme, because all four Pol &#x003b5; subunits co-immunoprecipitated from cells expressing these p260 mutants. In cells expressing histidine-tagged p60 (H-p60), p12, and p17, Ni<sup>2+ </sup>-chelating beads only precipitated H-p60, indicating that H-p60 does not interact directly with p12 or p17, or both subunits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), although it was known that both subunits interact each other and form a 1:1 complex in insect cells (data not shown) as <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Dpb3p-Dpb4p complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>p12, p17 and p60 of <italic>Xenopus </italic>Pol &#x003b5; interact with the C-terminal region of p260</bold>.

However, because the amino-terminal portion of Pol &#x003b5;, that is required for its DNA polymerase- and exonuclease activities, is dispensable for yeast DNA replication, repair, and viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], the role of Pol &#x003b5; during DNA replication has remained obscure. This study explores this role using an <italic>in vitro Xenopus </italic>DNA replication system and wild type and mutant forms of r-xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme. Here we show that the DNA replication defect in xPol &#x003b5;-depleted <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg extracts is readily corrected by native (n-xPol &#x003b5;) (data not shown and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]) or recombinant xPol &#x003b5; (r-xPol &#x003b5;) holoenzyme or the p260-p60 Pol &#x003b5; sub-complex, but not by p260&#x00394;Cat holoenzyme, p260 DN, p260 or p260-p12-p17 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Because the former enzymes are polymerase proficient, while p260&#x00394;Cat holoenzyme and p260 DN are polymerase-deficient, although these preparations contained a small amount of DNA polymerase activity, and the last two sub-complexes do not contain the second essential subunit of xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), these results clearly demonstrate that the DNA polymerase activity of Pol &#x003b5; holoenzyme is required for chromosomal DNA replication in <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg extracts.

However, these DNA synthesis activities never reach to the levels of either mock-depleted-, n-xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme-, or r-xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme-supplemented egg extracts even after long time incubation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]), thus we conclude that those residual activity of DNA synthesis upon addition of catalytically dead polymerases is not significant to the key issue of this paper.</p><p>We do not know why n-xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme preparations always exhibit higher specific activity of DNA polymerase than that of r-xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), although both polymerase holoenzymes equally complement the defect of the Pol &#x003b5;-depleted <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg extracts ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, we noticed that the reconstituted r-xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme is much more volatile than n-xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme during purification (Shikata K and Sugino A, unpublished results). Thus, it is possible that r-xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme purified from insect cells would not be fully activated yet and it might be activated during incubation with xPol &#x003b5;-depleted egg extracts by unknown mechanism(s) and function in the egg extracts as does n-xPol &#x003b5; holoenzyme.</p><p>The previous studies showed that a yeast strain consisting of a deletion of the amino-terminal portion of Pol2p (<italic>pol2-16</italic>) is temperature-sensitive for its growth, has a defect in elongation of DNA replication, has a short cell senescence, has a shorting telomere length, and is synthetic lethal with temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc2 </italic>(<italic>pol &#x003b4;</italic>) mutations and with the 3'-5' exonuclease minus Pol &#x003b4; mutant <italic>pol3-01</italic>, suggesting that Pol &#x003b5; is required primarily for maintenance of genome integrity and that the DNA polymerase activity of Pol &#x003b5; might be substituted by the remaining polymerase(s), if the polymerase domains are completely missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].
