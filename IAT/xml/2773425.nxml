This study aimed to evaluate the association between TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 and coronary artery disease in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>two populations were studied in order to assess severity of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular events incidence. Eight-hundred and eighty nine subjects who were referred for cardiac catheterization for coronary artery disease diagnosis were cross-sectionally evaluated for coronary lesions (atherosclerotic burden) and 559 subjects from the MASS-II Trial were prospectively followed-up for 5 years and assessed for major cardiovascular events incidence. As expected, rs7903146 T allele was associated with diabetes. Although diabetic patients had a higher prevalence of coronary lesions, no association between TCF7L2 genotype and coronary lesions was found in this subgroup. However, non-diabetic individuals carrying the T allele were associated with a significantly higher frequency of coronary lesions than non-diabetic non-carriers of the risk allele (adjusted OR &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.32 95&#x00025;CI 1.27&#x02013;4.24, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.006). Moreover, presence of multi-vessel coronary artery disease was also associated with the CT or TT genotypes in non-diabetics. Similarly, from the prospective sample analysis, non-diabetics carrying the CT/TT genotypes had significantly more composite cardiovascular end-points events than CC carriers (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.049), mainly due to an increased incidence of death (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.004).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>rs7903146 T allele is associated with diabetes and, in non-diabetic individuals, with a higher prevalence and severity of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular events. name of registry site (see list below), registration number, trial registration URL in brackets.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration Information</title><p>Medicine, Angioplasty, or Surgery Study (MASS II): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlledtrials.com."/>Unique identifier: ISRCTN66068876.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common disease present in about 200 million of individuals worldwide and its prevalence has been increasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-IDF1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Patients with previous cardiac events and/or previous diagnostic or therapeutic coronary catheterization, acute ischemic events, heart failure class III&#x02013;IV, hepatic dysfunction, familiar hypercholesterolemia, previous heart or kidney transplantation, and in anti-retroviral treatment were excluded from the study.

The coronary lesions were evaluated by an expert team by analyzing angiogram images, based on standard protocols. Patients answered a clinical questionnaire that covered questions regarding their personal medical history, family history of CAD, sedentary behavior, smoking status, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and current medical treatment. During the interview, anthropometric measures were collected (weight and height), and a blood sample during cardiac catheterization for genomic DNA extraction was obtained.

Briefly, 2,076 candidates who were indicated for myocardial revascularization were evaluated from May, 1995 to May, 2000. Of these, 611 patients were eligible and met all entry criteria to be randomly assigned to one of the three therapeutic groups. The inclusion criteria were symptomatic multivessel coronary disease, preserved left ventricular function, and the presence of coronary lesions (70&#x00025; of stenosis) amenable to angioplasty. Then patients were followed-up for five years and were assessed for cardiovascular events such as mortality, myocardial infarction, angioplasty, myocardial revascularization surgery and the combination of them. All patients from the MASS-II study were repeatedly evaluated in a single-center (Heart Institute, Brazil) by the same medical team for the five years of follow-up, according to a standard protocol.

Long-term survival comparisons were conducted for the entire study group and for the subgroups of diabetic and non-diabetic patients and TCF7L2 genotype. Logistic regression was used to estimate the cross-sectional association of these variables with each of the MASSII trial endpoints (death, myocardial infarction, and recurrent ischemia requiring revascularization), as well as the combined endpoint after the 5-year follow-up period. Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between the curves were evaluated with the log-rank statistic. We assessed the relationship between baseline variables and composite end points by using a Cox proportional hazards survival model. A value of p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant for comparisons.

Eight hundred and ninety six consecutive patients submitted for the first time only to coronary angiography to study a clinical suggestive diagnosis of coronary artery disease were selected. This study population had 52.4&#x00025; of male individuals, with a mean age of 59.5 years. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, obesity (BMI &#x0003e;30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), smoking, heart failure (HF) class I-II, peripheral artery disease (PAD) and chronic renal failure (CRF) was 73&#x00025;, 32.1&#x00025;, 28&#x00025;, 37.1&#x00025;, 1.8&#x00025;, 9.2&#x00025; and 2.7&#x00025;, respectively.

Decompounding the end points in non-diabetic individuals, we observed that the association between TCF7L2 genotype and cardiovascular events occurred mainly because an increased all-cause mortality incidence in individuals harboring the T allele (number of deaths: CT/TT &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;27 <italic>vs</italic> CC &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4, p value &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.004).

Interestingly, we were not able to demonstrate this association in diabetic patients.</p><p>It has been well established for many decades that diabetes increases the risk of CVD. About 65&#x00025; of deaths in individuals with type 2 diabetes are related to heart disease or stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-Milicevic1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-Morrish1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. These data are concordant with the results of this study, in which diabetic individuals had a higher severity of CAD and cardiovascular events incidence than non-diabetics. Considering this information and since there were no associations between rs7903146 polymorphism and established CV risk factors, other than diabetes itself, we hypothesize that the association between TCF7L2 genotype and cardiovascular phenotypes occurs due to glycemic homeostasis changes. Nevertheless, given the scenario of established diabetes, coronary disease risk will be increased by itself, despite TCF7L2 genotype status.</p><p>Genetic variants in the gene encoding for TCF7L2 have been associated with type 2 diabetes and impaired cell function, but the mechanisms still remain unknown. The gene TCF7L2 is located on chromosome 10 and encodes the transcription factor4 (TCF-4) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 strongly predicts prevalent and future T2DM in several independent populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-Cauchi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The risk T allele was associated with impaired insulin secretion and incretin effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-Lyssenko1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, trending to postprandial hyperglycemia. Data from MONICA/KORA surveys revealed the T allele at rs7903146 as inversely associated with log-transformed HOMA-&#x00025;Beta (as a measure of basal insulin secretion), but no association was found with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Therefore, we hypothesize that even non-diabetic carriers of CT/TT genotypes have increased postprandial glycemia and consequently, higher CAD tendency, severity and cardiovascular events incidence.</p><p>Actually, a meta-analysis of published data from 20 studies with almost 100,000 subjects followed-up for 12.4 years confirmed a significant association between 2-hour glucose levels after an oral glucose overload and incident cardiovascular events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-Coutinho1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In this same study, there was a suggestive trend (p value equal to 0.056) between fasting glucose and cardiovascular events. These data support the hypothesis that even non-diabetic degrees of fasting and mainly postprandial hyperglycemia are associated with CVD. Therefore, if T allele is associated with postprandial hyperglycemia, we hypothesized T allele would be associated with cardiovascular events. Plasma glucose is a continuous risk factor for CVD, in both diabetic and non-diabetic people, the risk extending below impaired fasting and impaired glucose tolerance cutoffs. Indeed, some authors consider that dysglycemia should be added to the list of established continuous cardiovascular risk factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-Wajchenberg1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Most cardiovascular risk factors are affected directly by an acute increase of glycemia: increase in LDL oxidation and endothelial dysfunction (vasoconstriction and decreased vasodilating response), increased production of collagen from the mesangial cell, activation of blood coagulation, increase in blood pressure, increase in the circulating levels of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), increase in inflammation (production of plasma interleulin-6, interleukin-18 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; - TNF-&#x003b1;) and increase in oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-Wajchenberg1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-Ceriello1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Unfortunately, there was no information about glycated haemoglobin or postprandial glycemia in our study and we were not able to evaluate this correlation. Regarding fasting glycemia, there is no difference between genotypes in non-diabetic individuals, but we were not able to evaluate the effects of the studied genotype in longitudinal glucose-related variables. In addition, after adjustment for other established cardiovascular risk factors, including baseline fasting glycemia, genotypes CT and TT continued to be related to CAD severity and CV events, mainly death.</p><p>Moreover, some studies have observed that transcriptional activation of TCF-4 is related to the nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) signaling pathway, which regulates inflammatory signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-Wang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and this could be hypothesized as an additional pleiotropic mechanism operant in the <italic>milieu</italic> of the vascular wall.</p><p>It should be remembered that the diabetic subgroups from both populations have a smaller number of individuals and one can not exclude that this small number of individuals associated with the higher prevalence of coronary artery disease and incidence of cardiovascular events in this particular subgroup of individuals has led to reduced statistical power to detect the association we were able to describe on non-diabetic individuals. However, even a relatively small sample size of non-diabetic subjects was able to provide an adequate statistical power analysis, in part due to the relatively large effect size. Despite this, it is not possible to exclude completely the possibility of false positive results. Considering it is a genetic study of association, a limitation is the possibility of other non evaluated variable that, by acting as a confounder, could play a significant role in the findings. One should remember, however, that multiple potential confounder adjustments were made in the presented analysis. Finally, results in the same direction in two different and independent populations may actually be indicative of a true association.</p><p>Previous myocardial infarction was significantly more prevalent in genotypes CT and TT in non-diabetic individuals from the MASS-II population. However, this factor was not independently associated with CV events, like TCF7L2 genotype, smoking and aging. Therefore, the higher prevalence of a previous myocardial infarction at baseline does not completely explain such association. Actually, these data contribute to the idea that non-diabetic patients carriers of the rs7903146 allele T presents a higher CAD severity.</p><p>Bielinski <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007697-Bielinski1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> have recently published a study in which TCF7L2 SNPs rs7903146, rs12255372, rs7901695, rs11196205 and rs7895340 were assessed with a similar objective, using more than 13,000 subjects from the ARIC study population. In their report, they have not demonstrated a significant association between any TCF7L2 SNP with incident coronary disease, ischemic stroke, CVD, prevalent peripheral artery disease (PAD) or all-cause mortality in the full cohort nor when stratified by race or diabetic status. Although divergent results, there are large methodological differences between the two studies: in the ARIC study, all patients with prevalent coronary disease were excluded from analysis and, consequently, the patients were free of prevalent CVD at baseline. On the other hand, our study populations contain patients with suspected CAD (cross-sectional study population) or with established multi-vessel CAD plus stable angina (MASS-II cohort) at baseline and these differences in the <italic>a priori</italic> risk of coronary artery disease in these populations could explain the apparent conflicting results. Here as well, it should be acknowledged that the interpretations of the present study are derived from two different and independent cohorts of patients, straightening the conclusions of the present work.</p><p>In conclusion, these data demonstrate an association between coronary artery disease severity and rs7903146 polymorphism mainly in non-diabetic individuals with increased cardiovascular risk. In people with diabetes, we were not able to show this association. Additionally, it was found that non-diabetic allele T carriers also had higher cardiovascular event incidence, mainly due to death. Due to the limitations already discussed, more studies are necessary to confirm this association and to evaluate the intrinsic mechanisms underlining this process. If this association is confirmed, other studies will also be useful to establish the best strategy to use this information for the better risk stratification of individuals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the work of two anonymous reviewers for insightful suggestions during the review
