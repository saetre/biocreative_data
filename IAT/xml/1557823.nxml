Since Wnt-5a mRNA and protein levels differ within and between tumours, the potential of Wnt-5a as a prognostic factor has been debated. We have previously shown that the lack of Wnt-5a protein is a predictor of shorter disease-free survival in human breast cancer. Recently, however, we also showed that the breast tumours lacking Wnt-5a protein had a high or normal level of Wnt-5a mRNA that might explain the discrepancies in previous studies. We here report that Wnt-5a is regulated at the post-transcriptional level. The regulation was mediated by the Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision (ELAV)-like protein HuR, which inhibited translation of Wnt-5a when bound to highly conserved AU-rich sequences in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) of the Wnt-5a mRNA molecule, as shown by both HA-tagged Wnt-5a- and Luciferase-Wnt-5a-3&#x02032;-UTR reporter assays. The HuR-dependent inhibition of Wnt-5a was supported by the fact that active HuR is located in the cytoplasm in invasive human breast tumours and that hypoxia-induced activation of HuR inhibits translation of both Luciferase-Wnt-5a-3&#x02032;-UTR and endogenous Wnt-5a protein. We propose that the lack of Wnt-5a protein expression in invasive human breast tumours is caused by a HuR-mediated suppression of Wnt-5a mRNA translation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Wnt proteins influence multiple developmental processes and have also been implicated in carcinogenesis, including the development of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Depending on which signalling pathway the Wnt proteins activate, they are referred to as canonical (Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin) or non-canonical Wnt proteins [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>)]. Wnt-5a has been characterized as a non-canonical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and non-transforming Wnt protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) that is important for cellular adhesion, migration, planar cell polarity and convergent extension movements.</p><p>We have previously shown that expression of Wnt-5a is a predictor of longer disease-free survival in human breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Expression of Wnt-5a in mammary cells confers a more differentiated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), an increased adhesion and a decreased motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Recent evidence links both canonical (Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin) and non-canonical (Wnt/Ca2+) pathways to tumour invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). However, the importance for Wnt-5a signalling in metastatic processes is debated and conflicting results concerning the expression levels of Wnt-5a in different invasive tumours can be found in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). There are probably two reasons for this; first, an abnormal protein expression level of Wnt-5a can affect adhesion and metastasis both when being over-expressed (loosely attached cells; malignant melanoma) and repressed (firmly attached cells; breast cancer). Thus, loosely attached cells will display an increased capacity to migrate upon increased adhesion (Wnt-5a signalling) while firmly attached cells will increase their migration upon a decreased adhesion (lack of Wnt-5a signalling). Second, most early studies concerning the role of Wnt-5a in cancers have analysed the expression levels of Wnt-5a mRNA and not protein. In a recent study, we show that breast tumours lacking Wnt-5a protein expression have a high or normal level of Wnt-5a mRNA as judged by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). This means that studies concerning Wnt-5a expression can only be judged by protein analysis of Wnt-5a. It also indicates that Wnt-5a expression probably is regulated at the post-transcriptional level.</p><p>Post-transcriptional regulation can be achieved by different means and includes mRNA processing, nucleo-cytoplasmic export, mRNA localization, mRNA stabilization and translational regulation [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>)]. These processes are influenced by the conserved sequence elements located in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNA molecules and the specific mRNA binding proteins that can bind to and affect its properties [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>)]. Proteins bind to UTRs via specific RNA-recognition motifs (RRM) and the mRNA binding sites are usually located in the 3&#x02032; ends of mRNAs. The sites are most often AU-rich or U-rich sequences and the binding proteins are therefore referred to as AU-rich element binding proteins (ARE-binding proteins). ARE-binding proteins can stabilize (AUBF, Elav-like family) or destabilize (AUF1, TTP and KSRP) mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). One common cellular mechanism is thus to produce unstable mRNAs that can be stabilized upon binding of specific RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). This way, the output of mRNAs for a specific gene can be constant, but will yield high levels of protein only when the mRNAs are stabilized and subsequently translated. Another less well-described mechanism is to suppress translation (TIAR, TIA-1 and CUGBP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p><p>The Elav-like family of ARE-binding proteins include the proteins HuR, HuD, HuC and Hel-N1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). They are most well known as mRNA stabilizing proteins that bind AREs in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated regions (3&#x02032;-UTRs) of unstable mRNAs. They act as nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttle proteins that predominantly are expressed in the nucleus but shuttle out into the cytoplasm upon initiation of cell signalling [e.g. by p38 MAPK, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin and Notch signalling; reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>)] or under stress conditions, such as hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Recent studies reported that cytoplasmic localization of HuR is associated with a high tumour grade or invasiveness in ovarian and breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). These data are particularly interesting in relation to the observed shorter disease-free survival in breast cancer patients with reduced Wnt-5a protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). In this study we investigated why the protein- but not mRNA levels of the prognostic marker Wnt-5a, are decreased in invasive ductal breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Constructs</title><p>The cDNA3 vector was obtained from Invitrogen and the pGL3-Luciferase and cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#x02013;Renilla vectors from Promega.

For UV-crosslink immunoprecipitation experiments the probes were also labelled with Digoxigenin (Roche). All regents for cDNA production were purchased from Promega, except for <sup>32</sup>P-UTP (Amersham).

The cold probe was prepared using rUTP (Promega) instead of radiolabelled-UTP. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), and diluted in Munro's buffer (1:5). Each probe (50&#x02009;000 c.p.m.) was incubated with 18 &#x003bc;l of the extracts for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, RNAse T1 (1 U; Promega) and Heparin (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) was added for 5 min each, the samples were diluted in RNA native loading buffer [30 mM Tris&#x02013;Hcl (pH 7.5), 40% Sucrose and 0.2% BFB] and subjected to native PAGE gel (4%) electrophoresis. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography with intensifying screens at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. For cold competition, the cold probe was added in 10-fold excess for 10 min prior to addition of the radiolabelled probe. In the supershift experiments, the antibody was added after 15 min of incubation. UV-crosslinking was performed as described above and further subjected to UV-crosslinking in a Stratalinker (250 mJ/m<sup>2</sup>) and subsequently analysed using SDS&#x02013;PAGE (10%) analysis and normal Laemmli-DTT loading buffer.

To find possible important RNA&#x02013;protein-binding sites (AREs) we searched for evolutionarily conserved sequence elements in the 5&#x02032;-UTR and the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the Wnt-5a mRNA. The sequence corresponding to 143&#x02013;318 bp in the 5&#x02032;-UTR was conserved between dog, mouse, rat and human, but no AREs were found (data not shown). However, the 3&#x02032;-UTR contained sequences that were conserved between chinchilla, mouse, rat and human (shaded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and many of these harboured putative AREs of class III or class I according to the definition of AREs [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>].

Both the Wnt-5a (W in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and the Luciferase (L) gene were driven by the pCMV promoter and contained the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal [BGH poly(A)] in order to obtain a basic and unregulated level of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The different constructs were, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, controls devoid of the 3&#x02032;-UTR (W and L), 1&#x02013;66 bp of the 3&#x02032;-UTR (W1 and L1), 1&#x02013;183 bp with the most conserved ARE (W2 and L2) and finally 1&#x02013;258 bp (W3 and L3).</p><p>To analyse whether the AREs regulated Wnt-5a protein expression, we transfected HB2 cells with the different HA-Wnt-5a containing vectors and analysed the protein expression levels by western blot using an anti-HA antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> the protein levels of transfected Wnt-5a decreased with increasing length of the 3&#x02032;-UTR. The effect on protein expression was gene independent since the same results were obtained using the Luciferase expression plasmid series, cotransfected with a CMV-controlled Renilla expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The experiments were performed as several separate experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 12), using different preparations of the L-L3 cDNA, and the Renilla expression plasmid was always mixed in the stock solution that subsequently was used to dilute the Luciferase plasmids (L, L1, L2 and L3) to assure an equal basal Renilla expression level.</p><p>To investigate whether the conserved AREs in the 3&#x02032;-UTR were destabilizing motifs, a series of mRNA stability experiments with Actinomycin D were performed. The half-life of endogenous Wnt-5a upon Actinomycin D treatment was &#x0223c;3 h (data not shown). Importantly, the addition of the 3&#x02032;-UTR regulatory domains to the Luciferase gene did not affect the stability of the mRNAs as shown by similar transfection experiments described above, and subsequent northern blotting using Luciferase and Renilla specific probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Indeed, treatment with Actinomycin D for 3 h did not lead to a decreased amount of mRNA indicating that the regulatory domains in the first 1&#x02013;258 bp of the 3&#x02032;-UTR were neither mRNA destabilizing motifs, nor stabilizing motifs. Therefore the data suggested that the evolutionarily conserved elements could suppress translation of the Wnt-5a gene.</p></sec><sec><title>HuR is one important protein that binds the Wnt-5a 3&#x02032;-UTR AREs</title><p>To further characterize possible mRNA binding proteins that can bind the AREs in the Wnt-5a 3&#x02032;-UTR we performed a UV-crosslinking experiment with radiolabelled mRNAs corresponding to the coding region of Wnt-5a as control (ctrl) or the different 3&#x02032;-UTR fragments (1: 1&#x02013;66, 2: 1&#x02013;183, 3: 1&#x02013;258 bp) together with cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts of HB2 cells. The reactions were subjected to a 10% SDS&#x02013;PAGE and analysed by autoradiography. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (left), there were at least four different proteins binding to the mRNAs. One protein of 20 kDa bound within the first 1&#x02013;66 bp, one at 36 kDa within 66&#x02013;183 bp and two (98 kDa and 45 kDa) showed enhanced binding with increasing length of the 3&#x02032;-UTR. As a control, a UV-crosslink experiment using probe 3 alone (3 w/o prot), or a mutated probe 3 (&#x00394;3) together with nuclear lysates from HB2 cells, was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right). As can be seen, the mutated probe 3 showed a decreased binding to the proteins corresponding to 36 and 98 kDa whereas probe 3 alone (3 w/o prot) did not give rise to background bands. HuR has a molecular weight of 36 kDa and is known to bind AREs of all classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In fact, HuR is one ARE-binding protein that was previously reported to be affected in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>To determine the ability of HuR to bind to the Wnt-5a 3&#x02032;-UTR, REMSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>) were performed with the control probe (ctrl) or the different 3&#x02032;-UTR probes. When cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were analysed a band appeared with the 3&#x02032;-UTR probes 2 and 3 (1&#x02013;183 and 1&#x02013;258 bp). This correlated with the UV-crosslink data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To analyse whether this band contained HuR, we performed supershifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) with a HuR specific antibody together with probe 3 (1&#x02013;258 bp; left) or a control IgG (right). Addition of the HuR specific antibody led to the disappearance of the faster migrating band, with a shift seen as a darker shade at the slower migrating bands. A cold probe (C) corresponding to probe 3 (1&#x02013;258 bp) competed for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and probe 3 alone (3 w/o prot) did not give any background bands.</p><p>To assure that HuR indeed bound to the Wnt-5a 3&#x02032;-UTR we performed a UV-crosslink immunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast to immunoprecipitation with the specific anti-HuR antibody, the control IgG<sub>1</sub> neither pulled down HuR nor the digoxigenin labelled probe 3 (left).</p></sec><sec><title>HuR suppresses Wnt-5a translation <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>We next wanted to investigate a possible role for HuR regarding Wnt-5a translation <italic>in vivo</italic> and therefore transfected the human breast epithelial cell line, HB2, with an expression vector coding for wild-type (wt) HuR or a mutated HuR (M1), which is unable to bind mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), together with the different Luciferase-3&#x02032;-UTR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, the over-expressed wt HuR protein affected the L2 and L3 expression levels significantly as compared to the vectors that do not bind HuR (L and L1). In contrast, the mutated HuR plasmid M1, that cannot bind mRNAs, did not significantly affect any of the Luciferase-expression plasmids. Moreover, the Luciferase-3&#x02032;-UTR mRNA levels remained constant even in the presence of over-expressed HuR, irrespectively of Actinomycin D treatment as indicated by northern blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, this clearly suggests that HuR did not affect Wnt-5a mRNA stability when bound to the AREs of L2, but rather regulates the translation efficiency. The transcription rate of Luciferase <italic>in vitro</italic> was unaffected by addition of the 3&#x02032;-UTR elements with exception for the L2 construct (discussed in detail below), as measured by incorporated [<sup>32</sup>P]rUTP where the number of UTPs were corrected for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The translation efficiency was also measured in a cell free system using Rabbit reticulocyte lysates together with the Transcend&#x02122; non-radioactive translation detection system. The protein content of the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system is to our knowledge not fully known. However, one can expect that the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system differ from the cellular context regarding the function of various mRNA binding proteins. We therefore performed one set of experiments using rabbit reticulocyte lysate only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> upper panel) and one using HuR pre-programmed reticulocyte lysate (lower panel). We did not detect any significant difference regarding the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation efficiency between the Luciferase-3&#x02032;-UTR constructs when using only reticulocyte lysate (upper panel) whereas translation of L3 was significantly inhibited when adding HuR pre-programmed reticulocyte lysate (lower panel). The fact that the L2 construct showed an increased transcription rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and that the L2 construct was less reduced than L3 in the previous transfection experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), most likely explains why we did not see a reduced level of translated L2 in this set of experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Endogenous Wnt-5a protein levels in breast epithelial cell lines reflect Luc-3&#x02032;-UTR levels</title><p>To ensure that not only protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, upper panel) but also HuR localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) were comparable, we performed immunohistochemistry with the HuR specific antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, HuR was primarily detected in the nuclei, with some cytoplasmic detection in all three cell lines tested; the non-cancerous HB2 cell line and the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D. However, since these different human breast epithelial cell lines express varying protein levels of endogenous Wnt-5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lower panel), we wanted to analyse whether these expression levels reflected repression by HuR. Repression of the expression of transfected Luciferase-3&#x02032;-UTR reporters should in theory reflect the ability and degree to which HuR could repress endogenous Wnt-5a levels in the respective cell lines. Distinct from the variation in Wnt-5a protein expression between the cell lines, differences in expression are also evident following passaging and differ with the degree of confluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Therefore in order to accurately represent genuine change in degree of HuR-mediated repression between the cell lines tested, we ensured that cell lysates were consistently prepared from cells at similar stage of confluency. Transfection with the Luciferase-3&#x02032;-UTR constructs indicated that repression of the Wnt-5a 3&#x02032;-UTR reflected the endogenous levels of Wnt-5a expression in the respective cell lines. The construct carrying the potential HuR-binding site (L2) was most significantly affected indicating that increased repression of translation was evident where HuR had the ability to bind the 3&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). It is important to note that the modest differences obtained are probably explained by the difficulty in comparing totally different cell lines and the intrinsic variation of Wnt-5a, which we attempted to control for. Also, the fact that L3 is less affected than L1 in this experimental set up probably lies in the nature of the experiment as the two breast cancer cell lines used differ considerably in many aspects, including protein expression pattern. Nevertheless, taking these factors into account we can conclude that the reduction in the Luciferase expression seen in the experiment can be adequately explained by increased HuR-binding and may thus be indicative of the endogenous control of Wnt-5a translation.</p></sec><sec><title>Wnt-5a translation is further suppressed during hypoxia</title><p>Hypoxia occurs in solid tumours where circulation is compromised because of structurally disorganized blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). During hypoxia, active HuR has been shown to translocate to the cytoplasm and protein expression of HuR was increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). To investigate in detail the effect of HuR on Wnt-5a translation under hypoxic conditions, we transfected HB2 cells with the Luciferase-3&#x02032;-UTR constructs and placed one dish in a normoxic chamber and one in a hypoxic chamber for 24 h. Indeed, the translation efficiency of the constructs carrying HuR-binding sites were significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) suppressed under hypoxic as compared to normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), probably resembling the situation of increased HuR activity in invasive breast cancer as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). A discrete increase in HuR levels was detected in hypoxic cells just as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Finally, the endogenous Wnt-5a mRNA and protein levels were analysed after culturing HB2 cells for 24 h under hypoxic, as compared to normoxic, conditions. The Wnt-5a mRNA levels remained stable during hypoxia and did not decrease as judged by semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). If anything we observed a slight increase in endogenous Wnt-5a mRNA under hypoxic conditions. In the same samples, however, we found a consistent decrease in endogenous Wnt-5a protein expression under hypoxic conditions (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The same experiments were repeated in MCF-7 cells and similar results were obtained (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The importance of Wnt-5a signalling in metastasis has been a matter of debate since conflicting results concerning the expression levels of Wnt-5a in invasive tumours emerged in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). One of the major reasons for this is that most early studies concerning the role for Wnt-5a in cancer, examined Wnt-5a mRNA and not protein levels. We have previously shown that expression of the tumour suppressor, Wnt-5a, is lost or severely down-regulated in invasive human breast cancer, and hence is a predictor of longer disease-free survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The lack of expression was not caused by a transcriptional defect since high amounts of Wnt-5a mRNA was detected in otherwise protein negative tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>Wnt proteins have not generally been viewed as proteins that are regulated through a post-transcriptional mechanism. However, there are two reports concerning 3&#x02032;-UTR post-transcriptional regulation of non-mammalian Xwnt-8, Awnt-5A, Awnt-5B and Awnt-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). These studies indicate that the Wnts analysed are regulated by mRNA stabilization as well as mRNA localization. In the present study we present the novel finding that the human Wnt-5a mRNA contains evolutionarily conserved sequence elements (AREs) in its 3&#x02032;-UTR that are implicated in post-transcriptional regulation. Moreover, a recent global analysis of HuR regulated genes identified Wnt-5b as a potential target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Wnt-5a and Wnt-5b are almost identical in their coding region, but their 3&#x02032;-UTR are different. The 3&#x02032;-UTR of Wnt-5b is neither conserved, nor does it contain a repetitive AU-rich stretch, as in the 3&#x02032;-UTR of Wnt-5a. Here we show for the first time that Wnt-5a is regulated at the post-transcriptional level. The regulation is caused by a HuR-mediated suppression of translation. We further show that the low Wnt-5a protein expression level in breast tumours is not caused by HuR-mediated destabilization of the Wnt-5a mRNA. Rather, and in line with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), the mRNA levels in otherwise Wnt-5a protein negative breast cancers have a high or normal level of Wnt-5a mRNA.</p><p>Several RNA-binding proteins that are specific for AREs have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The Elav-like protein HuR has been previously reported to primarily stabilize mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). We show that four proteins bind to the most conserved sequence elements of the human Wnt-5a 3&#x02032;-UTR; 20, 36 (corresponding to HuR), 45 and 98 kDa. The data presented in this study strongly indicate that HuR binds to the 3&#x02032;-UTR of Wnt-5a and, importantly, it binds AREs to suppress translation. The fact that Hu proteins can bind mRNAs to affect translation has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>), although with distinct differences (i.e. increased translation or inhibition of IRES-dependent translation). An important similarity to our study however, is that the Hu proteins were also suggested to bind AREs of class III in these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Furthermore, our finding is supported by a recent study where HuR was reported as a negative translational regulator in mammalian cells acting in synergy with the translational repressor TIA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). TIA-1 and TIAR belong to the same family of proteins and are both translational repressors of &#x0223c;45 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). We believe that HuR is an essential protein for regulating translational suppression, most likely in cooperation with at least one more protein as has previously been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Invasive human breast cancers have high levels of HuR in the cytoplasm (HuR<sub>c</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Invasive human breast cancers also have low Wnt-5a expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Clinical support for the concept that HuR acts in synergy with at least one more protein comes from the finding that an increased level of HuR<sub>c</sub> in invasive breast cancer only corresponds to tumour grade, whereas loss of Wnt-5a expression correlates to survival.</p><p>It has been shown that HuR affects mRNA and translation primarily in the cytoplasm, as exemplified by the increased Cox-2 mRNA and protein expression levels found in HuR<sub>c</sub> positive breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). It is therefore possible that the decreased protein expression level of Wnt-5a in human invasive breast cancer also is a direct consequence of HuR expression and cellular distribution. Hypoxia that exists in many solid tumours, leads to an increased expression of HuR but also leads to translocation of active HuR to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). We have taken advantage of this finding to mimic the HuR phenotype in invasive breast cancers and consequently found a decreased Wnt-5a translation rate during hypoxic conditions as shown using both Luciferase reporter vectors and endogenous Wnt-5a protein. Whether hypoxia affects other RNA-binding proteins, in addition to HuR, is not known. Interestingly, TIAR has been reported to be upregulated in neurons after ischemic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>).</p><p>A growing number of genes that are affected by HuR, or related proteins, are reported. Many of them are genes associated with inflammation, but also with tumourigenesis and metastasis, such as c-myc, p53, VEGF, Cox-2, the cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and now Wnt-5a. Whether the altered activity of HuR is caused by differentiation, hypoxia, nutrient-starvation or by other unrelated factors in the primary tumours will need to be further investigated. However, the fact that the effects of one group of proteins can affect numerous target proteins is intriguing both in the aspect of inflammation and as shown here, also in that of cancer. Efforts should be made to understand these mechanisms better with the goal to design novel cancer therapies based on post-transcriptional regulatory proteins.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Drs A.
