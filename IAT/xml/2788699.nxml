Perhaps, activation of multiple redundant signaling pathways by higher concentrations of thrombin and/or other agonists might favor activation of PP1c&#x003b1; or PP1c&#x003b2; in the absence of PP1c&#x003b3; to sustain activation of platelets. More importantly, thrombus formation induced by light-dye injury was significantly delayed in the cremasteric venules of the PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008304-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Since PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> is not a platelet specific knockout, contribution of PP1c&#x003b3; from other cell types within the vasculature towards <italic>in vivo</italic> thrombosis cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, this <italic>in vivo</italic> study is consistent and correlates well with the <italic>in vitro</italic> platelet data. In contrast to the thrombosis model, normal hemostasis was not altered in PP1c&#x003b3; <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice as revealed by normal tail bleeding times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008304-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). It is not known whether the differential role played by PP1c&#x003b3; in hemostasis versus thrombosis models was due to the intrinsic differences in the type and extent of injury in the two models, or due to the compensatory mechanisms, which was sufficient to drive hemostasis but not thrombosis.</p><p>Previous studies have identified that outside-in integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> signaling mechanisms facilitated the dissociation of &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> bound PP1c, with the ability to dephosphorylate platelet myosin light chain (MLC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Vijayan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Following the engagement of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>, PP1c&#x003b3; was shown to be involved in the dephosphorylation of ADP-induced nPKC&#x003b7; activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Bynagari1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations imply that PP1c&#x003b3; might regulate platelet functions mediated by outside-in integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> signaling processes. However, outside-in integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> signaling dependent functions like adhesion and spreading (not shown) to immobilized fibrinogen and clot retraction were not altered in PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Since all PP1c isoforms can interact with &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> (unpublished observation), one possibility is that the PP1c&#x003b3; isoform does not participate in the functional responses initiated by outside-in integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> signaling. Indeed, platelet MLC is dephosphorylated by PP1c&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; (myosin phosphatase) but not PP1c&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Another possibility relates to an easy compensation by other PP1c isoforms following engagement of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> to alter platelet outside-in signaling functions. Finally, the platelet functional data from PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was not completely consistent with the studies in human platelets treated with Ser/Thr protein phosphatase inhibitors. The latter studies employed calyculin A and okadaic acid and observed inhibition of platelet aggregation and secretion to various agonists and adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Nishikawa1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Lerea1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. These differences may stem from the fact that the platelet phenotype obtained in response to the pharmacological agents might be due to inhibition of multiple phosphatases as opposed to inhibition of only PP1c&#x003b3; in this study.</p><p>Decreased platelet responses to thrombin observed in the PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was not due to altered expression of PAR3, PAR4, &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> or decreased platelet counts. In fact, we noticed a moderate but significant increase in platelet numbers in PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice &#x0005b;Mean&#x000b1;SEM 596.78&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>&#x000b1;17.94 in WT compared with 693.71&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>&#x000b1;19.87 in PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice; N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0003&#x0005d;. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the lack of PP1c&#x003b3; isoform could alter PAR4 activation associated proximal signaling events such as binding of GTP to the G proteins that couple to PAR4. Perhaps, multiple substrates of PP1c&#x003b3; may exist in the signaling pathways that control &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation downstream of thrombin signaling. Absence of PP1c&#x003b3; may alter the phosphorylation of one or more of these cellular proteins, thereby suppressing the platelet function. In fact, we noticed that the GSK3&#x003b2;-Ser9 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in thrombin stimulated PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008304-g006">Figures 6A and 6C</xref>). GSK3&#x003b2; is Ser/Thr kinase and phosphorylation of Ser9 residue inhibits its constitutively active kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Cross1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Although an initial study using a more generic and non selective GSK3 inhibitor implied a positive role for GSK3&#x003b2; in platelet function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Barry1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, a more recent comprehensive genetic analysis using GSK3&#x003b2; heterozygote mice revealed that GSK3&#x003b2; is a negative regulator of platelet function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Li4">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Results from the latter study indicated that thrombin stimulated GSK3&#x003b2; Ser 9 phosphorylation and removed the suppressive role of GSK3&#x003b2; on platelet function. Thus, a decreased GSK3&#x003b2;-Ser9 phosphorylation upon thrombin stimulation is predicted to maintain a constitutive GSK3&#x003b2; activity, thereby inhibiting the platelet function. Indeed, our studies revealed that the PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets stimulated with thrombin had decreased GSK3&#x003b2;-Ser9 phosphorylation along with decreased &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation, fibrinogen binding, aggregation and delayed thrombus formation. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; partially abolished the difference in fibrinogen binding between WT and PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008304-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). These observations suggest that additional mechanisms that underpin the decreased fibrinogen binding in thrombin-stimulated PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets exist and remain to be identified.</p><p>The molecular basis for the relationship between the loss of PP1c&#x003b3; and decreased GSK3&#x003b2;-Ser9 phosphorylation is currently unclear. PP1c&#x003b3; does not appear to directly dephosphorylate Ser9 on GSK3&#x003b2;, because GSK3&#x003b2;-Ser9 phosphorylation under basal conditions was not significantly increased in PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets. Although AKT has a major role in GSK3&#x003b2; Ser9 phosphorylation, PP1c&#x003b3; does not appear to regulate GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation via AKT, since we observed comparable level of AKT-Ser473 phosphorylation in thrombin stimulated WT and PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets. A potential for AKT independent regulation of GSK3&#x003b2;-Ser9 phosphorylation was also noted in the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Li4">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Since PKC, PKA or p90Rsk can also phosphorylate GSK3&#x003b2; at Ser(9) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Frame1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, it is likely that PP1c&#x003b3; could affect GSK3&#x003b2; Ser9 phosphorylation by regulating the activation of one or more of these Ser/Thr kinases. Alternatively, PP1c&#x003b3; may inhibit other Ser/Thr phosphatases such as PP2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008304-Sutherland1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, which may participate in dephosphorylating Ser9 on GSK3&#x003b2; under conditions of thrombin stimulation thereby ensuring increased GSK3&#x003b2;-Ser9 phosphorylation.</p><p>In summary, our studies indicate that under conditions of low thrombin stimulation, platelet PP1c&#x003b3; is required for GSK3&#x003b2;-Ser9 phosphorylation, &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation, soluble fibrinogen binding, platelet aggregation and stabilization of thrombus formation. The agonist specific role for PP1c&#x003b3; is intriguing and future studies will be needed to address how PP1c&#x003b3; couples specifically to signaling by PAR receptors and not to other G-protein coupled receptors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Susannah Varmuza (University of Toronto) for providing us with PP1c&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>
