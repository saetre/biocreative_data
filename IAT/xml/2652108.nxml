Actin filaments are depolymerized towards the rear of the lamellipodium in a treadmilling process, thereby supplementing a G-actin pool for a new round of polymerization. In this scenario the concentrations of F- and G-actin are principal parameters, but have hitherto not been directly determined. By comparing fluorescence intensities of bleached and unbleached regions of lamellipodia in B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells expressing EGFP-actin, before and after extraction with Triton X-100, we show that the ratio of F- to G-actin is 3.2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;0.9. Using electron microscopy to determine the F-actin content, this ratio translates into F- and G-actin concentrations in lamellipodia of approximately 500 &#x000b5;M and 150 &#x000b5;M, respectively. The excess of G-actin, at several orders of magnitude above the critical concentrations at filament ends indicates that the polymerization rate is not limited by diffusion and is tightly controlled by polymerization/depolymerization modulators.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells move by the extension of a leaf-like structure, the lamellipodium, at the cell front <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004810-Abercrombie1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Calculation of the concentration of F-actin requires a value for the thickness of the lamellipodium. Various methods have been used to estimate the thickness of lamellipodia, including thin section electron microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004810-Abercrombie1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, standing wave fluorescence microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004810-Abraham1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, stereo microscopy of negatively stained preparations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004810-Hoglund1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and atomic force microscopy, with values ranging from around 70&#x02013;180 nm. Plastic cross sections of B16 cell lamellipodia showed a constant thickness across their breadth that varied between 70 and 100 nm (not shown). Taking into account some shrinkage during embedding and other published estimates, we assume here a lamellipodia thickness in B16-F1 cells of 120 nm. Future measurements by cryo electron tomography will lead to a more accurate estimate of this value. Taking this thickness and a density of about 100 filaments/&#x000b5;m at the front of the lamellipodium the concentration of F-actin was estimated as roughly 500 &#x000b5;M (for the calculation see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Monomeric EGFP-actin recovers rapidly in bleached lamellipodia</title><p>To measure the G-actin component in lamellipodia we took advantage of the spatial features of recovery of EGFP-actin fluorescence after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004810-g001">Figure 1</xref>). During the early phase of recovery of F-actin fluorescence at the lamellipodium front, the rest of the bleached zone is populated by monomeric EGFP-actin. The fluorescence signal in this zone should reflect the G-actin concentration given that it recovers before incorporation of F-actin from the front. To estimate the rate of recovery of the EGFP-G-actin component in the body of the lamellipodium, we performed a double bleach experiment, in which bleaching of the lamellipodium was followed by selective bleaching at the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004810-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In this way we were able to determine the EGFP-actin signal in the lamellipodium in the absence of recovery of fluorescence at the tip. Within the limits of sensitivity of the double-headed confocal microscope system employed in this experimental setting, the EGFP fluorescence intensity in the lamellipodium was already recovered by the time of the first image acquisition after the initial photobleach (within 6 s; period indicated by dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004810-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The EGFP fluorescence intensity in the bleached zone in the early recovery after photobleach could then be taken as a concentration indicator. The competence of the expressed EGFP-actin to incorporate into filaments was tested by treating cells with jasplakinolide. At concentrations of 100 nM jasplakinolide EGFP-actin fluorescence became concentrated in a progressively distorted lamellipodium region, with a concomittent loss of fluorescence in the lamella zone (not shown), indicating that most, if not all of the expressed EGFP-actin was polymerisation competent.</p><fig id="pone-0004810-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004810.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Dual bleach experiments demonstrate that monomeric GFP-actin recovers in the lamellipodium within 6 s after photobleach and is incorporated into F-actin only at the tip.</title><p>A shows the overview before bleach.

The extraction conditions had then to satisfy two criteria to justify attribution of the loss of fluorescence to monomeric EGFP-actin: 1, F-actin should be mainly retained in the cytoskeleton; and 2, the change in conditions (pre- versus post-extraction) should not affect the fluorescence characteristics of EGFP (or the magnitude of the change should be known). Experiments showed that while the Triton/glutaraldehyde mixture used for electron microscopy satisfied the first criterion, the presence of glutaraldehyde caused a gradual quenching of the EGFP signal. Other extraction conditions were therefore investigated. By using polyethylene glycol in the extraction mixture (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) without glutaraldehyde, both conditions could be closely satisfied. First, the tip to rear gradient of EGFP-actin fluorescence in the unbleached regions of the lamellipodium could be preserved, indicating retention of the main component of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004810-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As an additional precaution we chose to use bleached regions of lamellipodia for our measurements since we could then avoid any errors due to possible losses of F-actin during extraction. Second, the fluorescence intensity of single microtubules in B16 cells transfected with EGFP-tubulin, measured by TIRF microscopy, before and after applying the extraction protocol, was essentially unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004810-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004810-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004810.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Selective extraction of G-actin after photobleaching.</title><p>A) Overview of a EGFP-actin expressing cell just before photobleach.

To reduce the influence of the soluble fraction of EGFP-tubulin on the intensity measurements, microtubules in the periphery and close to the substrate were chosen and imaged by TIRF microscopy.

Taking the fluorescence intensity at the unbleached lamellipodium tip before extraction as a measure of F-&#x0002b;G-actin, we obtained an average F- to G-actin ratio of 3.2&#x02236;1 (SDM&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.86, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11). The experimental values for the cells used for analysis are shown in supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004810.s003">table S1</xref>. With a concentration of F-actin from the filament counts of 490 &#x000b5;M (see above), this ratio translates a G-actin concentration of around 150 &#x000b5;M. Here we assumed that the G-actin concentration at the tip of the lamellipodium is similar to that a few &#x000b5;m (between 1 and 3 &#x000b5;m) behind, where the measurements in the bleached regions were made. This assumption was consistent with the more or less constant thickness of the lamellipodium (in EM cross sections, not shown) and the level drop of fluorescence intensity across the lamellipodium upon lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004810-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Our estimates indicate that the G-actin concentration in the lamellipodium is about 1500 times higher than the critical concentration required for elongation at the barbed end.

Triton X-100 was added from a 20&#x00025; stock to a final concentration of 1&#x00025; within 5 s after photobleaching. EGFP-actin was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA, USA).</p><p>The actin concentrations were calculated from the mean value of the actin filament number, 103 per &#x000b5;m, and the F&#x02236;G-actin ratio of 3.2&#x02236;1: Assuming continuous filaments, the total length of filaments in a 1&#x000d7;1 &#x000b5;m sheet is 103&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> nm. The volume in 1 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> of Lamellipodium with 120 nm thickness corresponds to 1.2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> &#x000b5;l. Taking 13 subunits per 38 nm of filament length, the number of actin molecules in a 1&#x000d7;1 &#x000b5;m sheet gives 35.24&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> molecules in 1.2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> &#x000b5;l. This makes 2.94&#x000d7;10<sup>20</sup> molecules per litre, corresponding to an F-actin concentration of 488 &#x000b5;M.</p><p>EGFP-&#x003b1;-tubulin (mouse) expressing cells were observed with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 equipped for TIRF microscopy (Zeiss/Visitron) and with a 100&#x000d7;1.45NA &#x003b1;Plan-FLUAR TIRF objective (Zeiss), solid state 488 nm laser, and a Cascade camera (Roper Scientific), and lysed as above including 1 &#x000b5;M Taxol to stabilize microtubules. Analysis was performed on a Windows PC with Metamorph Software.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004810.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Correlative light- and electron microscopy and immunogold labeling of EGFP-Abi1.
