One attractive model of how such conflicts are resolved is direct targeting of blocked forks by helicases with the ability to displace the blocking protein-DNA complex. We show that Rep and UvrD each promote movement of <italic>E. coli</italic> replisomes blocked by nucleoprotein complexes in&#x000a0;vitro, that such an activity is required to clear protein blocks (primarily transcription complexes) in&#x000a0;vivo, and that a polarity of translocation opposite that of the replicative helicase is critical for this activity. However, these two helicases are not equivalent. Rep but not UvrD interacts physically and functionally with the replicative helicase. In contrast, UvrD likely provides a general means of protein-DNA complex turnover during replication, repair, and recombination. Rep and UvrD therefore provide two contrasting solutions as to how organisms may promote replication of protein-bound DNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many barriers to replication fork progression exist within cells, all of which must be removed or bypassed for the completion of genome duplication. Failure to do so may lead to cell death, but blocked replisomes may also cause potentially catastrophic genome instability associated with cancer and many genetic disorders (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aguilera and G&#x000f3;mez-Gonz&#x000e1;lez, 2008</xref>). One class of potent blocks to replication are proteins bound to the template (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mirkin and Mirkin, 2007</xref>), with such collisions being numerous and unavoidable (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ivessa et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Complexes associated with transcription present a particular problem, with direct collisions between replisomes and transcribing RNA polymerases (RNAPs) causing fork pausing in bacteria and eukaryotes (<xref rid="bib2 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Azvolinsky et&#x000a0;al., 2009; French, 1992</xref>). The importance of resolving these conflicts is supported by the ability of mutations within RNAP to suppress DNA repair defects in <italic>E. coli</italic> strains lacking the Holliday junction resolvase RuvABC (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">McGlynn and Lloyd, 2000</xref>). Suppression by these <italic>rpo<sup>&#x02217;</sup></italic> mutations occurs by direct destabilization of RNAP elongation complexes, suggesting that RNAPs may be potent replicative blocks (<xref rid="bib46 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Trautinger et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Trautinger and Lloyd, 2002</xref>). The multiple mechanisms employed in all organisms to restart or displace stalled transcription complexes underline the importance of resolving such conflicts (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rudolph et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Recombination enzymes play important roles in processing of blocked replication forks. RecA is required for processing of forks blocked by UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in <italic>E. coli</italic> via a mechanism that requires the RecA loading factors RecFOR, RecJ exonuclease, and RecQ helicase (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Courcelle et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Induction of a nucleoprotein replication fork barrier, <italic>RTS1</italic>, in <italic>S.&#x000a0;pombe</italic> also creates a requirement for recombination to maintain cell viability, suggesting that recombination-dependent processing of blocked forks is a general feature of genome duplication (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). However, recombination provoked by&#x000a0;<italic>RTS1</italic>-dependent replication blockage causes gross chromosomal rearrangements (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Hyperrecombination near Tus-<italic>ter</italic> and <italic>lac</italic> repressor-operator complexes in <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic> also indicates that genome instability is a general feature of recombination-dependent processing of blocked replisomes (<xref rid="bib28 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Louarn et&#x000a0;al., 1991; Vilette et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, helicases could displace nucleoprotein complexes ahead of replisomes and so facilitate fork movement without the involvement of recombination, a possibility consistent with the displacement of proteins bound to DNA by many helicases and translocases (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Yancey-Wrona and Matson, 1992</xref>). Bacteriophage T4 Dda helicase promotes movement of T4 replisomes along DNA bound by RNAPs in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bedinger et&#x000a0;al., 1983</xref>), but Dda destabilizes transcription complexes independently of DNA replication (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). Thus, Dda may target transcription complexes rather than replication forks. However, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells lacking Rrm3p helicase have elevated pausing and breakage of replication forks at sites corresponding to nonhistone protein-DNA complexes, implicating Rrm3p as an accessory replicative helicase (<xref rid="bib2 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Azvolinsky et&#x000a0;al., 2009; Ivessa et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic> Rep and UvrD are helicases that translocate from 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032;&#x000a0;along ssDNA (<xref rid="bib32 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Matson, 1986; Yarranton and Gefter, 1979</xref>). Although cells bearing single mutations in <italic>rep</italic> and <italic>uvrD</italic> are viable, <italic>rep uvrD</italic> cells are not (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Taucher-Scholtz et&#x000a0;al., 1983</xref>), while in cells lacking Rep, forks translocate at half the speed of those in wild-type (WT) cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lane and Denhardt, 1975</xref>). However, slower movement of forks in <italic>rep</italic> cells could reflect the function of Rep along with PriC in the reassembly of replisomes away from <italic>oriC</italic> (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Heller and Marians, 2005</xref>), although lack of Rep-dependent replisome reloading is not responsible for <italic>rep uvrD</italic> lethality (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lestini and Michel, 2008</xref>). UvrD, unlike Rep, also has the ability to disassemble RecA nucleoprotein filaments in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Veaute et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), as do <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Srs2 and human RTEL orthologs (<xref rid="bib3 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Barber et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Krejci et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). UvrD also counters toxic effects of RecQ-dependent recombination intermediates in&#x000a0;vivo (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Magner et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), while <italic>rep uvrD</italic> lethality can be suppressed by mutations in <italic>recF</italic>, <italic>O</italic>, <italic>R</italic>, <italic>Q</italic>, and <italic>J</italic> (<xref rid="bib26 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lestini and Michel, 2008; Petit and Ehrlich, 2002</xref>). UvrD might therefore function to inhibit formation of recombination intermediates at blocked forks (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Magner et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that Rep and UvrD promote movement of replisomes along protein-bound DNA regardless of the identity of the blocking nucleoprotein complex, that transcription complexes present the most significant of such blocks in&#x000a0;vivo, and that accessory helicase function must be directed to the template strand opposite to that bound by the primary replicative helicase. Moreover, physical and functional interaction of Rep but not UvrD with the replicative helicase indicates that Rep is a component of the replisome. We conclude that Rep provides a fork-specific motor to facilitate replication of protein-bound template, whereas UvrD, highly abundant in&#x000a0;vivo, provides&#x000a0;a generalized motor for nucleoprotein complex turnover. Rep and UvrD therefore illustrate two solutions to the direct promotion of replisome movement along protein-bound DNA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Rep and UvrD Promote Replication of Protein-Bound DNA In Vitro</title><p>To search for helicases that might promote fork movement through protein-DNA complexes, we analyzed movement of reconstituted <italic>E. coli</italic> replisomes along template DNA bound by a model protein-DNA replication block. EcoRI E111G binds to its recognition sequence but has greatly reduced cleavage activity (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">King et&#x000a0;al., 1989</xref>) (see also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Replication of plasmids bearing <italic>oriC</italic> and two or eight EcoRI sites was initiated by addition of DnaA and replisome components followed by cleavage with EagI. Cleavage enabled passage of a single fork through the EcoRI sites to be monitored, since fork progression in the absence of a topoisomerase could occur only after relief of replication-induced positive supercoiling by restriction enzyme cleavage (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Marians et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>Ab and 1Ac). In the absence of E111G, replication generated lagging strands of approximately 0.5 kb and leading strands of 4.7 and 1.3 kb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1D, lane 1). Upon addition of E111G, there was a decrease in the amount of the 4.7 kb leading strand, together with the appearance of a 3.2 kb product with a greater inhibitory effect observed for eight as opposed to two EcoRI sites (compare lanes 1 and 2 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1D; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). This 3.2 kb product was the size expected if clockwise-moving forks stopped at the E111G complexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>Ad). Generation of this 3.2 kb leading strand also required EcoRI sites within the template DNA in addition to E111G, while levels of this truncated leading strand were dependent on E111G concentration (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). EcoRI E111G bound to its cognate DNA-binding site therefore provided a barrier to replisome movement.</p><p>The template bearing eight EcoRI sites was employed to provide an easily detectable signal for screening of <italic>E. coli</italic> enzymes that could relieve replisome inhibition. Helicases/translocases were chosen that have been implicated in processing of blocked forks or in displacement of proteins ahead of forks. Addition of Rep or UvrD after replisomes had become blocked resulted in increased levels of the 4.7 kb product, whereas RecG, PriA, and TRCF had no effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1C). The same pattern was observed on the template bearing two rather than eight EcoRI sites, with eight out of ten blocked forks being able to complete replication of the template when Rep or UvrD were present (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D&#x02013;1F). In contrast, RecG, PriA, and TRCF were not able to promote fork movement through this reduced nucleoprotein replicative barrier (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E). The relative increases in levels of the 4.7 kb product with Rep and UvrD were greater with two rather than eight EcoRI sites (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1E), demonstrating that the ability of Rep and UvrD to relieve inhibition of replication was dependent on the number of E111G-DNA complexes.</p><p>Thus, Rep and UvrD promoted fork movement through E111G-DNA complexes, whereas RecG, PriA, and TRCF did not. Rep and UvrD both translocate 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; along ssDNA rather than dsDNA (<xref rid="bib32 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Matson, 1986; Yarranton and Gefter, 1979</xref>), implying that fork movement was not promoted by translocation of Rep or UvrD along dsDNA ahead of the fork. Indeed, neither Rep nor UvrD displaced E111G from linearized, unreplicated DNA, as judged by their inability to relieve E111G-dependent inhibition of DNA cleavage by a catalytically competent EcoRI (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). Promotion of replisome movement along protein-bound DNA by Rep and UvrD therefore did not occur by indirect action along dsDNA remote from the fork. We conclude that the replication fork itself was required to provide ssDNA for Rep/UvrD binding and subsequent translocation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title><italic>rep uvrD</italic> Lethality Is Dependent on Growth Conditions</title><p>We analyzed whether <italic>rep uvrD</italic> lethality (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Taucher-Scholtz et&#x000a0;al., 1983</xref>) was linked to promotion of replication through nucleoprotein complexes by Rep and UvrD. The basis of this lethality was probed using a plasmid loss assay employing a very low-copy, highly unstable plasmid bearing <italic>lacIZYA</italic> (pRC7), whose retention or loss in the absence of antibiotic selection can be monitored by blue/white colony color in strains harboring chromosomal &#x00394;<italic>lacIZYA</italic> (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bernhardt and de Boer, 2004</xref>).

When plasmidless segregants of &#x00394;<italic>rep</italic> &#x00394;<italic>uvrD</italic> obtained on minimal agar were cultured in liquid minimal medium and then plated onto Luria-Bertani medium (LB), there was a large decrease in colony-forming ability as compared with &#x00394;<italic>rep</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>uvrD</italic> strains, a viability defect not seen when the same liquid minimal medium cultures were plated onto minimal agar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and 2D, compare N6577, N6632, and N7120). The original plasmidless colonies obtained upon plating <italic>uvrD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>/&#x00394;<italic>rep</italic> &#x00394;<italic>uvrD</italic> onto minimal agar did not, therefore, contain suppressor mutations that alleviated &#x00394;<italic>rep</italic> &#x00394;<italic>uvrD</italic> inviability.

Nine independent suppressors of &#x00394;<italic>rep</italic> &#x00394;<italic>uvrD</italic> rich medium lethality were isolated using this approach.

Thus, promotion of fork movement by Rep and UvrD occurred via targeting of blocked forks directly. Indeed, replication forks are the only plausible means of providing ssDNA for Rep/UvrD binding and subsequent translocation. The 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; polarity of Rep and UvrD and the critical contacts made with at least five nucleotides of ssDNA (<xref rid="bib21 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Korolev et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Lee and Yang, 2006</xref>) imply that direct targeting of forks requires a minimum of five nucleotides exposed on the leading strand template at the fork, ahead of the leading strand polymerase.</p><p>Polarity of helicase translocation also appears critical in promotion of fork movement.

Such a restriction might be due to insufficient ssDNA being available on the lagging strand template for accessory helicase binding due to occlusion of this ssDNA by DnaB. This model implies that the template strand to which the replicative helicase binds might dictate the required polarity for ssDNA-specific helicases to act as accessory replicative helicases. Eukaryotic replicative helicases have a polarity opposite to that of bacterial DnaB (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Forsburg, 2004</xref>). Helicases that promote fork movement might therefore require 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; translocation along ssDNA in eukaryotes, opposite to that determined for a bacterial system in this study. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rrm3p, the only eukaryotic helicase for which evidence exists of accessory replicative helicase function, is a 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; helicase that translocates along ssDNA, consistent with our proposal (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ivessa et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Why Does the Replicative Helicase Require Backup?</title><p>Why might recruitment of Rep or UvrD succeed in promoting fork movement through a protein-DNA complex when DnaB translocation has failed? Successive loading of helicases, one behind the other, may promote protein displacement (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Byrd and Raney, 2004</xref>). While there is no known mechanism to load additional DnaB hexamers onto a replisome to provide such assistance, probably as a consequence of the need to control replication initiation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Heller and Marians, 2006</xref>), binding of successive monomers of Rep or UvrD at a blocked fork could facilitate protein displacement. Tight control of replicative helicase loading is a conserved feature of replication systems, suggesting that similar considerations may apply to all organisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Generalized and Fork-Specific Helicases Can Underpin Replication of Protein-Bound DNA</title><p>Rep and UvrD underpinned fork movement along protein-bound DNA in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B&#x02013;1F), and each helicase provided this function in&#x000a0;vivo in the absence of the other enzyme (<xref rid="fig2 fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 2 and 4</xref>). However, low-level expression of Rep, but not UvrD, complemented &#x00394;<italic>rep</italic> &#x00394;<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality (Figures <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D), a property that correlated with the ability of Rep to interact physically and functionally with DnaB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A&#x02013;6C, 6E&#x02013;6H, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S4, and S5</xref>). Moreover, lack of this interaction abrogated Rep accessory helicase function in&#x000a0;vitro and inhibited complementation of <italic>&#x00394;rep &#x00394;uvrD</italic> lethality in&#x000a0;vivo (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>). These data indicate that Rep, present in low abundance in&#x000a0;vivo (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Scott and Kornberg, 1978</xref>), acts as the accessory replicative helicase in WT cells via physical and functional interaction with DnaB. Inhibition of the Rep-DnaB interaction by DnaC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>I and 6J) implies that Rep-DnaB complex formation likely occurs only after the initiation of replication. In contrast, UvrD may function as an accessory helicase only in the absence of Rep by virtue of the high abundance of UvrD (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Janion, 2001</xref>). UvrD might therefore act as a generalized protein displacement motor during DNA replication in addition to nucleotide excision repair and recombination (<xref rid="bib35 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Orren et&#x000a0;al., 1992; Veaute et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). However, regardless of helicase priority, our data demonstrate that accessory replicative helicase function may be provided by both a fork-specific and a non-fork-specific motor.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>Replication Fork Progression in a Protein-Rich Environment</title><p>Displacement of blocking proteins out of the path of advancing replication forks by an accessory helicase obviates the need for recruitment of recombination enzymes and the attendant risks of genome rearrangements. Minimizing recombination may be critically important, given the frequency with which collisions must occur between replication forks and nucleoprotein complexes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ivessa et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), especially transcribing RNAPs (<xref rid="bib2 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Azvolinsky et&#x000a0;al., 2009; Trautinger et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, although recombination is important in facilitating replication of template containing DNA damage, excision repair mechanisms ensure that replisome collisions with DNA lesions are infrequent, except when such damage is extensive (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rupp et&#x000a0;al., 1971</xref>). Thus, although recombination may be essential for survival in the face of programmed replication fork barriers located ectopically (<xref rid="bib6 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Bidnenko et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Lambert et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), accessory replicative helicases may act as a first line of defense against &#x0201c;accidental&#x0201d; fork blockage by nucleoprotein complexes. Our data therefore imply that such helicases may be ubiquitous, allowing genome duplication to occur concurrently with other essential DNA metabolic functions, and that within a single organism, multiple helicases may be able to perform such a function.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Plasmids, Proteins, and Strains</title><p><italic>oriC</italic>-containing plasmids bearing zero, two, or eight EcoRI sites (pPM436, pME101, and pPM594) and plasmids for the inducible expression of helicase&#x000a0;genes (pBAD) were constructed as described in thw <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>. pAM403 is a pRC7 derivative encoding Rep (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mahdi et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).
