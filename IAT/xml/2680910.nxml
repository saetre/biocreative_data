The ubiquitin E3-ligase POSH (plenty of SH3) augments HIV-1 egress by facilitating the transport of Gag to the cell membrane. Recently, it was reported, that POSH interacts with ALIX and thereby enhances ALIX mediated phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study we identified ALIX as a POSH ubiquitination substrate in human cells: POSH induces the ubiquitination of ALIX that is modified on several lysine residues <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>. This ubiquitination does not destabilize ALIX, suggesting a regulatory function. As it is well established that ALIX rescues virus release of L-domain mutant HIV-1, HIV-1&#x00394;<sub>PTAP</sub>, we demonstrated that wild type POSH, but not an ubiquitination inactive RING finger mutant (POSH<sup>V14A</sup>), substantially enhances ALIX-mediated release of infectious virions derived from HIV-1&#x00394;<sub>PTAP </sub>L-domain mutant (YPX<sub>n</sub>L-dependent HIV-1). In further agreement with the idea of a cooperative function of POSH and ALIX, mutating the YPX<sub>n</sub>L-ALIX binding site in Gag completely abrogated augmentation of virus release by overexpression of POSH. However, the effect of the POSH-mediated ubiquitination appears to be auxiliary, but not necessary, as silencing of POSH by RNAi does not disturb ALIX-augmentation of virus release.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Thus, the cumulative results identified ALIX as an ubiquitination substrate of POSH and indicate that POSH and ALIX cooperate to facilitate efficient virus release. However, while ALIX is obligatory for the release of YPX<sub>n</sub>L-dependent HIV-1, POSH, albeit rate-limiting, may be functionally interchangeable.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The release of nascent retrovirus particles requires the deployment of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) to the site of virus budding at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. ESCRT consists of four sub-complexes (ESCRT0-III) that normally reside on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane of late endosomes where they function in tandem to target endocytosed plasma membrane proteins into mutivesicular bodies (MVBs) <italic>en route </italic>to lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recruitment of ESCRT to the site of virus budding is facilitated by interaction of specific ESCRT proteins with short peptide sequences termed late (L-) domains of retroviruses Gag proteins such as the p6 and p9 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), respectively.</p><p>ALIX (ALG2 interacting protein X) is a multifunctional protein adaptor that plays a central role in the regulation of intracellular protein trafficking and apoptosis. As an ESCRT-associated regulator of protein trafficking, ALIX plays an essential role in retrovirus release, an activity that is dependent on the interaction between the central V-domain and the L-domain consensus sequence YPX<sub>n</sub>L in Gag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The function of ALIX to enhance virus release requires both the amino proximal Bro-domain that binds the ESCRT-III component CHMP4B as well as the carboxyl terminal proline-rich region (PRR) that interacts with multiple ALIX effectors including the tumor susceptibility gene (Tsg) 101 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Tsg101 is a component of the ESCRT-I and is essential for the release of retroviruses like HIV-1 that contain a PTAP L-domain motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Based on the fact that ALIX binds both CHMP and Tsg101 and the redundancy of ESCRT-II for HIV-1 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], it has been proposed that ALIX facilitates virus budding by recruiting ESCRT-III to ESCRT-I to which the nascent virus initially binds. In agreement with this hypothesis, overexpression of the ALIX V-domain potently inhibits HIV-1 release, a dominant negative function that is reversed by mutations that abolish ALIX-Gag binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast, preventing ALIX-Gag interaction has only a mild effect on the release of HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], while the ablation of Tsg101-Gag interaction blocks virus release almost completely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the binding of HIV-1 p6, ALIX was recently found to bind to nucleocapsid (NC) <italic>via </italic>its N-terminal Bro-domain in an RNA independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This interaction depends on the zinc finger motif in NC which mediates packaging of genomic RNA into budding virions. Intriguingly, zinc finger mutant viruses exhibited a phenotype similar to PTAP mutants, suggesting a functional link between NC and the L-domain in p6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) RING finger protein POSH (Plenty of SH3) is a scaffold protein that acts as an E3 ligase and as an activator of the JNK pathway (Jun N-terminal kinase), a function that is independent of its ubiquitination activity. Previously it was demonstrated that the ubiquitination activity of POSH is required for the trafficking of HIV-1 Gag from the TGN to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Subsequent reports implicated the E3 ligase activity of POSH in the degradation of the early endosome sorting factor Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine substrate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], in the regulation of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>immune response by mediating degradation of the JNK activator TAK-1 (TGF-beta-activated kinase-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and in the regulation of calcium homeostasis through spatial control of HERP (homocysteine-inducible endoplasmic reticulum protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Recent findings identified ALIX along with ALG-2 as binding proteins of POSH in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Thereby, POSH enhances ALIX mediated phenotypes in transgenic fruit flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Most intriguingly, these findings provided a clue for a possible molecular mechanism by which POSH regulates virus release in human cells. In the present study, we therefore investigated whether POSH cooperates with ALIX in terms of promoting virus release. We hereby report that ALIX is a POSH ubiquitination substrate. Further, we demonstrate that E3 ligase active POSH substantially enhances ALIX-mediated virus release. However, down-regulation of POSH fails to block ALIX virus promoting activity, indicating that POSH is not obligatory but rather an auxiliary co-factor for ALIX to facilitate virus release.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>POSH binds to ALIX in human cells</title><p>Previous results demonstrated an interaction between POSH and ALIX in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. To confirm this interaction in human cells, detergent extracts from HeLa cells transiently co-expressing epitope-tagged POSH and ALIX were subjected to immunoprecipitation of ALIX followed by Western blot analysis. POSH was efficiently co-precipitated by antibodies against ALIX (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Also the RING finger mutant POSH<sup>V14A</sup>, which is inactive as an E3 ligase and was previously shown to function in a dominant-negative manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated using anti-ALIX antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The amount of ALIX-bound POSH was directly proportional to the amount of expressed POSH. Thus, POSH<sup>V14A </sup>mutant that expresses at higher levels than wild-type POSH also shows increased binding to ALIX.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>POSH and ALIX are interacting proteins</bold>.

Consistent with <italic>in vivo </italic>data, POSH was efficiently co-precipitated by antibodies against ALIX, indicating that POSH directly interacts with ALIX (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ALIX is a POSH ubiquitination substrate</title><p>The finding that ALIX associates with POSH prompted us to test whether ALIX is a POSH ubiquitination substrate. To investigate this we employed a HeLa H310A cell line in which the POSH gene is efficiently silenced due to constitutive expression of a POSH specific shRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These cells were co-transfected with ALIX, HA-tagged ubiquitin and either RNAi insensitive <italic>wt </italic>POSH or POSH<sup>V14A</sup>. Subsequent analysis of immunoprecipitated ALIX by Western blot with anti-HA revealed that POSH, but not POSH<sup>V14A</sup>, induced the formation of high molecular weight ALIX-ubiquitin adducts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). It should be noted that the exogenous overexpression of POSH never exceeds the endogenous POSH levels and that of ALIX increases cellular protein level by approximately 10-fold (as determined by anti-ALIX, data not shown). Thus it is unlikely that the ubiquitination of ALIX by POSH is due to either non-physiological E3 levels or substrate concentration that could induce otherwise a non-physiological enzyme-substrate interaction.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>ALIX is a POSH ubiquitination substrate</bold>.

Following the ubiquitination reaction, ALIX was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG followed by a stringent wash with buffer containing 0.6% SDS (to disrupt ALIX-POSH interaction and thus ensure detection of ALIX-conjugated ubiquitin only).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-10-12-2"/></fig><p>To discern whether POSH ubiquitinates ALIX directly or rather, confers regulation of ALIX ubiquitination indirectly, we tested whether ALIX is a POSH ubiquitination substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end, bacterially expressed recombinant ALIX and POSH were incubated in the presence of ubiquitin, an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme and ATP in an <italic>in vitro </italic>ubiquitination reaction followed by Western blot analysis of the reaction products with anti-ALIX. The incubation of POSH with ALIX again produced high molecular ALIX species in an ATP-dependent fashion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Together, the <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>ubiquitination results established that ALIX is indeed a POSH ubiquitination substrate.</p><p>The conjugation of multiple ubiquitin moieties to ALIX together with the fact that this ubiquitination does not induce ALIX degradation suggests a conjugation of either non-canonical poly-ubiquitin chains or multiple mono-ubiquitin molecules. The best characterized non-canonical protein polyubiquitination is that formed through ubiquitin moieties linked by isopeptide linkages via lysine (K) 63 residue of ubiquitin. This type of polyubiquitin chain formation is strictly dependent on the activity of the heterodimeric E2 Ubc13/Uev1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To gain insight into the type of ubiquitination of ALIX induced by POSH we sought to further characterize the ubiquitination by employing the <italic>in vitro </italic>ubiquitination assay. To this end, bacterially expressed recombinant ALIX and POSH were incubated in the presence of ubiquitin, an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, two different E2 conjugating enzymes (UbcH5c and Ubc13/Uev1) and ATP in an <italic>in vitro </italic>ubiquitination reaction followed by Western blot analysis of the reaction products with anti-ALIX. The incubation of POSH and ALIX with UbcH5c produced high molecular ALIX species in an ATP-dependent fashion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) while incubation with Ubc13/Uev1 did not although POSH is active with Ubc13 for ubiquitination of Herp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As UbcH5c does not support formation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, the production of high molecular weight ALIX species is indicative of either multiple monoubiquitin molecules attached to multiple lysine residues within ALIX, or formation polyubiquitin chains linked by any other internal lysine of ubiqitin besides K63. Indeed, when a K48R ubiquitin, (where K48 is replaced by arginine), was employed in the <italic>in vitro </italic>reaction the polyubiquitinated ALIX species formed by POSH and UbcH5c were indistinguishable from those formed in the presence of native ubiquitin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This result in conjunction with the inactivity of Ubc13/Uev1a indicates that POSH induces either poly-ubiquitin chains linked <italic>via </italic>any other lysine besides K48 and K63 in ubiquitin, or poly-mono-ubiquitination where single ubiquitin molecules are conjugated to multiple lysine residues of ALIX.</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple ubiquitination sites are targeted by POSH</title><p>We next set out to investigate which domain of ALIX is ubiquitinated by POSH. For that reason, truncation mutants of ALIX were co-expressed with POSH and HA-tagged ubiquitin in H310A cells and ALIX-ubiquitin adducts were determined by Western blot with anti-HA. The C-terminal PRR of ALIX was the most promising candidate to be targeted by POSH as it was shown to interact with SH3-domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, deletion mutants of the last amino acids still were ubiquitinated by POSH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Even when the entire PRR was deleted, POSH still induced the formation of high molecular weight ALIX-ubiquitin adducts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), indicating that POSH also binds and ubiquitinates regions outside the PRR. Also a deletion of the N-terminal Bro-domain did not disturb the POSH-ALIX interaction as an N-terminal truncation mutant of ALIX is still ubiquitinated by POSH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Only the central V-domain was not targeted by POSH, either for the reason that it does not contain an ubiquitination site, or that it does not bind to POSH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>POSH targets multiple sites in ALIX</bold>. T7-tagged ALIX derivatives were expressed in HEK-293 cells and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-T7. Isolated ALIX was subsequently incubated in an <italic>in vitro </italic>ubiquitination reaction and ALIX-ubiquitin conjugation was analyzed as described in Material and Methods and in the legend to figure 2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-10-12-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>POSH enhances ALIX mediated augmentation of virus release</title><p>Recent studies demonstrated that overexpression of ALIX can rescue the production of an HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP </sub>mutant virus, that otherwise is severely attenuated due to its L-domain deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We therefore employed a full-length infectious HIV-1<sub>NL4-3 </sub>molecular clone, in which the PTAP motif was replaced by LIRL without affecting the <italic>pol </italic>ORF (HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) to explore the function of ALIX in virus biogenesis. Consequently, HeLa SS6 cells were co-transfected with HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP </sub>together with ALIX and POSH. Gag processing and release of infectious virions was determined 24-h post transfection by Western blot and single round infection of TZM-bl cells. The overexpression of POSH alone slightly enhanced both the expression of Gag and the release of virus particles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, lane 2), while overexpression of ALIX dramatically stimulated virus release by approximately 10-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, lane 3) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, co-expression of both exogenous POSH and ALIX further amplified virus production up to 25-fold compared to the control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, lane 4), indicating that both POSH and ALIX regulate the release of L-domain mutant HIV-1 virions in a synergistic manner.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Wild type POSH but not the ubiquitination inactive V14A mutant enhances rescue of virus production by ALIX</bold>.

Hence it is either that POSH contributed to virus release by increasing Gag expression (or stability) or that it functioned through a different mechanism. To discern between these possibilities we quantified the Western blot presented in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and subsequently determined the ratios between intracellular CA and virion CA and total Gag as measurements of Gag processing and virus release, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). According to these measurements, expressed relative to the corresponding ratio in the control, POSH had a minor effect on Gag processing, while ALIX stimulated processing by approximately three-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, right panel). POSH in the presence of ALIX did not further stimulate Gag processing. Similarly, POSH minimally affected mutant virus release while ALIX stimulation was over 2.5-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, left panel). Yet, despite having no effect by itself, in the presence of ALIX, POSH further stimulated virus release up to 4-fold. Thus, these quantifications indicate that the synergistic contribution of POSH is through a mechanism independent of the increase of Gag expression.</p><p>As we found that POSH ubiquitinates ALIX, we consequently wanted to test whether the enhancing effect of POSH on virus release is dependent on its ubiquitination activity. To this end, the enzymatic inactive POSH<sup>V14A </sup>mutant was tested for the ability to support virus release. Overexpression of POSH<sup>V14A </sup>alone in HeLa SS6 cells did not influence overall virus production (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 5) but inhibited relative Gag processing and virus release indicating a dominant negative effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 5).

Subsequent determination of virus release (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) showed that under conditions where ALIX was rate limiting, POSH consistently enhanced mutant virus release by approximately three fold.

Previous studies already indicated that POSH did not directly interact with HIV-1 Gag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Consequently, it can be excluded that the stimulatory effect of POSH on virus release resulted from a direct interaction of POSH with Gag. Yet, abrogating the interaction between ALIX and Gag should provide further indication whether POSH requires ALIX to stimulate virus production. Therefore, we investigated the ability of POSH to enhance ALIX-dependent virus release of HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP </sub>ALIX binding site (YPX<sub>n</sub>L) mutant, HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP/&#x00394;YP</sub>. To this end, POSH was co-expressed together with HIV-1 p6 ALIX binding site variants. The results depicted in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> show that in the presence of the intact ALIX binding site in p6, POSH was able to enhance HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP </sub>release (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the secondary &#x00394;YP mutation further reduced HIV-1 release and infectivity by an additional 5-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, lanes 1 and 3) as this mutation blocks ALIX-Gag interaction and as a result, the ability of ALIX to stimulate virus release. Overexpression of POSH had only slight effect on the release and infectivity of the HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP/&#x00394;YP </sub>double mutant virus, indicating that POSH requires the interaction of ALIX and Gag to substantially enhance virus production of a HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP </sub>mutant.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>POSH mediated enhancement of virus release requires a functional ALIX binding site in Gag</bold>.

To further elucidate the functional relationship between POSH and ALIX, we investigated the dependence of ALIX-mediated virus release on the ubiquitination by POSH. To address this question, endogenous levels of POSH were knocked down by RNAi in order to determine whether ALIX could enhance virus release in the absence of POSH. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, significant (approximately 70%) knock down of endogenous levels of POSH by RNAi had no influence on ALIX-mediated rescue of the HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP </sub>mutant, indicating that ALIX retained its activity even when endogenous POSH levels were reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2 to 3 and 4).

Hence, it appears that the virus release enhancing function of ALIX can be stimulated by POSH-mediated ubiquitination, while in contrast down-regulation of POSH does not significantly influence the ALIX activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>ALIX mediated rescue of HIV-1 L-domain mutant occurs independently of POSH</bold>.

ALIX was shown to associate with the MVB pathway and thereby being involved in budding of enveloped viruses. More recently it was demonstrated that ALIX as an ESCRT-III associated protein is also involved in the terminal stages of cytokinesis, where it is recruited to the midbody through binding to Cep55 (centrosome associated protein 55) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Biogenesis of intra-endosomal vesicles in MVBs, midbody abscission during cytokinesis and virus budding are topologically equivalent inasmuch as the final step, the pinching off the membrane-stalk, is regulated by the ESCRT.</p><p>Due to its multitasking nature, the function of ALIX is tightly regulated by its interaction partners. As already demonstrated earlier by others, ALIX is phosphorylated by the Src thyrosine kinase, which regulates its association with membranes and cytoskeleton as well as its affinity to binding partners SETA/CIN85 and Pyk2 that are involved in receptor downregulation and cell adhesion, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In this study we propose a role for ubiquitination in the regulation of ALIX function. We found, that the TGN-associated scaffolding protein POSH, which exhibits E3-ligase activity mediated by its N-terminal RING-domain, ubiquitinates ALIX. Intriguingly, this ubiquitination does not induce proteasomal degradation of ALIX, as there was no reduction in the level of intracellular ALIX upon POSH overexpression. Moreover, as it could be excluded that the ubiquitin chains are linked <italic>via </italic>K48 of ubiquitin, the non-canonical ubiquitination apparently has a regulatory function. While it could be established that POSH targets multiple lysine residues in ALIX, the detected high molecular ALIX species possibly arise from conjugation of monomeric ubiquitin moieties to several lysine residues. ALIX contains altogether 65 lysine residues from which 33 were predicted by computational analysis to be accessible for ubiquitination (ubiquitin nuggets, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ubpred.org/"/>). However, the exact nature of this ubiquitination remains obscure. Given that ALIX is ubiquitinated in the presence of UbcH5c but not in the presence of Ubc13/Uev1 it is likely that POSH either induces multi-ubiquitination on several lysine residues within ALIX or poly-ubiquitin chains linked via ubiquitin lysine residues other than K48 and K63 (<italic>e. g. </italic>K6, K11, K27, K29, and K33) as has been recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The functional significance of these types of ubiquitinations on target proteins is still poorly understood.</p><p>Besides its numerous functions in regulating cellular pathways, ALIX was described as binding partner of HIV-1 p6 and EIAV p9 thereby being involved in budding and release of these retroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Previously it was demonstrated that the ubiquitination activity of POSH is required for HIV-1 particle production by facilitating Gag trafficking from the TGN to the cell membrane and thus, stimulates the release HIV-1 particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The finding that there is a functional interaction between POSH and ALIX prompted us to investigate the importance of this interaction for virus release. Though the specific regulation conferred on ALIX through POSH-dependent ubiquitination is unclear, the data indicates that both proteins somehow cooperate to promote virus release: Overexpression of POSH substantially stimulated the ALIX mediated rescue of an HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP </sub>mutant, the stimulatory effect of POSH on virus production was blocked by abrogating Gag-ALIX interaction through introduction of specific mutations within Gag that prevented ALIX binding and the enhancing effect of POSH was completely abolished when its ubiquitination activity was disrupted due to a RING finger mutation (POSH<sup>V14A</sup>). However, the minor residual activity of POSH observed when ALIX-Gag interaction was blocked by the &#x00394;YP mutation in the L-domain containing p6 Gag protein might indicate that POSH also regulates another factor along the pathway that mediates virus release. This together with the fact that siRNA-mediated knockdown of POSH fails to block the function of ALIX raises the question of whether the cooperative function of POSH and ALIX in terms of promoting virus release is a result of a direct interaction between both proteins, or a consequence of an independent positive role of POSH-mediated ubiquitination somewhere else in the pathway. The observation that POSH, which by itself does not interact detectably with Gag, ubiquitinates ALIX is consistent with a model whereby the binding of Gag to ALIX meditates virus egress while POSH acts as an auxiliary factor. Since downregulation of POSH has no detectable influence on the function of ALIX, it is either that POSH is not strictly required or that the POSH function can be substituted by another E3-ligase. Similar to Tsg101, which is also substrate for two different E3 ligases, namely Tal (Tsg101 associated ligase) and Mahogunin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], ALIX may be ubiquitinated by an additional E3 ligase, when POSH is downregulated.</p><p>Until now, the molecular mechanism by which ALIX supports virus release is unresolved. Apparently, it requires the interaction of the N-terminal Bro-domain of ALIX with the ESCRT-III component CHMP4B as mutations in ALIX that prevent ALIX/ESCRT-III interaction abolish the ability of ALIX to rescue HIV-1 L-domain mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, the C-terminal PRR of ALIX was shown to be essential for virus release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], however, the nature of this activity is currently unknown. Furthermore, as ALIX fulfills several distinct cellular functions, it is possible that ubiquitination by POSH regulates a function that is redundant for virus release. That the ubiquitination of ALIX by POSH might not be essential for virus release is supported by the results that show lack of correlation between the requirement for ALIX ubiquitination and for the capacity of ALIX to support virus release. For example, ALIX truncation mutants that cannot promote virus release such as the &#x00394;Bro and the &#x00394;PRR are similarly ubiquitinated and both ubiquitination patterns are similar to that of native ALIX.</p><p>Previous studies implicated POSH as a regulator of Gag transport from the TGN to the cell membrane, a function that precedes ESCRT-mediated virus budding from the membrane. The function of POSH mediated ubiquitination of ALIX may accelerate a step of Gag transport prior to the virus assembly at the cell membrane. As the rate-limiting step of virus production of HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;PTAP </sub>mutant virions is the ESCRT-dependent release of virus particles from the cell membrane, inhibition of steps earlier in the pathway would not show a significant phenotype as long as enough Gag is transported to the cell membrane.</p><p>However, besides its role in ESCRT, ALIX was initially identified as interaction partner of ALG-2, a calcium binding protein that is necessary for induction of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The observation that POSH binds both, ALIX and ALG-2 in a calcium dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] together with the implicated role of POSH in the induction of apoptosis and neuronal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] suggest a functional role for POSH and ALIX in the regulation of apoptosis and calcium metabolism. Further evidence for this hypothesis comes from findings that POSH regulates calcium homeostasis through spatial control of HERP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The fact, that ALIX links ALG-2 and ESCRT pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] might indicate that these pathways are somehow connected and are utilized by HIV-1.</p><p>It has been reported that actin polymerisation is essential for Gag transport of EIAV to the plasma membrane and the subsequent disassembly of actin filaments facilitates virus budding and virion release from the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. ALIX, that contains actin and alpha actinin binding sites, also plays a pivotal role in actin organisation. Pan and colleagues reported that ALIX expression in a fibroblast cell line was required to maintain actin-based structures such as stress fibers and lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>We have no evidence for direct interaction between POSH and actin. Nevertheless, considering the interaction between POSH and ALIX, the actin interaction properties of ALIX and the requirement for actin dynamics for virus production and release, we propose (a model) whereby both proteins cooperate at the plasma membrane where ALIX serves a dual function: it bridges between Gag and actin through respective binding sites while it recruits ESCRT to initiate virus budding. POSH may regulate disassembly of actin from Gag, possibly through ubiquitination of ALIX, thereby facilitating detachment of nascent virus particles from the cell membrane.</p><p>The model is consistent with the absolute requirement for ALIX as it is essential for mutant virus budding. Likewise, the model is in agreement with overexpression of POSH enhancing virus release possibly by increasing the rate of actin disassembly.</p><p>Finally, it should to be considered that POSH also interacts with another ESCRT-associated protein as it was shown to ubiquitinate Hrs, which in contrast to ALIX, is subsequently targeted for proteasomal degradation. Hrs interacts with the ESCRT-I components Tsg101 and HCRP1/Vps37A and C-terminal fragments of Hrs that interact with Tsg101 interfere with HIV-1 particle production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus, it has to be considered that overexpression as well as downregulation of POSH may also regulate HIV-1 release distant to the hereby described POSH-ALIX interaction and overlapping effects may account for the partial nature of the phenotype described.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified ALIX as an ubiquitination substrate of POSH and indicate that both proteins are involved in the process of YPX<sub>n</sub>L-dependent HIV-1 release.
