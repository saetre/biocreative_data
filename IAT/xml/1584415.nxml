In most cases, individual polymorphisms only moderately increase risk (~20&#x00025;), and they are thought to be unhelpful in assessing individuals' risk clinically. The value of analyzing multiple alleles simultaneously is not well studied. This is often because, for any given disease, very few common risk alleles have been confirmed.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Three common variants (Lys23 of <italic>KCNJ11,</italic> Pro12 of <italic>PPARG,</italic> and the T allele at rs7903146 of <italic>TCF7L2</italic>) have been shown to predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus across many large studies. Risk allele frequencies ranged from 0.30 to 0.88 in controls. To assess the combined effect of multiple susceptibility alleles, we genotyped these variants in a large case-control study (3,668 controls versus 2,409 cases). Individual allele odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.14 (95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x0005b;CI&#x0005d;, 1.05 to 1.23) to 1.48 (95&#x00025; CI, 1.36 to 1.60). We found no evidence of gene-gene interaction, and the risks of multiple alleles were consistent with a multiplicative model. Each additional risk allele increased the odds of type 2 diabetes by 1.28 (95&#x00025; CI, 1.21 to 1.35) times. Participants with all six risk alleles had an OR of 5.71 (95&#x00025; CI, 1.15 to 28.3) compared to those with no risk alleles. The 8.1&#x00025; of participants that were double-homozygous for the risk alleles at <italic>TCF7L2</italic> and Pro12Ala had an OR of 3.16 (95&#x00025; CI, 2.22 to 4.50), compared to 4.3&#x00025; with no <italic>TCF7L2</italic> risk alleles and either no or one Glu23Lys or Pro12Ala risk alleles.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Combining information from several known common risk polymorphisms allows the identification of population subgroups with markedly differing risks of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those obtained using single polymorphisms.

One particular form, type 2 diabetes, develops when cells in the body become unable to respond to a hormone called insulin. Insulin is normally released by the pancreas and controls the ability of body cells to take in glucose (sugar). Therefore, when cells become insensitive to insulin as in people with type 2 diabetes, glucose levels in the body are not well controlled and may become dangerously high in the blood. These high levels can have long-term damaging effects on various organs in the body, particularly the eyes, nerves, heart, and kidneys. There are many different factors that affect whether someone is likely to develop type 2 diabetes. These factors can be broadly grouped into two categories: environmental and genetic. Environmental factors such as obesity, a diet high in sugar, and a sedentary lifestyle are all risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes in later life. Genetically, a number of variants in many different genes may affect the risk of developing the disease. Generally, these gene variants are common in human populations but each gene variant only mildly increases the risk that a person possessing it will get type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The investigators performing this study wanted to understand how different gene variants combine to affect an individual's risk of getting type 2 diabetes. That is, if a person carries many different variants, does their overall risk increase a lot or only a little?</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>First, the researchers surveyed the published reports to identify those gene variants for which there was strong evidence of an association with type 2 diabetes. They found mutations in three genes that had been shown reproducibly to be associated with type 2 diabetes in different studies: <italic>PPARG</italic> (whose product is involved in regulation of fat tissue), <italic>KCNJ11</italic> (whose product is involved in insulin production), and <italic>TCF7L2</italic> (whose product is thought to be involved in controlling sugar levels). Then, they compared two groups of white people in the UK: 2,409 people with type 2 diabetes (&#x0201c;cases&#x0201d;), and 3,668 people from the general population (&#x0201c;controls&#x0201d;). The researchers compared the two groups to see which individuals possessed which gene variants, and did statistical testing to work out to what extent having particular combinations of the gene variants affected an individual's chance of being a &#x0201c;case&#x0201d; versus a &#x0201c;control.&#x0201d; Their results showed that in the groups studied, having an ever-increasing number of gene variants increased the risk of developing diabetes. The risk that someone with none of the gene variants would develop type 2 diabetes was about 2&#x00025;, while the chance for someone with all gene variants was about10&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These results show that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is greater if an individual possesses all of the gene variants that were examined in this study. The analysis also suggests that using information on all three variants, rather than just one, is likely to be more accurate in predicting future risk. How this genetic information should be used alongside other well-known preventative measures such as altered lifestyle requires further study.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030374">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030374</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=128&#x00026;sectionId=19063">NHS Direct patient information</ext-link> on diabetes</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/type1and2/">National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse information on type 2 diabetes</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>World Health Organization <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/diabetes/">Diabetes Programme</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Centers for Disease Control<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/">Diabetes Public Health Resource</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Weedon MN, McCarthy MI, Hitman G, Walker M, Groves CJ, et al.

At each of these variants, our data (and that from the literature) are consistent with each risk allele independently increasing the odds of type 2 diabetes (i.e., individually all variants fit a multiplicative inheritance model); goodness of fit <italic>p</italic>-values are 0.81, 0.92, and 0.99 for Glu23Lys, Pro12Ala, and rs7903146, respectively.</p><p>We next looked for potential gene-gene interaction between the three variants and type 2 diabetes status (i.e., deviation from a multiplicative model) using logistic regression. We used both case-only and case-control designs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030374-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Power to detect interaction ORs for pairs of SNPs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030374-g001">Figure 1</xref>. We had 80&#x00025; power to detect pairwise interaction ORs of 1.18 to 1.28 at <italic>p</italic> &#x02265; 0.05, depending on the combination of polymorphisms. A pairwise interaction OR of 1.25 means, in the example of a pair of alleles each with main effect ORs of 1.2, that the joint OR is increased from 1.44 (no interaction) to 1.8 (i.e., 1.2 &#x000d7; 1.2 &#x000d7; 1.25).</p><p>Gene-gene interaction results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030374-t002">Table 2</xref>. No pairwise or three-way combinations of genotypes showed evidence of interaction. While our results suggest that these variants increase risk in a simple multiplicative manner, it is important to note that we cannot rule out a range of other joint effects models. For example, our data are also consistent with an additive model of gene-gene interaction; however, because the ORs for the individual polymorphisms are low, our study is poorly powered to distinguish between an additive and multiplicative model.</p><p>The proportion of participants with increasing numbers of risk alleles in cases and in controls are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030374-g002">Figure 2</xref>.

This reference group was chosen because only 0.25&#x00025; of individuals carry zero risk alleles. The progressive increase in ORs is consistent with an independent effects multiplicative model (goodness of fit test <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.49). Each additional risk allele increased odds of disease by 1.28 (95&#x00025; CI, 1.21 to 1.35) times. Participants with six risk alleles had an OR of 2.84 (95&#x00025; CI, 2.08 to 3.87) compared to the reference group.

It is the first study, to our knowledge, to look at the impact of the combined predictive value of three common (allele frequencies 0.3&#x02013;0.88) genetic variants that have individually reached genomewide significance in meta-analysis. We showed that there is no evidence for interaction (within the limits of this study's power), and that the prediction of relative risk is greater when the three alleles are combined in a manner that is consistent with a multiplicative model.</p><p>Because there are only three confirmed common type 2 diabetes risk variants, the predictive power of this genetic information is still small compared to environmental and lifestyle influences such as body mass index and physical activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030374-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Considerable cause for optimism remains, however, that common type 2 diabetes risk polymorphisms will provide meaningful predictive information. Janssens et al. have suggested that the predictive power of genetic tests should be evaluated by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030374-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The AUC is a measure of the discriminatory power of the test. A perfect test would have an AUC of 1; a test with no discriminatory power would have an AUC of 0.5. The ROC curve for the three polymorphisms described here is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030374-g004">Figure 4</xref>; the area under the ROC curve is 0.58. There are two reasons to think that this figure will improve with time and that genetic screening in type 2 diabetes will eventually prove useful. First, the number of reproducibly associated variants is likely to increase rapidly with large clinical resources and the technology to perform whole-genome association studies in place. Yang et al. estimated that 20&#x02013;25 risk variants with allele frequencies greater than 0.1 and ORs of 1.5 are required for an AUC of about 0.8 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030374-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030374-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;<italic>.</italic> Second, the low cost of genotyping may mean identifying a small proportion of individuals at high risk would still be justifiable if preventative measures can be found.</p><p>One minor limitation of our study is that our cases are enriched for patients with a family history of type 2 diabetes and a young age of diagnosis. This may mean that, compared to the general type 2 diabetes population, we have overestimated the risk due to these variants. This should be offset, to some extent, by our use of a relatively young population-based cohort as our control group, approximately 5&#x00025; of whom will develop diabetes later in life. We also note that the ORs we observed are consistent with those from other large studies in the literature. However, to assess the applicability of our findings to the general population, further studies will be needed&#x02014;ideally large, prospective cohort studies. This will require use of future resources such as the UK Biobank, which is currently in the early stages of recruiting 500,000 individuals from the general UK population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030374-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. These very large-scale studies will also be needed to give us the adequate power to compare risk of disease in patients with the high numbers of risk alleles, and to identify subtle interaction effects.</p><p>It has been suggested that gene-gene and gene-environment interactions play a major role in complex disease predisposition. We found no evidence of gene-gene interaction between the variants we studied and type 2 diabetes risk. If some of the yet-unidentified variants interact with each other and/or with environmental factors, we will be able to further (and perhaps dramatically) increase the predictive power of polygenic variant information. However, based on our results, even in the absence of interaction the combination of information from several common, low-penetrance alleles may provide a good level of predictive power in persons with high numbers of risk alleles.</p><p>Despite limitations to this study, we feel that important conclusions can be drawn from our results. Our data support the idea that, while individual polygenic susceptibility variants may be of limited use in disease prediction, the combined information from a number of these variants allows the identification of groups of people at high and low risk of developing a complex disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030374-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030374-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. This approach may allow the targeting of preventative measures to individuals at high risk of disease, although many further studies will be required to examine the efficacy of preventative measures in groups with high-risk genotypes.</p><p>In conclusion, although individual susceptibility alleles only moderately increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, the risk is multiplicatively increased when risk alleles are combined. The combined information from risk alleles allows the identification of subgroups of the population with odds for disease significantly greater than when using a single polymorphism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0030374-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>ORs and 95&#x00025; CIs for Different Combinations of Risk Alleles</title><p>Data are given for participants carrying differing combinations of risk alleles compared with those with zero <italic>TCF7L2</italic> risk alleles and zero or one Glu23Lys/Pro12Ala risk allele for type 2 diabetes status (Ref).
