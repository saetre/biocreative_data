Although Th1 cells control infection, they are unable to fully eliminate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, suggesting that Th1-mediated immunity is restrained from its full sterilizing potential. Investigation into T cell&#x02013;mediated defense is hindered by difficulties in expanding <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;specific T cells. To circumvent this problem, we cloned CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected B6 mice and generated transgenic mice expressing a T cell receptor specific for the immunodominant antigen early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6). Adoptively transferred naive ESAT-6&#x02013;specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are activated in pulmonary lymph nodes between 7 and 10 d after aerosol infection and undergo robust expansion before trafficking to the lung.

Bacterial replication in infected cells is inhibited by the actions of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;, supplied by antigen-specific T cells and cells of the innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Although infected humans and mice generate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;specific T cells, the immune system is generally incapable of providing sterilizing immunity against this pathogen, and individuals cured of primary <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection remain vulnerable to reinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). The only approved vaccine against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the <italic>M. bovis</italic> derivative Bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG), induces, at best, only partial immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Immunization of mice with BCG induces protective immunity that results in &#x0223c;10-fold fewer <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> organisms in the lungs upon aerosol challenge.</p><p>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells play a dominant role in immunity to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> because animals deficient in these cells are more susceptible to infection than normal mice or mice lacking CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), and patients with CD4 T cell deficiency from HIV infection have dramatically elevated rates of reactivation tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). After aerosol infection in mice, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> replication is controlled when effector T cells reach the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Among CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell subsets, IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing Th1 cells are essential, because humans with defects in the IFN-&#x003b3; receptor have markedly increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, and mice lacking either IFN-&#x003b3; or its receptor die rapidly after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Although it is commonly assumed that vaccines that elicit larger or more Th1-focused antigen-specific T cell responses will be more effective, the extent to which very high numbers of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;specific Th1 cells can provide protective immunity remains unclear.</p><p>Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain how <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> evades T cell&#x02013;mediated immune defenses. The first posits that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> induces complex T cell responses comprising Th1 and Th17 effector cells that enhance bacterial clearance, and regulatory T cells that restrict bacterial clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). In this scenario, regulatory T cell function is sufficient to prevent clearance of primary infection or development of protective immunity. The second hypothesis is that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has acquired mechanisms to hide from the immune system within infected cells, out of reach of the adaptive immune system. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and evidence in support of both is mounting. Because tuberculosis is a lengthy infection, with clinically distinct phases, it is likely that the mechanisms of immune evasion differ during early, latent, and late infection. Determining the relative contributions of distinct immune evasion mechanisms is essential for vaccine design and new therapeutic approaches.</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether high numbers of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;specific Th1 cells can protect mice from infection. We generated mice that are transgenic (tg) for an MHC class II&#x02013;restricted TCR specific for the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigen early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6). We show that ESAT-6&#x02013;specific Th1 cells are remarkably potent in protecting mice from infection. However, ESAT-6&#x02013;specific Th1 cells controlled bacterial replication only after day 7 following infection, despite the fact that high numbers of these cells were in the lung before, during, and after inhalation of live <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. These studies indicate that during the first week of infection, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected cells are either physically inaccessible to pathogen-specific effector CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells or are functionally incapable of receiving CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell help.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Generation of ESAT-6&#x02013;specific TCR tg mice</title><p>ESAT-6 is a secreted protein implicated in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and is a key antigen in humans, primates, and mice, and vaccination with ESAT-6 induces protective CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).

In both thymocytes and splenocytes, an increased percentage of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells with a concomitant decrease in the frequency of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells was observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).

One limitation of relying on these methods is that the frequency of antigen-specific cells needs to be high enough to detect by fluorimetric analysis, and these cells need to produce cytokines to be detected. Accordingly, naive cells cannot be studied because these cells need to expand and differentiate into cytokine-producing cells before they can be visualized. Using these methods, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;specific effector CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are first detectable in the pLNs &#x0223c;14 d after infection, and these cells reach peak numbers in the lungs between 21 and 28 d after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).

At days 7, 10, and 13 after infection, pLNs were recovered and the frequency and phenotype of C7 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were determined. At day 7 after infection, the frequency of C7 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the pLNs was low and similar to that seen in uninfected animals. C7 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells at day 7 had a naive phenotype. These cells were CFSE bright, CD69 negative, CD44 intermediate, and CD62L high (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> and not depicted). The naive phenotype of these cells, with low surface expression of the early activation marker CD69, indicates that C7 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells had not been presented antigen at the day 7 time point. By day 10 after infection, the frequency of C7 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells among CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells increased compared with day 7, and every mouse examined contained either recently activated cells (expressing CD69) or divided cells, as indicated by CFSE dilution.

In contrast, between days 7 and 10 after infection, while bacterial growth continued in control mice, growth was controlled in animals that received C7 Th1 cells. Interestingly, the number of bacteria remained constant until day 30 after infection despite the presence of C7 Th1 cells capable of producing cytokines in the lungs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>).</p><p>The finding that C7 Th1 cells were in the lungs before infection, but did not control bacterial replication until after day 7 following infection, led us to investigate whether these cells were activated during the first week of infection. Unlike our studies using naive C7 cells, we could not determine, using the activation markers CD69 and CD25, when C7 Th1 effector cells were presented antigen in the lung, because &#x0223c;60% of C7 Th1 cells expressed these activation markers regardless of whether these cells were harvested from naive or infected animals (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080353/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080353/DC1</ext-link>). This result is consistent with studies of memory CD8 T cells in the lung and suggests that CD69 cannot be used to monitor presentation of cognate antigen to antigen-experienced T cells in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). In addition, expansion of C7 Th1 cells was not evident in infected animals between days 4 and 13 after infection, because similar numbers of C7 Th1 cells were recovered from naive and infected mice (Fig. S1). As a third attempt to understand if C7 Th1 cells were activated during the first 7 d of infection, message levels for <italic>ifn&#x003b3;</italic> and one target gene, <italic>nos2</italic>, were measured in infected mice that received C7 Th1 cells. Similar levels of these transcripts were observed from days 1 to 7 after infection, whereas both transcripts were induced by day 18 after infection. This suggests that C7 Th1 cells were not activated to produce high levels of IFN-&#x003b3; during the first week of infection. Collectively, these data do not support the hypothesis that C7 Th1 cells are activated during the first 7 d of infection. However, these negative data also do not rule out the possibility that some C7 Th1 cells (perhaps very small numbers) &#x0201c;see&#x0201d; antigen and are activated during the first week of infection.</p><p>In summary, the results show that effector ESAT-6&#x02013;specific Th1 cells greatly reduce the number of viable <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the lungs and that control of bacterial growth occurs after day 7 following infection. This delay in protection is unlikely to be caused by a lack of ESAT-6 synthesis during the first week of infection, because ESAT-6 transcript was detectable by at least day 5 after infection in the lungs of infected mice, and ESAT-6&#x02013;deficient <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> showed reduced growth in the lungs (compared with wild-type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) during the first 5 d of infection, demonstrating that ESAT-6 is synthesized very early after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We generated mice tg for a TCR specific to the dominant <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigen ESAT-6 to investigate the ability of Th1 cells to provide protective immunity. Our analysis of adoptively transferred C7 TCR tg CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells revealed that priming of naive ESAT-6&#x02013;specific TCR tg cells occurred 7&#x02013;10 d after aerosol infection with a low dose of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Our experiments demonstrated that adoptively transferred Th1 cells specific for ESAT-6 can provide a high level of protection, as measured up to 90 d after infection, but that in vivo mycobacterial growth is unimpaired for the first week of infection despite large numbers of pathogen-specific T cells in the lungs.</p><p>The delay in priming of naive ESAT-6&#x02013;specific T cells is not unexpected and is consistent with the finding that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;specific effector T cells are not present at high frequencies in the lungs of mice until &#x0223c;3 wk after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Our results are also consistent with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) that monitored the priming of TCR tg CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells specific to the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigen Ag85B. One notable difference is that priming of Ag85B-specific monoclonal CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells occurred at day 12 after aerosol infection, 2&#x02013;4 d later than the C7 TCR tg cell response documented in this study. Differences in priming between naive Ag85B and ESAT-6&#x02013;specific clones may result from differences in the expression patterns of these two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), differences in the presentation of these antigens, or differences in the sensitivity of the TCRs used by Ag85B TCR tg cells and C7 TCR tg cells for their cognate antigens. Direct comparative studies will be required to distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>Our studies with in vitro&#x02013;generated Th1 cells revealed two surprising findings. One is how well monoclonal ESAT-6&#x02013;specific Th1 cells were able to protect mice from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. The second is the fact that despite high numbers of C7 Th1 effector cells in animals before infection, bacterial replication was not controlled until 1 wk after infection.</p><p>The 2-log reduction in the number of bacilli in animals that received C7 Th1 cells is greater than that observed after BCG immunization and comparable to prime-boost vaccination methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). By using adoptively transferred C7 Th1 cells, our experiments demonstrate that monoclonal T cells specific to ESAT-6 can provide a level of early protection that is comparable to that provided by mixed populations of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector T cells after vaccination. Thus, complex populations of T cells are not required to control infection, a result that suggests that adoptive T cell transfer may provide a therapeutic option for drug-resistant <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infections.</p><p>It is presumed that improved vaccines can be designed to protect individuals from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection by eliciting robust antigen-specific T cell responses. This view is supported by the observation that after aerosol infection in mice, accumulation of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the lungs coincides with the control of bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Several hypotheses for a lack of sterilizing immunity to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can be proposed, including a delayed recruitment of effector T cells to the lungs. Our ability to track adoptively transferred <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;specific C7 Th1 cells allowed us to determine that approximately a half million of these cells were in the lungs before infection and allowed us to definitively rule out this hypothesis.</p><p>What accounts for the delayed protection by C7 Th1 cells? Given the low dose infection used in our studies (100 bacteria) and the slow doubling time of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> during the first several days of infection, very few cells may be infected, and the probability of C7 Th1 cells &#x0201c;finding&#x0201d; an infected cell may be low. Although several cell types, including macrophages and DCs, are infected by day 14 after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), no information exists on the frequency or phenotype of infected cells in the lungs during the first week of infection (although presumably alveolar macrophages are the first cells infected). A recent study using multiphoton microscopy found that liver-resident macrophages, Kupffer cells, were the first cells infected with BCG after i.v. infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Recruitment of uninfected Kupffer cells and blood-derived monocytes to infected cells occurred 2 wk after infection.</p><p>If similar delays in cell recruitment occur in the lungs after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, it could take 7&#x02013;10 d until lung resident cells (i.e., macrophages, DCs, and effector/memory T cells) home to infected cells. Before day 7 after infection, C7 Th1 cells may randomly encounter infected cells, whereas after day 7, migration within the lungs to infected sites could be directed by inflammatory signals. Our studies with naive C7 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells demonstrated that T cell priming in pLNs also occurred only after day 7 following infection. A similar mechanism may account for the delayed priming of naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. After the first week of infection, DCs and other APCs may home to infected sites within the lung and traffic to draining LNs to prime naive T cells. This hypothesis requires further investigation.</p><p>On the other hand, if C7 Th1 cells home to infected cells within the lungs promptly after infection, it would suggest defective collaboration between CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector cells and infected cells: infected cells may be unable to present antigen to activate effector CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, or infected cells may be unable to control bacterial replication after stimulation by IFN-&#x003b3; and other factors provided by effector CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. In vitro studies support both hypotheses, but in vivo studies to answer these important questions are necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>).</p><p>The findings reported in this paper have important implications for understanding immunity to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. In this study, we show that high numbers of ESAT-6&#x02013;specific Th1 cells provided substantial protection to mice after low dose aerosol infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. However, this protection was delayed until after day 7 following infection, and bacteria persisted in these animals thereafter. This finding may help explain why vaccination against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has been difficult: immediately after infection, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> resides in cells that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells cannot help.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Generation of C7 TCR tg mice.</title><p>To generate ESAT-6&#x02013;specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell hybridomas, B6 mice were aerosol infected with &#x0223c;100 CFU <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Erdman, and 6 wk after infection, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> splenocytes were purified and stimulated in the presence of irradiated T cell&#x02013;depleted splenocytes (APCs) and 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml of ESAT-6 protein (the expression vector used to make ESAT-6 protein, pMRLB7, was provided by Mycobacteria Research Laboratories at Colorado State University). 2 d later, activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were fused with the tumor cell line BW5147.
