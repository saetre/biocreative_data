It is generally believed that the proteins encoded in these genes are important for successful survival of the organism under the hostile conditions.

To examine whether the heat shock proteins affect the bactericidal action of FQs, we constructed <italic>E. coli </italic>strains with mutations in various heat shock genes and tested their susceptibility to FQs. Mutations in <italic>dnaK</italic>, <italic>groEL</italic>, and <italic>lon </italic>increased this susceptibility; the <italic>lon </italic>mutant exhibited the greatest effects. The increased susceptibility of the <italic>lon </italic>mutant was corroborated by experiments in which the gene encoding the cell division inhibitor, SulA, was subsequently disrupted. SulA is induced by the SOS response and degraded by the Lon protease. The findings suggest that the hypersusceptibility of the <italic>lon </italic>mutant to FQs could be due to abnormally high levels of SulA protein resulting from the depletion of Lon and the continuous induction of the SOS response in the presence of FQs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present results show that the bactericidal action of FQs is moderately affected by the DnaK and GroEL chaperones and strongly affected by the Lon protease. FQs have contributed successfully to the treatment of various bacterial infections, but their widespread use and often misuse, coupled with emerging resistance, have gradually compromised their utility. Our results suggest that agents capable of inhibiting the Lon protease have potential for combination therapy with FQs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>FQs are broad-spectrum agents applicable to a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative infections, and they have good oral absorbability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Because of these advantages, FQs have been widely used against a variety of bacterial infections for about two decades. They target the type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for controlling the topological state of DNA during replication and transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Bacteria are known to respond to unfavorable conditions, e.g., exposure to toxic chemicals and physical agents, nutrient limitation, or sudden increase in growth temperature, by rapid expression of regulons related to the heat shock, SOS, and oxidative stress responses. DNA damage by UV irradiation, or treatment with naldixic acid, induce both the SOS and heat shock responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Puromycin has been reported to induce first the SOS and secondly the heat shock responses; hydrogen peroxide induces the oxidative stress and SOS responses; and CdCl<sub>2 </sub>strongly induces all three stress responses. Protein induction by these responses is widely believed to be important for the organism's survival under hostile conditions. Analogously, the proteins induced when bacterial cells are exposed to antibiotics may affect the susceptibility of the organisms to these agents.</p><p>The aim of present study was to identify the bacterial responses affecting the bactericidal action of FQs. We analyzed the proteins induced in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>by exposure to FQs, then examined the susceptibilities to these agents of <italic>E. coli </italic>strains with mutations in the genes encoding these proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Analysis of protein synthesis in E. coli exposed to levofloxacin</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1(A)</xref> shows a profile of proteins in <italic>E. coli </italic>cells that were pulse-labeled after incubation for 10 min with different concentrations of LVFX. The results show a large increase in synthesis of 70 kDa (a), 60 kDa (b), and 40 kDa proteins (c) at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml LVFX. These proteins were also induced by lower concentrations of LVFX, but increasing concentrations increased the rate of synthesis. Comparison of the protein profiles of LVFX-treated, temperature-shifted (42&#x000b0;C) and unshifted (30&#x000b0;C) bacteria indicates that the 70 kDa (a) and 60 kDa (b) bands may be heat shock proteins. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1(B)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1(C)</xref> show the time-course of synthesis of these proteins after incubation with 10 &#x003bc;g/ml LVFX for 60 min. Synthesis of the 70 kDa and 60 kDa proteins appears to have accelerated for 15 min and then stopped. In contrast, induction of the 40 kDa protein continued up to 45 min after exposure to LVFX, suggesting that the induction mechanism is different from that for the 70 and 60 kDa proteins.</p><p>The proteins were separated on two-dimensional gels to facilitate identification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Visual scanning of the autoradiogram showed that synthesis of at least 16 proteins was markedly elevated in bacterial cells exposed to LVFX compared with untreated cells. The spots numbered on the gel are proteins that could be identified by mass spectrometric analysis. Among these, heat shock proteins are identified as follows: ClpB (spot 1), DnaK (spot 2), GroEL (spot 3), HtpG (spot 4), HslU (spot 5) and GrpE (spot 6). Enhanced production of the small heat shock proteins GroES, IbpA, and IbpB was also observed when 12.5 % SDS-PAGE was used as the second dimension (results not shown). Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (spot 7) and phosphoglycerate kinase (spot 8) were also identified.</p><p>The 40 kDa protein showing the most marked induction in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> does not appear on the two-dimensional gel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We therefore fractionated the proteins from LVFX treated <italic>E. coli </italic>cells along with those from control cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the 40 kDa protein seems to be largely associated with high salt-soluble proteins (lanes 6 and 8). A portion of the high salt-soluble fraction was separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; the spot corresponding to the LVFX-induced 40 kDa protein was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis and identified as RecA. RecA is usually cytosolic in <italic>E. coli </italic>and binds to single-stranded regions of damaged DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Detection of a large amount of RecA protein in the high salt-soluble fraction suggests that when it is synthesized in abnormally large amounts, it aggregates with various denatured and misfolded proteins.</p><p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the expression of heat shock genes is positively regulated at the transcriptional level by the heat shock specific sigma subunit of RNA polymerase, &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>. In addition, the heat shock response is negatively autoregulated by the DnaK chaperone machine that interferes with the efficient binding of &#x003c3;<sup>32 </sup>to the RNA polymerase core, turning off the response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Heat-induced aggregation of proteins induces the expression of the heat shock regulon through the titration of the DnaK chaperone by the aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, in these experiments, the induction of the <italic>E. coli </italic>heat shock regulon could have been triggered by protein aggregates accumulated after incubation with LVFX.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli strains with mutations in heat shock genes</title><p>The heat shock proteins comprise chaperones such as the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, GroEL/GroES and IbpA/IbpB systems, and ATP-dependent proteases such as Lon, ClpXP and HslVU. Whereas the chaperones are abundantly synthesized, the levels of the proteases are relatively low even under inducing conditions. In these experiments, proteases were not present in sufficient amounts to identify by mass spectrometry in LVFX-treated cells. However, all the heat shock genes in one regulon under the control of &#x003c3;<sup>32 </sup>would be simultaneously induced in cells exposed to LVFX.</p><p>To examine the involvement of heat shock proteins in the susceptibility of <italic>E. coli </italic>to FQs, we constructed strains with mutations in various heat shock genes and then tested their susceptibility to LVFX (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Among the chaperone mutants, &#x00394;<italic>dnaK </italic>and <italic>groEL</italic><sup>- </sup>exhibited increased susceptibility. However, a mutation in the small chaperone, IbpAB, did not affect susceptibility. Among the protease mutants, &#x00394;<italic>clpP</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>clpX</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>clpA</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>hslVU </italic>and &#x00394;<italic>htrA </italic>all showed the same susceptibility to LVFX as the wild type. In contrast, &#x00394;<italic>lon </italic>showed a greatly increased susceptibility. This hypersusceptibility of the &#x00394;<italic>lon </italic>mutant was corroborated by providing a functional <italic>lon </italic>using a low copy-number-vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). The results suggest that the hypersensitivity of the strain to LVFX is largely due to the disruption of <italic>lon</italic>. &#x00394;<italic>lon </italic>showed a similarly increased sensitivity to other FQs such as ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and sitafloxacin (data not shown). As expected, a mutation in <italic>rpoH</italic>, which encodes &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>, also resulted in increased susceptibility of <italic>E. coli </italic>to LVFX.</p><p>Chaperones and proteases are essential for de novo folding and quality control of proteins, acting by preventing protein aggregation and by refolding or degrading misfolded proteins. Therefore, the increased susceptibility of the chaperone and <italic>lon </italic>mutants can partly be explained by the disruption of the quality control system in <italic>E. coli </italic>cytosol.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of sulA-disruption on the hypersusceptibility of the &#x00394;lon mutant to fluoroquinolones</title><p>The Lon protease degrades SulA, which inhibits separation by binding to FtsZ, a key cell division protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. SulA is a SOS response protein induced by DNA damage after UV-irradiation and quinolone-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We examined the possibility that the hypersensitivity of the &#x00394;<italic>lon </italic>mutant is due to the accumulation of SulA protein. The <italic>sulA </italic>gene was disrupted in both wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>lon</italic>-mutant cells and then the resultant double mutants were compared for susceptibility to LVFX. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, the hypersusceptibility of &#x00394;<italic>lon </italic>was suppressed by the subsequent disruption of <italic>sulA</italic>, suggesting that the increased sensitivity is due to the inhibition of cell division by abnormal accumulation of SulA. It therefore appears that in &#x00394;<italic>lon</italic>, depletion of the Lon protease and continuous induction of the SOS response in the presence of LVFX result in abnormally high levels of the cell division inhibitor SulA. Complementation analysis also indicates that continuous induction of SulA by FQs contributes to quinolone killing. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the &#x00394;<italic>sulA </italic>mutant is less sensitive to LVFX than the wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Moreover, disruption of <italic>lon </italic>did not affect the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics other than quinolones, such as ampicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin, polymixin-B or rifampicin (our unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of the lon mutation in fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants</title><p>Bacterial quinolone resistance is usually due to mutations in the genes for targets of these agents: DNA gyrase encoded by <italic>gyrA </italic>and <italic>gyrB</italic>, and topoisomerase IV encoded by <italic>parC </italic>and <italic>parE</italic>. In several species of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, decreased susceptibility or resistance to FQs is associated with specific point mutations in <italic>gyrA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. An additional mutation in <italic>parC </italic>results in greater resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We examined whether the &#x00394;<italic>lon </italic>mutation affects the resistance to LVFX in <italic>E. coli gyrA </italic>and <italic>parC </italic>mutants.</p><p>In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, strain CS5086 has a <italic>gyrA </italic>mutation (Ser83 to Leu). To construct a <italic>gyrA </italic>and <italic>parC </italic>double mutant, CS5086 was initially treated with mini F-<italic>parC1 </italic>(Gly78 to Asp, Val253 to Ile). Then the chromosomal <italic>parC </italic>gene of the resultant strain was replaced with <italic>parC</italic>::Cm by P1 transduction; <italic>lon </italic>was subsequently disrupted in both the <italic>gyrA </italic>and the <italic>gyrA</italic>, <italic>parC1 </italic>mutants. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, &#x00394;<italic>lon </italic>decreased the resistance of both <italic>gyrA </italic>and <italic>gyrA</italic>, <italic>parC1 </italic>to LVFX.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of recA mutation on susceptibility of E. coli to fluoroquinolone</title><p>Since one of the proteins strongly induced by LVFX is RecA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), the role of RecA in the bactericidal action of the agent was examined by susceptibility testing of a <italic>E. coli recA </italic>mutant along with the isogenic wild type. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> shows that the <italic>recA </italic>mutation increases the susceptibility of <italic>E. coli </italic>to LVFX. RecA positively regulates the SOS response, which includes amplification of RecA, UvrA/UvrB (excision repair enzyme), and SulA (cell division inhibitor). Although the continuous induction of the SOS response by quinolones is harmful to wild type cells, synthesis of RecA and UvrA/UvrB, which repair quinolone-induced DNA damage, are prerequisites for withstanding the bactericidal action of quinolones.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present results show that the DnaK and GroEL chaperones have moderate effects on the antimicrobial activity of FQs. These chaperones might contribute to quinolone resistance because they sequester the aggregates that accumulate in cells exposed to FQs. Lon protease markedly affects the bactericidal action of FQs, as indicated by the hypersusceptibility of the <italic>lon </italic>mutant. This increased susceptibility is corroborated by the effects of subsequent disruption of the gene encoding SulA. SulA protein is induced by the SOS response and degraded by Lon. Collectively, the results suggest that the hypersusceptibility of the <italic>lon </italic>mutant to FQs could be due to abnormal accumulation of SulA, which is depeleted by Lon, and the continuous induction of the SOS response.</p><p>FQs have contributed successfully to the treatment of various bacterial infections because of their broad-spectrum, potent antimicrobial activity and ease of oral administration. However, their widespread use and often misuse, coupled with emerging resistance, have gradually compromised their utility. The present work suggests that agents capable of inhibiting the Lon protease have potential for combination therapy with FQs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>Bacterial strains used are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.
