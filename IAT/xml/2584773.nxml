This paper seeks to better understand the role of protein&#x02013;protein interactions in this multitude of functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of an 11.5 day post coitum (dpc) mouse embryo cDNA library using the homeo-Prospero domain of Prox1 as bait. Computer modeling, cotransfection analysis and confocal immunolocalization were used to investigate the significance of one of the identified interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was identified as a Prox1 interacting protein. Prox1 interactions with PCNA require the PCNA interacting protein motif (PIP box), located in the Prospero domain of Prox1. Computer modeling of this interaction identified the apparent geometry of this interface which maintains the accessibility of Prox1 to DNA. Prox1 activated the chicken &#x003b2;B1-crystallin promoter in cotransfection tests as previously reported, while PCNA squelched this transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Since PCNA is expressed in the lens epithelium where Prox1 levels are low, while chicken &#x003b2;B1-crystallin expression activates in lens fibers where Prox1 expression is high and PCNA levels are low, these data suggest that Prox1-PCNA interactions may in part prevent the activation of &#x003b2;B1-crystallin expression in the lens epithelium.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prox1 is a transcription factor necessary for the development of diverse organs including the lens, retina, liver, pancreas, inner ear, and lymphatic endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Prox1 has been proposed to be a tumor suppressor in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] although it induces proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Upregulation of Prox1 expression induces the progression of colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>] and the invasiveness of Karposi&#x02019;s sarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>] while the overexpression of Prox1 in blood endothelial cells induced their conversion to a lymphatic endothelial phenotype associated with upregulation of cell proliferation markers including PCNA, cyclin E1 and E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. However in the lens, loss of Prox1 function led to down-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitors P27<italic><sup>KIP1</sup></italic> and P57<italic><sup>KIP2</sup></italic>and a loss of lens fiber cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Thus, it appears that Prox1 may function in both cell cycle arrest and cell cycle progression depending upon the cellular environment.</p><p>The carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain of Prox1 is well conserved within the animal kingdom and consists of an atypical homeodomain linked to a stretch of evolutionarily conserved amino acids denoted the Prospero domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>] although crystallographic studies of its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart, Prospero, suggest that the homeo- and Prospero domains fold into a single structural unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. The amino-terminus of Prox1 interacts with HDAC3 to mediate its function as a transcriptional repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Prox1 also has three nuclear receptor boxes (NR box) which can participate in Prox1 interactions with nuclear hormone receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. The subcellular localization of Prox1 has been proposed to be controlled by competition between a nuclear localization signal (NLS) located at the beginning of the amino-terminus and a nuclear export signal (NES) located in front of the homeodomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>].</p><p>Prox1 activates the transcription of the chicken &#x003b2;B1-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] and FGF receptor 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>] promoter via direct promoter interactions, although interaction of Prox1 with two of the three known binding sites in the &#x003b2;B1-crystallin promoter leads to transcriptional repression in cotransfection studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Prox1 also activates the mouse &#x003b3;F crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] and mouse cyclin E promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] although direct promoter interactions were not demonstrated. Prox1 serves as a transcriptional corepressor of the nuclear hormone receptors LRH-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], HNF4&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] and SF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] via interactions of these factors with the nuclear receptor boxes of Prox1. In addition, Prox1 can to function as a direct DNA binding transcriptional repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. These data demonstrate that Prox1 is a multifunctional transcription factor whose function is likely to be modulated by protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p><p>To identify additional Prox1 interacting proteins which affect Prox1 function, we created a yeast two-hybrid prey vector containing the evolutionarily conserved carboxyl-terminal homeo-Prospero domain of Prox1 and screened an 11.5 day post coitum (dpc) mouse embryo cDNA library. We identified 15 possible Prox1 interacting proteins including the cell cycle related protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA is best known as a sliding platform that stabilizes the interaction of other proteins with DNA during DNA replication and DNA repair and the coordination of these processes with the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Most reported interactions with PCNA are mediated via a conserved PCNA interacting protein motif (PIP box) found in PCNA interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Notably, such a motif is present in the Prospero domain of vertebrate Prox1. We found that Prox1 interacted with both the carboxyl-terminal domain and the IDCL (interdomain connecting loop) of PCNA and that mutation of the PIP box found in Prox1 diminished the interaction. In cotransfection studies, PCNA repressed Prox1 mediated activation of the &#x003b2;B1-crystallin promoter in transfection assays, indicating that PCNA negatively regulates Prox1 function. This is consistent with other reports that PCNA interacts with transcription factors and represses their transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Since PCNA is expressed in proliferating lens epithelial cells, while it is downregulated sharply early in lens fiber cell differentiation, it is possible that PCNA modulates Prox1 mediated fiber cell differentiation in lens epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid analysis</title><p>A yeast two-hybrid screen bait plasmid was constructed by cloning a PCR generated cDNA fragment corresponding to the homeo (HD) and Prospero (PD) domain (amino acids 547&#x02013;737), of human Prox1 into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGBKT7 (Clonech, Palo Alto, CA) to create fusion proteins between these Prox1 fragments and the DNA binding domain of yeast Gal4. Although this vector caused some autoactivation of the nutritional selection markers when transformed into yeast strain AH109, these yeast did not survive under high stringency selection. Similarly, yeast created by mating this strain with strain Y187 yeast harboring a vector expressing a fusion between the Gal4 activation domain and SV40 T-antigen also did not survive the high stringency selection, indicating that the autoactivation by Prox1 would not interfere with our screen (data not shown).</p><p>An 11 dpc mouse embryo oligo (dT) primed cDNA library cloned into the GAL4 activation domain (AD) vector pACT2 and pretransformed into yeast strain Y187 (1X 10<sup>6</sup> primary clones) was obtained from Clontech. Strain AH109 yeast containing the pGBKT7-Prox1 HDPD construct was mated with the library strain and the primary transformants transferred to screening plates (SD/-Leu/-His/-Ade/-Trp with added X-&#x003b1;-Gal) using the Matchmaker 3 high stringency screening protocol (Clontech). The phenotype of the positive colonies was confirmed by restreaking onto another high stringency plate and the activation domain plasmids from positive colonies were rescued and sequenced.</p><p>Prox1-Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion constructs consisting of either HD (amino acids 547&#x02013;642) alone or the PD (amino acid 638&#x02013;737) alone of Prox1 were generated by ligating PCR generated cDNA fragments into pGBKT7. Site directed mutants in the PIP box (amino acid 686 to 693) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>] of human Prox1 (amino acid 686 Q to E/A; amino acid 689 L to A; amino acid 692 F to A and amino acid 693 F to A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>] were created with the Quick Change site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the homeo-Prospero domain/pGBKT7 construct as a template. All constructs were sequence confirmed then transformed into yeast strain AH109.</p><p>The rescued AD/library plasmid containing PCNA was transformed into yeast strain Y187 which was then mated to yeast strain AH109 containing bait plasmids harboring either Prox1 constructs consisting of the HD/PD, HD, PD or HD/PD with PIP box mutations and transferred onto SD/-Leu/-Trp/X-&#x003b1;-Gal plates. The presence of PCNA-Prox1 interactions were tested by streaking the resulting colonies on both high and low stringency media and the relative strength of the interactions tested by &#x003b2;-Galactosidase assays using ONPG as substrate as described in the yeast protocols handbook (Clontech).</p><p>Mouse PCNA full length cDNA was synthesized by RT&#x02013;PCR using newborn mouse lens total RNA. All PCNA truncations were made by PCR using full length PCNA as a template, including the N+ (amino acids 1&#x02013;135); C+ (amino acids 115&#x02013;261) and C- (amino acid 135&#x02013;261). The products were digested with EcoR I and BamHI, and then ligated in frame into the pGADT7 vector (Clontech). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were then transformed into yeast strain Y187 and mated with AH109 containing the bait plasmids.</p></sec><sec><title>Constructs</title><p>The 3XPL2-&#x003b2;Actin CAT and -432/+30 pBasicCAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>] and CMV human Prox1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] expression vector were previously described. pCMV&#x003b2;GAL was purchased from Clontech.

The wildtype HDPD interacted with PCNA (2) and the mutants LF (3) and ELF (4) still had the ability to bind. In contrast, mutants LFF (5) and QLFF (6) could not survive on QDO plates suggesting that they did not interact with the carboxyl-terminus plus the IDCL of PCNA.

Notably, our prior Prox1 structural model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] predicts that the PIP box of Prox1 folds into a tight 3<sub>10</sub> helix consistent with the structure of other known PIP box containing PCNA interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. Thus, we tested whether Prox1-PCNA interactions are compatible with the structures of these proteins with the added requirement that the PIP box of Prox1 be contained within the interface region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). We also considered whether this interaction could take place without the IDCL, using only the carboxyl-terminus of the PCNA subunit since that was the original hit from the yeast two-hybrid screen. Both predicted models were subjected to a short energy minimization cycle (2,000 steps) using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amber.scripps.edu/">AMBER</ext-link>. The minimized models were then compared by their total and percent buried surface area.</p><fig id="f4" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Docking models of Prox1-PCNA interaction. <bold>A</bold>: Ribbon diagram of the complete trimeric PCNA structure (blue) docked to the homeo-Prospero domain of Prox1 (red).

However, although the absolute buried surface area is higher with trimeric PCNA/Prox1, it only corresponds to roughly 20% of the entire complex surface area; whereas, in the case of the carboxyl-terminal PCNA/Prox1 complex, nearly 28% of the entire surface area is buried. Our models do not explain why amino acids 135&#x02013;261 of PCNA interacted less efficiently with Prox1 than the original amino acids 167&#x02013;261 clone in yeast two-hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>), however, this may reflect destabilization of the chimeric protein structure compared to either the shorter or longer construct. Notably though, the predicted interaction between Prox1 and PCNA will preserve accessibility between Prox1 and DNA. Overall, these models support the idea that Prox1 interacts with PCNA via the PIP box.</p></sec><sec><title>PCNA and Prox1 colocalize in the lens epithelium and developing liver</title><p>To test whether PCNA-Prox1 interactions could be biologically relevant, immunolocalization for these proteins was performed on two known Prox1 dependent tissues, the lens and the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D-I</xref>).

Notably, in some cases such as the lens, Prox1 is necessary for cell cycle exit and the terminal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. In contrast, Prox1 is required for the proliferation of the lymphatic vasculature during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>] and overexpression of Prox1 is associated with elevated invasiveness of Karposi&#x02019;s sarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Further, Prox1 is required for cell proliferation of hepatoblasts during liver development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], but loss of Prox1 from hepatocytes is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] showing that Prox1 can play different roles at different developmental stages in a single organ system. Similarly, while Prox1 is accepted to function as a transcription factor, its roles are complex since it can function as a transcriptional corepressor of nuclear hormone receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] as well as a direct DNA binding transcriptional activator or repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. In fact, Prox1 repressive and activating sites have both even been detected in the promoter of a single gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].</p><sec><title>Prox1 interacts with PCNA through the PIP box</title><p>To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying these diverse functions of Prox1, we screened an 11.5 dpc mouse embryo yeast two-hybrid library with the carboxyl-terminus of Prox1 which includes the DNA binding domain and identified proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as a Prox1 interacting partner. PCNA is best known as a molecule essential for nuclear processes associated with the cell cycle including DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cycle control, and chromatin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. Native PCNA forms a homo-trimeric ring shaped complex with sixfold symmetry in which the outside surface is composed of &#x003b2;-sheets and parallel &#x003b1;-helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. PCNA in this structure can encircle double strand DNA and serves as a &#x0201c;sliding clamp&#x0201d; which stabilizes the interaction of DNA polymerases and other replication factors with DNA during replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. However, PCNA interacts with a wide variety of other proteins as well, including cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases, and various components of the DNA damage repair machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>].</p><p>Notably, most known PCNA protein partners interact with the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL, amino acids 119&#x02013;133) of PCNA via a conserved PCNA interacting signature sequence known as the PIP box although they make additional stabilizing contacts outside of this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Consistent with this, we identified a consensus PIP box in the Prospero domain of Prox1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>) which was required for interactions between the homeo/Prospero domain of Prox1 and PCNA. Computer modeling found a good geometric fit between this region of Prox1 and PCNA, with most of the contacts detected between the PIP box of Prox1 and the IDCL/carboxyl-terminus of PCNA. Notably though, the original PCNA clone identified in our yeast two hybrid screen lacks the IDCL domain and interacts with Prox1 more avidly than the carboxyl-terminus with the IDCL included. Our modeling results suggest that Prox1 interactions with trimeric PCNA in the absence of DNA would occur via the IDCL. A notable feature of the PIP-box is that it folds into a tight 3<sub>10</sub> helix with hydrophobic residues facing the surface while the IDCL of PCNA presents a rather linear extension of non-polar residues. These features make it possible for PCNA interacting proteins to bind PCNA by inserting this hydrophobic key into the non-polar pocket formed by the IDCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. However, it has been reported that some proteins interact with the IDCL of PCNA in the absence of DNA while they interact primarily with the C-terminus of PCNA when PCNA encircles double strand DNA due to conformation changes in PCNA upon DNA interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>].</p><p>Recently it has been reported that PCNA may also play roles in transcription as well as DNA replication/repair. PCNA interacts with P300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] and PCNA interactions with HDAC1 promote chromatin hypoacetylation and transcriptional repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>]. PCNA also interacts directly with the DNA binding domain of the retinoic acid receptor and represses its transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>] while PCNA interactions with unliganded estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;) result in stabilized ER&#x003b1; DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Here we showed that PCNA can also repress Prox1 mediated activation of both the full length chicken &#x003b2;B1-crystallin and the Prox1 activatable element, OL2, in transfection assays. However, PCNA did not significantly affect Prox1 mediated repression of the &#x02212;290 and &#x02212;220 elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] of the chicken &#x003b2;B1-crystalin promoter (data not shown). These data suggested that PCNA can modulate Prox1 function as a transcriptional activator but not its repressive roles. Interestingly, it was previously reported that Prox1 overexpression in blood vessel endothelial cells upregulates the expression of PCNA and other cell cycle related genes leading to phenotypic conversions of these cells to lymphatic endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. This suggests that in some systems Prox1 and PCNA could act in a feedback loop in which Prox1 activates PCNA expression then the elevated levels of PCNA repress Prox1 mediated transcriptional activation.</p><p>The lens is composed of two cell types, the anterior epithelial cells and the posterior fiber cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. In the adult lens, the central portion of the lens epithelium does not usually proliferate except in response to injury, while the equatorial epithelial cells continue to divide throughout life, albeit slowly. In contrast, lens fiber cells do not divide and in most circumstances are incapable of mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>. Prox1 is found in the nuclei of all lens cells, although its levels are relatively higher in the lens fibers which require Prox1 for their differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, PCNA is detected throughout the lens epithelium, even in cells unlikely to be actively cycling while its levels decrease sharply as lens fiber cells begin to differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). It should be emphasized that in the adult lens, PCNA is detected in epithelial cells unlikely to be progressing robustly through the cell cycle suggesting that it is performing other functions besides acting as a sliding clamp for DNA polymerase. The presence of PCNA in these cells may be due to both its long half life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>] and a function in transcriptional control.</p><p>Overall, our data suggest that PCNA binding to Prox1 can diminish Prox1&#x02019;s ability to function as a transcriptional activator. We have previously proposed that Prox1 interactions with the high affinity Prox1 binding sites in the chicken &#x003b2;B1-crystallin promoter can lead to Prox1 mediated repression of this gene when Prox1 is present at low levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. In contrast, Prox1 interactions with the lower affinity sites present in the same promoter results in transcriptional activation of the crystallin gene as Prox1 levels increase during lens fiber cell differentiation. The present data suggest that PCNA-Prox1 interactions in the lens epithelium could further block the Prox1 present in the lens epithelium from inappropriately driving lens fiber cell differentiation. Then, as PCNA levels decrease during early fiber cell differentiation, this transcriptional attenuation would be relieved and Prox1 would be capable of driving the formation of lens fiber cells.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Abby Grabitz, University of Delaware for technical support.
