We constructed a functional Fus2p&#x02013;green fluorescent protein (GFP), which exhibits highly dynamic localization patterns in pheromone-responding cells (shmoos): diffuse nuclear, mobile cytoplasmic dots and stable cortical patches concentrated at the shmoo tip. In mitotic cells, Fus2p-GFP is nuclear but becomes cytoplasmic as cells form shmoos, dependent on the Fus3p protein kinase and high levels of pheromone signaling. The rapid cytoplasmic movement of Fus2p-GFP dots requires Rvs161p and polymerized actin and is aberrant in mutants with compromised actin organization, which suggests that the Fus2p dots are transported along actin cables, possibly in association with vesicles. Maintenance of Fus2p-GFP patches at the shmoo tip cortex is jointly dependent on actin and a membrane protein, Fus1p, which suggests that Fus1p is an anchor for Fus2p. In zygotes, Fus2p-GFP forms a dilating ring at the cell junction, returning to the nucleus at the completion of cell fusion.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; IP, immunoprecipitation; lat-A, latrunculin-A; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ZCF, zone of cell fusion.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Haploid cells of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> conjugate to form diploid cells capable of entering meiosis. The two haploid mating types (<italic>MAT</italic>a and <italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;) detect each others' peptide pheromones (a-factor or &#x003b1;-factor) via G protein&#x02013;coupled cell surface receptors, which activate an intracellular mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sprague et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dohlman and Thorner, 2001</xref>). The downstream MAP-kinase Fus3p regulates at least three different pathways required for efficient mating, including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle arrest, and polarized growth. Polarized growth is directed toward the highest pheromone concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barkai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Madden and Snyder, 1998</xref>). After mating partners make contact, they adhere stably, forming a prezygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lipke and Kurjan, 1992</xref>). Cell fusion entails removal of the intervening cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trueheart et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsh and Rose, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>) and subsequent fusion of the plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heiman and Walter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2004</xref>) to produce a zygote with a common cytoplasm. As zygotes mature, cell wall remnants are removed, expanding the diameter of the zone of cell fusion (ZCF) and forming a smooth intracellular margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>). After cell fusion, nuclei are pulled together by microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meluh and Rose, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molk et al., 2006</xref>) and the nuclear envelopes fuse to form a diploid nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kurihara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melloy et al., 2007</xref>). The newly formed diploid cells then resume mitotic cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsh and Rose, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Cell fusion remains a poorly understood process. Several genes are known to play a role in cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White and Rose, 2001</xref>), which fall into five broad classes: (1) adhesion (e.g., <italic>FIG2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), (2) actin organization and cell polarization (e.g., <italic>BNI1</italic>, <italic>PEA2</italic>,and <italic>SPA2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chenevert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valtz and Herskowitz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evangelista et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matheos et al., 2004</xref>), (3) membrane fusion (e.g., <italic>PRM1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heiman and Walter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2004</xref>), (4) negative regulation (e.g., <italic>PKC1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Philips and Herskowitz, 1997</xref>), and (5) cell wall degradation at the ZCF (e.g., <italic>FUS2</italic>, <italic>RVS161</italic>, and <italic>LRG1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elion et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitch et al., 2004</xref>). Several of these genes also affect the formation of a pheromone-induced low-affinity calcium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muller et al., 2003</xref>). The precise mechanism of cell fusion remains unclear and little is known about how these processes are coordinated.</p><p>Based on genetic criteria, Fus1p and Fus2p are thought to act in separate pathways; double mutants show a significantly stronger defect than single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trueheart et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elion et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>). Electron microscopy suggested that Fus1p and Fus2p act at different stages of cell fusion (before and after vesicle clustering at the ZCF, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>). Other data suggest that the two proteins interact or have partially overlapping functions; overexpression of either protein partially suppresses deletion of the other gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trueheart et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>) and a two-hybrid study identified Fus1p and Fus2p as interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Rvs161p and Fus2p function together at the same stage of cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>). The defect of <italic>fus2 rvs161</italic> double mutants is not more severe than the single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>), and <italic>rvs161</italic> mutant cell fusion defects are identical to <italic>fus2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>). Overexpression of Fus2p partially suppresses the requirement for Rvs161p but not vice versa, indicating that Rvs161p likely assists Fus2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>). Fus2p and Rvs161p have been shown to interact physically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>) and in two-hybrid studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Talarek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Germann et al., 2005</xref>), and Fus2p stability depends on Rvs161p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Rvs161p consists of only a BAR domain, a conserved three-helix bundle shared with amphiphysins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peter et al., 2004</xref>). BAR domains dimerize to form crescent-shaped membrane-binding domains that preferentially bind to curved membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peter et al., 2004</xref>). Rvs161p interacts with a second BAR domain protein, Rvs167p, to form an obligate heterodimer that binds lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friesen et al., 2006</xref>). Although both proteins are required for endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Munn et al., 1995</xref>), only mutations in <italic>RVS161</italic> cause a strong defect in cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friesen et al., 2006</xref>). Alleles of <italic>RVS161</italic> have been identified that specifically effect either endocytosis or cell fusion, indicating that the two functions are independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>). How Rvs161p could mediate different functions has remained unclear.</p><p>Rvs161p localizes to the tip of the shmoo and the ZCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>). A nonfunctional Fus2p-lacZ hybrid was found in a cytoplasmic aggregate in shmoos, although some hybrid protein localized near the ZCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elion et al., 1995</xref>). To reconcile this apparent conflict, we constructed a fully functional Fus2p-GFP hybrid using a novel internal tagging approach. Like Rvs161p, functional Fus2p-GFP localized to the tip of the shmoo and to the ZCF. However, live-cell observations revealed that Fus2p localization is both highly dynamic and subject to complex regulation. Remarkably, in zygotes, Fus2p-GFP localized to an expanding ring at the cell fusion junction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Localization of Fus2p-GFP in wild-type cells</title><p><italic>FUS2</italic> encodes a 677-residue, 79-kD protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), including a region (residues 116&#x02013;327) that shares a homology with the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho-like GTPases (Rho-GEF, P &#x0003d; 1.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;35</sup>, analyzed by SMART; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Letunic et al., 2006</xref>).

In both cases, the resulting proteins were only partially functional (7 and 29% of wild-type levels of mating, respectively). Immunofluorescent microscopy showed two different patterns of localization in shmoos; the N-terminally tagged protein localized to the shmoo-tip and the C-terminally tagged protein localized to the nucleus (unpublished data). However, both proteins localized to the ZCF in prezygotes. Both termini are strongly conserved in other yeasts, which suggests that these regions are required for normal function. To identify functional sites to tag Fus2p, we compared the <italic>FUS2</italic> sequence of closely related yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cliften et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kellis et al., 2003</xref>) to identify regions that were especially nonconserved and therefore likely to reside in nonessential surface loops. Two regions were chosen for internal epitope tagging (residues 104&#x02013;109 and 410&#x02013;419). In both cases, the FLAG-tagged proteins were fully functional (100% of wild-type mating efficiency) and localized to the shmoo tip and ZCF (unpublished data).</p><p>To observe Fus2p localization in live cells, we used the upstream internal site to insert GFP. Using a sensitive replica-plate mating assay to a <italic>fus1 fus2</italic> partner, the Fus2p-GFP&#x02013;tagged protein supported mating as well as either the Fus2p-FLAG construct or untagged wild-type Fus2p (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In quantitative matings with a <italic>fus1 fus2</italic> partner, the Fus2p-FLAG construct supported mating as well as wild-type Fus2p, and Fus2p-GFP retained at least 90% of wild-type function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><p>To observe the dynamic behavior of Fus2p-GFP, cells were first treated with &#x003b1;-factor to induce expression and allow cells to progress into the mating pathway. In cells that had arrested their cell cycle and formed shmoos, Fus2p-GFP exhibited three general types of localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>): diffuse in the nucleus, cytoplasmic dots, and cortical patches. Many of the cytoplasmic dots moved rapidly from the cell body to the shmoo tip, following roughly linear tracks at a mean velocity of 0.38 &#x000b1; 0.19 &#x003bc;m/s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 135, maximal velocity &#x0003d; 0.99 &#x003bc;m/s). A few dots moved away from the shmoo tip and others exhibited random short-range movements. Cortical patches at or near the shmoo tip were very stable, showing no movement and no decrease in intensity over the course of the observation. Patches appearing at other cortical sites were not stable and disappeared over time.</p><p>To determine the order at which each localization pattern appeared, mitotic cells were treated with pheromone and observed by time-lapse microscopy at 10-min intervals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). In cells that had not completed mitosis, faint Fus2p-GFP fluorescence was observed in the nucleus (20&#x02013;60 min). After cells completed mitosis, Fus2p-GFP was observed at the nascent shmoo tip (80 min). As the shmoo became more pronounced, Fus2p-GFP fluorescence at the tip increased, and cytoplasmic dots were observed (100 min). The later appearance of dots may reflect ectopic localization as cortical sites become saturated or the early low level of expression may have precluded detection. Regardless, these results show that Fus2p-GFP initially localizes to the nucleus and localizes to cytoplasmic sites after cells exit mitosis and enter the mating pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Fus2p nuclear localization is regulated by the mating response</title><p><italic>FUS2</italic> expression is pheromone regulated; in vegetative cells, <italic>FUS2</italic> mRNA is virtually undetectable, increasing &#x0003e;32-fold after pheromone treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roberts et al., 2000</xref>). To eliminate expression effects on localization studies, <italic>FUS2-GFP</italic> was placed under the control of the inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. In vegetative cells in which <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-FUS2-GFP</italic> was expressed by induction with galactose, Fus2p-GFP accumulated in the nucleus at all stages of the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). When cells expressing <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-FUS2-GFP</italic> were treated with &#x003b1;-factor, Fus2p-GFP stayed in the nucleus until the completion of mitosis and subsequently localized to the shmoo tip (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Thus, the export of Fus2p from the nucleus depends on signals from the pheromone response pathway, possibly in coordination with cell cycle control.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Fus2p localization is regulated by the mating response.</bold> (A) Mitotically expressed Fus2p-GFP localizes to the nucleus at all stages of mitotic growth.

To distinguish between these two possibilities, vegetative <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-FUS2-GFP</italic> was induced with galactose and transcription was then repressed by the addition of glucose. The mRNA was allowed to decay (10, 20, and 30 min), after which &#x003b1;-factor was added to induce the mating pathway for 1.5 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). For all periods of glucose repression, Fus2p-GFP localized to the shmoo tip and no Fus2p-GFP localized to the nucleus. The level of fluorescence at the shmoo tip was similar for all time points, indicating that residual <italic>FUS2-GFP</italic> mRNA did not make a substantial contribution to the signal. In cells where expression was maintained by continued presence of galactose, Fus2p-GFP stayed nuclear in the absence of pheromone. When pheromone was added to these cells, Fus2p-GFP localized to the shmoo tip and cytoplasmic dots. The signal at the shmoo tip was significantly stronger than when glucose was present, as expected for continued synthesis after pheromone addition. The results strongly suggest that nuclear Fus2p-GFP exits the nucleus and localizes to the shmoo tip in response to pheromone signaling.</p><p>Yeast cells exhibit a complex dose response to pheromone; 10&#x02013;100-fold higher levels are required for shmoo formation compared with cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore, 1983</xref>). To determine whether Fus2p relocalization is simply a consequence of cell cycle arrest, cells containing <italic>FUS2-GFP</italic> expressed from its normal promoter were treated with either standard (6 &#x003bc;M) or low (0.6 &#x003bc;M) levels of &#x003b1;-factor. At low pheromone levels, cells arrested but did not polarize to form shmoos, and low levels of Fus2p-GFP could be detected in the nucleus, confirming that pheromone induction had occurred. However, the Fus2p-GFP remained in the nucleus and did not localize to the cell cortex during the experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). In contrast, when cells were treated with high levels of pheromone, cells began to polarize soon after completing mitosis, and Fus2p-GFP localized to the tip of the shmoo and to cytoplasmic dots (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Thus, relocalization of Fus2p-GFP from the nucleus to the site of polarized growth requires high levels of pheromone beyond those sufficient for its transcriptional induction and cell cycle arrest.</p><p>The pheromone response signal is chiefly transmitted by activation of the MAP kinase Fus3p. The <italic>fus3</italic>&#x00394; mutants are defective for cell fusion, in part because of a defect in cell polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matheos et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>fus3</italic>&#x00394; mutants respond transcriptionally to pheromone due to the presence of a second partially redundant MAP kinase, Kss1p. To distinguish the transcriptional response from other aspects of pheromone signaling, we examined a <italic>fus3</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Fus2p-GFP localized at the shmoo tip in 97% of wild-type cells treated with &#x003b1;-factor; it was retained in the nucleus in only 1% of cells.

When initially expressed in mitotic cells exposed to pheromone, Fus2p localizes to the nucleus. Upon cell cycle completion, and dependent on high levels of pheromone signaling, Fus2p exits the nucleus and complexes with the amphiphysin homologue Rvs161p. Cytoplasmic Fus2p&#x02013;Rvs161p is transported along actin cables and localizes to the shmoo tip cortex. The Fus2p dots may represent secretory vesicles, given the known association of Rvs161p with membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friesen et al., 2006</xref>). Fus2p&#x02013;Rvs161p would be anchored at the cortex, dependent on actin and an integral membrane protein, Fus1p. Based upon the presence of a Rho-GEF domain, we hypothesize that cortical Fus2p regulates a Rho-type G protein. Given the requirement for Fus2p&#x02013;Rvs161p to remove the intervening cell walls, we speculate that activation of a Rho protein would lead to fusion of secretory vesicles bearing cell wall&#x02013;degrading enzymes. After cell fusion, Fus2p&#x02013;Rvs161p would remain associated with remnant cell walls, ultimately returning to the nucleus as cells reenter the mitotic cycle.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>A model for the role of Fus2p in cell fusion.</bold> Cytoplasmic Fus2p associates with Rvs161p and attaches to vesicles (ves) as it is transported to the shmoo tip along actin cables by a myosin (myo). Fus2p/Rvs161p would be tethered to the cortex by Fus1p. Fus2p then acts as a Rho-GEF, activating a putative Rho-GTPase to trigger vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. Cell wall (cw) hydrolytic enzymes, carried by the vesicles, would be released into the extracellular space to degrade the intervening cell wall, allowing plasma membranes (pm) to fuse in subsequent steps.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810697f08"></graphic></fig><p>Given its function in cell fusion, the initial nuclear localization of Fus2p was surprising. However, regulation of Fus2p's localization may be required for proper coordination of mating with respect to mitosis. Fus2p interacts with Rvs161p, which has mitotic functions in the cell unrelated to cell fusion (e.g., actin organization and endocytosis). Premature interaction with Fus2p might sequester Rvs161p and interfere with its mitotic functions. Similarly, we expect that Fus2p's GEF domain regulates one of the six Rho proteins in yeast. The Rho proteins have critical roles in yeast mitosis and inappropriate activation would likely be deleterious. Therefore, nuclear localization may prevent interference with the completion of mitosis. Similarly, Fus2p relocalization to the nucleus after cell fusion would prevent interference with the next cell cycle.</p><p>The movement and localization of cytoplasmic Fus2p depended on interaction with the amphiphysin homologue Rvs161p. Most BAR domain proteins contain protein interaction domains and/or G protein regulatory domains (e.g., Rho-GEF, Rho-GAP, or Arf-GAP), which suggests that they often have roles in signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peter et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, Rvs161p consists solely of a BAR domain. The mitotic association of Rvs161p with Rvs167p provides an SH3 domain and functions related to endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Munn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Talarek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friesen et al., 2006</xref>). The association with Fus2p provides a putative Rho-GEF domain with functions specific to cell fusion. From this perspective, the Fus2p&#x02013;Rvs161p complex would be similar to a typical BAR domain protein, except that the domains have been split into two proteins to allow greater regulatory flexibility.</p><p>The interaction of Fus2p with Rvs161p suggests that Fus2p would be associated with membranes. Indeed, the behavior of Fus2p-GFP closely parallels that of vesicles at the ZCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>). In wild-type prezygotes, both Fus2p-GFP and the vesicles were initially restricted to a small subregion of the ZCF (0.5 and 0.73 &#x003bc;m in diameter, respectively). Mutations causing dispersal of the vesicles (<italic>pea2</italic> and <italic>spa2</italic>) resulted in broader zones of Fus2p localization. Similarly, in <italic>fus1</italic> mutants, vesicles were rare at the ZCF and Fus2p-GFP was significantly less persistent.</p><p>Vesicles also cluster around the remnant cell walls that persist after cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melloy et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with localization to vesicles, Fus2p-GFP localizes to a ring that forms, dilates, and disappears after cell fusion. The ring may represent a site where Fus2p&#x02013;Rvs161p helps to remove residual cell wall remnants; a feature of <italic>fus2</italic> and <italic>rvs161</italic> mutants is the failure to remove cell wall remnants even when cell fusion occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Fus2p-GFP persisted at the ZCF ring even as it began to accumulate in the nucleus at the end of cell fusion. The regulatory signals that determine cortical versus nuclear localization are unclear. Perhaps Fus2p&#x02013;Rvs161p binds to the highly curved membrane at the remnant cell wall by virtue of the BAR domain. Removal of remnant cell wall and smoothing of the plasma membrane would then erase the signal for localization. Alternatively, the loss of cortical localization may reflect mating or cell cycle&#x02013;dependent modification of Fus2p or interacting proteins.</p><p>Localization of Fus2p in shmoos was dependent on both polymerized actin and a pheromone-induced membrane protein, Fus1p. The requirement for actin may arise through multiple pathways. Mutations that affect cell polarity (<italic>bni1</italic>, <italic>pea2</italic>, and <italic>spa2</italic>) cause defects in actin cable assembly and thereby lead to defects in vesicular traffic and Fus1p localization. Accordingly, in these mutants, Fus2p moved randomly throughout the cell and also failed to form stable cortical patches.</p><p>Lat-A treatment clearly showed a requirement for polymerized actin in Fus2p transport. Only in the context of a <italic>fus1</italic> mutation was actin also seen to be required for Fus2p's localization at the shmoo tip. In the absence of Fus1p, actin-dependent transport may suffice to concentrate Fus2p at the shmoo tip. Alternatively, additional actin-dependent interactions may help stabilize the cortical localization.</p><p>Electron microscopy suggested that Fus1p and Fus2p act at different steps in cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>); <italic>fus1</italic>&#x00394; mutants show fewer, more dispersed vesicles, and <italic>fus2</italic>&#x00394; mutants showed wild-type vesicle clustering. These results suggested that Fus1p acts before vesicle clustering and that Fus2p acts later, possibly affecting vesicle fusion. Clearly, the morphology of the <italic>fus1</italic> mutants would have obscured evidence for additional downstream functions.</p><p>The dependence of Fus2p localization on Fus1p is consistent with genetic data showing both independent and partially overlapping functions. Overexpression of Fus2p might partially suppress the requirement for Fus1p by increasing Fus2p's cortical concentration, independent of anchoring. Overexpression of Fus1p might partially suppress <italic>fus2</italic> mutations by influencing the localization or function of an alternate mitotic Rho-GEF protein. The possibility that other Rho-GEF proteins substitute for Fus2p is supported by the fact that high-copy Bem1p, a scaffolding protein that interacts with Cdc24p (a GEF for Cdc42p), also suppresses <italic>fus2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitch et al., 2004</xref>). Fus2p dependence on Fus1p is also consistent with two-hybrid data for their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>). Collectively, these results support a model in which Fus2p is anchored at the shmoo tip by Fus1p but in which each protein has additional functions.</p><p>Remarkably, polarity mutants unable to localize Fus2p-GFP to the shmoo tip were able to localize it to the ZCF in prezygotes, which suggests that there is additional polarizing information in prezygotes. One major difference between shmoos and prezygotes is the way that pheromone is presented. Shmoos are formed by exposure to high levels of isotropic pheromone and polarize toward the preexisting bud site. Mating cells are exposed to a pheromone gradient and polarize toward the mating partner. Thus, conjugating cells receive positional information from the pheromone gradient, which is not available to cells in isotropic pheromone. Consistent with this view, the cell polarity mutants (<italic>bni1</italic>, <italic>spa2</italic>, and <italic>pea2</italic>) were profoundly defective for mating when their pheromone receptors were saturated (default pathway) but showed much fewer severe defects in normal mating conditions, where cells respond to pheromone gradients (chemotropic pathway; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorer et al., 1997</xref>). Hence, Fus2p provides a molecular marker whose localization behavior is acutely sensitive to polarization during chemotropic mating. Note that Fus2p-GFP localization at the ZCF was significantly less stable in these mutants, which is consistent with roles for Bni1p, Pea2p, and Spa2 in the maintenance of Fus2p localization and/or cell polarization.</p><p>The pattern of Fus2p-GFP localization in zygotes, forming a ring at a site of localized secretion where cells have formed a tight adhesion, is remarkably similar to metazoan cell junctions, such as the T cell and neuronal synapses. At these sites, adhesion molecules also form rings around sites of directed secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dustin and Colman, 2002</xref>). The similarity may represent a fundamental solution to the problem of how two cells engage in intimate communication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>General yeast techniques</title><p>Yeast media and general techniques used were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rose et al., 1990</xref>).

The three PCR products were transformed along with RS416, cut with BamHI into MY1817, and ligated by in vivo recombination.</p></sec><sec><title>Mating assays</title><p>Limited plate matings were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gammie et al., 1998</xref>). In brief, patches of cells were replica-printed to yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YEPD) plates containing lawns of the opposite mating type. The mating plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0; for 4 h followed by replica printing to the appropriate media to select for diploids.</p><p>Quantitative mating assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rose et al., 1990</xref>). In brief, overnight cultures were diluted to early log phase and grown 2&#x02013;4 h. 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells of each mating type were combined and concentrated on 2.5-cm<sup>2</sup> nitrocellulose filter discs (Millipore). The filters were placed onto either a YEPD or synthetic complete (SC) plate and the cells were allowed to mate for 4 h at 30&#x000b0;.</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy</title><p>For immunofluorescent imaging, exponentially growing cells or cells treated with pheromone were fixed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>). In brief, cells were incubated for 1 h in 4% formaldehyde and washed with PBS. Cells were spheroplasted with 25 &#x003bc;g/ml Zymolyase 100,000 T (MP Biomedicals) for 30 min at 30&#x000b0;. Anti-FLAG antibody was used at 1:6,000 dilutions (Sigma-Aldrich) and Alexa-conjugated anti&#x02013;mouse secondary antibodies were used at 1:500 dilutions (Invitrogen).</p><p>For live-cell imaging of GFP-tagged proteins, aliquots of cells were spread onto an agar pad containing the appropriate media with or without &#x003b1;-factor. For time-course experiments observing Fus2p-GFP, cells were grown to early exponential phase, treated with pheromone for various times, and spread on the surface of agar pads containing SC-URA, pH 3.5, &#x0002b; &#x003b1;-factor. All cells were visualized at 23&#x000b0; using a deconvolution microscope (DeltaVision; Applied Precision, LLC) based on a TE200 (Nikon) using a 100&#x000d7; NA 1.4 objective (Nikon), a 50-W Hg burner, and a Cool Snap ER charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific). Excitation was attenuated with 50% neutral density filter, 0.2-s exposures, and 2 &#x000d7; 2 binning.</p><p>For time-lapse studies after the induction of Fus2p-GFP from t &#x0003d; 0, early logarithmic phase cells were harvested and treated with 6 &#x003bc;M &#x003b1;-factor and immediately spread on agar pads containing SC-URA, pH 3.5, &#x0002b; 6 &#x003bc;M &#x003b1;-factor. Images were acquired using a stack of 10 sections, spaced every 0.5 &#x003bc;m and taken at 10-min intervals. For short time-course experiments designed to follow the rapid movement of the Fus2p-GFP dots, cells were induced with 6 &#x003bc;M &#x003b1;-factor for 1.5 h, harvested, and placed on an agar pad containing SC-URA, pH3.5, &#x0002b; 6 &#x003bc;M &#x003b1;-factor. Images were acquired in a similar way except that the image stack contained only three sections, spaced 0.5 &#x003bc;m apart, and taken at 1.5-s intervals. For experiments observing prezygotes, strains were mated on filters as stated in the Mating assays section for 4 h, lightly sonicated, and placed on an agar pad made from SC media. Images were acquired at 5- or 10-min time intervals.</p><p>Images were deconvolved and collapsed using a maximum intensity algorithm (SoftWorx, Applied Precision, LLC). Distance and intensity measurements were made on collapsed images using SoftWorx. Statistical analysis used a Student's <italic>t</italic> test for single group comparisons. For multiple comparisons, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test was used for all pairwise comparisons as implemented in KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). For publication purposes, brightness and contrast of images was enhanced using linear filters in SoftWorx and/or Photoshop CS2 (Adobe).</p></sec><sec><title>IPs and Western blotting</title><p>IPs were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>), with modifications. A 100-ml culture grown to early log phase was induced with 6 &#x003bc;M of &#x003b1;-factor for 90 min. Cells were collected, washed once with breaking buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100), and resuspended in 1 ml of breaking buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (5 &#x003bc;g/ml chymotrypsin, 5 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, 5 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin, 5 &#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM PMSF). Cells were broken by vortexing with glass beads for 1 min followed by 1 min on ice, repeated five times. The extract was twice cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. Samples were brought to 1 ml and NaCl was adjusted to 150 mM. Fus2p-FLAG was immunoprecipitated by the addition of 30 &#x003bc;l of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) prepared by washing once with H<sub>2</sub>O and three times with breaking buffer. Rvs167p-3xHA was immunoprecipitated by the addition of 40 &#x003bc;l monoclonal anti-HA agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) prepared like the anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. Anti-FLAG and anti-HA IPs were performed for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C, and the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer.</p><p>Fus2p-GFP was immunoprecipitated by the addition of 60 &#x003bc;l of Dynabeads (Invitrogen) washed and conjugated with 40 &#x003bc;l anti-GFP (Sigma-Aldrich). The conjugated mixture was added to extracts, anti-GFP IPs were performed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer.</p><p>After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected using anti-FLAG M2 (Roche) at 1:5,000, anti-GFP at 1:250, or a crude anti-Rvs161p polyclonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brizzio et al., 1998</xref>) at 1:1,000. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) were used to detect primary antibodies and were detected by chemiluminescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Lat-A treatment</title><p>Treatment with lat-A (Invitrogen) was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller et al., 1999</xref>). In brief, pheromone-induced cells (described in the Microscopy section) were concentrated 50-fold and treated with 200 &#x003bc;M lat-A for 10 min; control cells were treated with 2% DMSO. For experiments with live cells, 7 &#x003bc;l of lat-A&#x02013;treated cells were placed on glass slide with an agar pad containing SC-URA, pH 3.5, &#x0002b; 200 &#x003bc;M lat-A &#x0002b; 6 &#x003bc;M &#x003b1;-factor and imaged immediately by fluorescent microscopy. In experiments with fixed cells, the lat-A&#x02013;treated cultures were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. To stain actin, cells were then resuspended in 50 &#x003bc;l of PBS and treated with 25 &#x003bc;l of Texas red&#x02013;phalloidin (0.2 U/&#x003bc;l; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were washed in PBS and examined by fluorescence microscopy as described in the Microscopy section for fixed cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Nocodazole treatment</title><p>Pheromone-induced cells were concentrated 10-fold and treated with 15 &#x003bc;g/ml nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich), then diluted 100-fold from a 1.5-mg/ml stock in DMSO for 10 min at room temperature; control cells were treated with 1% DMSO. For experiments with live cells, 7 &#x003bc;l of nocodazole-treated cells were placed on a glass slide with an agar pad containing SC-URA, pH 3.5, &#x0002b; 15 &#x003bc;g/ml nocodazole &#x0002b; 6 &#x003bc;M &#x003b1;-factor and examined by fluorescent microscopy. To visualize microtubules by indirect immunofluorescence, cells were prepared and processed for immunofluorescent microscopy as described in the Microscopy section, except that cells were fixed for only 10 min at 23&#x000b0; with 4% formaldehyde. An anti-tubulin antibody, Yol1/34 (Morphosys), was used at 1:10 dilution in 10 mg/ml PBS-BSA. Anti&#x02013;rat antibody conjugated to Alexa 647 (Invitrogen) was used at a dilution of 1:500. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 &#x003bc;g/ml for 5 min at room temperature.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Alison Gammie for the suggestion of tagging <italic>FUS2</italic> internally.
