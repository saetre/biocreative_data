They can bind to nucleic acids, stabilize membrane and stimulate activity of several enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Despite the proved necessity of intracellular polyamine for optimal cellular growth, polyamine accumulation can lead to inhibition of cellular growth and protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Two major metabolic routes of polyamines breakdown have been described, one for the free bases <italic>via </italic>&#x00394;<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline (4-aminobutyraldehyde) and the other <italic>via </italic>N-acetyl derivatives. Acetylation pathway serves to prevent polyamine toxicity in prokaryotes and eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Spermidine and spermine are acetylated and further oxidized by polyamine oxidase or either deacetylated or excreted from the cell. Acetyltransferase forming exclusively of <italic>N</italic>-acetylspermidine has been described in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but neither spermidine-deacetylating activity nor <italic>N</italic>-acetylspermidine oxidase activity has been detected, suggesting that the <italic>N</italic>-acetylspermidine is excreted or kept in the inert acetylated form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the aminotransferase pathway of polyamine degradation, amino groups are converted from polycations to electron acceptors. Polyamine aminotransferase activity was found in some microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the case of putrescine, the resulting &#x00394;<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline is an intermediate product of 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The putrescine:2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) aminotransferase enzyme (PATase, EC 2.6.1.29) of <italic>E. coli </italic>was partially purified from the mutant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and characterized. The synthesis of putrescine aminotransferase is controlled by catabolite repression and nitrogen availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. But the corresponding gene remains to be identified. It was speculated that <italic>E. coli </italic>K12 <italic>ygjG </italic>gene (b3073, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) specifies the &#x003c9;-aminotransferase which either removes the amino groups from compounds with terminal primary amines, or adds amino groups to compounds with an aldehyde group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Putrescine and compounds metabolized to putrescine activate <italic>ygjG </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], which suggests a possible role in putrescine catabolism. To elucidate YgjG biochemical functions, we have cloned the <italic>ygjG </italic>gene, expressed, purified an active recombinant protein and investigated some molecular and biochemical properties of the YgjG enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cloning and characterization of the 5'-flanking region of the <italic>ygjG </italic>gene</title><p>The 1.8-kbp DNA fragment from <italic>E. coli </italic>K12 genomic DNA including <italic>ygjG </italic>and <italic>aer</italic>-<italic>ygjG </italic>intergenic region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) was cloned into pUC18 vector and sequenced. The obtained plasmid was designated as pUC18-ygjG. The computer analysis of the <italic>ygjG </italic>upstream regulatory region revealed recognizable consensus sequence of &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoter with score 70.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The localization of this promoter is shown on Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Likewise, according to DNA array data, the nitrogen limitation results in 3- to 5-fold increase in levels of <italic>ygjG </italic>transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. For more detail characterization of the role of the 5'-flanking region in the <italic>ygjG </italic>expression and nitrogen starvation induction we compared the expression levels of three different <italic>ygjG </italic>upstream regions fused to the <italic>lacZ </italic>reporter gene in plasmid pBRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] under different growth conditions. pBR-&#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-lacZ-1 and pBR-&#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-lacZ-2 plasmids carried 343-bp <italic>Kpn</italic>I-<italic>Acc</italic>III and 56-bp <italic>Bgl</italic>I-<italic>Acc</italic>III fragments, respectively, containing predicted &#x003c3;<sup>54 </sup>promoter sequence, and pBR-lacZ-3 plasmid harbored 282-bp <italic>Kpn</italic>I-<italic>Bgl</italic>I fragment upstream of &#x003c3;<sup>54 </sup>promoter. <italic>E. coli </italic>TG1 cells were transformed by each of plasmids and &#x003b2;-galactosidase productions in three media: LB broth and salt M9 media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] with ammonium or supplemented with proline as a sole nitrogen source were analyzed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>The all three recombinant strains were found to have low &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (below 200 Miller unites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]) in LB broth. The strain harboring pBR-lacZ-3 also revealed low levels of expression in all media, pointing that the 282-bp fragment doesn't include noticeable promoter sequence. The strain carried plasmid pBR-&#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-lacZ-2 containing practically &#x003c3;<sup>54 </sup>sequence alone, showed 3 &#x02013; 5 times higher <italic>lacZ </italic>expression levels than pBR-lacZ-3 in both variant of minimal media. But <italic>lacZ </italic>activity was dramatically increased in the strain harboring pBR-&#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-lacZ-1, especially under nitrogen limited conditions. The increase was about 9-fold in M9 medium with ammonium and 28-fold in M9 with proline in comparison with pBR-&#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-lacZ-2. Thus, the 56-bp region contains promoter sequence, and we concluded that &#x003c3;<sup>54 </sup>promoter localized in the <italic>Bgl</italic>I-<italic>Acc</italic>III fragment is the main promoter of <italic>ygjG</italic>. The <italic>Kpn</italic>I-<italic>Bgl</italic>I fragment is strongly essential for <italic>ygjG </italic>expression in minimal media and activation of <italic>ygjG </italic>expression (up to 6-fold) under nitrogen limitation. Because enhancer proteins are absolutely necessary for &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] we reanalyzed the sequence of this fragment and found some putative binding sites for <italic>E. coli </italic>activators: two general nitrogen regulatory protein (NR<sub>I</sub>) binding sites and binding site for integration host factor (IHF) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In addition, existence of factor of inversion stimulation (FIS) binding site was suggested <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/"/>. Thus the activation of <italic>ygj</italic>G expression is complicated, depends on growth conditions and needs further investigations.</p><p>TG1 cells harboring pUC18-ygjG were grown in three media (see above), the total RNAs were isolated and used to identify the transcriptional initiation site of <italic>ygjG </italic>mRNA by primer extension experiment. The same cDNA fragment was observed as the major transcript for all three RNA preparations, and the cytidine (C) was identified as the first mRNA base (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, also shown as "+1" in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The quantities of <italic>ygjG </italic>cDNA synthesized were estimated using Typhoon imager. The highest level of transcript was observed for RNA preparation from cells grown under nitrogen limitation, while only about 20% and less than 1% of it were detected if cells were grown in M9 and LB media, accordingly. Also, crude protein extracts from these cells were examined for PATase activity with putrescine as amino group donor and with 2-OG as acceptor. Enzyme activity was determined routinely by glutamate formation, which was measured by capillary zone electrophoresis (CE) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The second product of the reaction, &#x003b3;-aminobutyraldehyde, was unstable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and formed cycled &#x00394;<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline at alkaline pH. PATase activity was highest in extracts of cells grown under nitrogen limitation (47 nmol&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;mg<sup>-1</sup>). It was significantly reduced in cell extracts from M9 medium (nearly proportionally to decreasing of <italic>ygjG </italic>transcript level), and was practically undetectable in cell extracts from LB medium (near to the limit of accuracy for the CE method). Thus, the level of <italic>ygjG </italic>transcription and PATase activity correlated in cells grown in each of three media used.</p><p>The predicted AUG initiation codon for the <italic>ygjG </italic>gene of 1290 bp (denoted downstream as ORF1) which codes 429-amino acid polypeptide (SWISS-PROT Database, P42588) is situated 126 nucleotides downstream of the mRNA start. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed the other ORF (denoted as ORF2) encoding 459-amino acid protein with UUG initiation codon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), which is 30 amino acids upstream from an in frame ORF1 start codon. Because both putative ORFs have the potential Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we decided to express each of them as his<sub>6</sub>-tag fused recombinant protein to determine if these recombinant constructs actually yield a catalytically active enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning and expression of the ORF1 and OFR2 coding proteins</title><p>The 1.29-kbp (ORF1) and 1.38-kbp (ORF2) DNA fragments of pUC18-ygjG were cloned in translation fusion with N-terminal his<sub>6</sub>-tag sequence under the control of the T7 promoter in pET15b(+) vector. The resulting plasmids, pET-Ht-ORF1 and pET-Ht-ORF2, were expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>BL21(DE3) cells. SDS-PAGE of cellular extracts demonstrated a high level of expression of these proteins. To elucidate which of polypeptides encodes an active enzyme, crude extracts were examined for PATase activity. The essential level of glutamate formation activity was observed in crude cell extracts of the BL21(DE3) harboring pET-Ht-ORF2. It was equal to 2.16 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;mg<sup>-1</sup>. The BL21(DE3)(pET-Ht-ORF1) strain exhibited only traces of PATase activity. The BL21(DE3) strain transformed with pET15b(+) as a control revealed no activity. Obviously, the UUG is the real initiation codon of the <italic>ygjG </italic>encoding 459-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass (M<sub>r</sub>) of 49,644 Da.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification and characterization of the <italic>ygjG </italic>gene recombinant product</title><p>In order to confirm the identity of ORF2 as the gene encoding PATase, we purified recombinant protein from the BL21(DE3)(pET-Ht-ORF2) strain by immobilized-metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) to give a final preparation having a specific activity of 11.68 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;mg<sup>-1 </sup>with yield of 81%. The purity of Ht-YgjG recombinant protein was about 95%. SDS-PAGE showed one distinctive band with a relative M<sub>r </sub>of about 52 kDa. This value well corresponds to the sum of mass of 49.6 kDa for ORF2 coding protein and 2.1 kDa for his<sub>6</sub>-tag leader peptide.</p><p>Some parameters of PATase reaction were determined. The enzyme was active at the alkaline pH, with the maximum activity at pH 9.0 in Tris-HCl buffer and displayed a broad temperature optimum between 20&#x000b0;C and 80&#x000b0;C with maximum activity at 60&#x000b0;C. The <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m </italic></sub>values for putrescine and 2-OG were determined to be 9.2 mM and 19.0 mM, respectively.</p><p>Substrate specificity of purified Ht-YgjG was measured with different donors and acceptors of amino group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Several compounds (putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine, agmatine, and ornithine) were tested for their ability to function as amino donors for 2-OG. Among them putrescine was found to be the best amino group donor for the aminotransferase activity of Ht-YgjG. Slightly lower activity with cadaverine (97%) and significantly lower with spermidine (32%) was detected. Also, three keto acids: 2-OG, &#x003b1;-ketobutyrate and pyruvate were used as amino acceptors for putrescine. The enzyme did exhibit significant activity toward &#x003b1;-ketobutyrate (38%) and, to less extent, pyruvate (12%) with putrescine. Almost no activity was detected with ornithine as amino acceptor, while ornithine aminotransferase activity was annotated for <italic>ygjG </italic>in GeneBank Database. GABA, diaminopimelic acid, acetylornithine were completely inactive as amino group donors.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In addition to being involved in polyamine breakdown, the reaction catalysed by PATase appears to be the fourth reaction of the arginine decarboxylase pathway of arginine degradation to succinate via putrescine and GABA in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We have found that <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 <italic>ygjG </italic>gene (denoted above as ORF2) encodes for enzyme catalyzing PATase reaction. According to published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and our experimental data, <italic>ygj</italic>G expression is under the control of the &#x003c3;<sup>54 </sup>promoter and is induced at minimal salt medium and under nitrogen starvation. Two putative NR<sub>I </sub>binding sites and IHF binding site in <italic>ygjG </italic>upstream region proposed to be involved into transcription regulation. The cytidine localized 10 bp downstream from the &#x003c3;<sup>54 </sup>promoter sequence was identified as the first mRNA base. The potential SD site (GGAG) is located 6 nucleotides upstream from the UUG initiation codon of <italic>ygj</italic>G and this distance is functional for <italic>E. coli </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The UUG is initiation codon for about 3% of <italic>E. coli </italic>proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] but it is less effective at promoting translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] than is AUG codon. Thus the initiation of translation from UUG codon could be a way to confine the synthesis of the YgjG protein.</p><p>BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] analysis of the translated <italic>ygjG </italic>sequence revealed moderate identity to the aminotransferases belonging to the class III of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent aminotransferase family, which includes <italic>E. coli </italic>acetylornithine delta-aminotransferase (36% identity), GABA aminotransferase (34% identity), 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthetase (33% identity). In addition, the significant level of identity, 27%, was found for <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>SpuC protein catalyzing putrescine:pyruvate aminotransferase reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The multiple sequence alignment of these enzymes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) showed that YgjG contains the conserved sequence segments with four invariant amino acid residues (i.e. Gly-245, Asp-271, Lys-300, and Arg-426) known to be involved in binding of either the substrate or the coenzyme PLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, the N-terminal sequence of the YgjG is the longest among them, and we believe that this sequence may be essential for substrate specificity and enzyme activity. YgjG showed the greatest identity (94%) with a probable aminotransferase encoded by <italic>STY3396 </italic>gene from <italic>Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi CT18 </italic>(NP 457608) suggesting that STY3396 is likely to be PATase.</p><p>We have purified Ht-YgjG recombinant protein and found that pH optimum and substrate specificity of the enzyme, except for GABA, was in a good accordance with data of Kim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] obtained for partially purified PATase enzyme from mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>strain, while the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m </italic></sub>value for 2-OG of Ht-YgjG is higher. The <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m </italic></sub>values of enzymes belonging to the class III aminotransferases are significantly different, from micromolar to millimolar levels, for different substrates (see, for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brenda.uni-koeln.de"/>). As mentioned above, the N-terminal sequence of YgjG may be essential for substrate specificity and enzyme activity. According to our preliminary data, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m </italic></sub>values for putrescine and 2-OG of unfused YgjG enzyme are 3&#x02013;4 times lower than those for the fused Ht-YgjG protein (data not shown). Thus, the N-end modification of YgjG by his<sub>6</sub>-tag leader fusion alters kinetic constants of the native enzyme. Therefore further investigations are needed to more detail characterization of YgjG protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that <italic>E. coli </italic>K12 <italic>ygjG </italic>&#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-depended ORF encodes the 459-amino acid protein. The recombinant enzyme, purified as a fuse with his<sub>6</sub>-tag leader, possessed the putrescine:2-OG aminotransferase activity.

The quantities of synthesized cDNAs were estimated using Typhoon 9210 imager and ImageQuant version 5.2 software (Amersham, Molecular Dynamics).</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of Ht-YgjG</title><p>The Ht-YgjG was purified from 150 ml of BL21(DE3)(pET-Ht-ORF2) induced culture. Frozen cells (60 mg) were thawed, suspended in 75 ml of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM PMSF) and disrupted by sonication followed by centrifugation to remove debris (10 000 g, 20 min, 4&#x000b0;C). The imidazol and NaCl were added to supernatant up to final concentrations of 50 mM and 500 mM, respectively. The supernatant was applied to a His-Trap column (1 ml) (Pharmacia) equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted with 10 ml of buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mM imidazol, 500 mM NaCl). The Ht-YgjG containing fractions were applied on Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer D (20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 15% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10 &#x003bc;M PLP) and eluted in the same buffer. The Ht-YgjG containing fractions were combined, aliquoted and stored at -70&#x000b0;C until required.</p><p>The protein concentration was estimated following the method described by Bradford with bovine serum albumin as the standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

The assay mixture contained (in 0.1 ml of total volume) 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 25 &#x003bc;M PLP, 10 mM putrescine, 10 mM 2-OG. The reaction mixture was preincubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 5 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of cell extract or enzyme solution (5 &#x003bc;l). The reaction was stopped by adding 15 &#x003bc;l of HCl (10%). The analysis of glutamic acid formation was carried out using a Quanta 4000E Capillary Electrophoresis System (Waters) with an uncoated fused-silica capillary (75 &#x003bc;m inner diam. &#x000d7; 60 cm) at 25 kV potential. The injection was performed hydrostatically for 25 s. The separation buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris-base, 25 mM benzoic acid, pH 8.5, 0.25 mM tetradecyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (for indirect UV detection at 254 nm). The calibration at three concentrations of the L-glutamic acid (0.025 mM, 0.05 mM, 0.1 mM) and three concentrations of the 2-OG (0.05 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.2 mM) was carried out.</p><p>The kinetic constants of the Ht-YgjG were evaluated by varying the concentration of putrescine at a 2-OG concentration of 20 mM or by varying the concentration of 2-OG at a putrescine concentration of 15 mM. The enzyme kinetics data were fitted to Michaelis-Menten kinetics and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m </italic></sub>values were calculated. The substrate specificity of Ht-YgjG was determined using assay as described above with different polyamines and amino acids as amino group donors and 2-OG as acceptor, or with different acceptors and putrescine as amino group donor.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>N.N.S. carried out the experimental part of the study and drafted the manuscript.
