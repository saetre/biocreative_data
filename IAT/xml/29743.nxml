We have investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of the Ogg1 protein in yeast mitochondria. We demonstrate that inactivation of <italic>ogg1</italic> leads to at least a 2-fold increase in production of spontaneous mitochondrial mutants compared with wild-type. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) we show that a GFP&#x02013;Ogg1 fusion protein is transported to mitochondria. However, deletion of the first 11 amino acids from the N-terminus abolishes the transport of the GFP&#x02013;Ogg1 fusion protein into the mitochondria. This analysis indicates that the N-terminus of Ogg1 contains the mitochondrial localization signal. We provide evidence that both yeast and human Ogg1 proteins protect the mitochondrial genome from spontaneous, as well as induced, oxidative damage. Genetic analyses revealed that the combined inactivation of <italic>OGG1</italic> and <italic>OGG2</italic> &#x0005b;encoding an isoform of the Ogg1 protein, also known as endonuclease three-like glycosylase I (Ntg1)&#x0005d; leads to suppression of spontaneously arising mutations in the mitochondrial genome when compared with the <italic>ogg1</italic> single mutant or the wild-type. Together, these studies provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for the repair of oxidative lesions in the mitochondrial genome by human and yeast Ogg1 proteins. Our study also identifies Ogg2 as a suppressor of oxidative mutagenesis in mitochondria.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mitochondria are the major sites of energy (ATP) production in the cell. Mitochondria also perform many other cellular functions, such as respiration and heme, lipid, amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis. Mitochondria also maintain the intracellular homeostasis of inorganic ions and initiate programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c5">5</xref>). Mitochondria contain approximately 1000 proteins; however, only 13 of these proteins are encoded by human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These 13 proteins constitute the essential subunits of the electron transport system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c5">5</xref>). All other mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported into mitochondria. Proteins destined for mitochondria contain a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c5">5</xref>).</p><p> Mitochondria are the major source of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells as they contain the electron transport chain that reduces oxygen to water by addition of electrons during oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial respiration accounts for about 90&#x00025; of oxygen consumption in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c5">5</xref>). Each mitochondrion produces 10<sup>7</sup> ROS molecules&#x0002f;cell&#x0002f;day during normal oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c7">7</xref>). Human mtDNA, unlike nuclear DNA, contains no introns and has no protective histone proteins. These features of mtDNA make it more vulnerable than nuclear DNA to damage by ROSs produced within the mitochondria. Consistent with this finding, mtDNA appears to accumulate mutations at a frequency 10 times higher than that of nuclear DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c8">8</xref>). Mutations in mtDNA are involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c10">10</xref>), heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c11">11</xref>), cardiomyopathies, diabetes, degenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x02019;s, Alzheimer&#x02019;s and Huntington&#x02019;s disease and other neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c12">12</xref>). Accumulation of somatic mutations of mtDNA also appears to be a feature of normal aging in all vertebrates thus far examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c1">1</xref>). The genetic changes observed in these diseases range from point mutations to deletions or insertions in the mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c15">15</xref>).</p><p> ROSs produced in mitochondria can lead to over 100 different types of nucleotide base modifications in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c16">16</xref>). Among these, 7,8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanine (8-hydroxyguanine) is the most abundant form of oxidized base. 8-hydroxyguanine is a mutagen because it mispairs with adenine during DNA replication, thereby causing guanine:cytosine (G:C) to thymine:adenine (T:A) transversions and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c18">18</xref>). To prevent the mutagenic effect of 8-hydroxyguanine, the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> contains a GO system. The bacterial GO system consists of three proteins: MutM (also known as Fpg protein), a DNA glycosylase&#x0002f;lyase that recognizes 8-hydroxyguanine:C and catalyzes the excision of 8-hydroxyguanine; MutY, a DNA glycosylase that recognizes 8-hydroxyguanine:A and catalyzes the excision of A; and MutT, a pyrophosphohydrolase that sanitizes the nucleotide precursor pool of 8-oxo-dGTP and inorganic pyrophosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c21">21</xref>).</p><p> Yeast and other eukaryotic cells also contain DNA repair proteins that repair modified bases produced by oxidative damage. The yeast <italic>OGG1</italic> gene encodes a DNA glycosylase that functionally complements the defect of the <italic>fpg</italic><italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c23">23</xref>). Yeast Ogg1 excises 8-hydroxyguanine opposite cytosine but acts poorly on 8-hydroxyguanine opposite adenine or guanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c23">23</xref>). The yeast Ogg1 also contains AP lyase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ogg1 lysine 241 indicates that this residue is essential for catalytic activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c24">24</xref>). The yeast <italic>ogg1</italic> null mutant exhibits a mutator phenotype and is not sensitive to oxidative DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c24">24</xref>). The human homolog of yeast <italic>OGG1</italic> (h<italic>OGG1</italic>) was cloned by several groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c31">31</xref>). The h<italic>OGG1</italic> gene maps to chromosome 3p25, a region frequently deleted in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c32">32</xref>). Base substitution mutation in h<italic>OGG1</italic> has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c32">32</xref>). Like the yeast protein, hOgg1 also catalyzes the cleavage of 8-hydroxyguanine and complements the mutator phenotype of the <italic>fpg</italic> strain of <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c28">28</xref>). Seven spliced variants of hOgg1 have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c33">33</xref>). However, two isoforms, types 1a and 2a, appear to be the major forms found in most human tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c33">33</xref>). Both hOgg1 isoforms contain glycosylase and AP lyase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c33">33</xref>). Like the yeast counterpart, these forms repair 8-oxo-G opposite C. The type 1a possesses a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C-terminus and localizes to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c33">33</xref>), while the hOgg1 type 2a localizes to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c33">33</xref>). Interestingly, hOgg1 is not the only DNA repair protein that localizes to mitochondria. Other proteins that are localized into the mitochondria include Mth1, Nth1, Ape1 as well as Udg1 that removes uracil incorporated into DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c39">39</xref>).</p><p> Yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is an excellent eukaryotic model system to study DNA repair mechanisms because DNA repair pathways are highly conserved between human and yeast. Furthermore, yeast and human mitochondria resemble each other in structure and function. We have begun a systematic analysis of mtDNA repair in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. In this paper we provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that the inactivation of <italic>OGG1</italic> in yeast leads to spontaneous mutations in the mitochondrial genome. Our analysis reveals that the Ogg1 N-terminus contains a distinct MLS. We also report that expression of h<italic>OGG1</italic> suppresses both the spontaneous and induced mutations in the mitochondrial genome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media and reagents</title><p>The genotypes of yeast strains used in this study are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke196tb1">1</xref>. Yeast strains were grown in YPD medium (1&#x00025; yeast extract, 2&#x00025; Bacto-peptone, 2&#x00025; dextrose and 2&#x00025; agar for plates).

Synthetic complete (SC) medium (yeast nitrogen base without amino acids 0.67&#x00025;, 2&#x00025; dextrose, 0.2&#x00025; drop-out mix and 2&#x00025; agar for plates) lacking uracil was used for transformation of yeast with plasmids. SC medium containing 1 g&#x0002f;l of 5-fluoroorotic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c40">40</xref>) was used to select ura<sup>&#x02013;</sup> yeast segregants. All restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies. Hydrogen peroxide was purchased from Baker, adriamycin from Adra Chemical. Bacterial strain DH10B was used in all cloning steps. Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB) medium (1&#x00025; yeast extract, 0.5&#x00025; Bacto-tryptone, 1&#x00025; NaC1 and 2&#x00025; agar for plates) was used for the growth of <italic>E.coli</italic>.

Erythromycin resistant (E<sup>R</sup>) and chloramphenicol resistant (CAP<sup>R</sup>) colonies were scored after incubation at 30&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02013;6 days. Simultaneously, an aliquot of each of the 5 ml cultures was used to determine the number of viable cells using YPD plates.</p><p> Petite mutants, characteristically containing deletions in mtDNA, form small colonies and do not grow on media containing non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol (YPG medium) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c45">45</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>ade2</italic> yeast strains (and other adenine-requiring strains) produce red pigment and form red colonies. However, cells that lose the ability to respire do not accumulate red pigment and so form white colonies on YPD plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c45">45</xref>). We have tested the utility of this phenotype of the white colonies to analyze mitochondrial mutants and we consistently found that white colones were unable to grow on YPG plates. We therefore used the <italic>ade2</italic> yeast strain Y433, and its derivative null strains for analysis of mitochondrial mutants. Saturated cultures were diluted, plated on YPD and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02013;4 days. The number of red (wild-type) and white (petite) colonies were scored. The wild-type and its <italic>ogg1</italic> null derivative strain expressing the yeast or human <italic>OGG1</italic> under the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) promoter were grown to saturation in SC medium lacking uracil. They were then diluted and plated on YPD plates.

This culture was diluted in 10 ml of YPD to an optical density at OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2 and allowed to grow at 30&#x000b0;C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6. Cells constitutively expressing yeast and human OGG1 or vector alone were grown in SC medium lacking uracil at all steps. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in sterile water containing adriamycin as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c46">46</xref>). After treatment the cells were diluted and plated on YPD plates.

The plasmid is a 6.3 kb vector containing the <italic>URA3</italic> yeast selectable marker and carrying the MET25 promoter. The pGFP&#x02013;C&#x02013;FUS expression vector was employed for the generation of Ogg1p&#x02013;GFP fusion. A 1.1 kb insert containing the entire <italic>OGG1</italic> structural gene (1&#x02013;375 amino acids) was generated by PCR from the pYES2&#x02013;<italic>OGG1</italic> plasmid using the primers 5&#x02032;-CAGGGATCCATGAAAAGTGAGCTATGT-3&#x02032;and 5&#x02032;-CAGAAGCTTATCTATTTTTGCTTCTTTG-3&#x02032;. To generate yeast Ogg1 lacking the MLS, 11 amino acids from the N-terminal (construct pGFPc&#x02013;yOgg1&#x00394;N11) were deleted by PCR using the primers 5&#x02032;-CAGGGATCCATGTCTTATAAATTCGGC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CAGAAGCTTATCTATTTTTGCTTCTTTG-3&#x02032;.

To generate yOgg1 lacking the NLS the yeast OGG1 coding sequence was excised from pYES2&#x02013;yOGG1 plasmid by digesting with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Dra</italic>I, generating a 0.9 kb OGG1 fragment and thus 63 amino acids from the C-terminal (pGFPc&#x02013;yOgg1&#x00394;C63) protein. The resulting DNA fragment was ligated into <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Sma</italic>I sites of the pGFP&#x02013;C&#x02013;FUS vector.

Yeast strain FY250 was transformed by the lithium acetate method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c42">42</xref>) with either the in-frame GFP&#x02013;Ogg1 fusion construct or the pGFP&#x02013;C&#x02013;FUS vector. Cells were grown on SC plates lacking uracil and methionine for 20 h. They were then resuspended in 20 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM MitoTracker dye (Molecular Probes). Following 2 min incubation at room temperature, cells were washed once with 1&#x000d7; PBS, pelleted and resuspended in 5 &#x000b5;l of 1&#x000d7; PBS. A small aliquot (5 &#x000b5;l) of the resulting cell suspension was mounted on glass slides.

Fluorescence was examined using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) optimized filter and a DAPI optimized filter while the MitoTracker signal was examined through a Texa Red&#x0002f;Rhodamine filter. A Zeiss-Axiovert 135 TV inverted microscope equipped with a PXL camera (SENSYS Photometrics) was used to document results.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Increased frequency of petite mutants in the <italic>ogg1</italic> strain</title><p>Specific point mutations in the <italic>rib2 </italic>and <italic>rib3</italic> mitochondrial genes lead to erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f2">2</xref> shows the digestion pattern of mtDNA isolated from wild-type cells and three different white petite mutants in <italic>ogg1 </italic>null background.

To test the probable localization of Ogg1 in mitochondria, we constructed an in-frame Ogg1 fusion with GFP cDNA in a vector named pGFP&#x02013;C&#x02013;FUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c47">47</xref>). This vector allows the expression of the GFP fusion protein in yeast from the MET25 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c47">47</xref>). The MET25 promoter is turned on when methionine is absent from the medium. The yeast strain Y250 was transformed, the transformant selected and streaked on SD medium without methionine. After 2 days of growth, cells were examined under the microscope. We examined the localization of the three GFP&#x02013;Ogg1 fusion constructs: GFPc&#x02013;Ogg1&#x00394;C63, GFPc&#x02013;Ogg1&#x00394;11N and GFPc&#x02013;Ogg1 (containing the entire Ogg1 reading frame except the Ogg1 stop codon). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f3">3</xref> shows representative images of yeast expressing the fusion protein. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f3">3</xref>A, panel 1 shows a pattern of fluorescence (MitoTracker Red) that coincides with the mitochondria (control). Panel 2 shows that the GFPc&#x02013;Ogg1&#x00394;C63 fusion protein localizes in the mitochondria. The GFPc&#x02013;Ogg1&#x00394;C63 image when merged with MitoTracker dye (control) shows a punctate pattern overlapping with mitochondria. When 11 amino acids from the N-terminus were deleted (GFPc&#x02013;Ogg1&#x00394;N11) mitochondrial localization was abolished. It is evident from the overlapping images stained with DAPI (that stains mitochondrial and nuclear DNA) that GFPc&#x02013;Ogg1&#x00394;N11 was localized to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f3">3</xref>A and B). Interestingly, GFPc&#x02013;Ogg1 containing the entire open reading frame was localized to the cytoplasm. We conclude that the Ogg1 protein contains two distinct localization signals: one MLS located at the N-terminus and one NLS located at the C-terminus.</p></sec><sec><title>Ogg1 expression reduces the frequency of petite formation</title><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> role of hOgg1 in mitochondria is not clear. To analyze the effects of expression of yeast and human Ogg1 in yeast mitochondria, we cloned <italic>OGG1</italic> cDNA under the control of the ADH promoter. The wild-type strain Y433 was transformed with Ogg1&#x02013;ADH and petite colonies were counted. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f4">4</xref>A demonstrates that petite formation is reduced in cells expressing Ogg1 compared to cells containing the vector alone. We also cloned hOgg1 under the ADH promoter and transformed the wild-type strain. Like yeast Ogg1, cells expressing hOGG1 produced significantly fewer petite colonies than the vector alone. The h<italic>OGG1</italic> and yeast <italic>OGG1</italic> were also expressed in the <italic>ogg1</italic> null mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f4">4</xref>A). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f4">4</xref>A demonstrates that expression of Ogg1 in the null mutant reversed the effect of the <italic>ogg1</italic> mutation in this strain.</p><p> Adriamycin is an anthracycline drug that is activated in mitochondria. Upon activation inside the mitochondria it produces ROSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c46">46</xref>). Adriamycin, therefore, is a potent inducer of petite mutants (data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c46">46</xref>). We tested whether adriamycin-induced petite formation is decreased by expression of yeast Ogg1 and hOgg1. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f4">4</xref>B shows that, in response to adriamycin, cells that contain only the vector produce approximately 60&#x00025; petite mutants. However, expression of yeast or hOgg1 in cells reduced the frequency of petite formation significantly. Taken together, these data suggest: (i) that the majority of spontaneous petite mutants in wild-type cells arise due to 8-hydroxyguanine in mtDNA; (ii) that 8-hydroxyguanine in mtDNA is repaired by yeast and human Ogg1 proteins; and (iii) that yeast and hOgg1 proteins repair oxidative lesions in mtDNA induced by adriamycin.</p></sec><sec><title>Suppression of petite formation in <italic>ogg1</italic><italic>ogg2</italic> double mutant</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> contains an Ogg1 homolog known as Ogg2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c17">17</xref>), also known as Ntg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c54">54</xref>). Although Ogg2 localizes to mitochondria, its biological function is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c54">54</xref>). In order to characterize the role of Ogg2 in repairing damaged DNA in mitochondria, we constructed an <italic>ogg1</italic><italic>ogg2</italic> double mutant strain. We measured the frequency of petite formation in this strain using the color assay. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f5">5</xref> shows that inactivation of both <italic>ogg1</italic> and <italic>ogg2</italic> results in a reduced level of mitochondrial petite colonies in comparison to the <italic>ogg1</italic> strain. These data suggest that <italic>ogg2</italic> functions as a suppressor of oxidative DNA repair in mitochondria.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The mitochondrial genome of eukaryotic cells is extremely susceptible to damage due to constant exposure to significant amounts of ROSs produced endogenously by mitochondria as a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation. Organisms contain defence mechanisms to minimize the accumulation of ROS-induced damage. Recent biochemical and cell biological studies indicate the existence of base excision repair proteins in human mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c37">37</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> contains an Ogg1 homolog, named Ogg2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c17">17</xref>). Ogg2 repairs oxidative lesions and is localized to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c54">54</xref>). However, You <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c54">54</xref>) found no evidence for <italic>in vivo</italic> repair in mitochondria by Ogg2. Erythromycin and chloramphenicol-resistant colonies arise due to point mutations in mtDNA encoded <italic>rib2 </italic>or <italic>rib3</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c50">50</xref>). This method has been frequently used by many investigators including You <italic>et al.</italic> to measure the frequency of mitochondrial mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c54">54</xref>). We also used this method to analyze the effect of <italic>ogg1</italic> inactivation on the frequency of mitochondrial mutants. Our analysis revealed no significant difference in frequency of mitochondrial mutants between the wild-type and the <italic>ogg1</italic> mutant (data not shown). However, when we used the colony color method it revealed at least a 2-fold difference in the generation of mitochondrial mutants between the <italic>ogg1</italic> and the wild-type strain. It is likely that the observed lack of difference between the mutant and the wild-type is due to a limited target size provided by the <italic>rib2</italic> and <italic>rib3</italic> genes and the required specific point mutations that render cells resistant. In comparison, colony color measures random mutation in the entire mitochondrial genome that provides a significant target size (85 kb) for mutagenesis. Thus the colony color method is more sensitive at detecting mitochondrial mutations and should be helpful in identifying other genes involved in repairing the mitochondrial genome.</p><p> The observed insignificant differences between the wild-type and <italic>ogg1</italic> strain on the accumulation of antibiotic-resistant colonies suggest that a lack of Ogg1 does not result in increased point mutation in mtDNA. We found that <italic>ogg1</italic> inactivation leads to deletion in mtDNA. Ogg1 repairs several lesions in addition to 8-hydroxyguanine. These include 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5(<italic>N</italic>-methylforamamido) pyrimidine, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyridine (Fapy) as well as 7,8-hydroxy-8-oxoadenine placed opposite a cytosine or a 5-methyl cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c24">24</xref>). In the absence of Ogg1, it is likely that the chain terminating lesions such as Fapy are not repaired, which will lead to deletions in mtDNA. We do not yet know the complete spectrum of oxidative DNA lesions generated in the mitochondria but it is likely that the lesions similar to the ones generated in the nucleus are also generated in the mitochondria and are repaired by Ogg1 in both organelles. However, more experiments are required to address this possibility <italic>in vivo</italic> in the mitochondria.</p><p> The yeast Ogg1 contains a bipartite NLS located at the C-terminus between residues 341 and 362 (KKRK-X<sub>12</sub>-KQMKL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c55">55</xref>). Deletion of 63 amino acids from the C-terminus led to the exclusive localization of Ogg1 to mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f3">3</xref>). The N-terminus of Ogg1 contains features typical of an MLS. When 11 amino acids from the N-terminus were deleted, Ogg1 localization in the mitochondria was abolished. Instead, Ogg1 was localized in the nucleus because it contained the NLS at the C-terminus. These data suggest that Ogg1 contains two distinct localization signals, an MLS and an NLS, which are located at the N- and C-termini, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f3">3</xref>). It has been suggested previously that in proteins with multiple organelle localization signals, the N-terminal signal usually dominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c35">35</xref>). Interestingly, this is not the case for yeast Ogg1. When yeast Ogg1 contained both the MLS and NLS, it was present throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f3">3</xref>) indicating that neither signal dominates. However, the MLS in hOgg1 appears to be weak because hOgg1 containing both the MLS and NLS localizes to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c33">33</xref>).</p><p> We report that the constitutive expression of yeast and human Ogg1 protects yeast cells from spontaneous, as well as induced, oxidative damage to the mitochondrial genome. This study indicates that Ogg1 expression may be a rate-limiting step in repairing oxidative lesions in mitochondria. The reduced frequency of petite formation by yeast expressing hOgg1 suggests that human Ogg1 should be transported to mitochondria to repair any damage to the mitochondrial genome. Indeed, our data suggest that ectopically expressed hOgg1 accumulates in yeast mitochondria (data not shown). This observation is consistent with previous reports that MLSs from other species function in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c56">56</xref>).</p><p> The Ogg2 protein removes 8-hydroxyguanine paired with guanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c17">17</xref>). In addition, Ogg2 repairs thymine glycol, dihydrothymidine, dihydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxy-6-hydrothymine, 5-hydroxy-6-hydrouracil, 5-hydroxy-5-methyldantoin, 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxycytosine, Fapy&#x02013;7MeG, Fapy G, Fapy A and abasic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c54">54</xref>). We examined the frequency of petite formation in <italic>ogg1 </italic>single and<italic> ogg1</italic><italic>ogg2</italic> double null mutants. Surprisingly, we found that inactivation of <italic>ogg2</italic> together with <italic>ogg1</italic> reduces the frequency of petite formation to the wild-type level. Interestingly, the <italic>ogg2</italic> single mutant does not show a significant increase in frequency of spontaneous mitochondrial petite formation. It is important to note that the combined inactivation of <italic>ogg1</italic> and <italic>ogg2</italic> function reduces mutation in the nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c17">17</xref>). One possibility is that in the absence of both the Ogg1 and Ogg2 proteins, one or more alternative pathways are activated that repair oxidative DNA lesions in mitochondria. We propose a model in which Ogg2 may function as (i) a bypass suppressor or (ii) an epistasis suppressor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke196f6">6</xref>). In the first case, Ogg1 and Ogg2 function in a parallel pathway and the absence of one protein may increase the level of the other. As an example, a mutation that abolishes the function of <italic>CYC1</italic> gene (eliminating the major form of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>) is suppressed by a mutation that increases the level of another isoform encoded by <italic>CYC7</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c57">57</xref>). It is also possible that a mutation in Ogg2 may alter the specificity of a protein in a related but distinct pathway, so that it subsititutes for the function of Ogg1. In the second case, Ogg1 and Ogg2 may be in the same pathway and a null mutation in <italic>OGG2</italic> gene restores the wild-type phenotype because it is epistatic to Ogg1. Suppression by epistasis is observed in many pathways in gene regulation, such as those controlling amino acid biosynthesis in <italic>S.cerevisiae </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke196c57">57</xref>). Experiments are underway to test this model.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke196f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Frequency of spontaneous mitochondrial mutants: the wild-type (WT) and isogenic <italic>ogg1 </italic>null mutant (ogg1) were grown, the cells were washed, diluted in sterile water and plated.
