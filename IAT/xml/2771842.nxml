In particular, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 is a major enzyme involved in the reconstruction of the arterial intima through activation of other MMPs. We analyzed MMP-3 genotypes in hypertensive and normotensive adolescents and sought to determine if a particular genotype is a predictor of cardiovascular complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>Forty-four hypertensive adolescents and 59 healthy adolescents were included in this study. Serum aldosterone, renin, insulin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), insulin, homocysteine, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, folate, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, and TIMP-2 were measured. MMP-3 genotypes were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer. The carotid intima media thickness (IMT), diameter, and brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were evaluated using ultrasound.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In hypertensive adolescents, blood pressure, anthropometric data, carotid IMT, baPWV, serum pro-MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were no different between the 6A/6A group and the 5A/6A group. Serum MMP-9 was higher in the 5A/6A group than in the control group. Aldosterone, insulin, and homocysteine were higher in the 6A/6A group than in the control group, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate were lower in the 6A/6A group than in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, serum MMP-3 levels were not significantly different in different MMP-3 genotypes in hypertensive adolescents. However, few patients were included in this study.

This is due to its broad substrate spectrum, which includes most major constituents of the arterial wall: fibronectin, collagen types IV, V, IX, and X, gelastin, laminin, elastin, and proteoglycan proteins.

Most previous genetic studies have noted an association between MMPs and cardiovascular disease, though this has not been totally consistent. However, there has been no study addressing MMP-3 genotype in hypertensive adolescents.</p><p>The purposes of this study were to compare the incidence of the MMP-3 genotype in hypertensive and normotensive adolescents and to assess the effect of MMP-3 gene polymorphisms on carotid artery IMT and pulse wave velocity (PWV), which are markers of early atherosclerosis and vessel remodeling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Forty-four hypertensive patients and 59 healthy adolescents of similar age participated in this study (all patients greater than 16 but less than 17 years of age).

All participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Anthropometric measurements</title><p>All hypertensive students were referred to our pediatric clinic. Their elevated blood pressures were ascertained by averaging three blood pressure measurements made after 10 minutes of rest with an oscillometric monitor. No patients had ever been diagnosed or treated for hypertension before. Height and body weight were measured, and body mass index (BMI) and obesity index (OI) were calculated from these figures. BMI was defined as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>). OI was calculated by the following equation using the standard weight as the value corresponding to the 50th percentile weight of Korean adolescents.</p><p>Obesity index (%)=(weight measured-standard weight)/standard weight&#x000d7;100</p><p>Obesity was defined as OI above 120 percent.

PWV, ABI (the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the ankle to that in the brachial artery), blood pressures in both extremities, electrocardiography, and heart sounds were obtained simultaneously using volume plethysmographic technique. Cuffs were wrapped on both the arms and ankles, and electrocardiogram electrodes were placed on the left sternal border. As the pulse wave contours in the four extremities were recorded, the cuffs inflated and deflated automatically. Cuffs were attached to the plethysmographic sensor, which determined the volume pulse form. Blood pressures were measured from the oscillometric pressure sensor. BaPWV was determined based on the pulse transit time and the distance between these two segments. The distance of each segment was calculated automatically, based on the height of each subject. All measurements were made during regular sinus rhythm.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum aldosterone, renin, insulin, angiotensin converting enzyme, homocysteine, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and folate levels</title><p>Venous blood was drawn from all patients after overnight fasting. Samples were kept at -70&#x02103; for subsequent assay. Serum concentrations of aldosterone, renin, insulin, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and folate were evaluated by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with a COBRA-II Gamma Counter (Packard, Meriden Coonecticut, CA, USA). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was measured with enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) using COBAS MIRA (Roche, Switzerland). Homocysteine was measured by chemiluminoimmunoassay (CLIA) with an ADVIA Centaur HCY (Bayer, Tarrytown, New York, NY, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Matrix metalloproteinase-1, matrix metalloproteinase-2, matrix metalloproteinase-3, matrix metalloproteinase-9, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases-1, and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases-2</title><p>Commercially available sandwich ELISA assays (Molecular Devices, Palmcity, FL, USA) were used to determine MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 levels. We placed samples in a plate coated with specific total MMP-1 polyclonal antibodies and made specific antibodies. We then washed off the detached materials and added pro-MMP-1-specific enzymelinked polyclonal antibodies to each well. After substrate solution was added, total MMP-1 conjugates radiated. The absorbance was read spectrophotometrically with a microtiter plate reader. MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 levels were measured using the same method.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of the matrix metalloproteinase-3 genotype</title><p>The sequences of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were 5'-GATTACAGACATGGGTCACA-3' (forward primer) and 5'-TTTCAATCAGGACAAGACGAAGTTT-3' (reverse primer).

Genetic variation in a number of MMP and TIMP genes has been implicated as a risk factor for atherosclerosis. However, the studies indicating these relationships have been generally small and have produced conflicting results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21)</xref></p><p>Medley et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22)</xref> reported that the MMP-9 genotype influences large artery stiffness through effects on aortic gene and protein expression. MMP-9 genotype (C-1562T promoter polymorphism) T-allele carriers (C/T and T/T) had stiffer large arteries and higher carotid pulse and systolic blood pressure than C/C homozygotes did. The higher expression of MMP-9 associated with the T allele may influence large arteries to become stiffer through vascular remodeling, which disrupts their mechanical integrity. This relationship may be due to increased degradation of important elastic components of the ECM secondary to elevated MMP-9 gene expression and protein levels in the aorta.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22)</xref></p><p>An association was found between MMP-9 R279Q and internal carotid artery bulb IMT, but there was no linear trend between allele number and IMT and no association with common carotid artery or bulb IMT.

However, the interaction between MMP variants and hypertension suggest that hypertensive carriers of these alleles may be at greater risk for increased IMT and future cardiovascular disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21)</xref></p><p>Altered MMP activity has been noted to be involved as a mechanism in early vascular remodeling secondary to hypertension.

Carotid IMT and PWV were significantly higher in hypertensive adolescents compared with normal controls. However, IMT and PWV were no different according to MMP-3 genotype. Although the exact duration of hypertension was unknown in the patients in our study, it is probably too short to cause a significant difference in MMP levels according to genotype. IMT thickness appears to represent not only early atherosclerosis, but also adaptive remodeling, particularly in hypertension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23)</xref> The effects of MMP genetic variants may not be pronounced enough to be detected by increases in IMT in normotensive subjects at this early stage. However, as hypertension and the degree of vascular remodeling increase, the effect of these genetic variants will be manifested.</p><p>In adult studies, MMP-9 levels have been found to correlate significantly with aortic and brachial PWV at an early time point.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22)</xref> Aortic stiffness is related to MMP-9 and elastase levels, not only in ISH, but also in younger, apparently healthy individuals. This suggests that elastases including MMP-9 may be involved in arterial stiffening and the development of ISH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19)</xref> Hypertensive patients showed higher levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that serum levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were significantly and positively correlated with PWV in hypertensive patients.</p><p>The MMP-9/TIMP-1 system may play an important role in the determination of arterial function, and these findings may have implications for the involvement of the MMP-9/TIMP-1 system in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24)</xref></p><p>The concomitant increases in both MMPs and TIMPs may indicate abnormal ECM turnover at the post-translational level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25)</xref> MMP-1 is likely to be relevant in the clinical setting.

Plasma levels do not necessarily reflect the net ECM proteolytic activity that occurs within the myocardium. The myocardium is not the only source of MMPs and TIMPs in LVH patients. Therefore, plasma MMP and TIMP levels represent the sum of MMPs and TIMPs released from both cardiac and non-cardiac sources.</p><p>Our study is limited in that it was small; we studied only 44 adolescents. It is also possible we failed to show the relationship between MMP-3 genotype and cardiovascular risk because our subjects were adolescents who had high blood pressure of short duration. Large sample size increases statistical power and reduces the problem of incomplete penetrance in individuals that may have subclinical hypertension, which will lead to clinical events in subsequent years. Carotid IMT has been successfully used to demonstrate robust, replicable associations with other cardiovascular candidate genes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27)</xref></p><p>Our findings provide some support for genetic variants of MMP as direct risk factors for IMT, at least in the early stages of hypertension, through vessel remodeling and thickening.</p><p>Further studies investigating the associations between MMP genotypes and symptomatic disease will be required to determine if these variants play a role in hypertension. IMT thickness appears to represent not only early atherosclerosis, but also adaptive remodeling, particularly to hypertension. Vascular remodeling is limited during early atherosclerotic changes, which IMT changes represent. As such, the effects of MMP genetic variants may not be pronounced enough to be detected by increases in IMT in normotensive subjects at this early stage. However, as hypertension increases the degree of vascular remodeling, the effect of these genetic variants becomes manifest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref
