Murine arrest-defective protein 1A (mARD1A<sup>225</sup>) acetylates HIF-1&#x003b1;, triggering its degradation, and thus may play a role in decreased expression of VEGFA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We generated Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>/mARD1A<sup>225</sup> transgenic mice and quantified growth of intestinal polyps. Human gastric MKN74 and murine melanoma B16F10 cells overexpressing mARD1A<sup>225</sup> were injected into mice, and tumor growth and metastasis were measured. VEGFA expression and microvessel density in tumors were assessed using immunohistochemistry. To evaluate the role of mARD1A<sup>225</sup> acetylation of Lys532 in HIF-1&#x003b1;, we injected B16F10-mARD1A<sup>225</sup> cell lines stably expressing mutant HIF-1&#x003b1;/K532R into mice and measured metastasis. All statistical tests were two-sided, and <italic>P</italic> values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>/mARD1A<sup>225</sup> transgenic mice (n = 25) had statistically significantly fewer intestinal polyps than Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice (n = 21) (number of intestinal polyps per mouse: Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice vs Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>/mARD1A<sup>225</sup> transgenic mice, mean = 83.4 vs 38.0 polyps, difference = 45.4 polyps, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.8 to 48.6; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). The growth and metastases of transplanted tumors were also statistically significantly reduced in mice injected with mARD1A<sup>225</sup>-overexpressing cells than in mice injected with control cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01). Moreover, overexpression of mARD1A<sup>225</sup> decreased VEGFA expression and microvessel density in tumor xenografts (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .04) and Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> intestinal polyps (<italic>P</italic> = .001). Mutation of lysine 532 of HIF-1&#x003b1; in B16F10-mARD1A<sup>225</sup> cells prevented HIF-1&#x003b1; degradation and inhibited the antimetastatic effect of mARD1A<sup>225</sup> (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>mARD1A<sup>225</sup> may be a novel upstream target that blocks VEGFA expression and tumor-related angiogenesis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>CONTEXTS AND CAVEATS</title><sec><title>Prior knowledge</title><p>Angiogenesis plays a central role in tumor growth and is mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), which is expressed in many tumor types. VEGFA transcription is initiated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;). Arrest-defective protein 1A (ARD1A) induces the degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1;, resulting in lower VEGFA expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Growth and metastasis of intestinal tumors were quantified in transgenic mice expressing murine ARD1A. VEGFA expression and blood vessel proliferation in tumors were assessed in these mice relative to controls. The importance of HIF-1&#x003b1; degradation in suppression of VEGFA expression was tested by mutation of the HIF-1&#x003b1; acetylation site.</p></sec><sec><title>Contribution</title><p>Overexpression of ARD1A reduced the number and size of both primary tumors and metastases. In addition, ARD1A had an antiangiogenic effect by decreasing VEGFA expression and blood vessel density in tumors. This effect was inhibited by mutation of a single acetylation site in HIF-1&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications</title><p>The ARD1A protein may act as a novel antitumorigenic agent by blocking tumor-related angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The effects of the mutant HIF-1&#x003b1; did not fully override the increased expression of ARD1A, suggesting that additional targets of ARD1A may be involved in regulating tumor growth.

Murine ARD1A (mARD1A<sup>225</sup>) acetylates a lysine residue in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (HIF-1&#x003b1;), which enhances binding to the von Hippel&#x02013;Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) and promotes the subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>HIF-1 is a key factor involved in cellular adaptation to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1&#x003b1; is posttranslationally modified and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). However, during hypoxia, HIF-1&#x003b1; is stabilized and interacts with HIF-1&#x003b2; to form a functional HIF-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Transcriptional targets of HIF-1 include genes that promote angiogenesis and metastasis, most notably, the potent proangiogenic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>VEGFA modulates endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) and is overexpressed in many tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), malignant carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), and premalignant lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). For example, a statistically significant positive association has been demonstrated between increased levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGFA in human colorectal carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In this study, we examined the role of mARD1A<sup>225</sup> in the regulation of both primary tumor growth and metastatic disease. We generated mARD1A<sup>225</sup>-expressing transgenic mice to determine whether mARD1A<sup>225</sup> plays a physiologically important role in regulating tumor growth via HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGFA.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Construction of mARD1A<sup>225</sup> Expression Vector for Generation of Transgenic Mice</title><p>Sequences encoding a 9His-HRV2-9Myc tag were fused to full-length mARD1A<sup>225</sup> cDNA and cloned into the pCAGGS vector under the control of a chicken beta-actin promoter.

Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 and BALB/cSlc-nude mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and Japan Shizuoka Laboratory Center, Inc (Shizuoka, Japan), respectively. All mice were maintained in the Ewha Laboratory Animal Genomics Center under specific pathogen-free conditions.</p><p>Purified transgenic construct DNA was microinjected into the fertilized eggs collected from the superovulated C57BL/6 females. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from the tail tissue of founder mice at 2 weeks of age. Eight founder mice were identified via PCR and Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Among these, expression of mARD1A<sup>225</sup>-His9-HRV2-Myc9 protein was observed through the germline in three lines (0041, 0043, and 0046).

Also, this model showed that short-term treatment of Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice with an anti-VEGFA monoclonal antibody results in reduced tumor burden and vessel density of intestinal polyps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Similarly, targeted deletion of VEGFA in intestinal epithelial cells of Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice induced a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), suggesting that VEGFA plays an important role in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> intestinal polyp growth. The offspring from a cross between the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mouse and a mouse null for the endogenous anti&#x02013;angiogenic protein thrombospondin 1 (THBS1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) showed a significant increase in polyp number and diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), indicating a possible role for angiogenesis in polyp development. A study of another mouse model of intestinal adenomas, Apc<sup>716</sup>, which reported elevated VEGFA protein levels in polyps compared with normal intestinal epithelium control tissue, was also consistent with an association between VEGFA and polyp development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In our experiments, VEGFA expression was decreased in intestinal polyps of Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>/mARD1A<sup>225</sup> transgenic mice, which, in turn, led to suppression of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Therefore, we propose that transgenic overexpression of mARD1A<sup>225</sup> exerts an important tumor-suppressive effect via inhibition of VEGFA in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mouse intestinal polyps.</p><p>Whereas the vast majority of tumors express VEGFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), it is clear that VEGFA regulation by HIF-1&#x003b1; plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Here, we show that overexpression of mARD1A<sup>225</sup> in both human gastric cancer and mouse melanoma cells induces a statistically significant reduction of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein expression and consequent production of VEGFA. Furthermore, the growth of lung nodules in an experimental model of lung metastases was markedly inhibited by overexpression of mARD1A<sup>225</sup> in cancer cells. Expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGFA triggered under conditions of intratumoral hypoxia was decreased by mARD1A<sup>225</sup> in B16F10 and MKN74 tumors. Our in vitro studies demonstrate that mARD1A<sup>225</sup> overexpression leads to suppression of VEGFA-mediated endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation. The data collectively suggest that the decrease in VEGFA levels induced as a result of degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1; by mARD1A<sup>225</sup> inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo.</p><p>This study confirms the in vivo importance of a single lysine residue in regulating the stability of HIF-1&#x003b1;. To our knowledge, HIF-1&#x003b1; is the only known target of the acetyltransferase, mARD1A<sup>225</sup>. Our analyses of the mutant HIF-1&#x003b1; construct, HIF-1&#x003b1;/K532R, show that VEGFA overexpression is because of the stability of HIF-1&#x003b1;. However, the effects of the mutant HIF-1&#x003b1; in tumor cells did not fully override the increased expression of mARD1A<sup>225</sup>, such that the incidence of lung tumor lesions in our experimental model of lung metastases was higher than that in mARD1A<sup>225</sup>-overexpressing cells but not higher than in mock-infected tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, D). This suggests that additional targets of mARD1A<sup>225</sup> are involved in regulating tumor growth and/or progression. Other limitations of this study are that we only examined VEGFA expression as a measure of HIF-1&#x003b1; activity. We also could not exclude the possibility of other HIF-1&#x003b1;-targets involved in tumor growth and/or progression. In addition, the mARD1A<sup>225</sup> isoform has not yet been identified in human cell lines. However, recent reports provide direct evidence for an inhibitory effect of human ARD1A on HIF-1&#x003b1; stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).</p><p>Our data collectively confirm the importance of mARD1A<sup>225</sup> in regulating tumor growth and development and provide evidence of its antitumor and antiangiogenic activities. Notably, mARD1A<sup>225</sup> regulates tumor growth via degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1; and consequent reduced expression of the proangiogenic protein, VEGFA. Therefore, we conclude that mARD1A<sup>225</sup> presents a novel target in the regulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; stability and may have potent therapeutic effects in combination with currently approved anti-VEGFA treatments such as bevacizumab.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>21st Century Frontier Functional Human Genome Project (FG06-2-9); <funding-source>National Research Foundation of
