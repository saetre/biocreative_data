Recently, many studies have focused on isolation of brain cancer stem cells using CD133 expression. In this study, we investigated whether CD133 expression is regulated by bioenergetic stresses affecting mitochondrial functions in human glioma cells. First, we determined that hypoxia induced a reversible up-regulation of CD133 expression. Second, mitochondrial dysfunction through pharmacological inhibition of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) produced an up-regulation of CD133 expression that was inversely correlated with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Third, generation of stable glioma cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA showed significant and stable increases in CD133 expression. These glioma cells, termed <italic>rho</italic><sup>0</sup> or &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>, are characterized by an exaggerated, uncoupled glycolytic phenotype and by constitutive and stable up-regulation of CD133 through many cell passages. Moreover, these &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells display the ability to form &#x0201c;tumor spheroids&#x0201d; in serumless medium and are positive for CD133 and the neural progenitor cell marker, nestin. Under differentiating conditions, &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells expressed multi-lineage properties. Reversibility of CD133 expression was demonstrated by transfering parental mitochondria to &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells resulting in stable trans-mitochondrial &#x0201c;cybrid&#x0201d; clones. This study provides a novel mechanistic insight about the regulation of CD133 by environmental conditions (hypoxia) and mitochondrial dysfunction (genetic and chemical). Considering these new findings, the concept that CD133 is a marker of brain tumor stem cells may need to be revised.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria play a major role in many cellular processes including energy production, apoptosis, and generation of free radical species.

Thus, it is important to understand how these cells are regulated in the context of tumor progression and therapy. One avenue is a possible common microenvironment and bioenergetic pathway between cancer cells and human embryonic stem (hES) cells. Subsequent to implantation and vascularization <italic>in vivo</italic>, hES cells are in a hypoxic environment between 1 to 5&#x00025; of oxygen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003655-Ezashi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Under these conditions, they remain pluripotent. Because hypoxic embryonic cells cannot produce adequate amounts of ATP via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), they rely on anaerobic metabolism to produce ATP to meet their energy requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003655-Brown1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, just as many cancer cells do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003655-Griguer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003655-Gillies1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial status plays a role in the regulation of the CD133 expression in human glioma cell lines. To this end, we used three cellular models: long term exposure to hypoxia, pharmacologic blockers of the ETC and genetic depletion of mitochondrial DNA (&#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>). In all three cellular models, we observed that, regardless of the means used to produce a glycolytic bioenergetic phenotype, CD133 is profoundly up-regulated. Moreover, up-regulation of CD133 expression by hypoxia is reversible upon re-oxygenation. Genetic depletion of mitochondrial DNA (&#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> model) increased CD133 cell surface expression in an irreversible manner and yielded a human glioma model in which CD133 is constitutively expressed. Transfer of mitochondria from parental U251 cells to &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells results in transmitochondrial cybrid clones that manifest parental phenotype. These results strongly demonstrate that mtDNA depletion is at least partly responsible for the CD133 expression.</p><p>Our findings, in combination with the uncertain role of CD133, suggest that the use of CD133 expression as a marker for brain tumor stem cells should be critically evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression of CD133 increases in glioma cells maintained under hypoxia</title><p>To assess the effect of hypoxia on expression of CD133, we cultured U251MG human glioma cells in 1&#x00025; oxygen for up to 3 days and compared them to cells maintained under standard normoxic conditions (21&#x00025; oxygen). Flow cytometric analysis indicated that CD133 expression was not detectable above background when these cells were exposed to 21&#x00025; oxygen. However, U251MG glioma cells cultured in 1&#x00025; oxygen were enriched in CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003655-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

(b): increased angiogenesis will result in formation of new vessels that will provide a transient increase in the microenvironment content of oxygen and nutrients allowing the switch from glycolysis back to OxPhos metabolism. (c): because the cells at the margin of tumor invasion will be re-oxygenated, they will grow and divide generating a new oxygen and nutrient diffusion barrier.
