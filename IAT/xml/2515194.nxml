Stem cells in particular are likely to depend upon nucleolus-based processes to remain in a proliferative state. A highly conserved nucleolar factor named nucleostemin is proposed to be a critical link between nucleolar function and stem-cell&#x02013;specific processes. Currently, it is unclear whether nucleostemin modulates proliferation by affecting ribosome biogenesis or by another nucleolus-based activity that is specific to stem cells and/or highly proliferating cells. Here, we investigate nucleostemin (<italic>nst-1</italic>) in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which enables us to examine <italic>nst-1</italic> function during both proliferation and differentiation in vivo. Like mammalian nucleostemin, the NST-1 protein is localized to the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm; however, its expression is found in both differentiated and proliferating cells. Global loss of <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin (<italic>nst-1</italic>) leads to a larval arrest phenotype due to a growth defect in the soma, while loss of <italic>nst-1</italic> specifically in the germ line causes germline stem cells to undergo a cell cycle arrest. <italic>nst-1</italic> mutants exhibit reduced levels of rRNAs, suggesting defects in ribosome biogenesis. However, NST-1 is generally not present in regions of the nucleolus where rRNA transcription and processing occurs, so this reduction is likely secondary to a different defect in ribosome biogenesis. Transgenic studies indicate that NST-1 requires its N-terminal domain for stable expression and both its G1 GTPase and intermediate domains for proper germ line function. Our data support a role for <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin in cell growth and proliferation by promoting ribosome biogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Stem cells are carefully poised between the alternate fates of proliferation and differentiation. The regulation of this choice is a complex one that occurs on many different levels. One major influence controlling this choice derives signals emanating from the nucleolus, which serves dual roles as the site of ribosome biogenesis and as a repository for sequestered key regulatory factors. The nucleolar GTPase nucleostemin has recently been identified as a potential link between stem cell proliferation and nucleolar function, but its exact role in the nucleolus has not been directly addressed in a metazoan. Here, we use the model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic> to investigate the function of nucleostemin in both differentiated cells and proliferating stem cells. We show that nucleostemin probably acts to regulate ribosome biogenesis, and through this process controls cell proliferation. We also suggest that, at least in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the function of nucleostemin is not restricted to proliferating stem cells, but that it also functions in differentiated cells to control cell growth. Our study highlights the complexity of the role of the nucleolus in regulation of cell growth and division.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nucleolus is a dynamic structure to which an increasing diversity of functions is ascribed. Previously known primarily as the central site of ribosome subunit biosynthesis, the nucleolus has recently been recognized as a coordination center for many processes related to cell growth and proliferation, in addition to ribosome biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Boisvert1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The nucleolus changes size and appearance in response to metabolic and growth cues received by the cell when in interphase, suggesting that active signaling between external stimuli and the nucleolus exists. It can also serve as a repository for proteins with a wide variety of functions related to cell proliferation and genome integrity. For instance, key cell cycle proteins such as CDC14 are regulated by their coordinated release from the nucleolus at certain stages of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Shou1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Stem cells in particular are likely to rely on nucleolar regulation of cellular growth and proliferation. Regulation of telomerase activity is critical for the ability of stem cells to undergo self-renewing divisions and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) can be found in the nucleolus at certain stages of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Blasco1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, nucleolar mechanisms that permit rapid and robust responses to genotoxic stress are also likely to be especially prominent in stem cells, where maintaining integrity of the genome is of paramount importance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Hong1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, in response to DNA damage, RNA polymerase I activity in the nucleolus is down-regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Kruhlak1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, and proteins that inhibit p53 are sequestered in the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Weber1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Stem cells are delicately balanced between division and differentiation, and the nucleolus is a convenient place to hold transcription factors that affect differentiation. For instance, the transcription factor Hand1 is sequestered in the nucleolus of trophoblast stem cells, and its release directs those cells to differentiate into giant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Martindill1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, Polycomb factors are sequestered in the nucleolus during <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatogenesis to permit differentiation of primary spermatocytes into mature spermatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Chen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A recently identified, highly conserved factor named nucleostemin is a potential link between nucleolar function and stem cell-specific processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Tsai1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. It is preferentially expressed in stem cells and other proliferating cells, and shuttles between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm via its GTPase activity in a cell cycle-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Tsai2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Depletion or overexpression of nucleostemin in cell culture impairs normal cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Tsai1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether nucleostemin modulates some aspect of ribosome biogenesis or whether it has a different function that is more specific to stem cells and other rapidly proliferating cell types, remains unresolved. Mammalian nucleostemin is not present in the portion of the nucleolus where ribosomal RNA synthesis and processing occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Politz1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that it does not have a role in initial aspects of ribosome biogenesis. However, the class of nucleolar GTPases to which nucleostemin belongs includes yeast Nug1, which acts to export pre-60S ribosomal subunits out of the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Bassler1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, it is not known in which compartment of the cell nucleostemin function is actually required, or whether it is the act of shuttling between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm itself that is the critical activity. If the latter, cargo or associated proteins have remained unidentified. Thus, how nucleostemin might function in the nucleolus in proliferating cells is unknown.</p><p>We have investigated nucleostemin function in somatic and germline stem cell division in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a multicellular organism that permits the study of nucleostemin during both proliferation and differentiation in vivo. Previous gene expression profiling experiments in our lab indicated that <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin, here named <italic>nst-1</italic>, is preferentially expressed in proliferating germ cells (unpublished data). We found that global loss of nucleostemin (<italic>nst-1</italic>) resulted in a larval arrest phenotype and failure of growth. Loss of <italic>nst-1</italic> specifically in the germ line, but not the soma, caused germline stem cells to fail to proliferate. Ribosomal RNA production is decreased in <italic>nst-1</italic> mutants prior to any obvious defects in the animal, suggesting that <italic>nst-1</italic> is required for ribosome biogenesis. NST-1 protein is localized to the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm, but in contrast to mammalian nucleostemin, NST-1 is found in both terminally differentiated, non-cycling cells as well as in proliferating cells. Transgenic studies indicated that NST-1 requires its N-terminal domain for stable expression, and requires both the G1 GTPase and intermediate domains for function in the germ line. Our results suggest that nucleostemin regulates ribosome biogenesis to mediate its effects on cell growth and proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Lack of <italic>nst-1</italic> Causes Larval Arrest due to a Growth Defect</title><p>To functionally characterize <italic>nst-1</italic>, we isolated an <italic>nst-1</italic> deletion mutant, <italic>vr6</italic>, by PCR screening of a mutagenized worm library.

We measured the length of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> and wild type larvae from head to tail at multiple timepoints during larval development, beginning immediately after hatching as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Boxem1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The genotypes were indistinguishable in length for the first four hours of post-embryonic development, after which point <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> larvae failed to grow significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6). This growth defect precedes essentially all postembryonic cell divisions, suggesting that it is not solely due to defective larval cell divisions, but also a failure of existing cells to support growth.</p><p>To ascertain whether <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants undergo any normal larval blast cell divisions, we looked at the division of intestinal cells. At hatching, wild-type animals have 20 intestinal cells, 14 of which divide at the L1 molt resulting in 34 intestinal nuclei. <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants also have 20 intestinal cells at hatching, but these cells do not divide at the L1 molt as seen in controls (20 versus 31 cells at 16 hours post hatching; n&#x02265;9). We next examined the division of germ cells in <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants during L1 development. In order to distinguish germ cells from somatic cells, we used a strain where P granules are marked by RFP. We found that the precursor germ cells Z<sub>2</sub> and Z<sub>3</sub> are present in PGL-1::RFP; <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants similar to controls (n&#x02265;10). Eight hours post hatching, PGL-1::RFP; <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> animals had significantly less germ cells than control PGL-1::RFP animals (3.7 versus 7.1; p&#x0003c;6.34&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>; n&#x02265;7). The reduction in germ cell divisions in PGL-1::RFP; <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants was also evident at the L1 molt (5.5 versus 12 in PGL-1::RFP controls; p&#x0003c;1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10). Therefore, the <italic>nst-1</italic> lesion causes larval arrest due to a defect that occurs very early during post-embryonic development, and which subsequently may impair later larval cell divisions in both the germ line and the soma.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>nst-1</italic> Acts in the Germ Line to Promote Germ Cell Proliferation</title><p>Because nucleostemin has a conserved function in modulating cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Beekman1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, we wanted to examine the effects of loss of <italic>nst-1</italic> in the germ line, which contains proliferating germ cells in both larvae and adults.

We found that loss of <italic>nst-1</italic> in the soma leads to larval arrest and cell growth defects, while a lack of <italic>nst-1</italic> in the germ line causes germ cells to undergo a cell cycle arrest. Our work provides several lines of evidence suggesting that <italic>nst-1</italic> controls proliferation and cell growth by regulating ribosome biogenesis: (1) NST-1 is required for larval development but appears dispensable for embryogenesis, similar to other factors important for ribosome biogenesis that are not ribosome subunits themselves, such as RBD-1 and FIB-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Saijou1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, (2) ribosomal RNA production is significantly reduced prior to any other detectable phenotype in <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants, indicating that it is a component of the initial defect and not a secondary consequence, (3) NST-1 is clearly related to yeast NUG1, which has a demonstrated role in ribosome subunit export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Bassler1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and (4) NST-1 is expressed in the nucleolus where ribosome biogenesis occurs.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>How Does <italic>nst-1</italic> Affect rRNA Levels?</title><p>We have shown by two independent methods that <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants have significantly reduced rRNA levels. The decreased rRNA levels seen in the <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutant are likely not due to a role for NST-1 processing, because NST-1 is absent from regions of robust rRNA processing within the nucleolus. In yeast, the related protein NUG1 has been shown to export RPL25.2, a pre-60S subunit, out of the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Bassler1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesize that NST-1 also shuttles partially assembled ribosomes in and out of the nucleolus. In the absence of functional NST-1, the ribosomal subunits would remain within the nucleolus, and ultimately affect global rRNA levels due to a negative feedback mechanism that results in decreased ribosome biogenesis. We attempted to test this possibility by determining whether a GFP-tagged ribosome subunit, RPL-25.2, was restricted to the nucleolus in <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants. However, even low expression levels of RPL-25.2::GFP made the animals too sick to analyze.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>How Conserved Are the Functional Domains of Nucleostemin?</title><p>Mutations in the highly conserved functional domains of NST-1 did not result in changes in subcellular localization seen in mammalian nucleostemin studies. We did however observe alterations in the spatial expression in the germ line for the &#x00394;GTP, &#x00394;I, and &#x00394;GTP&#x00394;I mutations in NST-1::GFP. We suggest that the alteration in spatial expression of NST-1 may be due to moderate de-stabilization of the mutant proteins. The NST-1(&#x00394;GTP)::GFP and NST-1(&#x00394;I)::GFP transgenic lines are at least partially able to rescue the somatic defects of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants, arguing that neither domain is absolutely essential in the soma. The inability of the NST-1(&#x00394;GTP&#x00394;I )::GFP transgenic line to rescue the somatic phenotype of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants may be due to incomplete expression, although we believe this is unlikely because it is expressed as broadly as the &#x00394;GTP lines that do rescue this phenotype. Rather, we think it more likely that losing both the G1 GTPase domain and the intermediate domain in combination is more deleterious than loss of either alone.</p><p>Interestingly, the NST-1(&#x00394;GTP)::GFP and NST-1(&#x00394;I)::GFP transgenic lines are not able to rescue the germline defects of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants, despite being expressed in the germ line. This observation argues that both domains are necessary for NST-1 function in the germ line, and suggests that the functional domains of NST-1 may have different roles in the soma and germ line. Another possibility is that NST-1 needs to be ubiquitously expressed in the germ line to maintain proper germ cell development.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Does Nucleostemin Have a Conserved Role in Modulating Proliferation by Regulating Ribosome Biogenesis?</title><p>To date, it has been shown that <italic>S. cerevisae</italic>, <italic>S. pombe</italic>, and, in this work, <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin modulates cell growth and proliferation by regulating ribosome biogenesis. The <italic>S. pombe</italic> NUG1 homologue Grn1 is involved in 60S biogenesis, and Grn1 mutants have a severe growth defect with a significant reduction in mature rRNA species similar to the <italic>C. elegans nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutant phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Du1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. It has not been elucidated whether mammalian nucleostemin regulates some aspect of ribosome biogenesis, or whether it has diverged to have an additional function that is specific to stem cells or other rapidly proliferating cells. The expression of mammalian nucleostemin is apparently restricted to proliferating cells, but our studies show that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, NST-1 is expressed in terminally differentiated cells as well as in proliferating cells. Moreover, the effect of mutation of individual domains on localization and function is different between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals. This difference in regulation suggests that perhaps the role of nucleostemin is more limited or specialized in mammals. Consistent with this possibility, we were unable to rescue the <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutant phenotype using mouse nucleostemin cDNA, despite having a similar expression pattern and levels to NST-1::GFP, which suggests that there may indeed be functional differences between mouse and <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin.</p><p>Due to the fundamental requirement for translation in living cells, it has been difficult to determine exactly how ribosome biogenesis is specifically connected to cell growth and proliferation. Nucleostemin is potentially a key link between these two processes, as it could regulate the rate of translation to cell growth by modulating the rate of 60S subunit formation in response to cell-extrinsic cues. Further studies directed toward identifying the cargo of nucleostemin and the cell cycle-specific mechanisms controlling its ability to shuttle in and out of the nucleolus will likely shed light on this key question.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains and Maintenance</title><p>Nematode strain maintenance was as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Brenner1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>C. elegans</italic> strain N2 was used as the wild type strain in addition to the following variants: LGI, <italic>cep-1(gk138)</italic>, <italic>gld-1(q485)</italic>; LGII, <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic>; LG III, <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic>, <italic>ced-4(n1162)</italic>, <italic>unc-119(ed3)</italic>, <italic>ncl-1(e1865)</italic>, <italic>unc-36(e251)</italic>, <italic>rrf-1(pk1417)</italic>; LGV, <italic>qIs19(lag-2</italic>::GFP).
