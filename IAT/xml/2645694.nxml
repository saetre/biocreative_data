Here we report on the functional effects of a coding SNP, c.501G&#x0003e;C, which produces a single amino acid change (K&#x0003e;N at codon 167). Our study was aimed at elucidating whether the c.501G&#x0003e;C polymorphism changes the binding affinity of LOX-1 receptor altering its function. The presence of p.K167N mutation reduces ox-LDL binding and uptake. Ox-LDL activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2) is inhibited. Furthermore, ox-LDL induced biosynthesis of LOX-1 receptors is dependent on the p.K167N variation. In human macrophages, derived from c.501G&#x0003e;C heterozygous individuals, the ox-LDL induced LOX-1 46 kDa band is markedly lower than in induced macrophages derived from c.501G&#x0003e;C controls. Investigation of p.K167N mutation through molecular dynamics simulation and electrostatic analysis suggests that the ox-LDL binding may be attributed to the coupling between the electrostatic potential distribution and the asymmetric flexibility of the basic spine residues. The N/N-LOX-1 mutant has either interrupted electrostatic potential and asymmetric fluctuations of the basic spine arginines.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many biochemical and functional studies have suggested a fundamental role of oxidized low density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) and of their main receptor LOX-1 (oxidized low density lipoproteins receptor 1) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Metha1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Vohra1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>LOX-1 is a disulfide-linked homodimeric type II transmembrane receptor belonging to the C-type lectin family of scavenger receptors. Each subunit is composed by a short 34-residue cytoplasmic region, a single transmembrane segment, and an extracellular 80-residue &#x0201c;neck&#x0201d; domain, predicted to have a coiled coil structure, followed by a 130-residue C-terminal C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Sawamura1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The two CTLD domains form a heart-shaped homodimer, consisting of two antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheets flanked by two &#x003b1;-helices with three large loops protruding into the solvent. This fold is stabilized by three conserved intra-chain disulfide bonds and an inter-chain disulfide bridge, located at the N-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Ohki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Park1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, several association studies have characterized various polymorphisms (SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms) in <italic>OLR1</italic> gene, that encodes for LOX-1 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Mango1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Mango2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. It was shown that a linkage disequilibrium block of SNPs located in the <italic>OLR1</italic> gene introns 4, 5, and the 3&#x02032; untranslated region are associated to an increased susceptibility to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). These SNPs modulate the expression of a splicing isoform of LOX-1 receptor, named LOXIN, which protects macrophages against ox-LDL-mediated apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Mango2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. LOXIN is deficient in ox-LDL binding activity but interacts with LOX-1 receptors inhibiting its function through the formation of non-functional hetero-oligomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Biocca1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, conflicting results have been reported on the association between some polymorphisms in <italic>OLR1</italic> gene and coronary artery disease (CAD)/AMI susceptibility on the basis of study design, statistical analysis and interpretation of results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Morgan1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, a predicted functional SNP, the G&#x0003e;C transition at position 501 in the exon 4 has been studied, with different conclusions, as a possible valid genomic biomarker for potential CAD/AMI risk factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Mango1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Ohmori1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Knowles1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This SNP results in the Lys to Asn amino acid residue replacement at position 167 of the C-type lectin-like domain, in the extracellular portion of LOX-1 receptor. Since this is the ligand binding domain, the p.K167N variation may affect LOX-1 receptor response.</p><p>In order to test the effects of the p.K167N SNP, we investigated, at a molecular level, whether the c.501G&#x0003e;C polymorphism could affect LOX-1 receptor activity. Here we report the heterologous expression and functional characterization of wild&#x02013;type (K/K167) and mutated (N/N167 and K/N167) LOX-1 in different cell lines, including fibroblasts and human endothelial cells. K167N mutation of LOX-1 receptor markedly alters ox-LDL binding, uptake and its intracellular signalling. Investigation of p.K167N mutation through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, coupled with a time evolution analysis of electrostatic potential, provides an explanation for the drastic reduction of LOX-1 function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression of N167-V5 tagged variant</title><p>The native K/K167 (wt-LOX-1-V5) and mutated N/N167 (mut-LOX-1-V5) proteins have been ectopically expressed in different cell lines, including fibroblasts (COS) and human endothelial cells (HUVEC) and studied by Western blot.

In order to elucidate the mechanism by which the c.501G&#x0003e;C polymorphism may influence the risk of atherosclerosis and MI, we have performed a detailed biochemical and functional analysis of the p.K167N mutation of LOX-1 receptor.</p><p>We have analysed the effects of heterologous expression of p.K167N variant in mammalian fibroblasts and human endothelial cells. We show that both wt-LOX-1 and mut-LOX-1 variant display a stable dimeric structure and tend to form higher MW oligomers <italic>in vivo</italic>. When the two proteins are co-transfected, they form hetero-oligomers, in particular hetero-dimers and hetero-tetramers. Moreover, they have the same glycosylation/maturation process and the missense p.K167N mutation does not affect LOX-1 receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane. Importantly, when ectopically expressed, the amount of exposed receptors, at the steady state, is identical. However, at a functional level, the presence of p.K167N mutation in LOX-1 receptors reduces ox-LDL binding and uptake. In particular, the binding activity is 30&#x02013;35&#x00025; lower in case of homozygosity for N/N-LOX-1 expression and 20&#x00025; reduced in case of heterozygosity, obtained by co-transfection of K/K167 and N/N167 DNA plasmids at a ratio 1&#x02236;1. It is worth noting that the presence of the C-terminal tags (myc- and V5-tags) in LOX-1 receptors and its variants does not have any influence on the reported effects, as demonstrated by transfection and functional analysis with the non-tagged proteins (18 and unpublished results).</p><p>ERK 1/2 phosphorylation is specifically stimulated by ox-LDL in LOX-1 expressing cells (12, 13 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004648-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Since p.K167N mutation affects ox-LDL binding activity, we next examined the activation of the extracellular signalling-regulated kinases ERK 1/2 in K/K167, K/N and N/N167 transfected cells. Expression of K/N and N/N167 LOX-1 receptors in fibroblasts resulted in a marked inhibition of ERK activation (85&#x00025; reduction in case of homozigosis and 70&#x00025; in case of heterozygosis) with respect to ERK activation in wt LOX-1 expressing cells, indicating the impairment of the ox-LDL-dependent intracellular response. ERKs belong to a family of mitogen-activated protein kinases associated to a variety of biological responses, depending upon the cell type, the stimulus and the duration of activation. These include also injury-induced tissue damage and apoptosis in some cell types and organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004648-Zhuang1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Although we do not have evidences on the downstream effects of the observed impairment of ox-LDL-dependent ERK phosphorylation, further studies are likely to clarify this important issue.

From modeling studies, the first important effect of the single p.K167N mutation is an altered balance of charges in the network formed by E166, K167, E170 and K171. This network includes the mutation site and alterations, i.e. the uncoupled negative charge of E170, are observed either in the homozygous N/N-LOX-1 and in the heterozygous K/N-LOX-1 mutant. Secondly, it was observed an asymmetric flexibility of the basic spine residues, in particular in the N/N-LOX-1 mutant. We hypothesize that the variation of potential distribution, observed in N/N-LOX-1, is due both to an unbalanced network of charges and to an altered flexibility of the basic spine residues that, together, induce a marked inhibition of ox-LDL recognition. In the heterozygous K/N-LOX-1 mutant the unbalanced network of charges alters the potential distribution but is not supported by the basic spine arginines large asymmetric fluctuation, explaining the lower level of impairment.</p><p>Ox-LDL is considered to play a fundamental role in the entire process of atherogenesis.
