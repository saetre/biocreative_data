Here, we show that these proteins can not bind simultaneously to ribosomes and moreover, a chimera containing the first 137 amino acids of Mrt4 and the last 190 amino acids from P0 can partially complement the absence of the ribosomal protein in a conditional P0 null mutant. This chimera is associated with ribosomes isolated from this strain when grown under restrictive conditions, although its binding is weaker than that of P0. These ribosomes contain less P1 and P2 proteins, the other ribosomal stalk components. Similarly, the interaction of the L12 protein, a stalk base component, is affected by the presence of the chimera. These results indicate that Mrt4 and P0 bind to the same site in the 25S rRNA. Indeed, molecular dynamics simulations using modelled Mrt4 and P0 complexes provide further evidence that both proteins bind similarly to rRNA, although their interaction with L12 displays notable differences. Together, these data support the participation of the Mrt4 protein in the assembly of the P0 protein into the ribosome and probably, that also of the L12 protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ribosomal P0 protein, the orthologue of bacterial ribosomal L10 protein, is the central component of the eukaryotic ribosomal stalk. This structure is formed by the association of P0 with two heterodimers of the P1 and P2 acidic phosphoproteins, the counterparts of prokaryotic protein L7/L12. Although the stalk seems to essentially fulfill the same role in the translational machinery of all organisms, which is related to the interaction and activity of several soluble factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), the eukaryotic P0/(P1&#x02013;P2)<sub>2</sub> complex has some peculiar properties that are not attributed to the prokaryotic structure. These differences have led to the proposal that this complex might modulate ribosomal activity, which does not yet appear to be the case in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Among these peculiarities, the eukaryotic domain seems to undergo a process of assembly/disassembly during translation, which can be detected as an exchange between the ribosome bound P1/P2 proteins and the free proteins present in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>). It is not clear when this exchange occurs but it seems most likely to take place during ribosome dissociation, after the termination step. It is possible that as a result of this process, the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> ribosome population does not have a homogeneous P1/P2 content. Thus, particles containing different amounts of these acidic proteins, or even totally lacking them, can be detected in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Since the proposed modulatory role of the ribosome stalk is based on the relative proportion of ribosomes with different P1/P2 content, it is fundamental to understand how this ribosome domain is assembled and how the assembly/disassembly process is controlled.</p><p>The stalk must be assembled as part of the ribosome and ribosome assembly in eukaryotes is an extremely complicated process that remains far from being understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A large number of proteins and small rRNA molecules, generically known as <italic>trans</italic>-acting or assembly factors, participate in the assembly process. Many of these components have been identified in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, although their specific function is only known in a limited number of cases. In yeast, ribosome biogenesis starts in the nucleolus with the transcription of the pre-rRNAs, which bind to a considerable number of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors and ribosomal proteins in order to form the 90S particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). After three consecutive processing steps, the 90S pre-ribosomal particle, which contains the 35S pre-rRNA, yields a pre-40S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and a pre-60S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). These two particles follow independent pathways in the nucleus that include the formation of a still poorly defined number of intermediates, especially in the case of the pre-60S. Late pre-ribosomal particles are then exported into the cytoplasm where they undergo the final maturation steps.</p><p>The information available regarding stalk assembly is still scarce. The P0 protein has been detected in different pre-ribosomal complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>). However, additional information will be required before a conclusion can be reached in regard to stage in which the protein is assembled. Similarly, there is no direct evidence that the P1/P2 stalk proteins are present in pre-ribosomal particles and it is generally assumed that they are assembled in the cytoplasm.</p><p>Significant sequence homology has been found between a number of ribosomal proteins and several assembly factors. Thus, the L24 ribosomal protein (Rpl24) is homologous to Rlp24, as is L7 (Rpl7) to Rlp7 and Rps9 to Imp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In the case of the Rpl24/Rlp24 pair, it has been proposed that the ribosomal protein might replace the assembly factor in the late pre-ribosome particles as one of the last maturation steps that take place in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the P0 protein and Mrt4 share notable amino acid homology. Mrt4 was initially thought to be involved in mRNA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) but it was later found in pre-ribosomes, and it is now considered a component of the ribosome assembly machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The Mrt4 protein has been detected in particles purified using tagged proteins involved in the early and mid-stages of 60S ribosomal subunit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), suggesting that it fulfills a specific role at the beginning of the 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis pathway. However, Mrt4 has recently been associated with factors involved in the late stages of 60S assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), making its true role far from clear.</p><p>Here, we have investigated the functional relationship between P0 and Mrt4, finding that both proteins can interact with the same region in the rRNA but that they are mutually exclusive in the ribosome. These data support the hypothesis that Mrt4 binds first to pre-60S ribosomal particles, occupying the P0 site in the earlier assembly steps, and that it is then later displaced by the ribosomal protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> W303-1B (MAT &#x003b1;, leu2-3,112, ura3-1, trp1-1, his3-11,15, ade2-1, can1-100) was the parental control strain. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> W303dM (MAT &#x003b1;, leu2-3,112, ura3-1, trp1-1, his3-11,15, ade2-1, can1-100, MRT4::KanMX4) and W303dMGP0 (MAT &#x003b1;, leu2-3,112, ura3-1, trp1-1, his3-11,15, ade2-1, can1-100, RPP0::URA3-P<sub>GAL1</sub>-RPP0, MRT4::KanMX4) were derived from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> W303-1B and W303dGP0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), respectively, by deleting the MRT4 gene using the KanMX4 module that carries short flanking MRT4 homology regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

For the Mrt4 and P0 proteins, the PDB 1ZAV chain A structure was used as a template, while the L12 protein was modelled using chain L from PDB 487D. The yeast ribosomal RNA stalk was modelled by mutating the fragment between residues 1145 and 1218 from the PDB 3CC2 chain 0 with the graphic software InsightII (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The L12-RNA-Mrt4 and L12-RNA-P0 complexes were constructed by means of structural alignments using MAMMOTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and with the G, I and 0 chains from PDB 3CC2 as a template. The hydrogen atom positions, standard atomic charges and radii were assigned according to the ff99 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The two modelled complexes were immersed in cubic boxes of TIP3P water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) sufficiently large to guarantee that the shortest distance between the solute and the edge of the box was &#x0003e;15&#x02009;&#x000c5;.

Three consecutive minimizations were performed: (i) the first involving only hydrogen atoms; (ii) the second only the water molecules and ions; and (iii) the entire system.</p></sec><sec><title>Simulation details</title><p>The minimized starting structures, prepared as indicated previously, were simulated in the NPT ensemble using Periodic Boundary Conditions and Particle Mesh Ewald method to treat long-range electrostatic interactions. The systems were then heated and equilibrated in two steps: (i) 200&#x02009;ps of MD heating of the whole system from 100 to 300&#x02009;K; and (ii), equilibration of the entire system during 1.0&#x02009;ns at 300&#x02009;K. The equilibrated structures were the starting points for 25&#x02009;ns of unconstrained MD simulations at constant temperature (300&#x02009;K) and pressure (1&#x02009;atm). The SHAKE algorithm was used to keep bonds involving H atoms at their equilibrium length, allowing a 2&#x02009;fs time step for the integration of Newton's equations of motion. The ff99 and TIP3P force fields, as implemented in the AMBER 8 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), were used to describe the proteins and water molecules, respectively. The last 15&#x02009;ns of each trajectory were used to sample frames at 1&#x02009;ps intervals, which were subsequently used for the analysis.</p><p>Effective free binding energies were estimated qualitatively using the MM-GBSA approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The MM-GBSA method approaches the free energy of binding as a sum of a molecular mechanics (MM) interaction term, with a contribution of solvation from a generalized Born (GB) model and with a surface area (SA) contribution to account for the non-polar part of desolvation. These calculations were performed for each snapshot of the simulations using the appropriate module within AMBER 8. Averages were taken every 20 snapshots, and a normal distribution was fitted to the measured free energy density.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>The P0 and Mrt4 proteins can not bind simultaneously to the ribosome</title><p>The notable sequence homology between the ribosomal P0 protein and the Mrt4 protein, a putative ribosome assembly factor, suggests they may be functionally related during ribosome assembly. As a first step to explore this hypothesis, the distribution of both proteins was assessed after sucrose gradient centrifugation of a total cell extract from the parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). As expected, P0 was present in all the ribosomal particles, except in the 40S subunit, whereas the Mrt4 protein was detected in the 60S and 80S peaks but not in the polysomes. The absence of Mrt4 from the polysomes suggested that it was bound to translation inactive particles, probably pre-ribosomal particles that are found in the gradient overlapping the 60S/80S region. Alternatively, both proteins might be bound to a fraction of the mature ribosomal population that is inactive due to the presence of Mrt4. To resolve this dilemma, particles carrying either tagged Mrt4-TAP or tagged P0-TAP were affinity purified and the presence of the partner proteins was analyzed as described in the Material and methods section. The presence of ribosomal proteins L1 and L12 in the samples eluted from the columns indicate that real protein complexes and not individual proteins were purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). While P0 was absent from Mrt4-TAP purified particles, Mrt4 was not found in P0-TAP ribosomes, indicating that both proteins seem to be unable to bind to the ribosome at the same time. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Total extracts from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> W303-1B were resolved in a 7&#x02013;50% sucrose gradient and the fractions corresponding to the gradient top (T), the peaks corresponding to the 40S, 60S and 80S particles, as well as the first four peaks of the polysome region were collected and analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE.

This homology suggests that both proteins might interact with the same region in the 25S rRNA, the GTPase Associated Region (GAR). To test this possibility, a protein chimera was constructed by replacing the first 121 amino acids of P0 with the equivalent region from Mrt4, which contains 16 additional residues at the amino end. The chimeric gene was cloned into the centromeric plasmid pFL37 under the control of the P0 promoter region, yielding the pFL37-Mrt4/P0 plasmid, which was used to transform the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain W303dMGP0. This strain is a conditional null P0 mutant that carries the genomic copy of gene <italic>RPP0</italic> under the control of the GAL1 promoter and since P0 is an essential protein, the strain does not grow in the presence of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). As expected, the parental W303dMGP0 was unable to grow in the presence of glucose while transformation with pFL37-Mrt4/P0 permitted growth in this carbon source, albeit at a lower rate than that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that the Mrt4/P0 chimera can partially complement the lack of P0. Indeed, in a YEPD liquid medium the transformed strain expressing the chimera had a doubling time around four-fold higher than the parental <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> W303. In these experiments the W303 and W303dM strains were used as a positive control. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Growth test of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain expressing the Mrt4/P0 chimera.

In contrast, polysomes were practically absent in extracts from W303dMGP0 transformed with an empty plasmid and maintained in a glucose medium for 48&#x02009;h, which accumulate free subunits and pre-ribosomal particles, in agreement with previous data from similar conditional P0 null mutants grown in restrictive conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Polysome profiles from the W303dMGP0-Mrt4/P0 strain grown in the presence of galactose (<bold>A</bold>) or glucose (<bold>B</bold>), as well as strain W303dMGP0 transformed with an empty plasmid and grown either in galactose (<bold>C</bold>) or shifted to a medium containing glucose for 48&#x02009;h (<bold>D</bold>).

Unfortunately, the crystal structure of these proteins has not yet been resolved, information that would confirm this prediction. However, the high resolution structure of the complex formed by the 23S rRNA GAR domain, protein L11 and the NTD of L10E in <italic>Haloarcula marismortui</italic> is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Given the close homology between these components and their <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> orthologues, namely the 25S rRNA GAR domain and the ribosomal proteins L12 and P0, respectively, we have modelled the structure of the equivalent yeast complex and analyzed this through molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Likewise, a similar complex containing the Mrt4 NTD instead of P0 NTD was also modelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). A summary of the protein&#x02013;RNA interactions detected are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp209/DC1">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</ext-link>. Although both these complexes were similar, some interesting differences were also detected. The P0 and Mrt4 proteins both interact with the 25S RNA GAR, mainly through the sugar-phosphate backbone and principally at four points around nucleotides G1218, G1229, G1258 and G1281, the equivalent residues to those found in the <italic>H. marismortui</italic> structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). However, in the complex containing Mrt4 there are fewer contacts. From an energetic point of view, and considering that only the relative numbers are really significant, the MM-GBSA analysis of both models indicated that P0 binds a little tighter than Mrt4. Indeed, the predicted binding affinity for the 25S rRNA GAR-L12 complex was of &#x02212;152.64 (SD 9.53) and &#x02212;124.93 (SD 9.20) kcal/mol, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp209/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2A</ext-link>). However, the most interesting differences were found in the interaction of the P0 NTD and the Mrt4 NTD with the L12 protein in their respective complexes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp209/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>). Our model predicts that the L12 protein contacts P0 through a F109<sup>L12</sup>&#x02013;K174<sup>P0</sup> hydrophobic interaction, as well as a R111<sup>L12</sup>&#x02013;R173<sup>P0</sup> ionic interaction mediated by the U1257 phosphate group, both at positions equivalent to those reported for the L10E&#x02013;L11 interaction in <italic>H. marismortui</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In contrast, L12 interacted with Mrt4&#x02009;at three sites, two of which were similar to those found in the P0 interaction, while a third R117<sup>L12</sup>&#x02013;E107<sup>Mrt4</sup> ionic contact took place. This stronger interaction seems to pull the three L12 &#x003b2; strands closer to Mrt4, in this way filling the gap between both proteins in the P0 complex and inducing a significant conformational change in L12. Indeed, the predicted affinity of L12 binding was &#x02212;271.59 (SD 12.8) kcal/mol in the P0 complex as opposed to &#x02212;175.39 (SD 16.5) kcal/mol in the case of Mrt4 complex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp209/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2B</ext-link>). <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Predicted structure of the complexes formed by the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 25S rRNA GAR, the L12 protein and the NTD of either the Mrt4 (<bold>B</bold>) or P0 (<bold>A</bold>).

Moreover, affinity chromatography purification shows that neither P0 is present in Mrt4-TAP purified particles, nor is Mrt4 present in P0-TAP ribosomes. These results are in agreement with the suggestion that Mrt4 acts as a ribosomal assembly factor and they are compatible with the hypothesis that both proteins compete for the same site in such particles. In fact, the strong amino acid homology in both proteins, especially at the NTD where the P0 rRNA binding site is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), indicates that their incompatibility in the ribosome might be due to the fact that both proteins bind to the same site in the nucleic acid molecule. Indeed, in the case of P0 the binding site corresponds to the highly conserved GTPase associated region, the so called GAR domain of the 25S rRNA. A P0 protein carrying the NTD region from Mrt4, the Mrt4/P0 chimera, could partially complement the growth deficiency derived from the absence of the stalk component, which is in full agreement with this proposal. Moreover, Mrt4/P0 is found in the ribosomes from the cells expressing the chimera, indicating that the Mrt4 domain in this protein indeed binds to the 25S rRNA GAR. However, this interaction is apparently weaker since the chimera is released from the ribosomes at lower salt concentrations than those required to release P0, although this might be expected since the Mrt4 protein is also washed off pre-ribosomal particles under less stringent conditions.</p><p>The presence of Mrt4/P0 also affects the binding of the P1 and P2 acidic proteins that are present in lower amounts in the ribosomes containing the chimera, probably one of the reasons for the slow growth phenotype of this strain. It seems that the binding site for the P1/P2 heterodimers is altered in the chimera, despite the fact it is located between residues 189 and 260 of the CTD, apparently far from the rRNA binding site. However, this effect is in agreement with previous data showing that modifications in the region downstream of the P1/P2 binding site have a negative effect on the binding of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). These long range effects are interesting with regards the acidic protein exchange process that takes place during translation in eukaryotes and indeed, they suggest that the stability of the P0&#x02013;P1/P2 complex is susceptible to conformational changes in the P0 NTD. If so, cyclical changes induced in P0 during translation, perhaps at the termination stage, could facilitate the release of P1/P2.</p><p>Together, the biochemical data suggest that P0 and Mrt4 do indeed bind to the same site in the rRNA. Moreover, they provide experimental support for the proposal that Mrt4 binds first to the pre-ribosome and that it is replaced by P0 at a later stage, as previously speculated for the Rlp24 and Rpl24 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, in contrast to the Rpl24/Rlp24 pair, this exchange is likely to take place in the nucleus since P0 has been reported in nuclear pre-ribosomal particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), and in fact, the P0 protein is not found free in the cytoplasm. How this replacement takes place currently remains unclear, although it probably involves the action of other assembly factors. An ongoing analysis of pre-ribosomal particles from cells lacking Mrt4, not an essential protein, should provide useful information in this respect.</p><p>The crystal structure of the ribosomal stalk in yeast mature ribosomes and pre-ribosomal particles is unfortunately not available. However, using the high resolution structure of the <italic>H. marismortui</italic> ribosomal stalk base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), we modelled the corresponding <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> complex formed by the 79 nucleotide long 25S rRNA GAR, the L12 protein and the P0 NTD, as well as an equivalent complex containing Mrt4. A molecular dynamics analysis of both structures identified expected similarities, as well as some interesting differences. The Mrt4 protein and the P0 NTD interact in a similar manner with the other two components, although the estimated energy of interaction indicates that Mrt4 binding to the complex is weaker, probably due to the fewer contact points with the rRNA. This is in agreement with the biochemical data showing that the assembly factor starts to be released at lower salt concentrations. Nevertheless, from a structural point of view, the most interesting difference lies in the interaction of both proteins with the L12 protein. The contact between Mrt4 and L12 is predicted to be stronger and results in a notable conformational change of the ribosomal protein in the complex. Both proteins come closer together, filling up an empty space existing in the P0 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp209/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). In agreement with these structural data, the estimated binding energy for L12 is notably higher in the Mrt4 than in the P0 modelled complex. The biological significance of these differences is currently obscure since very little is known about the functional role of Mrt4, but our data suggest that this protein might also have an important role in the assembly of the protein L12.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp209/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp209_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp209_nar-00072-r-2009-File010.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci&#x000f3;n (Spain) (BFU2006-00365 to J.P.G.B., BFU2007-60151 to J. de la C., BFU2007-64280/BMC to M.R., CSD2006-00023); Fundaci&#x000f3;n Ram&#x000f3;n Areces (institutional grant to C.B.M.S.O.).
