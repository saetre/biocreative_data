Each ommatidium consists of 8 photoreceptors, 4 lens-secreting cone cells and 2 primary pigment cells. Ommatidia are separated from each other by secondary and tertiary (2&#x000b0; and 3&#x000b0;) pigment cells, and by sensory bristles. Each of these cell types occupies a stereotypic position within the lattice. Pattern formation in the eye is initiated in the 3rd larval instar as a wave of morphogenesis sweeps across the epithelial cell layer in the eye imaginal disc. First, eight photoreceptor cells and four lens-secreting cone cells are specified through sequential inductive interactions. During early pupal stages, cone cells come to cover the photoreceptors. They also recruit two primary pigment cells, which surround the cone cells. Cells that have not been specified at this stage form the interommatidial cell (IOC) lattice, which will ultimately be composed of secondary pigment cells, tertiary pigment cells, and bristles. These cells initially appear undifferentiated and unpatterned, with several layers of IOCs often separating neighboring ommatidia. Reorganization begins with presumptive lattice cells maximizing their contacts with primary pigment cells rather than with other lattice cells. This results in each lattice cell being connecting to at least two primary pigment cells, and with each ommatidia being separated by a single layer of lattice cells, arranged in an end-to-end chain. About two-thirds of these cells will go on to develop as secondary pigment cells, each of which makes up one face of the ommatidial hexagon, or tertiary pigment cells, which make up alternative vertices, with bristle groups making up the other vertices. The remainder of the IOCs are eliminated by apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Much cell death in <italic>Drosophila </italic>takes the form of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Caspase proteases are the central executioners of apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Dronc is required for many cell deaths in the fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], including those of the IOCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Once activated through interactions with the adaptor Ark, Dronc cleaves and activates effector caspases such as Drice and Dcp-1 that are thought to bring about cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Drice is activated during the stages in which IOC death occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and Drice mutants lack some, but not all, IOC death, highlighting the importance of this protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. DIAP1 is a cell death inhibitor that suppresses the activity of Dronc and caspases activated by Dronc through several different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Reaper (Rpr) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], Head involution defective (Hid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], Grim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], Sickle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and Jafrac2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], known collectively as the RHG proteins after their founding members Rpr, Hid and Grim, bind to DIAP1 through a short-N-terminal motif and disrupt DIAP1-caspase interactions through several mechanisms, each of which has the effect of unleashing a cascade of apoptosis-inducing caspase activity. Flies that lack Hid show defects in Drice activation and IOC cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], while mutants for the other proteins are not available. Together these observations suggest that IOC death is driven, at least in part, by Hid-dependent inhibition of DIAP1, which facilitates activation of Dronc and Drice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> schematic).</p><p>Ubiquitination, and thus presumably deubiquitination, plays several important roles in the regulation of this cell death pathway. DIAP1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] that can ubiquitinate and inactivate Dronc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. DIAP1 can also promote the ubiquitination and degradation of other pro-apoptotic proteins that it binds such as Reaper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. DIAP1 also ubiquitinates itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and DIAP1 ubiquitination can be stimulated by the RHG proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Many components of the ubiquitin pathway have been identified as regulators of RHG-mediated cell death. Examples include the ubiquitin activating enzyme (<italic>uba1</italic>), two components of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase (<italic>skpA </italic>and a novel F-box gene, <italic>morgue</italic>) and the deubiquitinating enzyme <italic>fat facets </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, the points at which these proteins work to regulate death are largely unknown.</p><p>As noted above, the IOCs are initially arranged in double or triple rows between ommatidia in the pupal eye. IOCs then rearrange in an end-to end configuration to form a single layer or row of cells separating primary pigment cells of different ommatidia. Cell death only occurs after this rearrangement, or sorting, is complete. A key player in this process is the immunoglobulin family protein Roughest (Rst). In the absence of roughest the IOCs remain stacked side-by-side in multiple rows and IOC death does not occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Rst is localized in IOCs to the border between IOCs and primaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], in a process that requires DE-cadherin and Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Recent observations suggest that Rst promotes sorting by physically interacting with Hibris, another immunoglobulin family membrane protein expressed in primary pigment cells that is also required for IOC sorting and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The EGF receptor pathway provides important anti-apoptotic signals to IOCs. Loss of EGFR signaling in the pupal eye results in fewer IOCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], while activation of EGFR or Ras promotes IOC survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. EGFR activation promotes IOC survival at least in part by negatively regulating <italic>hid </italic>levels and pro-apoptotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Pro-survival signaling through the EGFR is antagonized by Notch-mediated signals (probably between IOCs), which are required to remove excess IOCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The amount of contact an IOC has with primary pigment cells (which produce EGFR-dependent survival signals) as opposed to other IOCs (which produce Notch-mediated signals that antagonise the EGFR pathway) is likely to be an important part of the calculus that determines IOC fate. Ubiquitination plays important roles in regulating both signaling pathways. The EGFR is monoubiquitinated following ligand binding, and this promotes receptor endocytosis and degradation, thus attenuating signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In the Notch pathway, monoubiquitination of both ligands and Notch by multiple E3 ligases is associated with endocytic events that promote signaling. Ubiquitination of Notch by other E3 ligases is associated with internalization and lysosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Other proteins that regulate IOC survival have been identified. The Runx DNA-binding protein Lozenge is required for IOC death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Lozenge pro-apoptotic activity is mediated by its ability to induce the expression of Argos, a secreted inhibitor of EGFR activation in cone cells, and 2&#x000b0; and 3&#x000b0; cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Lozenge also activates expression of Klumpfuss, a transcription factor with similarity to the Wilm's Tumor suppressor, in 2&#x000b0; and 3&#x000b0; cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Klumpfuss function is required for normal levels of IOC death, and genetic evidence suggests that it antagonizes EGFR signaling downstream of receptor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p><italic>echinus </italic>(<italic>ec</italic>), defined by a single allele, <italic>ec</italic><sup>1</sup>, was identified by Calvin Bridges in 1918 as a X-chromosome-linked, recessive, rough eye mutant (as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]). More recently, Wolff and Ready showed that <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>flies had decreased levels of IOC death, much like <italic>rst </italic>mutants. However, while IOC sorting failed to occur in <italic>rst </italic>animals, sorting was largely (though not completely) intact in <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Expression of the baculovirus caspase inhibitor p35 also prevents death but not sorting, giving rise to a pupal retinal phenotype with many similarities to (though not identical to) that observed in <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Together these observations have suggested that <italic>ec </italic>acts primarily subsequent to sorting, perhaps regulating cell death directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. To understand the role <italic>echinus </italic>plays in bringing about IOC death we generated a number of new <italic>echinus </italic>alleles and re-examined phenotypes associated with <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>following extensive outcrossing to remove modifiers. Multiple alleles, including putative null alleles, show defects in cell sorting as well as cell death. We cloned the <italic>echinus </italic>locus and found that it encodes multiple isoforms of a protein with homology to the ubiquitin specific protease (USP) family of proteases. Somewhat unexpectedly, versions of Echinus that lack residues thought to be important for USP catalytic activity can rescue the <italic>echinus </italic>loss-of-function sorting and cell death phenotypes. We were unable to detect significant interactions between loss- and gain-of-function <italic>echinus </italic>alleles and a number of known or suspected regulators of IOC death. <italic>echinus </italic>may primarily regulate cell sorting, with loss of death being only a consequence of an earlier defect in this process. Alternatively, <italic>echinus </italic>may regulate cell sorting and cell death, with regulation of death occurring at a novel point, perhaps through mechanisms that are independent of USP activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>CG2904 encodes echinus, which is expressed at low levels ubiquitously in the pupal retina</title><p>As a first step to cloning the <italic>echinus </italic>locus we used both EMS mutagenesis and P element excision to generate new <italic>echinus </italic>alleles. We identified an X chromosome-linked P element insertion line, <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>PlacZ</italic></sup>, with a recessive rough eye phenotype that failed to complement <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We generated a number of excisions of this element. The rough eye phenotype was reverted in some of these, indicating that the P element insertion was responsible for the <italic>echinus </italic>phenotype. The <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>PlacZ </italic></sup>transposon is located between CG2901 and CG2904, suggesting one or the other of these genes as good candidates to encode <italic>echinus</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>echinus </italic>gene structure, mutants and surrounding genomic region.

In contrast, adult eyes of <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>flies are rough (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), and extra IOCs are present in the pupal retinas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). To determine if CG2904 encodes <italic>echinus </italic>we generated flies expressing dsRNA corresponding to CG2904 in order to trigger RNAi-dependent knockdown of CG2904 expression, under the control of the eye-specific-GMR promoter (GMR-CG2904-RNAi). Consistent with this hypothesis, GMR-CG2904-RNAi flies had a rough eye phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) and extra IOCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). To create deletion alleles of CG2904 we generated excisions from a nearby P element insertion line, <italic>EP(X)1343</italic>, that is wildtype with respect to <italic>echinus </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Multiple excision lines were identified that had rough eyes as homozygotes. Each of these failed to complement <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>or <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>PlacZ</italic></sup>. Breakpoints for four of these were determined, and each was found to delete sequences within the CG2904 transcript. We have focused our analysis on one of these, designated <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>&#x00394;4 </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, J</xref>). Pupal eyes from <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>&#x00394;4 </sup>also showed extra IOCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>). We found that the CG2904 gene was also disrupted by the breakpoints of an excision allele generated from an alternate P element insertion (<italic>ec</italic><sup>&#x00394;9</sup>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>. Kramer, unpublished). This mutant also had rough eyes and extra IOCs (data not shown). More recently, a number of new P element insertion lines in the surrounding genomic region have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Several have a rough eye phenotype that fails to complement <italic>ec</italic><sup>1</sup>, and each of these is located near CG2904 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We also identified several new EMS alleles of <italic>echinus </italic>(see methods for details). We sequenced CG2904 coding sequences from one of these and identified an E125-Stop change in <italic>ec</italic><sup>56 </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

Finally, we sequenced CG2904 coding and nearby regions from the original <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>stock. Two significant alterations were noted: an R295-Stop mutation in the coding region, and a Copia element inserted 3' to the transcript.

To test this definitively we asked if expression of CG2904 could rescue the <italic>echinus </italic>phenotype. We identified several cDNAs for CG2904 from a larval-pupal library (see below). One of these, designated ec-SF1, was introduced into flies under the control of the GMR promoter (GMR-ec-SF1 flies). These flies have wildtype-appearing eyes and IOC number (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,K</xref>), but when introduced into the <italic>echinus ec</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>&#x00394;4 </sup>background, GMR-ec-SF1 restored adult ommatidial patterning and normal IOC cell death (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F,L</xref>). RH68894 represents a group of 3 kb cDNA species that overlap echinus on the anti-sense DNA strand. RH68894 is predicted to be a non-coding RNA, based on the lack of any reading frame of significant size. To test whether RH68894 has any role in mitigating the echinus phenotype, GMR-RH68894 was introduced into the fly (GMR-RH68894 flies). Adult eyes of GMR-RH68894 flies appear wildtype. In addition, when introduced into <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>&#x00394;4</sup>, GMR-RH68894 failed to rescue or alter the echinus rough eye phenotype. Together these observations demonstrate that CG2904 (hereafter simply referred to as <italic>echinus</italic>), and not RH68894, encodes <italic>echinus</italic>.</p><p>Pupal retinas from animals homozygous for new alleles of <italic>echinus </italic>such as <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>&#x00394;4</sup>, <italic>ec</italic><sup>&#x00394;9 </sup>and <italic>ec</italic><sup>56</sup>, as well as those from wildtype flies expressing GMR-CG2904-RNAi, showed a striking difference from retinas mutant for <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>(as obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center). <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>pupal eyes showed a significant increase in IOC number subsequent to the time when death normally occurs, and this increase was associated with only a modest level of side-by-side alignment of IOCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. One of the new EMS alleles isolated, <italic>ec</italic><sup>3<italic>c</italic>3</sup>, which contains a stop codon near the C-terminus of the <italic>echinus </italic>coding region, showed a similar phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>). ec<sup>3c3 </sup>is likely to be a partial loss-of-function allele of <italic>echinus </italic>since <italic>ec</italic><sup>3<italic>c</italic>3</sup>/Df(1)HC244 results in a stronger adult rough eye phenotype than that observed in homozygous <italic>ec</italic><sup>3<italic>c</italic>3 </sup>flies (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). In contrast, pupal eyes from <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>&#x00394;4 </sup>and GMR-CG2904-RNAi (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), <italic>ec</italic><sup>&#x00394;9 </sup>and <italic>ec</italic><sup>56 </sup>(data not shown) showed a greatly increased number of IOCs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and many of these extra cells were aligned side-by-side. The Bloomington <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>stock was outcrossed to wildtype flies for 5 generations in two independent experiments. Interestingly, pupal eyes from both of these outcrossed lines showed an increase in the number of extra IOCs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and IOC cell stacking (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M,N</xref>). Importantly, both sorting and death phenotypes were rescued by GMR-dependent expression of ec-SF1 for multiple <italic>echinus </italic>alleles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the original <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>line has picked up one or more suppressor mutations and that the true <italic>echinus </italic>null phenotype in the pupal eye results in extra IOCs, with many of these cells being stacked side-by-side. In addition, there seems to be a direct correlation between the severity of defects in sorting and those in cell death. Thus, pupal retinas from the original <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>allele and <italic>ec</italic><sup>3<italic>c</italic>3 </sup>displayed mild defects in sorting and IOC death, while retinas from the deletion allele <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>&#x00394;4</sup>, outcrossed <italic>ec</italic><sup>1</sup>, GMR-CG2904-RNAi, and <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>&#x00394;4</sup>/Df(1)HC244 (a deficiency which covers the <italic>echinus </italic>locus) (data not shown), displayed much more severe defects in sorting and IOC death. These observations raise a question as to whether the <italic>echinus </italic>decrease-in-IOC death phenotype is a result of loss of <italic>echinus </italic>function as a death activator, or a secondary consequence of a failure in sorting, which precludes death signaling (discussed further below).</p><p>cDNAs for echinus have been isolated from early embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], as well as pupal eyes (this work), and genetic interactions between <italic>echinus </italic>and genes that result in phenotypes in tissues other than the eye have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Thus, it is likely that <italic>echinus </italic>is expressed in, and plays roles in tissues other than the eye, though our focus in this work is the pupal eye. To determine the <italic>echinus </italic>expression pattern in this tissue we carried out tissue <italic>in situ </italic>hybridizations on pupal retinas with an antisense <italic>echinus </italic>cDNA probe. <italic>echinus </italic>transcripts could be detected at low levels in cone cells, primary pigment cells and IOCs prior to, and during the period of IOC death (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>). The <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>PlacZ </italic></sup>allele carries a version of <italic>lacZ </italic>that functions as an enhancer trap. Therefore, as a second, and perhaps more sensitive method of visualizing <italic>echinus </italic>expression, we examined &#x003b2;-gal expression in pupal retinas from this line. Consistent with the results from <italic>echinus </italic>tissue <italic>in situ </italic>hybridizations, &#x003b2;-gal was expressed uniformly in cone cells, primary pigment cells and IOCs in wildtype (heterozygous <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>PlacZ</italic></sup>) pupal retinas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;E</xref>). These observations do not exclude the possibility that Echinus protein is differentially translated in specific cells, but they do suggest that transcription of <italic>echinus </italic>in specific populations of IOCs is not a critical point of cell sorting or cell death regulation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The <italic>echinus </italic>transcript is expressed at low, uniform levels in the pupal eye, and GAL4-driver-dependent expression of ec-SF1 or an <italic>ec</italic>-silencing microRNA suggests that pigment cells are an important site of <italic>ec </italic>action.

Expression of LL54-GAL4 in a wildtype background, in conjunction with a UAS-driven miRNA (UAS-CG2904-RNAi) targeting all <italic>echinus </italic>splice forms, phenocopied the <italic>echinus </italic>phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that low-level expression of the <italic>echinus</italic>-targeting miRNA in other cell types in the eye is sufficient to generate this phenotype. This possibility notwithstanding, our observations suggest that <italic>echinus </italic>normally functions, at least in part, within the pigment cells to regulate IOC fate. Interestingly, however, expression of either of two different splice forms of <italic>echinus </italic>(ec-SF1 and ec-SF2; see below), in an <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>&#x00394;4 </sup>background, under this same promoter, failed to rescue the <italic>ec</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>&#x00394;4 </sup>phenotype (data not shown). This observation suggests, but does not prove, that <italic>echinus </italic>expression is also required in other cell types to bring about proper IOC sorting and death. Analysis of <italic>echinus </italic>clones will be required to determine definitively the cell types in which <italic>echinus </italic>expression is required. Finally, GMR-driven transgenes are expressed in all cell types in the developing eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. As noted above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,K</xref>), forced expression of <italic>echinus </italic>in all retinal cells did not by itself induce defects in sorting or ectopic retinal (IOC) cell death. This, in conjunction with the observation that endogenous <italic>echinus </italic>is expressed uniformly in the pupal retina, is consistent with a model in which <italic>echinus </italic>expression is not sufficient to induce the death of IOCs, though it is necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Echinus gives rise to multiple splice forms that encode proteins with homology to ubiquitin-specific proteases</title><p>We sequenced multiple <italic>echinus </italic>cDNAs and identified three splice variants (designated ec-SF1, ec-SF2, and ec-SF3) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). In each of these, a common 3' coding and UTR sequence is spliced to distinct 5' UTR and coding sequences. To determine which splice forms are expressed during pupal retinal cell death, we conducted RT-PCR using exon-specific primers. We found that all isoforms were expressed in the pupal retina during the stages when IOC death occurred (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). No differences were seen when expression of different splice forms was monitored using tissue in situ hybridizations (data not shown).</p><p>Each splice form encodes a large protein of roughly 1700 aa. Blast searches identified only one region of homology with other proteins, an N-terminal USP domain, a domain found in one of the seven families of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). USP-containing DUBs are cysteine proteases that are capable of removing ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins from substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. The USP domain features two short, well-conserved motifs &#x02013; the Cys box, which contains the essential catalytic cysteine, and a His box, which contains conserved His and Asp residues that are thought to be essential for catalysis. Structural studies on the USPs HAUSP and Ubp14 have revealed that the catalytic histidine and aspartic acid deprotonate the catalytic cysteine allowing for nucleophilic attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Ec-SF1 encodes an USP domain with all the known essential catalytic residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Database searches identified genomic sequences that if spliced, would generate similar forms of <italic>echinus </italic>in multiple <italic>Drosophila </italic>species as well as several other insects. Outside of the arthropods Echinus shows most homology with the mammalian DUBs USP53 and USP54, with essentially all of this homology occuring within the USP domain. Most importantly for the purposes of this report, Ec-SF2 and Ec-SF3 encode proteins with truncated USP domains and lack residues important for catalysis. Specifically, Ec-SF2 and Ec-SF3 contain the catalytic histidine and aspartic acid residues found in the USP His box, but they lack the Cys box and its catalytic cysteine. Ec-SF2 and Ec-SF3 instead have alternative N-termini that are conserved in <italic>Drosophilia </italic>and show no sequence similarity to the Cys box motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, C</xref>). The homologous mammalian DUB USP54 also encodes 4 alternative splice forms, two of which do not contain complete USP domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Echinus lacks USP activity on a model substrate, and USP activity is not required for echinus-dependent death of IOCs</title><p>We generated flies expressing a microRNA that targets Ec-SF1 specifically, under the control of the GMR promoter. These flies showed an <italic>echinus</italic>-like adult rough eye phenotype, and pupal eyes contained extra IOCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,E</xref>). In contrast, GMR-driven expression of microRNAs designed to target Ec-SF2 or Ec-SF3 resulted in flies that appeared wildtype, and no extra IOCs were observed (data not shown). We cannot exclude the possibility that the microRNAs targeting Ec-SF2 and Ec-SF3 failed to phenocopy <italic>echinus </italic>because they failed to induce a large enough decrease in splice form expression (though in other experiments expression of these miRNAs was sufficient to suppress rescue of <italic>echinus </italic>by GMR-dependent expression of ec-SF2 or ec-SF3; data not shown). Nonetheless, our results from targeting Ec-SF1 demonstrate that this splice form, at least, is important for bringing about IOC death, and suggest that it may be the most important for regulating IOC survival. Also consistent with this hypothesis is our observation that GMR-driven RNAi that targets all splice forms (GMR-CG2904-RNAi) results in a phenotype similar to that observed in flies in which only ec-SF1 was targeted (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,I</xref>).

Deubiquitinating enzymes that remove Ub create Arg-&#x003b2;-gal, an unstable protein.

However, the significance of this interaction is unclear since expression of GMR-GAL4-UAS-klumpfuss alone resulted in only rare adults (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Finally, no interactions were observed between loss- or gain-of-function mutations in <italic>echinus </italic>and <italic>rst </italic>(see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We showed that <italic>echinus</italic>, a gene required for normal IOC death, corresponds to CG2904. CG2904 generates multiple transcripts, each of which encodes a protein with homology to the USP family of ubiquitin-specific proteases. Echinus is necessary but not sufficient to cause IOC death when overexpressed. These results are consistent with models where <italic>echinus </italic>provides an activity that can modulate other signals that drive the death of specific cells (or prevent their survival), rather than providing death signals to specific cells. Previous analyses of the <italic>ec</italic><sup>1 </sup>allele led to a model wherein <italic>echinus </italic>functions subsequent to IOC sorting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, our analysis of multiple newly generated <italic>echinus </italic>alleles, including multiple likely null alleles, showed the presence of many excess IOC cells arranged in a side-by-side configuration with respect to primary pigment cells, in addition to excess cells arranged end-to-end. These observations are consistent with a model in which <italic>echinus </italic>functions to promote proper IOC sorting, with the failure in IOC death being a result of incorrectly positioned IOCs being unable to send or receive cell death signals. An alternative possibility that we explored is that <italic>echinus </italic>plays roles in cell death signaling as well as cell sorting. We failed to observe significant genetic interactions between <italic>echinus </italic>and known or suspected death regulators. While these observations do not rule out the possibility that <italic>echinus </italic>acts to regulate death at a novel point, they tend to support models in which <italic>echinus </italic>functions primarily to regulate cell sorting.</p><p>Homology searches of genome sequence in other insects suggest that <italic>echinus </italic>is conserved. But nothing is known about the functions of any of these genes. One splice form of <italic>echinus</italic>, ec-SF1, encodes a protein that contains catalytic residues essential for USP activity. ec-SF1 is expressed in the pupal eye and splice form-specific RNAi of this transcript phenocopied <italic>echinus</italic>. However, Ec-SF1 was inactive in a deubiquitination assay utilizing a model ubiquitin-&#x003b2;-gal fusion protein substrate. This may reflect the fact that ec-SF1 is inactive as a USP. Alternatively, Echinus may only be active on specific substrates, a phenomenon observed with a number of USPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. It is also possible that Ec-SF1, as with several other USP family members, cleaves proteins modified with other ubiquitin-related proteins such as ISG15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] or Nedd8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Regardless of the answer to this question, our observation that splice forms of Echinus that lack residues essential for USP activity rescue the <italic>echinus </italic>phenotype strongly suggests that ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like protease activity is not essential for Echinus function, at least for bringing about the sorting and death of excess IOCs. This does not mean that Echinus functions are necessarily unrelated to regulation of deubiquitination. Interestingly, like <italic>echinus</italic>, the genes USP53 and USP54 in human and mouse have a shorter splice form missing key catalytic residues and a longer form that includes these residues (the longer forms are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Also like Echinus, the USP53 and USP54 long forms are inactive in a deubiquitination assay using a model ubiquitin-&#x003b2;-gal fusion protein substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. This conserved similarity in gene structure suggests a functional requirement for the multiple splice forms of <italic>echinus</italic>, despite the observed absence of protease activity. Inactive versions of known USPs can, in some cases, still bind ubiquitinated substrates, functioning as dominant negatives that block deubiquitination, thereby facilitating degradation or other events dependent on ubiquitin conjugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. A number of components of the ubiquitin pathway regulate cell death in the fly eye, including the ubiquitin activating enzyme uba1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase DIAP1, two components of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase (<italic>skpA </italic>and a novel F-box gene, <italic>morgue</italic>), and the deubiquitinating enzyme <italic>fat facets </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Perhaps Echinus promotes cell sorting and death by binding substrates modified with ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins, thereby blocking the removal of these modifications. Alternatively, Echinus could titrate cellular inhibitors of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteases. Finally, it is important to emphasize that Echinus's functions in sorting and cell death may be unrelated to ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins. Some USPs affect signaling through pathways which are independent of their ability to remove ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Central to addressing these questions is the identification of proteins bound by Echinus in the eye.</p><p>As a first step in this direction we searched for genetic interactions between <italic>echinus </italic>and mutations in genes known or suspected to regulate IOC survival. EGFR or Notch, important upstream regulators of IOC survival. Particularly in the case of the Echinus overexpression experiments, our observations suggest that <italic>echinus </italic>is not sufficient on its own to regulate signaling through these pathways. We also searched for interactions between <italic>echinus </italic>and a number of known or suspected cell death effectors. These included Rpr, Hid, Grim, and the caspases Dronc, Drice, and Dcp-1. For each of these genes, and for the eye-specific partial loss-of-function of DIAP1 induced using GMR-diap1-RNAi, expression in the eye results in ectopic cell death. However, none of these phenotypes were significantly suppressed in the <italic>echinus </italic>loss-of-function background, or enhanced by <italic>echinus </italic>coexpression. Perhaps <italic>echinus </italic>does not regulate these components, or components in the same pathways, at downstream points. However, there are several caveats to this conclusion. First, <italic>echinus </italic>is rare at the level of mRNA, and thus presumably at the level of protein as well. Therefore, it may simply be that loss of <italic>echinus</italic>, which normally regulates its target(s) in the context of their much lower endogenous expression level, has little effect on phenotypes due to high-level target expression. Second, in the cases where Echinus was overexpressed, it may be that <italic>echinus </italic>requires cofactors in order to act on its targets, and these also may be relatively rare and rate-limiting. If true, overexpression of <italic>echinus </italic>might again be expected to have little effect on phenotypes associated with high-level expression of its target proteins. Therefore, our observations allow us to conclude at most that <italic>echinus </italic>is probably not a rate-limiting, or dose-dependent regulator of the above death activators.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>echinus </italic>locus encodes multiple splice versions of proteins with homology to USP family proteases. But there is no clear evidence that regulation of ubiquitination is relevant to <italic>echinus's </italic>role in promoting IOC sorting and death. <italic>Echinus </italic>did not show significant genetic interactions with a number of known death regulators, and expression of <italic>echinus </italic>was not sufficient on its own to induce ectopic death. Together these observations suggest several possibilities. The first is that <italic>echinus </italic>regulates &#x02013; but only in very specific contexts/cell types &#x02013; unknown (or untested) upstream regulators or effectors of the core cell death pathway. Alternatively, <italic>echinus </italic>may act as a necessary but not sufficient component in a parallel death signaling or effector pathway. Finally, <italic>echinus </italic>may function primarily to regulate cell sorting, with failure in this process leading to cell survival because IOCs are unable to effectively transmit or receive death signals. Drawing links between <italic>echinus </italic>and any of these pathways requires the identification of Echinus targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Identification and sequencing of echinus alleles</title><p>Adult males were exposed to EMS and mated with females carrying an attached-X chromosome (XX/Y).
