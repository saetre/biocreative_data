The resultant clot (thrombus) plugs the wound and prevents blood loss. When the injury has healed, other proteins dissolve the clot, a process called &#x0201c;fibrinolysis.&#x0201d; Sometimes, however, a thrombus develops inside an undamaged blood vessel and partly or completely blocks the blood flow. A clot that occurs in one of the veins (vessels that take the blood to the heart) deep within the body (usually in the leg) is a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Some DVTs have no symptoms; others cause pain, swelling, and tenderness in one leg. They are usually treated with heparin and warfarin, anticoagulant drugs that stop the clot growing. If left untreated, part of the clot (an embolus) can break off and travel to the lungs, where it can cause a life-threatening condition called a pulmonary embolism (PE).</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Most people are very unlikely to develop venous thrombosis (the collective term for DVT and PE), but anything that makes blood &#x0201c;hypercoagulable&#x0201d; (prone to clotting) increases this risk. Genetic risk factors can be inherited changes in blood clotting proteins (for example, a mutation in a gene coding for one protein, factor V, which is involved in clotting, is known as factor V Leiden&#x02014;Leiden, The Netherlands, was where it was first described). There are also acquired risk factors such as taking oral contraceptives or being immobilized (for example, during bed rest). These risk factors often act in such a way that the risk of developing venous thrombosis for a person with multiple risk factors is greater than the sum of the individual risks. Another recently identified but little studied risk factor for venous thrombosis is &#x0201c;hypofibrinolysis,&#x0201d; a decreased capacity to dissolve blood clots. In this study (part of the &#x0201c;MEGA&#x0201d; study on risk factors for venous thrombosis), the researchers investigate the combined effect of hypofibrinolysis and established risk factors associated with hypercoagulability on the risk of developing venous thrombosis.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers collected blood from more than 2,000 individuals after their first DVT or PE and from a similar number of persons without venous thrombosis (controls). For each blood sample, they measured the time it took to dissolve a clot generated from that blood in a test tube (the clot lysis time or CLT) and determined which participants had the factor V Leiden mutation or a genetic change in the clotting factor prothrombin that also increases blood coagulability. The study participants also completed a questionnaire about acquired risk factors for venous thrombosis. The researchers divided the participants into four equal-sized groups (quartiles) based on their CLT and used the quartile with the lowest CLT as the reference group for their statistical analyses; hypofibrinolysis was defined as a CLT in the highest quartile (the longest times). Participants with hypofibrinolysis alone were twice as likely to develop venous thrombosis as those with a CLT in the lowest quartile (the shortest times). Oral contraceptive use alone increased the risk of venous thrombosis 2.5-fold, whereas the combination of oral contraceptive use and hypofibrinolysis increased the risk 20-fold. The researchers also found synergistic effects on thrombosis risk for hypofibrinolysis combined with immobilization or with the factor V Leiden mutation but not with the prothrombin mutation.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings confirm that persons with hypofibrinolysis and hence longer CLTs have a greater risk of developing venous thrombosis than those with short CLTs. Because CLTs were measured after venous thrombosis had occurred, hypofibrinolysis could be an effect rather than a cause of this condition. However, this is unlikely because there was no association between how long after the venous thrombosis the blood sample was taken and the measured CLT. These findings also show that the combination of hypofibrinolysis with immobilization, the factor V Leiden mutation, and oral contraceptive use greatly increases the risk of venous thrombosis. This new information about the risk factors for venous thrombosis should help physicians to advise patients about reducing their chances of developing this life-threatening condition.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050097">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050097</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus encyclopedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001124.htm">blood clots</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000156.htm">deep vein thrombosis</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000132.htm">pulmonary embolism</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/Dvt/DVT_WhatIs.html">deep vein thrombosis</ext-link>, including an animation about how DVT causes pulmonary embolisms</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service Direct health encyclopedia provides information for patients on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleID=122">deep vein thrombosis</ext-link> (in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p>More information about the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lumc.nl/4060/research/mega.html">Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of risk factors for venous thrombosis (MEGA) study</ext-link> is available on the Leiden University Medical Center Web site</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation">coagulation</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis">fibrinolysis</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Meltzer ME, Lisman T, Doggen CJM, de Groot PG, Rosendaal FR (2008) Synergistic effects of hypofibrinolysis and genetic and acquired risk factors on the risk of a first venous thrombosis.

The occurrence of multiple risk factors within a single patient may be associated with a risk of thrombosis that exceeds the sum of the individual risks. Such an increase is, for example, found in women with the factor V Leiden mutation who also use oral contraceptives. While carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation have a 5-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis, and oral contraceptive use increases the risk about 3-fold, the combination of these risk factors leads to a 20- to 30-fold increased risk (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;).

We hypothesized that the combination of hypofibrinolysis and hypercoagulability would synergistically enhance the risk of venous thrombosis. This hypothesis was investigated in the Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment (MEGA) of risk factors for venous thrombosis study, which is a large population-based case-control study on venous thrombosis. First, we studied hypofibrinolysis as a risk factor for thrombosis, and investigated the joint effect of hypofibrinolysis and several established risk factors for venous thrombosis. Second, we studied the influence of several genetic and acquired factors on the outcome of the clot lysis assay.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>The design of the MEGA study has been described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Between March 1999 and May 2002, consecutive patients aged 18 to 70 y, with a first DVT of the leg or a first pulmonary embolism (PE), were identified at six anticoagulation clinics in The Netherlands. In these clinics, the anticoagulant therapy of all patients in a well-defined geographical area is monitored, which gave us the opportunity to identify consecutive and unselected patients with venous thrombosis.</p><p>Partners of participating patients were invited to take part as control participants. From January 2002 to September 2004, an additional control group was selected from the same area by random digit dialing using the Mitofsky-Waksberg method &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; and was frequency matched to the patients for age and sex. This matching was on group level in which random controls were selected in numbers proportional to the number of patients within strata of sex and 5-y age groups.</p><p>Patients or control participants with severe psychiatric problems or those who could not speak Dutch were excluded.</p><p>For the MEGA study, 4,131 patients were eligible. Of those patients, 194 died soon after the venous thrombosis. Of the remaining 3,937 patients, 51 were in the end stage of a disease and 629 were unable or refused to participate, leaving 3,257 patients in the study who filled in a questionnaire (83&#x00025;). Of the total of 3,257 patients of the MEGA study, 2,360 had an eligible partner. One partner died soon after the request for participation and, of the remaining 2,359 partners, 1,908 participated (81&#x00025;). Of the nonparticipating partners, 15 were in the end-stage of a disease and 436 refused, were unable to participate, or could not be located. Of the 4,350 eligible random digit dialing control participants, four died before they were able to participate, 15 were in the end stage of a disease, and 1,331 refused to participate or could not be located, leaving 3,000 participants in the study (69&#x00025;).</p><p>All participants signed a written informed consent form. Approval for this study was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Validation of Thrombosis Diagnosis</title><p>Written informed consent to obtain medical records was given by 95&#x00025; of the patients. Information regarding the diagnostic procedure was obtained via hospital records and general practitioners. For 10&#x00025; of these patients the information regarding the diagnostic procedure could not be obtained. A PE was considered &#x0201c;definite&#x0201d; when diagnosed with a high-probability ventilation-perfusion scan (VQ scan), positive spiral computed tomography (CT), or angiogram. A PE was considered &#x0201c;probable&#x0201d; when diagnosed with a low- or intermediate-probability VQ scan, inconclusive spiral CT, or angiogram. A deep venous thrombosis was considered definite when a (Doppler) ultrasound showed the presence of a thrombus in the deep veins. When no information regarding the diagnostic procedure was available or when a patient was registered at the anticoagulation clinic with a different or additional diagnosis to the one that had been objectively confirmed, the diagnosis by which the patient was registered at the anticoagulation clinic was added. A registration of a PE was considered probable while a DVT registration was considered definite. Only those patients were included in the study when their diagnosis was definite or probable. Of those patients in whom diagnostic information was available, only 2&#x00025; was excluded as they did not have a venous thrombotic event according to the medical records.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data Collection and Current Analysis</title><p>All participants were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire on acquired risk factors for venous thrombosis, such as surgery, plaster cast, confinement to bed, injury, oral contraceptive use, hormonal replacement therapy, pregnancy, and malignancy. Body mass index (BMI in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated from self-reported weight and height. All items in the questionnaire referred to the period before the index date. The date of diagnosis of thrombosis as reported by the participant was used as the index date for the patients. For the control participants, the date they filled in the questionnaire was used as index date. Idiopathic venous thrombosis was defined as venous thrombosis in patients who had never had malignancies and without surgery, injury, plaster cast, or confinement to bed in the year prior to the thrombosis or oral contraceptive use or hormone replacement therapy at the time of the event.</p><p>When participants were unable to fill in the questionnaire, questions were asked by telephone, using a standardized mini-questionnaire. Three months after discontinuation of the anticoagulant therapy, a blood sample was taken from patients and participating partners in the anticoagulation clinic. In patients who received prolonged anticoagulant therapy (&#x0003e;1 y), blood was drawn 1 y after the event. The random control participants were invited to the clinic for a blood draw after returning their questionnaire. All participants were interviewed regarding current anticoagulant use.</p><p>In the current analyses only patients who had their blood drawn were included (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2,420).

Samples that were not previously thawed were used for this study. Lysis of a tissue factor&#x02013;induced clot by exogenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) was studied by monitoring changes in turbidity during clot formation and subsequent lysis as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

After thorough mixing, the plate was incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C in a Spectramax 340 kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation), and the optical density at 405 nm was monitored every 20 s, resulting in a clot-lysis turbidity profile. The CLT was derived from this clot-lysis profile and defined as the time (minutes) from the midpoint of the clear to maximum turbid transition, representing clot formation, to the midpoint of the maximum turbid to clear transition, representing the lysis of the clot.

ORs adjusted for age (continuous) and sex (categorical) (OR<sub>adj</sub>) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. Analyses in subgroups by sex were adjusted only for age. Analyses in subgroups of age were adjusted for sex and for age (continuous) within each stratum of age. Adjustment for age as a dummy variable (five categories) did not change the results compared to models with age as a continuous covariate, and the latter adjustment is presented for all analyses.</p><p>A patient and his or her partner control may be more similar than a random pair selected from the population would be, e.g., on (measured and unmeasured) lifestyle factors that could influence fibrinolytic potential.

In the analyses with the random control group, unconditional logistic regression including all patients and random control participants were performed. To obtain a final estimate, results of unmatched and matched analyses were pooled. As both estimates used the same subset of 1,128 patients, the estimates are correlated.

Participants in the first quartile of CLT and without the other risk factor of interest were used as the reference category, and dummy variables were used for the seven other categories.</p><p>To study the association between clotting abnormalities and acquired (risk) factors with CLT in the control group (partners and random controls), mean CLTs of different groups were calculated and confidence intervals were constructed for the difference based on a <italic>t</italic>-distribution. The association between age and BMI with CLT was assessed using linear regression. Linear regression was also used to determine the association between the time interval between the thrombotic event and blood draw and CLT in the patients. Longer CLTs in those with a small time interval than in those with a large time interval could indicate that increased CLT is rather an acute-phase reaction than a risk factor for venous thrombosis.</p><p>Cases and controls with missing data were excluded in the analyses.

The combination of hypofibrinolysis with immobilization, factor V Leiden, and especially oral contraceptive use, resulted in high relative risks. CLTs were associated with age, BMI, diabetes, oral contraceptive use, and the prothrombin 20210A mutation.</p><p>The risk of venous thrombosis for individuals with hypofibrinolysis was 2.4-fold increased compared with those with CLTs in the first quartile. Furthermore, there was a clear dose-response relation between CLT and the risk of venous thrombosis. Our findings support the results of the Leiden Thrombophilia Study (LETS) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In this case-control study, CLTs above the 90th percentile of the levels found in the control group were associated with an almost 2-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis.</p><p>Because hypercoagulation is a well-established risk factor for venous thrombosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, we hypothesized that hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis have synergistic effects on venous thrombosis. First, we studied the risk of venous thrombosis in individuals with hypofibrinolysis combined with established acquired risk factors. We found a 22-fold increase in risk in women with hypofibrinolysis who were taking oral contraceptives compared with women with neither risk factor. Although the thrombosis risk associated with oral contraceptive use is well known, the mechanisms behind the increased risk of venous thrombosis are still incompletely elucidated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Oral contraceptive use induces complex changes in the hemostatic system, including increased levels of several procoagulant factors, reduction in levels of anticoagulant factors, and activated protein C resistance. In addition, oral contraceptive use results in complex changes in fibrinolytic variables suggestive of increased fibrinolytic capacity. However, the net effect of these changes appears to be prothrombotic. The combination of oral contraceptive use and factor V Leiden was previously shown to result in a thrombosis risk larger than the sum of the individual risks (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;). This effect is presumably due to further exacerbation of thrombin-generating capacity induced by both risk factors. The substantially increased risk associated with hypofibrinolysis and oral contraceptive use possibly relates to a concomitant presence of excessive thrombin-generating capacity and defective clot breakdown.</p><p>The combination of immobilization (confinement to bed, surgery, or plaster cast) and hypofibrinolysis resulted in a synergistic effect, possibly via a similar mechanism because immobilization leads to an increase of thrombin formation. The increased risk of venous thrombosis during stasis may be caused by endothelial cell activation and expression of P-selectin, allowing tissue factor&#x02013;bearing microvesicles to initiate coagulation and thrombosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, increased thrombin generation occurs after surgery, as demonstrated, for example, by elevated levels of thrombin&#x02013;antithrombin complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Although no other studies have investigated the combined risk of immobilization and hypofibrinolysis, in a review it was concluded that there was some evidence for an association between decreased fibrinolytic potential (measured using different assays to the one used in the present study) and postoperative thrombosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, it is found that, among hospitalized patients, the prevalence of asymptomatic thrombi is high, up to about 40&#x00025; (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;). Although most asymptomatic thrombi resolve without causing clinical consequences, it is plausible that those individuals with a decreased capacity to remove these thrombi have a higher risk of eventually developing a symptomatic venous thrombosis. Similarly, the risk of an unprovoked (idiopathic) thrombosis was also increased in individuals with hypofibrinolysis, which may be explained by defective breakdown of asymptomatic thrombi, as 1&#x00025; of a healthy population was found to have such an asymptomatic thrombus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Second, we evaluated the effect of hypofibrinolysis in combination with established genetic risk factors, i.e., factor V Leiden or the prothrombin 20210A mutation. The joint presence of factor V Leiden and hypofibrinolysis resulted in a large increase in risk of DVT. Individuals with both factor V Leiden and hypofibrinolysis had an 8.1-fold increased risk, compared with the absence of both risk factors. This joint effect can also be explained by the presence of both an increased procoagulant state and a decreased fibrinolytic potential.</p><p>The combination of hypofibrinolysis and the prothrombin 20210A mutation did not lead to a large increase in risk. A difficulty in evaluating the combination of these two risk factors is the apparent effect of prothrombin 20210A on CLT. In accordance with results previously reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, we found that individuals with the prothrombin 20210A mutation had increased CLTs, conceivably related to increased activation of TAFI.</p><p>We found shorter CLTs in women using oral contraceptives compared with women not taking oral contraceptives. This is in contrast with the results of a crossover study showing no difference in CLT before and during oral contraceptive use &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. In that study, t-PA activity, plasminogen, and plasmin-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin complexes were increased during oral contraceptive use, and levels of PAI-1 antigen and activity and t-PA antigen were decreased. It was suggested that this increased fibrinolytic activity is counteracted by the increased TAFI levels that were also found. However, a direct comparison of the studies is complicated, because the CLT assays used were slightly different. In the crossover study, the plasma was clotted with thrombin and t-PA, while in our assay tissue factor and t-PA is used.</p><p>We found a positive relation between BMI and CLT and increased CLTs in individuals with diabetes. It is plausible that PAI-1 plays an important role in these associations, as it is known that PAI-1 is overexpressed in patients with diabetes and obesity (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>In our previous study, we showed that the risk of venous thrombosis in individuals with hypofibrinolysis as measured with our clot lysis assay did not disappear after adjustment for several coagulation factors shown to influence CLTs in the control population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050097-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. This result suggests that the CLTs are mostly determined by fibrinolytic factors. It is also supported by the association between BMI and CLT and the increased CLTs in individuals with diabetes and those with the prothrombin 20210A mutation. Which fibrinolytic factor or which combination of factors is important for this increased risk is yet to be investigated.</p><p>A drawback of using case-control studies for finding associations between the risk of venous thrombosis and blood parameters is that the blood of the patients is drawn after the thrombotic event. In this way decreased fibrinolysis could be a consequence of the disease rather than a cause. However, when CLT would increase as a result of the event, one would expect such an acute-phase effect to attenuate with time after the thrombotic event. In this study no relation was found between CLT and the number of days between the event and the blood draw.</p><p>We conclude that the risk of venous thrombosis is increased in individuals with decreased fibrinolytic potential, as measured by an overall plasma-based assay. The combination of hypofibrinolysis with established genetic and acquired risk factors associated with hypercoagulation has a synergistic effect on the thrombosis risk. This joint effect is observed in individuals with hypofibrinolysis who use oral contraceptives, are immobilized, or are carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation, but not in patients who carry the prothrombin 20210A mutation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the directors of the Anticoagulation Clinics of Amersfoort (M.H.H.
