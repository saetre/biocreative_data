Combinations of interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-23 with transforming growth factor &#x003b2; were used to differentiate myelin-specific T cell receptor transgenic T cells into Th17 cells, none of which could induce EAE, whereas Th1 cells consistently transferred disease. However, IL-6 was found to promote the differentiation of encephalitogenic Th17 cells. Further analysis of myelin-specific T cells that were encephalitogenic in spontaneous EAE and actively induced EAE demonstrated that T-bet expression was critical for pathogenicity, regardless of cytokine expression by the encephalitogenic T cells. These data suggest that encephalitogenicity of myelin-specific T cells appears to be mediated by a pathway dependent on T-bet and not necessarily pathway-specific end products, such as interferon &#x003b3; and IL-17.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has been used as a model for multiple sclerosis (MS) for over four decades. Our understanding of EAE and the immune cells that mediate the pathology of the disease has grown tremendously during this time. However, as the field of immunology evolves, many of the fundamental observations in EAE are questioned and revisited to further our understanding of EAE and ultimately enhance our understanding of MS. Although EAE was initially induced by immunization with myelin proteins emulsified in CFA, it can also be induced by adoptive transfer of myelin-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells into naive recipient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McDonald and Swanborg, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Waldburger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lovett-Racke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gocke et al., 2007</xref>). The observation that myelin-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells were sufficient to induce EAE focused MS research on these IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing T cells in MS patients. Although myelin-specific T cells were found in both MS patients and healthy individuals, which raised questions as to the relevance of these cells in MS patients, it does appear that myelin-specific T cells from MS patients are more likely to have a Th1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olsson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voskuhl et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pelfrey et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequently, several studies demonstrated that although healthy individuals had myelin-specific T cells, these cells were naive, whereas MS patients had activated and memory myelin-specific T cells, indicating that these cells had been previously activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allegretta et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lovett-Racke et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burns et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, a clinical trial with an altered peptide ligand from myelin basic protein (MBP), which was intended to down-regulate myelin-specific T cells, actually exacerbated disease in several MS patients, which was associated with increased frequency of MBP-specific T cells that produced IFN-&#x003b3;, suggesting that MS is mediated by myelin-specific Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bielekova et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>As a result, several studies focused on IFN-&#x003b3; as the pathogenic molecule in EAE and MS. Surprisingly, IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;deficient mice and mice given antibodies to neutralize IFN-&#x003b3; were still susceptible to EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lublin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferber et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heremans et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Willenborg et al., 1996</xref>). The number of myelin-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was expanded in these mice, which may have occurred because of the loss of regulatory cells that were dependent on IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2000</xref>). However, several studies that specifically suppressed IFN-&#x003b3; in the myelin-specific T cells before transfer into recipient mice demonstrated that altering the signaling pathway that results in IFN-&#x003b3; production in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells decreases the encephalitogenic capacity of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Racke et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Racke et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lovett-Racke et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, STAT4 and T-bet, transcription factors in the Th1 cell differentiation pathway, have been shown to be critical for EAE induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chitnis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bettelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lovett-Racke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nath et al., 2006</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the differentiation pathway that generates Th1 cells may be important in encephalitogenicity, but the downstream production of IFN-&#x003b3; by myelin-specific T cells may not be critical.</p><p>More recently, a new phenotype of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was described in EAE that appears to be pathogenic. Stimulation of myelin-specific T cells from myelin-immunized mice with IL-23 promotes the expansion of T cells that express IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langrish et al., 2005</xref>). Transfer of these myelin-specific IL-17&#x02013;producing T cells, called Th17 cells, into naive mice induced EAE. In addition, microarray analysis of MS tissues indicates that IL-17 is present in MS lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lock et al., 2002</xref>). We and others have shown that Th17 cells are found in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice after adoptive transfer of myelin-specific Th1 cells; however, the Th17 cells are derived from the recipient and not the transferred Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gocke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lees et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, IL-17&#x02013;deficient mice developed EAE, although disease severity is reduced and disease course altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Komiyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haak et al., 2009</xref>). These studies have raised the question as to whether the pathogenic T cells in EAE and MS are actually Th1 or Th17 cells, or whether both populations contribute to the disease.</p><p>Several studies have defined cytokines, primarily IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2;, which can induce the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Th17 cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>). However, it has not been demonstrated whether pure populations of myelin-specific Th17 cells can induce EAE, because previous studies have used lymphocytes from immunized mice that have been skewed in vitro to enhance either IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-17 expression, but not exclude the other population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGeachy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stromnes et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, we use TCR transgenic T cells specific for MBP Ac1-11 to study the differentiation of Th17 cells and their ability to induce EAE. In addition, we characterized the pathogenic autoreactive T cells in both induced and spontaneous EAE.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; fail to generate encephalitogenic Th17 cells</title><p>Several recent studies have defined cytokines that induce the differentiation of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that myelin-specific T cells from immunized mice can be restimulated with IL-23 to enhance IL-17 production. These IL-23&#x02013;driven IL-17&#x02013;producing T cells can induce EAE, often with atypical clinical signs, when transferred into recipient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langrish et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGeachy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stromnes et al., 2008</xref>). However, it has not been shown whether myelin-specific Th17 cells generated in vitro with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; can induce EAE. Naive TCR transgenic splenocytes from a mouse that expresses TCR genes <italic>V&#x003b1;2.3/V&#x003b2;8.2</italic> that recognize MBP Ac1-11 were differentiated in vitro with peptide plus IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; or IL-12. Flow cytometric analysis was used to determine the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 under Th1-inducing (IL-12) and Th17-inducing (IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2;) conditions. Differentiation of TCR transgenic T cells with IL-12 resulted in &#x0223c;13% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing IFN-&#x003b3;, and &#x0003e;40% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiated with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; expressed IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To determine if the Th17 cells generated by IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; were encephalitogenic, Th17 and Th1 cells generated in vitro were transferred into naive B10.PL recipients. Although all of the mice that received Th1 cells developed EAE, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gocke et al., 2007</xref>), none of the mice that received the Th17 cells developed disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In addition, no CNS-infiltrating mononuclear cells were recovered from the mice receiving the Th17 cells. Pure populations of naive TCR transgenic T cells acquired by cell sorting of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>+</sup> cells were also differentiated in vitro with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2;, but these cells also failed to transfer EAE to recipient mice (unpublished data). It was possible that the Th17 cells were pathogenic but unable to access the CNS in the absence of Th1 cells. However, cotransfer of myelin-specific Th17 cells with suboptimal numbers of myelin-specific Th1 cells failed to induce EAE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Although pertussis toxin is not necessary to transfer EAE with the TCR transgenic Th1 cells, perhaps pertussis toxin was necessary for trafficking of Th17 cells to the CNS. However, i.p. injection of pertussis toxin on days 0 and 2 with transfer of Th17 cells also failed to induce EAE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>Th17 cells differentiated with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2;

However, analysis of the cytokine profile of the transferred T cells after secondary stimulation showed that there were actually three distinct populations of T cells generated during the restimulation: Th1 cells (37%), Th17 cells (6.6%), and a population that expressed both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 (5.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Thus, restimulation of the Th17 cells with antigen induced IFN-&#x003b3; production, making it unclear whether the IL-17&#x02013; or IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing cells caused the disease. This also suggests that Th17 cells may not have a stable phenotype, which was also observed with the OVA-specific OT-II TCR transgenic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the CNS-infiltrating cells, gated on CD45 and V&#x003b2;8 (expressed by the TCR transgenic T cells), were analyzed by flow cytometry. Although three populations of V&#x003b2;8<sup>+</sup> T cells were identified in the CNS as defined by cytokine production, the majority (54% single positive and 13% double positive) of CNS-infiltrating T cells produced IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), suggesting that the severe disease was associated with an expansion of V&#x003b2;8<sup>+</sup> IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;producing cells in the CNS. In an effort to maintain the Th17 phenotype upon restimulation with antigen, IL-23 or IL-1&#x003b2; were added during the restimulation with antigen, yet the cells still produced both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 and transferred disease similar to the cells restimulated with antigen only (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Role of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 in the differentiation of Th17 cells</title><p>Because IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; were capable of differentiating T cells into IL-17&#x02013;producing T cells but not sufficient to generate encephalitogenic T cells during primary stimulation, we speculated that an alternative pathway may occur in vivo that generates encephalitogenic Th17 cells. Because cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 had also been implicated in the differentiation of Th17 cells and EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langrish et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>), we investigated whether combinations of IL-6, TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-23 might be required for the generation of encephalitogenic myelin-specific Th17 cells. Naive wild-type splenocytes, depleted of antigen presenting cells, were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 with different combinations of these cytokines. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, many combinations of these cytokines generated T cells capable of producing IL-17. However, in the absence of TGF-&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003b3; was also produced, suggesting that TGF-&#x003b2; may be critical for suppressing IFN-&#x003b3; production, not necessarily inducing IL-17 production. Because differentiation with IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23 resulted in the greatest IL-17 production and IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23 + TGF-&#x003b2; had high IL-17 and low IFN-&#x003b3;, we investigated whether these cytokine combinations may generate Th17 cells capable of inducing EAE. Splenocytes from naive TCR transgenic mice were differentiated in vitro with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23, IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23 + TGF-&#x003b2;, or IL-12 and transferred into B10.PL mice. The mice that received the T cells differentiated with IL-12 or IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23 developed severe EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). As previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), T cells differentiated with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; did not transfer disease. However, the mice that received the T cells differentiated with IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23 + TGF-&#x003b2; did develop EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), albeit significantly milder cases than IL-12&#x02013; or IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23&#x02013;differentiated T cells. Analysis of the cytokines by flow cytometry at the time of transfer showed that T cells differentiated with IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23 + TGF-&#x003b2; were both Th1 (9.24%) and Th17 (6.8%) cells, making it unclear whether the disease was mediated by IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013; or IL-17&#x02013;producing T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). We have shown previously that the IL-1R signaling pathway is critical for the production of IL-12 and the differentiation of encephalitogenic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2003</xref>), and thus it appears that IL-1&#x003b2; is up-regulating IL-12 in antigen/APC-driven differentiation, which subsequently favors Th1 cell differentiation in the presence of IL-23. This experiment also illustrates that differentiation with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) generates different T cell phenotypes than antigen/APC-driven T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Although this may be in part caused by cytokines produced by the APCs, it may also be caused by differences in signaling cascades mediated by natural ligands that are not accurately recapitulated by antibody-mediated signaling (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Encephalitogenicity correlates with IFN-&#x003b3; production and T-bet expression.</bold> (A) Naive splenocytes from wild-type B10.PL mice were activated in vitro with anti-CD3/CD28 plus different combinations of cytokines for 72&#x02013;96 h.

Therefore, IL-10 was analyzed by flow cytometry in these four differentiation conditions and did not correlate with encephalitogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In fact, differentiation with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; generated the fewest IL-10&#x02013;producing T cells.

To verify that IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; was not promoting the differentiation of regulatory T cells, TCR transgenic cells differentiated with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; were cotransferred with TCR transgenic cells differentiated with IL-12. As expected, the cells differentiated with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; did not induce EAE; however, they did not reduce the severity of EAE in Th1-mediated disease when cotransferred into mice, indicating that they do not have a regulatory phenotype (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082584/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple cytokine combinations promote the differentiation of Th17 cells but fail to generate encephalitogenic Th17 cells</title><p>To determine to what extent IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-23, and TGF-&#x003b2; contribute to the differentiation of Th17 cells and determine if any combination of these cytokines can generate encephalitogenic Th17 cells, Th17 cells were generated using all combinations of these cytokines, or neutralizing these cytokines with antibodies. Because all combinations in the absence of TGF-&#x003b2; could produce IFN-&#x003b3; and TGF-&#x003b2; had been implicated as necessary for IL-17 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>), all combinations included TGF-&#x003b2; to increase the probability of generating pure Th17 cells.

It is interesting to note that although IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23 + TGF-&#x003b2; generated mildly encephalitogenic T cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, differentiation with IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23 + TGF-&#x003b2; + anti&#x02013;IL-6 failed to generate encephalitogenic T cells, suggesting that endogenous IL-6 was contributing to the development of encephalitogenic T cells.

However, we did not know if T-bet affected IL-17 production in myelin-specific effector T cells. We had previously found that draining lymph nodes from B6 mice immunized with MOG35-55/CFA express both Th1 and Th17 cells, as well as a small population of T cells that express both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 (unpublished data). To determine if T-bet plays a role in IL-17 production in T cells generated in vivo, B6 mice were immunized with MOG35-55/CFA and administered siRNA-Tbet or siRNA-NS via the tail vein to determine if T-bet affected the phenotype of the myelin-specific T cells that differentiated in vivo.

Although the percentage of IL-17<sup>+</sup> T cells was higher with anti-CD3/CD28 restimulation, IFN-&#x003b3; expression was similar with antigen/APC or anti-CD3/CD28 restimulation, indicating that the APCs were not responsible for the shift in cytokine production. In addition, the Th17 cells differentiated with antigen/APCs were transfected with siRNA-Tbet or siRNA-NS after the rest and before restimulation with MBP Ac1-11 and transferred into naive B10.PL mice. As expected, the mice that received the siRNA-NS&#x02013;transfected cells developed severe EAE, whereas the mice that received the siRNA-Tbet&#x02013;transfected cells had a significantly milder disease course (P = 0.002), suggesting that suppressing T-bet was beneficial in ameliorating EAE mediated by Th1 and Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>).

Previous EAE studies had demonstrated that Th17 cells generated in vivo by immunization with myelin peptides in CFA could be expanded in vitro with IL-23 and induce EAE when transferred into naive recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langrish et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGeachy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stromnes et al., 2008</xref>). However, these studies never excluded the possibility that myelin-specific Th1 cells were also being transferred, and two studies actually show that IFN-&#x003b3; is produced by the transferred populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGeachy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stromnes et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, several studies had identified conditions that promoted the differentiation of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>) yet had not determined if these differentiation conditions actually yielded encephalitogenic T cells. Using myelin-specific TCR transgenic mice that are housed in a specific pathogen-free environment, T cells were differentiated with TGF-&#x003b2; and combinations of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-23. Although several cytokine combinations generated myelin-specific T cells that expressed high levels of IL-17 in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;, these Th17 cells failed to induce EAE. As others have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langrish et al., 2005</xref>), we found that in vivo&#x02013;differentiated Th17 cells that are expanded in vitro with IL-23 are highly encephalitogenic (unpublished data), suggesting that myelin-specific Th17 cells contribute to disease pathogenesis. Thus, it appears that an alternative differentiation pathway generates encephalitogenic autoreactive Th17 cells in vivo.</p><p>Because myelin-specific Th17 cells differentiated in vitro with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; were not pathogenic after primary differentiation, we speculated that they may be inefficient effector T cells until reexposure to antigen. However, restimulation of Th17 cells generated in vitro resulted in decreased IL-17 production and increased IFN-&#x003b3; production, suggesting that Th17 cells may not have a stable phenotype. In addition, these cells transferred disease, but it was not clear whether the disease was caused by IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;, IL-17&#x02013;, or IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-17&#x02013;producing T cells because all were present in the transferred cells. Because identification of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013; and IL-17&#x02013;producing cells requires intracellular cytokine staining, it is not possible to sort these cells and transfer each population into recipient mice to identify the pathogenic T cell population. However, we were able to isolate the T cells from the CNS of these mice after disease onset and found that the majority of the myelin-specific T cells in the CNS produced IFN-&#x003b3;.</p><p>Because production of IL-17 was not sufficient for encephalitogenicity in our study but IFN-&#x003b3; was consistently associated with disease, we analyzed other factors that may determine whether a myelin-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population was encephalitogenic. One study suggested that IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; may not generate pathogenic Th17 cells, because myelin-specific T cells restimulated with these cytokines expressed IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGeachy et al., 2007</xref>). In that study, myelin-specific T cells from immunized mice were restimulated in vitro with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; &#x000b1; IL-23 and analyzed for cytokine expression by flow cytometry, and it was found that the cells failed to transfer disease. However, cotransfer of these IL-10&#x02013;producing cells with encephalitogenic T cells protected mice from EAE, suggesting that the cells were regulatory. In our study, we found no association between IL-10 production and encephalitogenicity in T cells undergoing primary differentiation with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2;. In fact, IL-10 expression was lowest in the T cells differentiated with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2;. Cotransfer of Th1 cells with Th17 cells differentiated with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; did not protect mice from EAE (Fig. S1). In contrast, T-bet expression had the highest correlation with encephalitogenicity. Thus, we speculate that TGF-&#x003b2;, a known antagonist of T-bet expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gorelik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2005</xref>), may be responsible for minimizing the encephalitogenic capacity of myelin-specific Th17 cells generated in vitro with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2;.</p><p>T-bet is a transcription factor that was first associated with the differentiation of Th1 cells and IFN-&#x003b3; production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szabo et al., 2000</xref>). We and others have found that T-bet is essential for the development of EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bettelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lovett-Racke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nath et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gocke et al., 2007</xref>) even though T-bet&#x02013;deficient mice produce IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrington et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furuta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Phoon et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, several models of autoimmunity in which IL-17 has been implicated as a pathogenic cytokine are not inducible in T-bet&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neurath et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bettelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Juedes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nath et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). These observations suggest that the generation of autoreactive Th17 cells in the absence of T-bet is not sufficient to induce autoimmunity, even when the Th17 cells are differentiated in vivo. Myelin-specific T cells from T-bet&#x02013;deficient mice fail to transfer disease to wild-type mice, confirming that T-bet is necessary for the generation of encephalitogenic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nath et al., 2006</xref>). Encephalitogenic T cells differentiated in vitro with IL-12 or IL-1&#x003b2; + IL-23 expressed high levels of T-bet, whereas addition of TGF-&#x003b2; consistently reduced T-bet expression and encephalitogenic capacity. When T-bet levels were analyzed in mice with spontaneous EAE, T-bet expression was high, although these cells produced little, if any, IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-17, suggesting that T-bet may be regulating other genes or pathways that are critical for encephalitogenicity, which may be unrelated to cytokine production. We have previously shown that suppression of T-bet inhibits IL-23R expression, and that T-bet binds the IL-23R promoter and plays a direct role in the transactivation of the <italic>IL-23R</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gocke et al., 2007</xref>). Historically, IL-23R was identified as a marker of memory Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oppmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parham et al., 2002</xref>), although the more recent literature suggests that the IL-23R pathway is critical for IL-17 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langrish et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stromnes et al., 2008</xref>). These data were ascertained by studying mRNA or how T cells responded to IL-23. Unfortunately, there is no commercial IL-23R antibody available for flow cytometric analysis to definitively determine the cell populations that express this receptor and how the engagement of the IL-23R affects cytokine production and pathogenicity by Th1 or Th17 cells. However, it is clear that IL-23&#x02013;deficient mice do not develop EAE, and thus, IL-23R engagement is critical in the pathogenesis of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cua et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that T-bet up-regulates IL-23R expression and that engagement of the IL-23R, whether on Th1 or Th17 cells, generates highly encephalitogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, other genes such as osteopontin have also been shown to be regulated by T-bet, and osteopontin-deficient mice have a reduced susceptibility to EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chabas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jansson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shinohara et al., 2005</xref>), necessitating a comprehensive analysis of genes transactivated by T-bet and their contribution to T cell encephalitogenicity.</p><p>The critical role of T-bet for encephalitogenicity was observed when siRNA was used to silence T-bet in highly encephalitogenic T cells that express both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17, resulting in the reduced pathogenic potential of these myelin-specific T cells. In addition, administration of T-bet siRNA to mice immunized with myelin peptides in CFA reduces both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 production, suggesting that T-bet's role in T cell differentiation is not limited to Th1 cells. We confirmed this observation by analyzing myelin-specific T cells from the CNS of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that express both IL-17 and T-bet. In IL-23&#x02013;driven IL-17&#x02013;producing T cells from myelin-immunized mice, T-bet was also observed in these pathogenic IL-17&#x02013;producing T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). Analysis of the draining lymph nodes after active induction of EAE demonstrated that the Th17 cells in IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice express higher levels of T-bet than wild-type controls, which suggest that encephalitogenicity is associated with enhanced T-bet expression. The fact that the draining lymph node cells from T-bet<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice express similar levels of Th17 cells in the absence of T-bet as IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice indicates that T-bet is a critical factor for determining encephalitogenicity, not IL-17 expression. It is also interesting to note that systemic administration of T-bet siRNA in wild-type mice suppresses development of Th17 cells, whereas immunization of mice with a genetic deletion of T-bet results in a significant population of nonencephalitogenic Th17 cells. This suggests that mice incapable of generating Th1 (T-bet<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice) promote Th17 cell differentiation but that wild-type mice in which T-bet is suppressed via siRNA do not favor Th17 cell differentiation, possibly because of Th1-related cytokines that are still present at low levels in the environment.</p><p>It was still unclear how T-bet<sup>+</sup> IL-17<sup>+</sup> encephalitogenic T cells could be generated if TGF-&#x003b2; was critical for development of Th17 cells. However, IL-6, in the absence of exogenous TGF-&#x003b2; and Th1-associated cytokines, promoted the differentiation of encephalitogenic Th17 cells that expressed T-bet. This confirmed that myelin-specific Th17 cells can induce EAE, but that T-bet must be expressed either by differentiation in a TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;low environment or differentiation with IL-6 + TGF-&#x003b2; and reexposure to antigen in a TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;low environment to allow for up-regulation of T-bet. The data in this study clearly define the necessity of T-bet in the development of autoimmune demyelinating disease, but they do not exclude the possibility that T-bet<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells contribute to pathogenesis. In addition, T-bet may be contributing to disease in multiple cell types, such as dendritic cells as observed in inflammatory arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), although this study focuses specifically on the role of T-bet in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>Although this study was initially designed to determine the role of myelin-specific Th1 and Th17 cells in EAE pathogenesis, we have found that pathogenesis is more closely associated with a transcription factor than cytokine production. We typically associate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell function with the cytokines that they produce. However, both IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013; and IL-17&#x02013;deficient mice develop EAE, although the disease course is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferber et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Komiyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haak et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of autoimmunity, the function of autoreactive T cells may be mediated by a particular signaling pathway (i.e., T-bet) that programs the cells to be pathogenic, and not the end product of a pathway (i.e., cytokine production).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Induction of EAE.</title><p>B10.PL mice transgenic for the MBP Ac1-11&#x02013;specific TCR chains V&#x003b1;2.3 or V&#x003b2;8.2 were a gift from J.
