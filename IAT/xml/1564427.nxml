Presently used antifilarial drugs are able to strongly reduce transmission and will thus ultimately lower the burden of morbidity associated with the infection, however, a chemotherapeutic principle that directly induces a halt or improvement in the progression of the morbidity in already infected individuals would constitute a major lead. In search of such a more-effective drug to complement the existing ones, in an area endemic for bancroftian filariasis in Ghana, 33 microfilaremic and 18 lymphedema patients took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a 6-wk regimen of 200 mg/day doxycycline. Four months after doxycycline treatment, all patients received 150&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;g/kg ivermectin and 400 mg albendazole. Patients were monitored for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and microfilaria loads, antigenemia, filarial dance sign (FDS), dilation of supratesticular lymphatic vessels, and plasma levels of lymphangiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor-C &#x0005b;VEGF-C&#x0005d; and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 &#x0005b;(s)VEGFR-3&#x0005d;). Lymphedema patients were additionally monitored for stage (grade) of lymphedema and the circumferences of affected legs. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> load, microfilaremia, antigenemia, and frequency of FDS were significantly reduced in microfilaremic patients up to 24 mo in the doxycycline group compared to the placebo group. The mean dilation of supratesticular lymphatic vessels in doxycycline-treated patients was reduced significantly at 24 mo, whereas there was no improvement in the placebo group. Preceding clinical improvement, at 12 mo, the mean plasma levels of VEGF-C and sVEGFR-3 decreased significantly in the doxycycline-treated patients to a level close to that of endemic normal values, whereas there was no significant reduction in the placebo patients. The extent of disease in lymphedema patients significantly improved following doxycycline, with the mean stage of lymphedema in the doxycycline-treated patients being significantly lower compared to placebo patients 12 mo after treatment. The reduction in the stages manifested as better skin texture, a reduction of deep folds, and fewer deep skin folds. In conclusion, a 6-wk regimen of antifilarial treatment with doxycycline against <named-content content-type="genus-species">W. bancrofti</named-content> showed a strong macrofilaricidal activity and reduction in plasma levels of VEGF-C/sVEGFR-3, the latter being associated with amelioration of supratesticular dilated lymphatic vessels and with an improvement of pathology in lymphatic filariasis patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Lymphatic filariasis, caused by filarial worms, is transmitted by mosquitoes. The infection leads to pathology such as edema of the legs (lymphedema) or the scrotum (hydrocele). About 120 million people are estimated to be infected, and 1.2 billion are at risk of infection. The currently used drugs (diethylcarbamazine &#x0005b;DEC&#x0005d; or ivermectin plus albendazole) to treat the disease are able to kill most of the larval stage (microfilariae) in the blood but have either no (ivermectin) or partial (DEC) effect on the adult worms that cause the pathology. They also do not sufficiently halt the progression of pathology, such as, lymph vessel dilation, hydrocele, and lymphedema.</p><p>In search of a more effective drug capable of killing the adult worms, and also of halting the progression of the disease in already infected individuals, the authors recruited, in an endemic area in Ghana, 33 people who were infected with the worm and microfilaremic but had not yet developed the disease, as well as 18 lymphedema patients, and treated them with either 200 mg/d doxycycline or matching placebo for 6 wk. The findings presented here reveal that doxycycline is able to kill the adult worms, improves lymphatic vessel dilation, and ameliorates the conditions of lymphedema patients significantly. This suggests that doxycycline can be used to treat lymphatic filarial infections and pathology, making doxycycline the first drug already approved for human use and considered for use as an adjunct to current control programs, which in addition to parasite control achieves improvement of the quality of life of persons with pathology.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Debrah AY, Mand S, Specht S, Marfo-Debrekyei Y, Batsa L, et al.

Additional evidence for the role of VEGF-C/VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 in the pathogenesis of lymphatic dilation and lymphedema stems from experimental studies in transgenic mice with skin specific overexpression of soluble VEGFR-3 (sVEGFR-3) using a <italic>keratin 14</italic> transgenic promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

These K14/ sVEGFR-3 transgenic mice lack a functional cutaneous lymphatic system and are characterized by lymphedema formation in the skin. The expression of VEGF-C has been shown to be up-regulated by proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1B and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), suggesting that proinflammatory cytokines could affect the lymphatic vessels via VEGF-C &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Studies in animal models have shown that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>&#x02013;derived molecules from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Brugia</named-content> spp. induced proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-1B &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

Together, these data allow the hypothesis that targeting <italic>Wolbachia</italic> by doxycycline may ameliorate filarial pathology through down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF-C/VEGFR-3.

To address these aims, we recruited microfilaremic and lymphedema patients in an endemic area in Ghana and treated them with 200 mg/d doxycycline for 6 wk. Lymphedema patients were followed up at 4 and 12 mo, whereas microfilaremic patients were re-examined at 4, 12, and 24 mo after the start of doxycycline treatment. We report that 6 wk of doxycycline had a strong macrofilaricidal activity; and targeting the endosymbiotic <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in filarial worms resulted in the reduction of plasma levels of VEGF-C/sVEGFR-3, which were associated with amelioration of dilated supratesticular lymphatic vessels and improvement of lymphedema in lymphatic filariasis patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We treated a total 95 patients with bancroftian filariasis (76 microfilaremic and 19 lymphedema) with doxycycline or matching placebo for 6 wk.

The adverse reactions arose on days 2 and 3 after commencement of treatment in both groups. The adverse reactions experienced by the eight doxycycline-treated patients included headache, dizziness, diarrhea, and itching skin. No adverse event went beyond 3 d or required more intervention than application of paracetamol tablets, oral dehydration salt, and ointment. The adverse reactions experienced by the ten placebo patients included headache, diarrhea, and painful scrotum. Again no event lasted for more than 3 d, except for one microfilaremic patient who had a painful scrotum for 6 d.

It must be mentioned that all patients continued to live in the endemic area; given a 5-y average life-span of adult worms and constant worm loads without treatment interference, new infections are expected to occur at a rate of about 20&#x00025; per year.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Measurement of Adult Worm Vitality in Microfilaremic Patients</title><p>Circulating filarial antigen (CFA) levels in plasma, and presence or absence of worm nests in ultrasound examinations, were used to assess macrofilaricidal activity of doxycycline.

Before doxycycline treatment, all 33 (17 doxycycline and 16 placebo) patients had antigenemia levels above 32,000 units (the highest level that can be semiquantitatively determined according to the manufacturer, TropBio). However, at 24 mo, 11/17 (65&#x00025;) of doxycycline-treated patients had antigen units below 32,000, compared to only 4/16 (25&#x00025;) of placebo patients.

Targeting the filarial worms by doxycycline reduces the levels of VEGF-C/sVEGFR-3, with amelioration of dilated supratesticular lymphatic vessels and improvement in the conditions of lymphedema patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020092-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020092-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

This may be similar to what pertains in animal models in which inhibition of the binding of VEGF-C to membrane-bound VEGFR-3 by sVEGFR-3 led to complete destruction of the lymphatic network and a lymphedema-like phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

The levels of endemic normals in the present study was somewhat higher, with a mean of 1,851 pg/ml (range 634&#x02013;2,805); it is not clear whether this reflects genetic differences between people of European descent and Africans, or a possible exposure of these persons to stimuli of the lymphangiogenetic system other than lymphatic filariasis. However, the levels of VEGF-C in microfilaremic and lymphedema patients were significantly increased over those of endemic normals before treatment. This finding, and more so the yet significantly elevated levels of sVEGFR-3 in lymphedema patients in comparison to microfilaremic patients (e.g., those with filarial infection but without overt lymphatic pathology), raises the question about the biological significance. Despite a vast literature on VEGF-C or sVEGFR3 expression in tissue (quantitative PCR and immunohistology), few data on plasma exist for these two factors, which are the major axis specific for lymphangiogenesis. What can be concluded from the available data are the following: (1) serum levels of VEGF-C are usually 10-fold higher than plasma levels, because of release from platelets during coagulation; this also means that plasma levels would be the more reliable marker since there is no (dominant) interference by platelet-derived VEGF-C &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;; and (2) measurement of plasma VEGF-C levels in cancer patients revealed 3-fold higher levels in comparison to controls &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. In this regard, it is assumed that the almost 3-fold increase of plasma VEGF-C levels in our LF patients over endemic normals would be biologically significant based on the comparison with cancer patients. Importantly, in our study, VEGF-C levels decreased by 12 mo after doxycycline treatment, well before the supratesticular lymphatic dilation improved. The fact that the VEGF-C reduction preceded the improvement of pathology indicates a possible causal interaction between lymphangiogenic factors reduced by doxycycline treatment and lymphatic pathology, rather than only a coincidence or an epiphenomenon.</p><p>A report on VEGF-C levels in cervical cancer patients provides levels in serum, not plasma, and is therefore not directly comparable to our data (see the constraints above); nevertheless, in that report, after anticancer therapy the levels decreased to the level of controls, accompanied by concomitant improvement in the conditions of the patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;, as also observed in our study in which levels decreased to those of endemic normals following doxycycline treatment.</p><p>Unfortunately no data exist as yet with regard to plasma sVEGFR3 levels and their biological significance for tumors.

This suggests that doxycycline can be used to improve the clinical manifestations of lymphedema due to filariasis. A reduction of the number of adenolymphangitis (ADL) attacks that was noted in both, doxycycline and placebo patients (unpublished data) could be attributed to the foot-care hygiene training given to all the lymphedema patients, and with an attempt by patients to demonstrate best compliance.

This may be due to the fact that that circumference determination is not a reliable parameter to assess improvement of the disease, as suggested by Dreyer and co-workers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, since it shows considerable variability due to transient effects such as keeping the leg elevated in the hours before measurement, or the female monthly hormonal cycle, etc. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of lymphedema do not only hasten the progression of lymphedema to elephantiasis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;, but also reduce the workforce and economic resources of the affected individuals and communities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d; in many endemic areas. Therefore, better treatment options are mandatory.</p><p>The current treatment of lymphedema, which mainly relies on foot hygiene, is suboptimal and still empirical. This is because it is not clear at present to which extent ADL attacks are caused by either filarial worms, including <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts, by exogenous bacteria, or by both &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Several chemotherapeutic agents have been tested, but so far, only 5,6 benzo-alpha-pyrone (coumarin) showed some encouraging results &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b076">76</xref>&#x0005d;. However, this drug is no longer recommended since it has been shown to be hepatotoxic &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;. Penicillin, which acts on some exogenous bacteria such as streptococci, but not on <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts, has also been tested and reported to be beneficial in reducing only the incidence of ADL attacks &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, but there was no significant reduction in the lymphedema stages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, in our study, treatment with doxycycline led to a significant amelioration of lymphedema stages. This could be due to the fact that doxycycline, in addition to targeting exogenous bacteria, also targeted <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts and reduced lymphangiogenic factors along with a reversion of lymph vessel dilation. In order for doxycycline to exert its ameliorating activity by targeting <italic>Wolbachia,</italic> it is mandatory that the targets, i.e., adult worms or at least incoming L3/4 larvae, are present in the host's body. Indeed, all our patients were either CFA-positive (although most they did not exhibit high levels, as known for lymphedema patients) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b078">78</xref>&#x0005d;, or they showed clearly positive antifilarial antibody titers as a sign of recent exposure (two cases), in accordance with the assumption that it is a characteristic feature of lymphedema that the patients have a strong immune reaction that is targeted to incoming L3 and L4 larvae, effectively killing them, however at the expense of strong inflammation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Studies are currently ongoing to compare the efficacy of doxycycline in CFA-positive in comparison to a larger group of CFA-negative lymphedema patients.</p><p>Lymphedema patients have a high level of suffering, and it can be well expected that they would use doxycycline for 6 wk without the need of a directly observed treatment (DOT). This is so all the more since the current mass treatment does not improve lymphedema per se. Hence, doxycycline treatment will have a good chance to be the first chemotherapeutic approach to address lymphatic pathology.</p><p>In conclusion, our data are in agreement with the hypothesis that progression of infection to lymphedema may be due to overexpression of lymphangiogenic factors such as VEGF-C and more so, sVEGF-R3, first due to the presence or the death of adult filarial worms in the lymphatic vessels and later (in the CFA-negative phase of the disease) either by the incoming larval stages of the parasite releasing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> upon being killed, or (additionally) by skin commensals such as streptococci &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b080">80</xref>&#x0005d; that exacerbate the condition by stimulating more proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF molecules, which are also reduced by doxycycline. This hypothesis is further supported by another study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b081">81</xref>&#x0005d; in which the level of serum VEGF was shown to remain the same in patients with bancroftian filariasis after DEC treatment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b081">81</xref>&#x0005d;, which does not have beneficial effects on lymphedema patients apart from reducing parasite loads &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. This is probably due to the fact that DEC treatment has no effect on bacteria (neither <italic>Wolbachia</italic> nor exogenous species), and therefore has no effect on proinflammatory cytokines that regulate this VEGF family, although it does partially reduce adult worm levels.</p><p>Although both microfilaremic and lymphedema patients had elevated VEGF-C and sVEGFR-3 levels, those of sVEGFR-3 were yet significantly higher in lymphedema patients compared to non-lymphedema patients that are microfilaremic (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0024, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020092-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This could be an indication that plasma levels of VEGF-C/sVEGFR-3 may correlate with disease progression in LF leading to lymphatic dilation and lymphedema development and hence, might be developed as prognostic indicators of an increased risk of LF pathology before it actually becomes manifest. Importantly, reduction of lymphangiogenic factors preceded the improvement in pathology. On the one hand, these data argue against a possible hypothesis that elevated levels of these factors merely reflect infection. On the other, they do offer a potential to identify individuals who are prone to develop more severe disease. For this, a prospective study is needed that would screen VEGF-C and sVEGFR-3 levels in children and young adults, and monitor development of pathology such as lymphedema. In human studies of lymphedema families, heterozygous inactivating missense mutations have been detected in the tyrosine kinase&#x02013;encoding region of Flt4 (VEGFR-3) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020092-b082">82</xref>&#x0005d;, indicating that some lymphedema patients have dysfunctional lymphatics due to defective VEGFR-3 signaling. This might also be exploited for the development of an early marker for lymphedema.</p><p>Considering the possible effect of VEGF-C/sVEGFR-3 on lymphatic dilation and lymphedema development, a combination of classical antifilarial plus antiwolbachial therapy, which will reduce production of proinflammatory cytokines, may prove to be more effective in treating pathogenesis associated with LF than antifilarial therapy alone. This study represents a first observation that antiwolbachial therapy does not only have macrofilaricidal activity but may also halt progression of manifestations associated with lymphatic filariasis, and have a potential restorative effect on LF patients. As discussed earlier, compliance to take doxycycline for extended periods is not expected to be an issue with individuals suffering from lymphatic pathology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This placebo-controlled, double-blind study was carried out in the Nzema East District in the Western region of Ghana.
