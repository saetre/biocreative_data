The assay relies upon the measurement of inorganic pyrophosphate generated in the first step of the aminoacylation of a tRNA. Pyrophosphate release is coupled to inorganic pyrophosphatase, to generate phosphate, which in turn is used as the substrate of purine nucleoside phosphorylase to catalyze the N-glycosidic cleavage of 2-amino 6-mercapto 7-methylpurine ribonucleoside. Of the reaction products, ribose 1-phosphate and 2-amino 6-mercapto 7-methylpurine, the latter has a high absorbance at 360 nm relative to the nucleoside and hence provides a spectrophotometric signal that can be continuously followed. The non-destructive nature of the spectrophotometric assay allowed the re-use of the tRNAs in question in successive experiments. The usefulness of this method was demonstrated for glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. Initial velocities measured using this assay correlate closely with those assayed by quantitation of [3H]Gln-tRNA or [14C]Trp-tRNA formation respectively. In both cases amino acid transfer from the aminoacyl adenylate to the tRNA represents the rate determining step. In addition, aminoacyl adenylate formation by aspartyl-tRNA synthetase was followed and provided a more sensitive means of active site titration than existing techniques. Finally, this novel method was used to provide direct evidence for the cooperativity of tRNA and ATP binding to GlnRS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2886"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2887"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2888"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2889"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2890"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2891"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2892"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
