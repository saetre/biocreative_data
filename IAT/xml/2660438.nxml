The expression of optineurin is induced by various cytokines. Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms which regulate optineurin gene expression and the relationship between optineurin and nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B). We cloned and characterized human optineurin promoter. Optineurin promoter was activated upon treatment of HeLa and A549 cells with tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;). Mutation of a putative NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site present in the core promoter resulted in loss of basal as well as TNF&#x003b1;-induced activity. Overexpression of p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B activated this promoter through NF-&#x003ba;B site. Oligonucleotides corresponding to this putative NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site showed binding to NF-&#x003ba;B. TNF&#x003b1;-induced optineurin promoter activity was inhibited by expression of inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;) super-repressor. Blocking of NF-&#x003ba;B activation resulted in inhibition of TNF&#x003b1;-induced optineurin gene expression. Overexpressed optineurin partly inhibited TNF&#x003b1;-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation in Hela cells. Downregulation of optineurin by shRNA resulted in an increase in TNF&#x003b1;-induced as well as basal NF-&#x003ba;B activity. These results show that optineurin promoter activity and gene expression are regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in response to TNF&#x003b1;. In addition these results suggest that there is a negative feedback loop in which TNF&#x003b1;-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activity mediates expression of optineurin, which itself functions as a negative regulator of NF-&#x003ba;B.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Optineurin is a cytoplasmic protein that is ubiquitously expressed although it shows higher level of expression in retina, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, placenta and kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005114-Li1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005114-DeMarco1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently it has been shown that optineurin negatively regulates TNF&#x003b1;-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation by binding to polyubiquitinated RIP (19). Towards the C-terminal end, a ubiquitin-binding domain has been identified in optineurin, which is also present in NEMO, a sub-unit of protein kinase IKK complex involved in NF-&#x003ba;B regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005114-Zhu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

The biological effects of TNF&#x003b1; are mediated by its binding to trimeric receptor, TNFR-1 which results in activation of two important signalling pathways that lead to activation of transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B and caspase-8. NF-&#x003ba;B comprises a family of inducible transcription factors that serve as important regulators of host immune response and inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005114-Wajant1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005114-Chen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. NF-&#x003ba;B is also involved in protecting cells from apoptosis by inducing many anti-apoptotic genes. NF-&#x003ba;B activity is regulated through association with an inhibitor, I&#x003ba;B which keeps NF-&#x003ba;B in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005114-Wajant1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005114-Chen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

The effect of ectopic expression of wild type optineurin and its E50K mutant on TNF&#x003b1;-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation was determined. HeLa cells were transfected with NF-&#x003ba;B luciferase reporter construct along with or without optineurin expression plasmids.

For this purpose two shRNAs were expressed which target two different regions of optineurin mRNA.

This promoter is active in HeLa as well A549 cells and is activated upon treatment of cells by TNF&#x003b1;. This promoter does not have a TATA box or an initiator element. It showed several putative Sp1 sites and one NF-&#x003ba;B site. Mutation of NF-&#x003ba;B site resulted in loss of activation of promoter by TNF&#x003b1;. In addition basal promoter activity was also reduced. Overexpression of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; resulted in inhibition of basal as well as TNF&#x003b1;-induced promoter activity. These results show that NF-&#x003ba;B is a crucial regulator of optineurin promoter activity. The location of NF-&#x003ba;B site immediately upstream of exon-1, requirement of NF-&#x003ba;B site for basal promoter activity and lack of an initiator element lead us to speculate that NF-&#x003ba;B might be involved in initiation of transcription from this promoter. Activation of optineurin promoter by TNF&#x003b1; suggests that TNF&#x003b1;-induced induction of optineurin gene expression is likely to be due to the activation of the promoter. A recent study has identified several target genes of NF-&#x003ba;B including optineurin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005114-Mrowka1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Deletion analysis resulted in identification of a minimal or core promoter (&#x02212;136 to &#x0002b;221) which is activated by TNF&#x003b1; and shows higher basal activity than the longer promoter in both HeLa as well as A549 cells. Higher basal activity of smaller promoter suggests that negative regulatory elements are present between &#x02212;856 and &#x02212;136 region of the promoter. However the negative regulatory elements present between &#x02212;856 and &#x02212;136 region do not seem to play a role in TNF&#x003b1;-induced activation because the core promoter shows as much activation by TNF&#x003b1; as the longer promoter.
