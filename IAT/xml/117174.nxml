Mutagenesis of host-encoded factors has begun to unravel the mechanism of several forms of RNA-mediated gene silencing and has suggested that it may have been conserved through evolution. This has led to the identification of certain host genes, which, when mutated, abrogate this phenomenon. Conversely, the identification of other factors that, when co-expressed or overexpressed, can enhance gene inhibition is equally important for both elucidating the mechanism of this process and enhancing gene silencing in recalcitrant systems. We have taken such a dominant genetic approach to identify several host-encoded factors that dramatically enhance target gene silencing when co-expressed with antisense RNA in fission yeast. The transcription factor thi1 and, surprisingly, the ATP-dependent RNA helicase ded1 were initially shown to enhance gene silencing in this system. Additionally, screening of a <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> cDNA library identified four novel antisense-enhancing sequences (<italic>aes</italic> factors) all of which are homologous to genes encoding proteins with natural affinities for nucleic acids.

The application of this strategy often results in only partial suppression, depending upon the gene being targeted or the organism in which it is employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c2">2</xref>). This is also true for other forms of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) such as double-stranded (ds)RNA-mediated gene silencing and RNA interference (RNAi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c3">3</xref>). The reasons for this variability of RNA-mediated gene silencing may include (i) the secondary structure of the complementary RNAs and target site accessibility, (ii) the stability of the antisense RNA molecule, (iii) the ratio of antisense and target RNA, (iv) the metabolic state of the cell, (v) the co-localisation of the complementary RNAs within the cell and (vi) the presence or absence of host factors that are part of the gene-silencing pathway(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c5">5</xref>).</p><p>RNA structure, annealing dynamics and stability are dependent on RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c6">6</xref>). Additionally, there are many proteins that bind to duplexed RNA which may affect antisense RNA-mediated gene inhibition, including ADAR, PKR, RNA helicases and RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c7">7</xref>). Several cellular proteins have been identified as facilitators of RNA duplex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c8">8</xref>). These include the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c11">11</xref>), the tumor suppressor protein p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c13">13</xref>) and the yeast initiation factor TifIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c14">14</xref>). These RNA-binding proteins may act to facilitate RNA hybridisation through various mechanisms. For example, the heterogenous nuclear ribonuceloprotein hnRNP A1 has been shown to strongly enhance RNA:RNA duplex formation through protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c11">11</xref>) and has thus been a candidate for modulating antisense RNA efficacy. It is reasonable to expect that alternative proteins would exist in fission yeast that act in a similar fashion to hnRNPs.</p><p>RNA helicases have roles in transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, RNA maturation, RNA transport and translation and RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c15">15</xref>). It is likely that unwinding of RNA duplexes also affects gene silencing. This could result in inhibition of the antisense effect by resolving dsRNA or it is conceivable that such helicases could enhance gene silencing if an RNAi-like mechanism was active where dsRNA was the catalytic molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c16">16</xref>). Recently, the RNA helicases SDE3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c17">17</xref>), DICER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c18">18</xref>) and MUT6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c19">19</xref>) have been shown to be central to dsRNA-mediated gene silencing in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and the alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, respectively.</p><p>Mutagenesis of host-encoded factors has begun to unravel the mechanism of PTGS and has suggested that it may have been conserved through evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c20">20</xref>). This has led to the identification of certain non-essential factors that, when down-regulated, affect the efficiency of gene silencing. In addition to RNA helicases, these genes include ones encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase &#x0005b;<italic>qde-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c21">21</xref>), <italic>sde1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c22">22</xref>) and <italic>ego-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c23">23</xref>)&#x0005d;, a RecQ DNA helicase &#x0005b;<italic>qde-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c24">24</xref>)&#x0005d;, an RNase D homologue &#x0005b;<italic>mut-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c25">25</xref>)&#x0005d;, an RNase III homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c18">18</xref>) and a putative translation initiation factor &#x0005b;<italic>rde-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c26">26</xref>), <italic>qde-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c27">27</xref>) and <italic>ago1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c28">28</xref>)&#x0005d;. Clearly, there may be several additional factors, in particular genes that are essential for cell viability, which are involved in gene silencing that, as yet, have not been identified.</p><p>In comparison with mutagenesis strategies, the identification of other factors that, when overexpressed, can enhance gene silencing is equally important for both elucidating the mechanism of these processes and enhancing gene silencing in recalcitrant systems. Here we present a genetic screening approach to identify several host-encoded factors that dramatically enhance target gene silencing when co-expressed with antisense RNA in fission yeast. These factors were named antisense-enhancing sequences (to be referred to as <italic>aes</italic> factors).

We use the fission yeast strain RB3-2 containing the chromosomally expressed target <italic>lacZ</italic> gene under control of the constitutive <italic>adh1</italic> promoter and antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> genes under control of the conditionally regulated <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f1">1</xref>A). In this system, we showed that antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing is dose dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c5">5</xref>). To demonstrate that a dominant genetic approach could be used to identify factors that enhance gene silencing by antisense RNA, we initially overexpressed the <italic>thi1</italic> gene in this model. This transcriptional activator has previously been shown to up-regulate transcription of the thiamine-repressible promoter <italic>nmt1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c37">37</xref>) and, as such, we hypothesised that activation of the <italic>nmt1</italic>-driven antisense gene would enhance <italic>lacZ</italic> inhibition. The plasmid pREP4-<italic>thi1</italic> was transformed into strain RB3-2 containing the antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> plasmid pGT2 and &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays were performed. Raw data were then normalised to account for plasmid segregation. As predicted, <italic>lacZ</italic> suppression in the <italic>thi1</italic>-expressing strain was enhanced when compared with a strain expressing antisense RNA alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f1">1</xref>B). When pREP4-<italic>thi1</italic> was introduced into RB3-2 in the absence of the antisense plasmid, no down-regulation of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was observed. As expected, northern analysis demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>thi1</italic> resulted in an increased level of steady-state <italic>nmt1</italic> RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f1">1</xref>C). This was shown for both the endogenous <italic>nmt1</italic> gene and the episomal <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter which is contained in the control vector. These results indicate that the transcriptional activator, <italic>thi1</italic>, could increase the intracellular dose of the antisense RNA that, in turn, enhances gene silencing. Furthermore, it suggests that additional rate-limiting host-encoded factors are present which may affect the robustness of RNA-mediated gene silencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-expression of the <italic>ded1</italic> helicase enhances antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing</title><p>Since RNA duplex formation can directly inhibit translation, RNA helicases were originally proposed to decrease antisense RNA-mediated gene inhibition as overexpression of an RNA helicase would enhance unwinding of the RNA duplex. However, recent evidence has shown that RNA helicases are required for other forms of RNA-mediated gene silencing, such as PTGS and RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c19">19</xref>). We therefore tested the ability of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> ATP-dependent RNA helicase gene, <italic>ded1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c38">38</xref>), in modulating antisense RNA efficacy by co-expressing it with various antisense genes in fission yeast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f1">1</xref>A). This particular RNA helicase was chosen because (i) it has been shown to be involved in translation initiation in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c38">38</xref>) and might therefore be a candidate for unwinding a mRNA-containing duplex, and (ii) <italic>ded1</italic> is an essential gene and therefore an ideal candidate RNA helicase to test by the dominant genetic approach.</p><p>Surprisingly, co-expression of <italic>ded1</italic> from the pREP4 plasmid and the long antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> (pGT2) from the pREP2 plasmid demonstrated complete inhibition of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity following normalisation for plasmid segregation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f2">2</xref>A). When <italic>ded1</italic> was overexpressed in the absence of the antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> vector, &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was comparable with control strains, indicating that the <italic>ded1</italic> effect was dependent on the presence of antisense RNA. The <italic>ded1</italic> vector was also co-expressed with a short 5&#x02032; antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> plasmid (pGT59) which was previously shown to be less effective than the full-length antisense gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c32">32</xref>). Again, overexpression of <italic>ded1</italic> stimulated antisense RNA-mediated <italic>lacZ</italic> inhibition. However, when the <italic>ded1</italic> gene was co-expressed with a short 3&#x02032; antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> plasmid (pGT61), which demonstrates negligible suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c32">32</xref>), no enhancement of gene silencing was observed. When <italic>ded1</italic> was expressed from a <italic>ura4</italic>-based plasmid (pREP4) there was no impact on the phenotype of the transformed strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f2">2</xref>B). However, in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c39">39</xref>), <italic>ded1</italic> expression from the weakly complementing <italic>LEU2</italic>-based plasmid (pREP2) caused aberrant morphology of transformed cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f2">2</xref>B). This is most likely due to differences in copy number of <italic>ura4</italic>- and <italic>LEU2</italic>-based plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c40">40</xref>). As <italic>LEU2</italic>-based plasmids are usually maintained at a higher copy number than <italic>ura4</italic>-based plasmids there would be a consequent increase in the steady-state level of ded1, which would produce a threshold of the protein that impacts on the cell cycle. In addition, we have observed an increased steady-state level of gene expression from <italic>LEU2</italic>-based plasmids compared with <italic>ura4</italic>-based plasmids (data not shown). The above observations confirmed that the <italic>ded1</italic> ORF was generating functional ded1 protein. In conclusion, these data indicate that the host-encoded ATP-dependent RNA helicase, <italic>ded1</italic>, can enhance antisense RNA efficacy when co-expressed with effective antisense RNA molecules.</p></sec><sec><title>Library screen for antisense-enhancing plasmids</title><p>Next, a <italic>S.pombe</italic> cDNA library was overexpressed in the antisense <italic>lacZ</italic>-expressing fission yeast strain to screen for novel host-encoded factors that would enhance gene silencing in the current system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f3">3</xref>). A <italic>S.pombe</italic> cDNA library was transformed into RB3-2 containing the episome-based long <italic>lacZ</italic> antisense plasmid (pGT2). The cDNA transformants are under control of the <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter and have the ability to be translated. From 12 000 transformants screened, 48 were initially identified as having a reduced blue phenotype compared with background transformants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f4">4</xref>A). Each of these transformants was independently isolated from the primary screen. Transformants also displaying an increased blue phenotype were identified, but these were not analysed further. Clearly, this system can also be employed to screen for host-encoded factors that, when overexpressed, inhibit antisense RNA efficacy. Quantitative analysis using the liquid &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay showed that 25 of the 48 transformants displayed a reproducible reduction in &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity compared with the antisense strain alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f4">4</xref>B). The control strain, RB3-2, transformed with the <italic>lacZ</italic> antisense construct, consistently demonstrated &#x0223c;55&#x00025; of control &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (prior to normalisation for plasmid segregation). The antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> gene and the host factor cDNA were both driven by the conditional <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter. Repression of the <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter by addition of thiamine to the culture medium resulted in a reversion to control levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. This indicated that the observed enhancement of suppression in these transformants was dependent on expression of the antisense RNA and&#x0002f;or the host factor cDNA and that this effect was not due to other events such as <italic>lacZ</italic> target gene mutations or modification of protein stability.</p><p>Following segregation of the antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> plasmid from these strains, 9 of the 25 transformants returned to the level of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity observed in the control strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f4">4</xref>B). Together with the above data, this indicates that the enhanced gene silencing observed in these nine strains was dependent on expression of antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> RNA. The cDNAs expressed in these transformants were therefore named <underline>a</underline>ntisense-<underline>e</underline>nhancing <underline>s</underline>equences (<italic>aes</italic> factors). The remaining 16 transformants retained a suppressed level of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity, indicating that the reduced blue phenotype of these transformants was not dependent on the presence of <italic>lacZ</italic> antisense RNA and that the cDNA encoded proteins in these strains were modulating <italic>lacZ</italic> gene expression by an alternative mechanism. It is possible that these factors are affecting the rate of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription or the stability of the &#x003b2;-galactosidase protein. Although these were not further characterised it will be of interest to determine their nature and mode of action on <italic>lacZ</italic> gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterisation of antisense-enhancing sequences</title><p>The library plasmids were recovered from the <italic>aes</italic>-containing strains and their cDNA inserts sequenced using primers specific for the <italic>nmt1</italic> expression cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c5">5</xref>; see Supplementary Material). BLASTN and BLASTP analyses were performed on the sequenced cDNA inserts using the NCBI GenBank facility. Four unique <italic>aes</italic> factors were characterised. The extent of homology for each of these is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f5">5</xref>.</p><p>BLASTN analysis identified the cDNA in the transformants W18, W20 and W30 (named <italic>aes2</italic>) as part of the mitochondrial elongation factor EFTu (accession no. AL049769). EFTu is the mitochondrial analogue of the eukaryotic EF1&#x003b1;, which acts in the cytoplasm transporting tRNA to the A site in the ribosome for peptide elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c41">41</xref>). The aes2 sequence corresponded to 181 amino acids of the central portion of the encoded protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f5">5</xref>A). Interestingly, the absence of the 5&#x02032; end of this protein may allow aes2 to act within the cytoplasm as the mitchondrial signal peptides, which allow for transportation from the cytosol to the mitochondria, are found in the N-terminus of mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c42">42</xref>).</p><p>Approximately 50&#x00025; of the cDNA sequence in transformants W21, W23 and W32 (named <italic>aes3</italic>) had complete identity to the 3&#x02032; end of a putative protein (accession no. D89239) that was previously identified in a screen for fission yeast ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c43">43</xref>). This portion of <italic>aes3</italic> also had complete homology to the antisense strand of the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of the fission yeast gene <italic>sna41</italic> (accession no. AB001379). The protein encoded by <italic>sna41</italic> was previously shown to be involved in DNA replication and has low homology (31&#x00025; identity) with the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> protein CDC45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c44">44</xref>). In addition, analysis of <italic>aes3</italic> showed that its 5&#x02032; end was comprised of an ORF which could be translated into an 84 amino acid protein containing a string of 36 arginine&#x02013;glutamic acid repeats. These types of amino acid repeats are often found in transcription factors, which lends further credence that this factor is acting directly on nucleic acids. Finally, it should be noted that the <italic>aes3</italic> sequence is possibly a chimera generated by library construction since the 5&#x02032; portion of this sequence is not homologous to the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>S.pombe sna41</italic> gene.</p><p>The cDNA in transformant W47 (named <italic>aes4</italic>) was completely homologous to the antisense strand of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> ribosomal protein L7a (accession no. AJ001133), a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Interestingly, several antisense transcripts have been identified in ribosomal loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c46">46</xref>). Additionally, a genome-wide screen has found complementarity between many mRNAs and rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c47">47</xref>), while more recently it has been shown that such RNA duplex formation may function as a mechanism of translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c48">48</xref>). <italic>aes4</italic> also contained a small ORF (105 amino acids) of unknown biological function. This protein sequence shared 52&#x00025; identity with a hypothetical protein in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (accession no. Z73150).</p><p>BLASTP analysis showed that the inserts in transformants W27 and W28 (named <italic>aes1</italic>) shared 43&#x00025; identity with amino acids 4&#x02013;202 of a <italic>Candida albicans</italic> hypothetical protein (accession no. AJ390519) which was identified in a screen for genes essential for cell growth (M. De Backer, personal communication). It also shared weak homology (39&#x00025; identity) with the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> thymidylate synthase (TS) protein (accession no. NP&#x0005f;011894.1). TS is required for the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of thymidine 5&#x02032;-monophosphate (dTMP) and also has RNA-binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c49">49</xref>). The degree of homology between the <italic>S.pombe</italic> aes1 protein and the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C.albicans</italic> proteins is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f6">6</xref>.</p><p>A tertiary &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay showed that these cofactors enhanced antisense suppression by up to 50&#x00025; when co-expressed with antisense RNA in the <italic>lacZ</italic> strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f7">7</xref>A). In this assay three individual colonies of transformants W27 (<italic>aes1</italic>), W30 (<italic>aes2</italic>), W21 (<italic>aes3</italic>) and W47 (<italic>aes4</italic>) were assayed in triplicate and normalised for plasmid segregation. All of the <italic>aes</italic>-expressing strains displayed normal growth rates and cellular morphologies, indicating that overexpression of the exogenous cDNAs did not affect general metabolism (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f7">7</xref>B). Northern analysis also confirmed RNA expression of selected <italic>aes</italic> factors in these strains, while transcripts of predicted sizes were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf312f7">7</xref>C). These results demonstrated that overexpression of a cDNA library was an effective way of identifying novel cofactors that magnify the suppressive effect mediated by antisense RNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A common genetic strategy for analysing the cellular function of a gene is to examine phenotypes associated with reduced gene expression levels. Previous studies have used mutagenesis approaches to identify proteins involved in different categories of RNA-mediated gene silencing. For example, a screen of <italic>Neurospora</italic> mutants that were defective in quelling of an endogenous gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c50">50</xref>) identified several proteins involved in PTGS, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c21">21</xref>) and a RecQ DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c24">24</xref>). A similar screen in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also identified mutants impaired in co-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c51">51</xref>), while mutagenesis of <italic>C.elegans</italic> strains have identified genes that are involved in RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c26">26</xref>). A common outcome of these approaches was that all of the genes identified were non-essential for cell viability. Clearly, one reason for this is that genes essential for cell growth or proper development will be selected against if their expression is perturbed.</p><p>&#x02018;Dominant genetics&#x02019; is an alternative approach to elucidate gene function based on increasing the intracellular concentration of an endogenous gene&#x02019;s encoded product and examining the resulting phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c52">52</xref>). This may result in either supplementation of the protein or in its inhibition via a transdominant negative effect. Here a unique overexpression strategy was developed for the identification of novel host-encoded factors that enhance antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing in fission yeast. It overcomes the major limitation of the mutagenesis approaches enabling genes that are both essential and non-essential for cell growth to be selected. It must be considered, however, that overexpression of certain genes can also be deleterious to the cell and, as a result, this screening strategy may also fail to identify a subset of host genes involved in gene silencing. It is therefore suggested that this approach should be used to complement mutagenesis strategies.</p><p>The first gene that was tested in modulating antisense RNA-mediated gene regulation in the present model was the <italic>S.pombe</italic> transcription factor <italic>thi1</italic>. As expected, overexpression of this gene up-regulated <italic>nmt1</italic>-driven antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription. Since antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing is dose-dependent in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c5">5</xref>), co-expression of <italic>thi1</italic> with the <italic>nmt1</italic>-driven antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> gene resulted in enhanced <italic>lacZ</italic> gene silencing. This result validated our approach of co-expressing host-encoded genes with antisense RNA for identifying factors that enhance gene silencing. To further validate this system we wished to co-express a gene that might inhibit gene silencing. To this end we chose the ATP-dependent RNA helicase gene <italic>ded1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c38">38</xref>). <italic>ded1</italic> is an essential gene which has previously been characterised as a suppressor of sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c39">39</xref>), a suppressor of checkpoint and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c53">53</xref>) and a general translation initiation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c38">38</xref>). If antisense RNA mediates gene silencing by forming an RNA duplex with mRNA, thereby sterically hindering translation, it might be a reasonable assumption that overexpression of an RNA helicase that is involved in translation initiation would interfere with antisense action, thereby increasing the level of <italic>lacZ</italic> gene activity.</p><p>Surprisingly, co-expression of the <italic>ded1</italic> gene from the <italic>ura4</italic> plasmid with the long antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> gene significantly enhanced antisense RNA-mediated <italic>lacZ</italic> inhibition by a further 50&#x00025; compared with control strains. When <italic>ded1</italic> was co-expressed with an ineffective antisense plasmid no enhancement was observed. These results suggest that <italic>ded1</italic>-mediated augmentation of gene silencing was dependent on an antisense RNA that was capable of some partial gene inhibition. This could be due to the absence of RNA duplex formation with the ineffective antisense RNA and the consequent lack of a substrate for the RNA helicase. This would be consistent with the role of an RNA helicase in dsRNA-mediated gene silencing. Interestingly, DICER in <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c18">18</xref>), MUT6 from the unicellular green alga <italic>C.reinhardtii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c19">19</xref>) and SDE3 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c17">17</xref>), all of which contain RNA helicase motifs, have recently been shown to be involved in dsRNA-mediated gene silencing. It will be interesting to examine whether homologues of these helicases also increase the efficacy of antisense RNA in fission yeast. We further address the possibility that antisense RNA is acting through a dsRNA-mediated gene silencing pathway in another study (M.Raponi and G.M.Arndt, manuscript submitted).</p><p>The enhanced gene silencing seen when antisense RNA was co-expressed with <italic>thi1</italic> or <italic>ded1</italic> established this system for the screening of novel factors that increase antisense RNA efficacy. Arndt <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c31">31</xref>) previously described an <italic>in vivo</italic> screening strategy for identifying the most effective antisense constructs against any gene of interest using the <italic>lacZ</italic> fission yeast model. In that study, conditions were identified that established a link between the blue colour colony phenotype and the degree of <italic>lacZ</italic>-encoded &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity within fission yeast transformants. In the work presented here similar conditions were utilised to screen the impact of a fission yeast cDNA library on the degree of antisense RNA-mediated <italic>lacZ</italic> gene silencing. From 12 000 transformants 48 were initially found to have a reduced blue phenotype compared with background colonies. Approximately half of these showed a reproducible phenotype when analysed in a secondary assay. Notably, isolation of transformants that contained the same cDNA sequence verified the power of this screening strategy in that it demonstrated the reproducible nature of the visual screen. Two classes of gene-silencing modulators were observed. The first acted independently of antisense RNA and may function either at the transcriptional level or by modifying the stability of the <italic>lacZ</italic> encoded protein. The second class only functioned in the presence of antisense RNA and were therefore named antisense-enhancing sequences (<italic>aes</italic> factors).</p><p>Four novel <italic>aes</italic> factors were identified using this screen (named <italic>aes1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>aes4</italic>); co-expression of these factors enhanced antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing by up to an additional 50&#x00025;. Sequence analysis suggested that each of the <italic>aes</italic> factors has the potential to interact with nucleic acids. Although each of these factors has the ability to be translated, further studies will be required to demonstrate whether their proteins are being expressed. Interestingly, evidence exists showing that L7a and EFTu interact during biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf312c54">54</xref>). This suggests that aes2 and aes4 may act through a similar mechanism to enhance gene silencing. However, while it can be speculated as to how these factors might be functioning in the gene-silencing phenomenon, further work will be required to understand their precise mechanism of action.</p><p>Overall, by using a co-expression strategy in a <italic>lacZ</italic> fission yeast model, five novel genes that enhance antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing have been identified. The overexpression strategy described herein overcomes some limitations associated with mutagenesis by identifying several genes that are essential for cell viability and with a potential role in gene silencing. In addition, this strategy complements other systems by allowing the isolation of cellular factors that modify the efficacy of RNA-mediated gene inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the co-expression of these factors with different forms of gene silencing activators, including sense RNA, antisense RNA or dsRNA, could be one way of enhancing the efficacy of these methods. This may be especially important for application of antisense RNA and dsRNA to mammalian cells and tissues or to genes that have been recalcitrant to these forms of regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_30_11_2546__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_30_11_2546__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf312f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Overexpression of the transcriptional activator <italic>thi1</italic>.
