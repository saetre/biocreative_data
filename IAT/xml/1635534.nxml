The density of promoter-like sequences, that could be recognizable by RNA polymerase and may function as potential promoters, is high within regulatory regions, in contrast to coding regions and regions located between convergently transcribed genes. Moreover, functional promoter sites identified experimentally are often found in the subregions of highest density of promoter-like signals, even when individual sites with higher binding affinity for RNA polymerase exist elsewhere within the regulatory region. In order to see the generality of this pattern, we have analyzed 43 additional genomes belonging to most established bacterial phyla. Differential densities between regulatory and nonregulatory regions are detectable in most of the analyzed genomes, with the exception of those that have evolved toward extreme genome reduction. Thus, presence of this pattern follows that of genes and other genomic features that require weak selection to be effective in order to persist. On this basis, we suggest that the loss of differential densities in the reduced genomes of host-restricted pathogens and symbionts is an outcome of the process of genome degradation resulting from the decreased efficiency of purifying selection in highly structured small populations. This implies that the differential distribution of promoter-like signals between regulatory and nonregulatory regions detected in large bacterial genomes confers a significant, although small, fitness advantage.

In fact, large GC-rich genomes (<italic>Pseudomonas, Ralstonia,</italic> and most of the alpha-proteobacteria) display motif scores above those of <italic>E. coli,</italic> probably due to the greater compositional difference between the AT-rich motifs and the background genomic sequence.

Two main alternative profiles were obtained, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020185-g003">Figure 3</xref> (profiles for all species analyzed are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020185-sg001">Figure S1</xref> and at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ccg.unam.mx/Computational_Genomics/PromotorTools/PLoS06/Figure_S1.hmtl">http://www.ccg.unam.mx/Computational&#x0005f;Genomics/PromotorTools/PLoS06/Figure&#x0005f;S1.hmtl</ext-link>). Regulatory and nonregulatory regions contain differential densities of promoter-like signals in 24 genomes, including genera belonging to phyla distantly related to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>, such as the <italic>Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria,</italic> and <italic>Thermotogae</italic>. Clearly, the presence of the pattern is highly dependent on genome size (Pearson's correlation &#x0003d; 0.59, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). All genomes above 4 Mb display marked differences in promoter-like signals between regulatory and nonregulatory regions, whereas none of the genomes under 1.5 Mb do so. Among the genomes of intermediate size, the pattern is detectable in 65&#x00025; of the cases. There is also a notable effect of GC content (Pearson's correlation &#x0003d; 0.58, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Although the differential signal densities can be seen in genomes of very different GC contents (from 30&#x00025; GC <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactococcus lactis</named-content> to 62&#x00025; GC <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ralstonia solanacearum</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caulobacter crescentus</named-content>), overall, 75&#x00025; of GC-rich genomes display the differential pattern, in contrast to 53&#x00025; of those under 50&#x00025; GC. Multiple regression analysis reveals that up to 0.43 of the variance in pattern overrepresentation might be related to these two variables, genome size and GC content (for a correlation of about 0.66).</p><p>To test if the accumulation of promoter-like signals observed in regulatory regions is due to AT-richness of these sequences, we generated randomized regulatory sequences (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) and we searched for promoter-like signals. As expected, the randomized regulatory sequences of large genomes show flattened distributions with significantly less promoter-like signals than real regulatory regions (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), meaning that observed densities in regulatory regions are not due to an AT bias. Results for random regulatory regions are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020185-sg002">Figure S2</xref> and at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ccg.unam.mx/Computational_Genomics/PromotorTools/PLoS06/Figure_S2.hmtl">http://www.ccg.unam.mx/Computational&#x0005f;Genomics&#x0005f;PromotorTools/PLoS06/Figure&#x0005f;S2.html</ext-link>.</p><p>The observations here reported strongly suggest that the differential density of promoter-like signals in regulatory and nonregulatory regions of large bacterial genomes is maintained by natural selection. First, the fact that this pattern is observed in phylogenetically distant genomes argues against mutational biases being its main source, since mutational biases are known to vary among genomes, particularly when there are large differences in GC content. Second, differential signal density is highly dependent on large genome size, and is completely absent from most of the small genomes of animal parasites and symbionts with an intracellular or predominantly host-restricted lifestyle <italic>(Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Treponema, Borrelia, Campylobacter, Rickettsia, Buchnera,</italic> and <italic>Wigglesworthia)</italic>. And third, analysis on conservation of promoter-like signals in a group of 14 related species shows 79&#x00025; signal conservation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Degradation of Regulatory Functions in the Small Genomes of Host-Restricted Bacteria</title><p>Acquisition of such obligate dependence on a host is known to have many deleterious consequences, collectively known as genome degradation or genome reduction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Reduced genomes have independently evolved many times within several bacterial phyla, repeatedly undergoing rapid sequence evolution and acquiring extremely low GC content, often with clearly maladaptive consequences, including accumulation of deleterious amino acid substitutions and loss of adaptive codon biases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Typical changes also include a large increase in the frequency of mobile elements in the early phases of genome degradation, chromosomal rearrangements mediated by recombination among these elements, pseudogene formation, and deletions of varying size. There is recent evidence that genome degradation also affects gene regulation, due to losses of certain promoter sequences, specialized &#x003c3; factors, and regulatory proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. These common changes likely reflect a diminished capacity of reduced genomes to respond to natural selection, conducive to the accumulation of all types of moderately deleterious mutations that would normally be purged from the genomes of free-living bacteria. This lowered effectiveness of purifying selection is due to the subdivided population structure imposed by confinement within a host, which limits the effective size of the bacterial population by subjecting it to recurrent bottlenecks and by thwarting opportunities for recombination with close relatives &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, different types of molecular evolutionary analyses indicate that the rate of generation of point mutations is accelerated in reduced genomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We argue that a decrease in the efficiency of purifying selection in host-restricted bacteria allows promoter-like signals to rapidly accumulate all along the genomic sequence of these organisms, causing the loss of differential signal density patterns.

The increased frequency of promoter-like signals could have regulatory implications by making it more difficult for RNAP to correctly identify regulatory regions and the functional promoters within them. In that case, one could expect a slow response to changes in cellular conditions and/or a decreased level of gene expression.</p><p>To further test whether genome degradation produces loss of differential signal densities, we decided to compare signal density patterns between a genome that has recently entered a process of degradation and close relatives evolving under stronger purifying selection. Our initial analyses pinpointed <italic>Mycobacterium leprae,</italic> the obligate intracellular pathogen that causes leprosy, as one of the rare genomes above 3 Mb for which differential promoter signal densities are not detected. However, although the genome of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. leprae</named-content> remains relatively large (3.27 Mb) and GC-rich (58&#x00025; overall), it is clearly decreasing in size and GC content relative to its closest relative, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> (4.41 Mb and 65.6&#x00025; overall GC). Genome comparisons between different mycobacterial species indicate that <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. leprae</named-content> has also undergone massive gene decay by pseudogenization and deletion, as well as numerous genomic rearrangements likely due to the proliferation of IS elements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. As we expected, analyses of promoter-like signals in two strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> do reveal the differential signal densities characteristic of large genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020185-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020185-t003">Table 3</xref>). Both <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> strains display higher average scores than <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. leprae</named-content> for the &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 promoter motifs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020185-t003">Table 3</xref>), supporting the idea that the leprosy bacillus is undergoing a general degradation of its regulatory sequences. Preliminary comparative analyses between the upstream regions of pseudogenes in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. leprae</named-content> and the regulatory regions of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. leprae</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> reveal an evident increase of promoter-like signals in the upstream regions of pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020185-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Studies about mechanisms that prevent the unnecessary expression of degenerated genes suggest that the accumulation of mutations in ribosome-binding sites and promoter regions provoke a translational and transcriptional silencing of pseudogenes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Overall, the promoter-like signals upstream of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. leprae</named-content> pseudogenes still retain the conserved &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 conseni of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters (&#x0201c;TTGACA&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;TATAAT&#x0201d;, respectively), indicating that promoter degeneration is not yet pervasive across the pseudogenes of this species. However, the average scores of the &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 motifs of promoters in pseudogenes are below the average scores of the promoters found in the regulatory regions, especially for the &#x02212;35 motif (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020185-t003">Table 3</xref>), implying a certain level of degradation of these signals. It is known that the &#x02212;35 box is dispensable for transcription initiation as long as there is a regulatory mechanism to anchor the polymerase in the promoter, which can be achieved by regulatory proteins or extended &#x02212;10 boxes. We suggest that excessive density of lightly degraded promoter-like signals may be silencing pseudogenes in two ways: (i) by attracting the polymerase to sites that could be competing with the &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; promoter and/or (ii) by presenting polymerase binding sites where the &#x02212;35 degraded box is not sufficient to support open complex formation. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020185-st001">Table S1</xref> in Supporting Information shows selected comparisons between <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. leprae</named-content> pseudogenes and their corresponding functional equivalents in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Potential Functions of the Promoter-Like Signals</title><p>In the course of our analyses, we identify two types of promoter-like signal densities: a global density and a local density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020185-g004">Figures 4</xref> and 7 in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;). The global density is obtained during the search for the &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 motifs using PWMs. In <italic>E. coli,</italic> this search produces an average of 38 promoter-like signals per 250-bp regulatory region, which may be distributed evenly across the sequence or present different levels of overlap. The second type of density, the local density, results from applying the COVER function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;, which establishes a competition on the set of promoter-like signals in terms of &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 score and position of the signal regarding the gene start, selecting the more probable candidates to be functional promoters (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Material and Methods</xref> section for details). In <italic>E. coli,</italic> COVER produces 4.7 signals in average per 250-bp regulatory region. Most of these signals tend to exist as a series of overlapping potentially competing RNAP binding sites. The average size of these clusters of overlapped signals is 42 bp. Seventy-four percent of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> experimentally mapped promoters are embedded in this kind of clusters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. We suggest that each of these types of densities may be maintained by natural selection for very different reasons.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Global density of promoter-like signals in regulatory regions.</title><p>It is most likely that the global density is largely built by promoter-like signals that do not substitute the function of the primary promoter which has to respond to a given cellular condition; this would be the case if the majority of detected signals could bind RNAP and form a closed complex but were not able to proceed with the subsequent steps required to initiate transcription. However, a subset of these promoter-like signals could be just a single point mutation away from being able to operate as active transcription initiation sites. These could be called cryptic promoters, in analogy to cryptic genes that can be activated by single mutations. Some cryptic promoters could be relics of ancient promoters, indicating the high frequency of changes in regulatory regions. This high frequency correlates with the observed high flexibility in the evolution of transcriptional regulators in bacteria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The permanence of cryptic promoters in the regulatory regions of bacteria could be facilitated by different kinds of evolutionary processes. First, they could constitute a collection of &#x0201c;back up&#x0201d; promoter sequences, maintained by selection for robustness. Bacteria having redundant signals capable of acquiring functionality with a single base change would increase in frequency in the population, because a fraction of their descendent cells would carry such activating mutations and would be able to survive in the advent of a deleterious mutation that destroyed the main promoter. In other words, the existence of multiple potential promoters would minimize the deleterious effects of genetic mutations on gene expression. In addition, for bacterial species prone to encounter a variety of environments, the existence of cryptic promoters of different strength could also allow for rapid evolution of changes in gene expression allowing adaptation to environmental changes. Taking into account that for &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> transcription, the precise positioning of the regulatory proteins strongly determines their positive or negative role &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, this large availability of promoter-like sequences provides a fertile ground for quick changes in the role of regulatory proteins. Those changes have been proposed to depend on the demand of gene expression in a model where selection governs changes in gene regulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>It is also possible that some of the signals detected in regulatory regions are not cryptic but rather fully functional promoters that are utilized only in special conditions. Although, in general, the site of transcription initiation is known to be rather precise, 25&#x00025; of the transcription units in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> are known to be transcribed by more than one single promoter. The average number of mapped promoters coexisting in multiple-promoter regulatory regions is 3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The simultaneous availability of alternative promoters for a given gene would provide plasticity of gene expression in response to different conditions regularly encountered by the bacterial cell.</p><p>The regulatory region of the <italic>E. coli lac</italic> operon exhibits signals of both types. Six promoter sequences have been experimentally detected in close proximity to the primary <italic>lac</italic> promoter <italic>(lacP1)</italic>. Four signals were created via single base pair mutations in the wild sequence, and two were detected in vivo as weak promoters that function when the primary promoter is impaired and its activator protein is absent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Finally, the global density of promoter-like motifs in the regulatory regions could be bringing the polymerase near the promoter during the random DNA search prior to forming closed complexes, by attracting the enzyme to the general vicinity of the functional promoter. However, kinetic studies suggest that this might only result in a minor increase in the rate of formation of closed complexes (Jay D. Gralla, personal communication).</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Local density of overlapping promoter-like signals.</title><p>Overlapping promoter-like signals could play a regulatory role through functional interaction with the true promoter sequence, and their effect on regulation could be negative or positive.</p><p>Overlapping signals could negatively affect regulation by different means. The overlapping promoter-like signals might play a negative role if their interaction with RNAP were competitive. When two or more promoters are in close proximity, the potential exists for competition between them for the binding of RNAP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Regulatory proteins play an important role in helping RNAP to choose the functional promoter sequence according to specific conditions. The regulation of the <italic>gal</italic> gene is an example of the effect of regulatory proteins on the positioning of RNAP between two competing promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Also, the promoter-like signals could also induce pauses in the early steps of elongation when &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is still bound to core RNAP. The strongest evidence indicating that &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> can play a functional role during elongation comes from studies of the bacteriophage &#x003bb; PR&#x02032; promoter and the lacUV5 promoter. Biochemical experiments have shown that &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-dependent pause occurs during early elongation in these promoters after RNAP has escaped from the promoter and synthesized a 16 or 17 nucleotide transcript. This pause is mediated by protein&#x02013;DNA interaction between &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and a DNA sequence element in the initially transcribed region that resembles a promoter &#x02212;10 element &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>On the other hand, overlapping signals could also affect regulation positively. Some of these sites could be noncompetitive weak promoters that, in the absence of activation of the primary promoter, produce basal transcription of downstream genes. For example, transcription units that encode their own regulator would require constitutive levels of basal transcription. The overlapping promoter-like signals might also play a positive role by collecting RNAP molecules which could then be channeled to the primary promoter sequence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020185-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Clearly, the distribution of the differential pattern of promoter-like signal densities among bacterial genomes mirrors that of genes and other genomic features that require weak selection to be effective in order to persist. This implies that the differential density of promoter-like signals between regulatory and nonregulatory regions confers some small but significant fitness advantage. Therefore, the outcome of gene regulation could be affected by factors much beyond the sequence of a single pair of RNAP binding sites in a given regulatory region, including the general abundance and organization of promoter-like signals in the region, as well as the presence of signals in the non-regulatory portions of the genome. Identification of the specific types of selective constraints that shape the number, position and arrangement of promoter-like signals across the different genomic regions of large bacterial genomes will require further comparative analyses among closely-related bacteria.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Sequence data.</title><p>To evaluate the genomic frequency of promoter-like signals, three kinds of regions were defined in each genome according to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) annotations: coding, convergent, and strictly noncoding (excluding the convergent regions).</p><p>Coding regions contain genes with sizes above 1 kb.

Nonregulatory regions include the coding regions and the noncoding regions between convergently transcribed genes. For coding regions, the middle point of a gene was taken as the position 0 and 500 bases upstream and 500 bases downstream of this position were included.
