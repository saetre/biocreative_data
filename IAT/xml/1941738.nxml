However, despite the growing interest in alternative promoters and their role in genome diversification, very little is known about how and on what occasions those promoters are differentially regulated. Runx1 transcription factor is a key regulator of early hematopoiesis and a frequent target of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias. Mice deficient in <italic>Runx1 </italic>lack definitive hematopoiesis and die in mid-gestation. Expression of <italic>Runx1 </italic>is regulated by two functionally distinct promoters designated P1 and P2. Differential usage of these two promoters creates diversity in distribution and protein-coding potential of the mRNA transcripts. While the alternative usage of P1 and P2 likely plays an important role in <italic>Runx1 </italic>biology, very little is known about the function of the P1/P2 switch in mediating tissue and stage specific expression of <italic>Runx1 </italic>during development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We employed mice bearing a hypomorphic <italic>Runx1 </italic>allele, with a largely diminished P2 activity, to investigate the biological role of alternative P1/P2 usage. Mice homozygous for the hypomorphic allele developed to term, but died within a few days after birth. During embryogenesis the P1/P2 activity is spatially and temporally modulated. P2 activity is required in early hematopoiesis and when attenuated, development of liver hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) was impaired. Early thymus development and thymopoiesis were also abrogated as reflected by thymic hypocellularity and loss of corticomedullary demarcation. Differentiation of CD4/CD8 thymocytes was impaired and their apoptosis was enhanced due to altered expression of T-cell receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data delineate the activity of P1 and P2 in embryogenesis and describe previously unknown functions of Runx1.

The members of this gene family, <italic>RUNX1, RUNX2 </italic>and <italic>RUNX3 </italic>are key regulators of lineage-specific gene expression in major developmental pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The three RUNX proteins recognize the same DNA-motif and regulate their target genes through interaction with a common group of transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Interestingly, however, the functional overlaps are minor and each RUNX protein has a distinct subset of biological functions. Accordingly, each of the corresponding RUNX knockout (KO) mice displays a unique subset of phenotypic abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This lack of functional redundancy results from a tightly regulated spatio/temporal expression mediated by an intricate transcriptional control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For example, both <italic>Runx1 </italic>and <italic>Runx3 </italic>genes are expressed in developing dorsal root ganglia, but in different classes of sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and both are expressed in mature T cells, but at different stages during T cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the mouse embryo, expression of Runx1 is first detected in definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and in endothelial cells at HSC emergence sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These occurrences correlate well with the earlier findings that homozygous disruption of <italic>Runx1 </italic>results in a complete absence of fetal liver hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Postnatally, Runx1 is highly expressed in several hematopoietic lineages including myeloid, B- and T-lymphoid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and is required for megakaryocytic maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast to the critical role of Runx1 during embryogenesis, it is less essential for adult hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], albeit conditional inactivation is associated with a number of hematopoietic abnormalities including myeloproliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Runx1 is also expressed in a number of other tissues at specific time windows during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, due to the early (E12.5) lethality of homozygous null Runx1 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], relatively little is known about the function of <italic>Runx1 </italic>in these tissues. In developing thymus Runx1 is more abundantly expressed in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] during early stages of thymopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Transgenic mice that express a dominant-negative form of <italic>Runx1 </italic>display defects in maturation of single positive (SP) CD4 and SP CD8 thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Additionally, naive T cells from these mice exhibited increased production of IL4, lack of <italic>GATA3 </italic>expression and enhanced Th2 differentiation of CD4<sup>+ </sup>helper-T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Selective inactivation of <italic>Runx1 </italic>in T-cell progenitors demonstrated that <italic>Runx1 </italic>acts in double negative (DN) thymocytes to repress CD4 expression and to up-regulate CD8 as cells differentiate into the double positive (DP) thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. ES cells bearing a mutant Runx1 lacking the C-terminal repression sub-domain, failed to adequately contribute to the thymus in chimera mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In the knock-in model of this mutant, the overall number of thymocytes was significantly reduced and the thymus contained a higher proportion of SP CD4 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that transcription of <italic>Runx1 </italic>is regulated by two distantly located promoter regions designated P1 and P2 for the distal and proximal, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The P2 is nested within a particularly large and evolutionary conserved CpG island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], while no such CpG rich region is found in P1. The two promoters are regulated in a cell type-specific manner and respond to mitogenic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The P1- and P2-derived primary transcripts are processed into a diverse repertoire of alternatively spliced mRNAs that are differentially expressed in various cell types and at different developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The P1 and P2 mRNAs differ at their 5'-coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and the resulting protein isoforms differ in their biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Similarly, a number of P2-derived splice-variants bear shorter reading frames that lack the transcriptional activation domain and can act in a dominant negative manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Forced expression of such isoforms results in transcriptional repression of <italic>Runx1 </italic>target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and in blocking of myeloid differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Hence, differential usage of P1 versus P2 has a profound effect on the repertoire and nature of Runx1 isoforms in the cell, which likely impacts on the regulation of Runx1 target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Significantly, disruption of P1 by the 12;21 chromosomal translocation results in the most common subtype of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>P1- and P2-transcripts also differ in the structure and function of their 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). The P1-5'UTR is relatively short and mediates cap-dependent translation, whereas the P2-5'UTR is particularly long, contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and mediates cap-independent translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These structurally and functionally different 5'UTRs could have a profound effect on translation efficiency of Runx1 mRNAs. Indeed, in cell lines where P2 transcription predominated, P2-5' IRES-dependent translation was more efficient than P1-5' cap-dependent translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. IRES-dependent translation is particularly important during development, in times when cap-dependent translation in proliferating or differentiating cells is down-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. While it is clear that the regulation of <italic>Runx1 </italic>expression by alternative P1/P2 usage is a potentially key paradigm in the <italic>in vivo </italic>regulation of Runx1, very little is known about the role of the P1/P2 switch in mediating tissue and stage specific expression of <italic>Runx1 </italic>during development.</p><p>To investigate the biological function of the P1/P2 switch during embryogenesis, we generated mice bearing a hypomorphic <italic>Runx1 </italic>allele by inserting a <italic>neomycin </italic>(<italic>neo</italic>) gene into the P2 region (P2<sup>neo</sup>). Mice homozygous for the P2<sup>neo </sup>allele (P2<sup>neo/neo</sup>) displayed a markedly attenuated P2 activity. Nevertheless, these mutant mice developed to term, but newborns died within a few days after birth. We show that the P1/P2 switch is developmentally regulated and that the two promoters are alternatively used during embryogenesis. P2 mediated transcription is required during early thymopoiesis for the proper development of the thymus and for differentiation of DN and DP CD4/CD8 T cells. Attenuation of P2 activity results in impaired development of fetal liver hematopoietic precursors and in enhanced apoptosis of thymocytes due to altered expression of T-cell receptors (TCRs). The data describe previously unknown functions of Runx1, delineate the activity of P1 and P2 in embryogenesis, show unequivocally that their function during development is non redundant and underscore the significance of the two promoters in <italic>Runx1 </italic>biology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of Runx1 P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>mice and phenotypic analysis of mutant newborns</title><p>Null mutation in <italic>Runx1 </italic>results in embryonal lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As P2 activity starts early in embryogenesis (Levanon D. and Groner Y. unpublished), we envisaged a scenario in which germline inactivation of P2 will also result in embryonal death. To avoid this occurrence we explored means to selectively attenuate the activity of <italic>Runx1 </italic>P2. We have previously demonstrated that the genomic region upstream the transcription start sites of <italic>RUNX1 </italic>P2 was important for regulated transcription of <italic>RUNX1 </italic>in various cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We thus assessed whether insertion of a <italic>neo </italic>cassette into this region affects P2 activity in transfected cells (See additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> for constructs, results and methods). Transfection experiments indicated that insertion of a <italic>neo </italic>cassette into the P2 region specifically attenuated P2-mediated transcription in several cell lines and encouraged us to utilize this approach for evaluating the biological activity of <italic>Runx1 </italic>P2 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Attenuated <italic>Runx1 </italic>P2 expression in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>embryos impaired thymus development</bold>.

The resulting heterozygotes bearing the remaining <italic>loxP </italic>sequence within the P2-<italic>XbaI </italic>site were mated and offspring homozygous to P2-loxP were obtained at the expected Mendelian proportion (25%). Significantly, <italic>Runx1</italic><sup>P2loxP/loxP </sup>(P2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>) mice were indistinguishable form WT littermates indicating that the early lethality phenotype of P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>newborns was due to the presence of the <italic>neo </italic>cassette in the P2 region.</p></sec><sec><title>Attenuated Runx1 expression in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>mice</title><p>The above-described phenotypic manifestation of the P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>allele posed a question as to how the expression level of <italic>Runx1 </italic>was affected. To address this issue, <italic>Runx1 </italic>expression in various tissues was examined using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA in situ hybridization (RISH) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In tissues of P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>mice, such as kidney and tongue, where Runx1 expression is normally mediated by both P1 and P2, only P1-transcripts were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In contrast, no Runx1 expression was detected by either RT-PCR or IHC in developing gastric epithelium where only P2 is normally active (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). P2<sup>neo </sup>is therefore a hypomorphic allele of <italic>Runx1 </italic>in which P2 activity is largely diminished. Interestingly, however, no developmental abnormalities were detected by macroscopic and histological examination of kidney, stomach and tongue of mutant embryos or newborns. The most obvious and consistent macroscopic abnormality was a profound reduction in size of the thymus of newborn P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>mice as compared to WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><p>Western blot analysis, RISH using a P2 specific probe and RT-PCR showed that during early thymogenesis (embryonal day (E) 14.5&#x02013;16.5) transcription of <italic>Runx1 </italic>in WT thymus was predominately mediated by P2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), and that at this stage almost no Runx1 was detected in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymus (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). The P1 activity in WT thymus was switched-on between E15.5&#x02013;E17.5 and persisted thereafter, whereas the activity of P2, which predominated during embryogenesis, gradually decreased after birth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Importantly, once switched-on the P1 activity was apparently unaffected in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>mice, as evidenced by northern blot analysis of <italic>Runx1 </italic>mRNAs in newborns (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Together, the complementary results of Runx1 expression studies and morphological analyses showed that expression of Runx1 in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>mice was compromised both temporally and spatially, resulting in adverse effect on thymus development.</p></sec><sec><title>Impaired thymus development in Runx1 P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>mice</title><p>Thymus development in mouse embryo begins at E9.5 ensued by immigration of lymphocyte precursors into the thymic rudiment at E14.5. Development proceeds through stage specific interactions between thymocytes and thymic epithelium that are essential for the formation of thymic architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Runx1 is highly expressed in developing thymocytes, but not in thymic epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Macroscopic examinations revealed that thymi of P2neo/neo neonates were about one-third of the normal size (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref>). This diminished size was caused by a profound reduction in the number of thymocytes during mutant thymus development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). Histological examinations revealed no gross morphological differences between P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>and WT at E14.5 and E15.5 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), except for scattered cysts in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymi (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These cysts are thought to result from accelerated epithelial turnover within centers of epithelial islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. At E16.5 however, extensive histological differences between WT and P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>emerged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). WT thymus had a clear demarcation of cortex and medulla. WT cortex was densely cellular with small hyperchromatic thymocytes, while the medulla was paler, contained a lower number of thymocytes admixed with macrophages, epithelial cells, and antigen presenting cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Mutant thymus, on the other hand, was much smaller, hypocellular, had a scalloped capsular surface and consisted predominantly of epithelial cells, with no evidence of an organized cortex and medulla. At E17.5 the histological defects were even more pronounced; the P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymus still lacked corticomedullary organization and contained occasional cysts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Histological and IHC analysis of thymus development in WT and P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>mice</bold>.

Runx1 is mostly expressed in DN CD4<sup>-</sup>/CD8<sup>- </sup>immature thymocytes, where it regulates CD4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. IHC of E15.5&#x02013;E16.5 WT thymus revealed that these Runx1 positive immature thymocytes were predominantly in the cortex and less in the medulla (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), as also shown by the RNA <italic>in-situ </italic>hybridization data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). In P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymus on the other hand, the fewer Runx1 positive cells were scattered randomly within the organ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). At E17.5 most of Runx1 expressing DN CD4<sup>-</sup>/CD8<sup>- </sup>thymocytes were found in the sub-cortical band (SCB), whereas the cortical, DP CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+ </sup>thymocytes did not express Runx1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). In E17.5 P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymus, many Runx1 positive cells were still in the cortex and only after birth, when the mutant thymus gradually gained WT morphology, were Runx1 expressing hyperchromatic cells seen in the SCB (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L</xref>). But even then, the overall size of mutant thymus remained much smaller compared to WT (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref>).

At E14.5 a much higher proportion of P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes (63% &#x000b1; 5) compared to WT (28% &#x000b1; 8) bound annexin V, indicating increased apoptosis among P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Additionally, increased proportion of necrotic cells positive to both annexin V and propidium iodid (PI), was observed in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymus (15% &#x000b1; 3 P2<sup>neo/neo</sup>; 10% &#x000b1; 2 WT, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The enhanced cell death of E14.5 P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes led to a three-fold reduction in the proportion of viable thymocytes in mutant thymus (WT 61.0% &#x000b1; 5; P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>21.9% &#x000b1; 3). At E16.5&#x02013;17.5 the P1 promoter is switched on (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), expression of Runx1 in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes increased (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>) and recovery of thymopoiesis commenced.

(B) P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes display enhanced apoptosis throughout embryonic thymopoiesis. Proportion of non-viable (apoptotic+necrotic) WT and P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>cells gradually decreased during embryonic development. Nevertheless, at any given time point, P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymui contained a higher proportion of non-viable cells compared to WT littermates. After birth the proportion of non-viable thymocytes in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>became similar to WT. At least five mice of each genotype were analyzed. The differences between WT and P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>apoptotic thymocytes were significant at P &#x0003c; 0.001 (*) and P &#x0003c; 0.01 (#) by Student's t test.

Following FACS analysis an equal number (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>) of E15.5 WT or P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>Annexin V negative thymocytes were incubated with TPA (20 ng/ml) and ConA (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 48 h. <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine was present during the last 18 h of incubation. Differences between WT and P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>were statistically insignificant by Student's t test. Proliferation capability of thymocytes was further examined by immunostaining of E15.5 thymic lobes for the proliferation-associated antigen recognized by Ki-67 antibodies (Right panels). (D) Enhanced embryonal apoptosis is a cell-autonomous property of P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes. WT or P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>E15.5 FL HPC were differentiated under saturating conditions in E14.5 WT FTOC for 14 or 16 days. We predetermined that ~100 FL cells (either WT or P2<sup>neo/neo</sup>) per lobe were sufficient to populate all available thymic lobes and therefore used 1000 FL cells per lobe. Thymocytes accumulation in FTOC populated with P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>FL HPC is reduced compared to WT (left panel WT-black; P2<sup>neo/neo</sup>-white). Proportion of apoptotic thymocytes (Annexin V<sup>+</sup>) derived from FTOC populated with P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>FL cells (red) was considerably higher compared to WT (light blue) (right panel).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-7-84-3"/></fig><p>We next asked whether the proliferative capacity of P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes was also affected. E15.5 thymocytes were isolated, analyzed by FACS and similar numbers of viable cells cultured <italic>in-vitro </italic>under proliferation stimulating conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Purified P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>and WT thymocytes displayed a similar thymidine incorporation rate, indicating that the ability of thymocytes to proliferate was hardly affected by the attenuated expression of Runx1 during early thymopoiesis. This conclusion was supported by immunostaining of thymocytes with the cell proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67. In E15.5 P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymus the number of Ki-67 positive cells was lower than in WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), reflecting the hypocellularity of mutant thymus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Nevertheless, significant numbers of P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes did express Ki-67, indicating normal progression through the cell cycle. Together, these results show that P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes possess proliferation and cell cycle progression capabilities similar to WT, but attenuating Runx1 expression during early developmental stages rendered thymocytes more susceptible to apoptosis, leading to thymic hypocellularity.</p><p>To address whether the increased apoptosis of P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes was due to loss of a cell-autonomous function of Runx1, we examined the capacity of P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes to populate fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC). E14.5 WT thymic lobes were reconstituted, at a saturating cell number, with either WT or P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>E15.5 fetal liver (FL) cells that contain hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). At FTOC day 14 and 16, cells were extracted out of the lobes and analyzed by FACS for Annexin V binding. P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>HPC gave rise to a significantly lower number of FTOC cells compared to WT and most P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>derived cells were Annexin V<sup>high </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).

While it was clear that transcriptional regulation of Runx1 expression is an important element of its biological function, little was known about the role of the two promoters during development, and about how and when they are differentially regulated. Is the alternative promoter usage of human and mouse <italic>RUNX1</italic>/<italic>Runx1 </italic>a reflection of vertebrates' higher complexity? Differential usage of alternative promoters enables diversified transcriptional regulation within a single locus and may thus serve as a molecular basis for the higher complexity of certain vertebrates' systems, such as the immune system. Indeed, while the <italic>RUNX </italic>genes are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom, more primitive animals such as the nematode <italic>C. elegance </italic>and the sea urchin contain only one gene regulated by a single promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This single promoter is the equivalent of vertebrates' P2.</p><sec><title>Differential P1/P2 usage during embryogenesis</title><p>The use of hypomorphic alleles for studying essential genes at the organismal level is a well-established approach. We employed mice homozygous for a hypomorphic <italic>Runx1 </italic>allele, which caused a profound attenuation of P2 activity, to investigate the biological role of P2 during embryogenesis. Specifically, we analyzed the impact of the resulting hypomorphic Runx1 expression on FL HPC development and early thymopoiesis. We found that during embryogenesis <italic>Runx1 </italic>is developmentally regulated through alternative usage of P1 and P2. In certain tissues, including kidney, tongue and liver both P1 and P2 are active, whereas in others such as intestinal epithelium and early thymocytes P2 activity predominates. Contrary to Runx1 null mice, in which embryonic lethality occurs at ~E12.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>mice develop to term, implying that during early development the activity of P1 prevails. This conclusion is supported by the finding that both P1- and P2-transcripts are found in FL of E12.5 embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The notion that both P1 and P2 are active during early hematopoiesis correlates well with the finding that P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>embryos displayed moderate and severe hematopoietic defects in the liver and thymus, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>P2 activity is essential for embryonal thymopoiesis and thymus development</title><p>Thymic development in the mouse begins at ~E9.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].

Using <italic>in-situ </italic>hybridization, RT-PCR and IHC we demonstrate that during early thymopoiesis activity of P2 predominates. The P1 is upregulated at E17.5 and its activity persists thereafter, while the activity of P2 declines after birth. At E11 the thymic rudiment is colonized by the first wave of committed T-cell precursors (TCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] which endure in the thymus until E17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that P2 activity is confined to descendants of the first wave TCP, whereas P1 is active in thymocytes originating in the second wave. Consistent with this hypothesis, the first wave P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes contained a markedly reduced level of Runx1 compared to WT, whereas in second wave thymocytes the level was similar to WT due to switch-on of P1 at E17.5. These second wave thymocytes grow exponentially after birth, when P1 is more active, and become the major cell population in the thymus.</p><p>During early stages of thymus development (i.e. E14.4 to E16.5) a marked reduction in thymic cellularity was observed in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>embryos. We show that this occurrence was due to enhanced apoptosis of P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes. But why were E14.4 to E16.5 P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes more susceptible to apoptosis than WT cells?</p><p>Selection processes in the thymus ensure that peripheral T cells are responsive to foreign antigens but tolerant to self-antigens. This occurs through positive and negative &#x003b2;-selections. Thymocytes, whose TCR engaged peptide/MHC molecules productively, escape their inherent programmed cell death and subsequently are induced to proliferate. On the other hand, thymocytes that react strongly with self-peptide-MHC molecules are actively eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. According to the avidity model, selection occurs only when signals received through the TCR fall between two thresholds: signals below the one are incompatible with survival (death by neglect), while signals above the other result in deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].

Specifically, we have shown that Runx1 can act as a transcriptional repressor in TCR regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, it is conceivable that the increased levels of TCRs in embryonic P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes resulted from the reduced Runx1 expression in these cells, and that the higher TCRs levels lead to a higher avidity of TCR-MHC interactions, which programmed the cells to apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported by <italic>Runx1</italic><sup>F/F</sup>/Lck-Cre mice, which show enhanced negative selection of Runx1<sup>-/- </sup>thymocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and by the finding that upon recovery of Runx1 expression in P2<sup>neo/neo </sup>thymocytes, TCR expression and apoptosis resumed WT levels. Potentially related, mice homozygous for a knock-in <italic>Runx1 </italic>cDNA that are lacking the C-terminal VWRPY, exhibit thymic hypocellularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].
