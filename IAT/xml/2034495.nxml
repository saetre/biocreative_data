In contrast to mitosis, sister chromatids have to be oriented toward the same spindle pole in meiosis-I, while homologous chromosomes are bi-oriented. We find that the fission yeast Aurora kinase Ark1 is required for the faithful bi-orientation of sister chromatids in mitosis and of homologous chromosomes in meiosis-I. Unexpectedly, Ark1 is also necessary for the faithful mono-orientation of sister chromatids in meiosis-I, even though the canonical mono-orientation pathway, which depends on Moa1 and Rec8, seems intact. Our data suggest that Ark1 prevents unified sister kinetochores during metaphase-I from merotelic attachment to both spindle poles and thus from being torn apart during anaphase-I, revealing a novel mechanism promoting monopolar attachment. Furthermore, our results provide an explanation for the previously enigmatic observation that fission yeast Shugoshin Sgo2, which assists in loading Aurora to centromeres, and its regulator Bub1 are required for the mono-orientation of sister chromatids in meiosis-I.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aurora</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>For eukaryotic chromosome segregation to occur correctly, the two copies of the chromosome (sister chromatids) need to be physically connected. This is accomplished by the &#x02018;cohesin' complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Haering and Nasmyth, 2003</xref>), which links sister chromatids from their generation in S-phase until the onset of anaphase. By metaphase, the two sister chromatids become attached to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles (bi-orientation). A central component ensuring the bi-orientation of sister kinetochores is the &#x02018;chromosomal passenger complex' (CPC) that is composed of Aurora-B, INCENP, Borealin/Dasra and Survivin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Vagnarelli and Earnshaw, 2004</xref>). In anaphase, cohesion between the sister chromatids is released, which is accomplished by cleavage of the Scc1/Rad21 subunit of cohesin by the protease separase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Uhlmann, 2003</xref>), a process that is under control of the mitotic spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Similar principles govern meiotic chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Lee and Orr-Weaver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Watanabe, 2004</xref>), but in contrast to mitosis, two rounds of chromosome segregation follow only one round of DNA replication in order to generate haploid gametes. Several modifications allow this two-step process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Petronczki <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>): homologous chromosomes become connected via chiasmata, which result from crossover recombination during meiotic prophase, and sister kinetochores on each chromosome adopt a side-by-side rather than back-to-back conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Goldstein, 1981</xref>). These two mechanisms allow the recognition of homologous chromosomes as entities destined for opposite poles during anaphase-I. In addition, only cohesion between chromosome arms is lost during anaphase-I, which allows the separation of homologs; cohesion at the centromere is preserved depending on Shugoshin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Watanabe, 2005</xref>), and sister chromatids therefore stay connected so that they can be properly segregated during meiosis-II. For meiosis-II, kinetochores are again in a back-to-back position, and chromosome segregation is very similar to mitosis.</p><p>In all model eukaryotes that have been studied, Aurora-B kinases are required for the proper bi-orientation of sister chromatids in mitosis. In the absence of Aurora-B, syntelic (both sister kinetochores attached to the same spindle pole) or merotelic (one kinetochore attached to two opposing spindle poles) attachment of chromosomes occurs with increased frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hauf <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cimini <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Knowlton <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). These malattachments escape the surveillance by the mitotic spindle checkpoint, indicating that Aurora-B kinases are also required for proper checkpoint function. Budding and fission yeast have a single Aurora kinase, Ipl1 and Ark1, respectively. These single Aurora kinases are thought to be homologous to Aurora-B and presumably interact with INCENP (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<italic>S.p.</italic>) Pic1) and Survivin (<italic>S.p.</italic> Bir1) homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Leverson <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Vanoosthuyse <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Whereas Ipl1 has been shown to be required for the proper bi-orientation of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Francisco and Chan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Biggins <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), a role for Ark1 in regulating chromosome attachment has not been demonstrated. Fission yeast cells that lack Ark1 fail to divide the chromatin during anaphase, but nevertheless proceed to septation, resulting in a cut (&#x02018;cell untimely torn') phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Petersen and Hagan, 2003</xref>). Mutants in the condensin complex, which is required for compaction of chromatin during mitosis, display a similar phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Saka <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>), and Ark1 and Bir1 are indeed required for the correct intranuclear localization of condensin subunits during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Morishita <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Petersen and Hagan, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In meiosis, Aurora-B kinases have been shown to regulate cohesion in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. In the worm, the Aurora-B kinase AIR-2 promotes segregation of homologous chromosomes, presumably by phosphorylation-dependent removal of meiotic cohesin, which contains the meiosis-specific subunit Rec8 that replaces Rad21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kaitna <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Rogers <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Aurora-B seems to be required to preserve centromeric cohesion beyond meiosis-I, depending on MEI-S332, a member of the Shugoshin family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Resnick <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The only indication for a role of Aurora in controlling chromosome attachment in meiosis comes from budding yeast, where very recent work has shown that Ipl1 is required for the bi-orientation of homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Monje-Casas <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Yu and Koshland, 2007</xref>). Here, we examined the role of the fission yeast Aurora kinase Ark1 in chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. We find that Ark1 is required to promote the bi-orientation of chromosomes in mitosis and to prevent or correct syntelic and merotelic attachment. Furthermore, Ark1 is necessary for the bi-orientation of homologs in meiosis-I. However, notably different from budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Monje-Casas <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), we describe that fission yeast Aurora is required for the monopolar attachment of sister chromatids in meiosis-I, and acts in a different pathway from the Moa1/Rec8 mono-orientation pathway that has been defined.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ark1 ensures faithful centromere segregation in mitosis</title><p>To address whether Ark1 has a role in the bi-orientation of chromosomes, we examined chromosome segregation in haploid fission yeast, in which chromosome 2 was marked with GFP close to the centromere (<italic>cen2</italic>-GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Yamamoto and Hiraoka, 2003</xref>) using a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>ark1</italic> (<italic>ark1-T7</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kawashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) or analog-sensitive versions of Ark1 (<italic>ark1-as2</italic>, <italic>ark1-as3</italic>, see Materials and methods), which can be inactivated by specific inhibitors (4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(1&#x02032;-napthyl)pyrazolo&#x0005b;3,4-d&#x0005d;pyrimidine (1NA-PP1) or 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(1&#x02032;-napthylmethyl)pyrazolo&#x0005b;3,4-d&#x0005d;pyrimidine (1NM-PP1)). When Ark1 was inactivated, centromere segregation was perturbed in half or more than half of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). In about 40&#x00025; of cells, one of the sister chromatids did not move entirely toward one pole in anaphase (&#x02018;lagging'), and in 11&#x02013;25&#x00025; (depending on the allele), both sister centromeres moved to the same pole. This is indicative of merotelic and syntelic chromosome attachment, respectively. To obtain further insight into chromosome movement in <italic>ark1</italic>-mutant cells, we observed chromosome segregation in living <italic>ark1-T7</italic> cells at the restrictive temperature using <italic>cen2</italic>-GFP and the spindle pole body (SPB) marker Sid4-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We found that even before anaphase, alignment of chromosomes on the mitotic spindle was defective, since the <italic>cen2</italic>-GFP mark was found close to one of the spindle poles in about 60&#x00025; of the <italic>ark1-T7</italic> cells at restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>, and data not shown). In anaphase, sister chromatids of chromosome 2 missegregated in 28&#x00025; of the cells. In a few cases (3&#x00025; of all cells) the sister chromatids stayed entirely at one pole during anaphase. In the other cases, sister chromatids were lagging behind on the spindle during anaphase, with about two-thirds eventually moving to the correct and the remainder moving toward the incorrect pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>Cells with mutations in condensin fail to segregate the bulk of chromatin very similar to <italic>ark1</italic>-mutant cells, and we therefore wanted to exclude that the chromosome segregation defect observed after Ark1 inhibition is merely a consequence of the condensation defect. When we observed <italic>cen2</italic>-GFP segregation in temperature-sensitive condensin-mutant cells (<italic>cut3-477</italic>), we also found some failure in centromere segregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), which might be attributed to the disturbed structure of the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hirano, 2005</xref>). However, this defect in centromere segregation was less pronounced than in <italic>ark1</italic>-mutant cells, although the chromatin condensation defect in these two strains was similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Furthermore, in the presence of low concentrations of the microtubule-destabilizing substance TBZ, <italic>ark1-T7</italic> cells exhibited considerable missegregation (about 35&#x00025;) even at the permissive temperature when chromosome condensation was largely normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, in wild-type or <italic>cut3</italic>-mutant cells, TBZ only caused a very minor increase in missegregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). This suggests that Ark1 is needed to establish proper microtubule&#x02013;kinetochore attachment independent of its role in chromosome condensation. Ark1 also functions in the mitotic spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Petersen and Hagan, 2003</xref>; data not shown). However, even the additional deletion of the checkpoint gene <italic>mad2</italic>&#x0002b; in <italic>cut3-477</italic> cells leads to a weaker defect in chromosome segregation than the one observed in <italic>ark1-T7</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that Ark1 plays a specific role in promoting proper chromosome segregation beyond its role in the mitotic checkpoint and in chromosome condensation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ark1 is required for the correction of malattachment</title><p>In both budding yeast and metazoans, Aurora kinases act in the bi-orientation of chromosomes by correcting improper, syntelic attachment of chromosomes to the same spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hauf <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Lampson <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). When we inactivated Ark1 in an otherwise unperturbed mitosis, segregation of both sisters to one spindle pole was rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). This could be because in an unperturbed mitosis, initial syntelic attachment is rare or because syntelic attachment can still be corrected in <italic>ark1</italic>-mutant cells. We therefore increased the frequency of misattachment by first arresting cells in mitosis without microtubules, using a cold-sensitive tubulin mutant <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> and then releasing to permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Trautmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Grishchuk and McIntosh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kawashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Because <italic>ark1</italic>-mutant cells do not arrest in mitosis under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Petersen and Hagan, 2003</xref>; data not shown), we could only perform the experiment with the <italic>ark1-as3</italic> allele, which is functional when cells are grown without inhibitor and thus allows arrest by <italic>nda3-KM311</italic>. Shortly before release, we inhibited Ark1-as3 by the specific inhibitor 1NM-PP1, which inactivates the kinase within 10 min (data not shown and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). When checking anaphase spindles 10 min after the release, both <italic>cen2</italic>-GFP marks were found close to one edge of the spindle in about 20&#x00025; of cells. No such missegregation was observed in wild-type cells treated with inhibitor or in <italic>ark1-as3</italic> cells grown without inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that its occurrence depends on the inactivation of Ark1. To determine whether this indeed represents initial misattachment that fails to correct, we filmed Ark1-inactivated cells being released from the <italic>nda3</italic> arrest. Among those cells that we could image from the start of mitosis, about half had both sister centromeres located entirely at one pole throughout prometaphase and anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). These data indicate that Ark1 is required to correct syntelic misattachment of chromosomes (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>).</p><p>To confirm in a different setting that malattachment of chromosomes cannot be corrected in <italic>ark1</italic>-mutant cells, we used a temperature-sensitive mutant of fission yeast cohesin, <italic>psc3-1T</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Nonaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Sister chromatids precociously detach from each other in the absence of cohesin, but remain competent to attach to microtubules. However, in the absence of cohesion between sister chromatids, kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachment cannot be stabilized because of a lack of tension. Therefore, attachment remains unstable, which in budding yeast depends on Ipl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Biggins and Murray, 2001</xref>). In live-cell microscopy experiments, the instability of sister chromatid attachment in <italic>psc3-1T</italic> cells was exemplified by an occasional switching of at least one sister chromatid from one spindle pole to the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>, arrows). When Ark1 was additionally inactivated, such switching was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that Ark1 is required to keep sister chromatid attachment unstable in <italic>psc3-1T</italic> cells. This result is consistent with Ark1 being needed to correct kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachments that fail to generate tension through bi-orientation. However, the fact that sister chromatids were not very motile when Ark1 is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>) could also indicate a more profound defect in kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule dynamics. Inactivation of condensin did not seem to have the same effect as Ark1 inactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>), which again suggests that Ark1 regulates chromosome attachment independent of condensin.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ark1 has a role in nuclear division during meiosis-I</title><p>To study the requirement of Ark1 in meiosis, we used an &#x02018;<italic>ark1</italic> shut-off' (<italic>ark1 s.o.</italic>) strain, where the <italic>ark1</italic>&#x0002b; gene is under control of the mitosis-specific promoter of the <italic>rad21</italic>&#x0002b; gene. In this strain, the level of Ark1 protein in meiosis was largely reduced, but minor amounts of Ark1 were still observed at centromeres and midspindles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). For some experiments, we therefore either additionally or alternatively used the <italic>ark1-as2</italic> allele together with the specific inhibitor.</p><p>The most prominent phenotype observed after Ark1 depletion in mitosis is a failure to condense chromosomes, which leads to a defect in nuclear division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Petersen <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). We similarly found a defect in chromosome condensation during meiosis in <italic>ark1 s.o.</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Nevertheless, four distinct, albeit often unequally sized, nuclei formed after meiosis-II in <italic>ark1 s.o.</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). However, in about 50&#x00025; of <italic>ark1 s.o.</italic> cells, the two meiosis-II spindles formed extremely close to each other and often in what seemed to be one nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating a failure of nuclear division during meiosis-I. To assess this phenotype better, we arrested cells after meiosis-I using the <italic>mes1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Izawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Under these conditions, more than 80&#x00025; of <italic>ark1</italic>&#x0002b; cells but only 30&#x00025; of <italic>ark1 s.o.</italic> cells formed two nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Nevertheless, the mononucleated <italic>ark1 s.o.</italic> cells seemed to have undergone anaphase-I, because Rec8-GFP was largely removed from chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). The failure in nuclear segregation after Ark1 depletion presumably reflects a failure in condensin function, since mutants in the condensin subunit <italic>cut3</italic> also show a slightly increased number of cells with one nucleus when arrested by the <italic>mes1</italic> mutation at a semi-permissive temperature (data not shown).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ark1 promotes homolog bi-orientation in meiosis-I</title><p>To address whether Ark1 has any role in meiotic chromosome segregation, we examined the segregation of <italic>cen2</italic>-GFP in <italic>ark1 s.o.</italic> and <italic>ark1-as2</italic> cells during anaphase-I. When Ark1 was inhibited or depleted, both homologous chromosomes 2 segregated to the same pole in about 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; of anaphase-I cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). In another 30&#x00025; of cells, at least one of the homologs was lagging on the anaphase-I spindle. These segregation problems could be caused either by a failure to bi-orient bivalents or by a failure to join homologous chromosomes through chiasmata. Since the intergenic recombination frequency between the <italic>lys3</italic>&#x0002b; and <italic>ura1</italic>&#x0002b; locus on chromosome 1 was similar in <italic>ark1</italic>&#x0002b; and <italic>ark1 s.o.</italic> strains (data not shown), the latter is unlikely. Therefore, these data suggest that Ark1 is required for the bi-orientation of connected homologs during meiosis-I (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The role of Ark1 in bi-orientation is independent of kinetochore geometry</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Paliulis and Nicklas (2000)</xref> have shown that specific features of the chromosome and not of the spindle determine the special chromosome segregation of meiosis-I. In fission yeast, genetic tricks can be used to create mitosis-like chromosomes during meiosis-I. Deletion of the gene for the meiosis-specific cohesin subunit Rec8 causes a failure in recombination and therefore chiasmata generation. Additionally, sister kinetochores in each homolog are faithfully bi-oriented presumably because geometry at the centromeric region is mitosis-like and sister chromatids remain cohered by mitotic cohesin complexes, which persist into meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Yokobayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Similarly, mitosis-like chromosomes can be generated by deleting <italic>rec12</italic>&#x0002b;, which is required for recombination, and <italic>moa1</italic>&#x0002b;, the gene product of which is required for the mono-orientation of sister kinetochores in concert with Rec8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Yokobayashi and Watanabe, 2005</xref>). In both these genetic backgrounds, Ark1 shut-off caused missegregation of sister centromeres in meiosis-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>), with the effect being greater in a <italic>rec12</italic>&#x00394; <italic>moa1</italic>&#x00394; strain than in a <italic>rec8</italic>&#x00394; strain (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). Thus, during meiosis-I, Ark1 can promote the equational segregation of sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>), or the bipolar segregation of homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>), depending on the chromosome structure. We suggest that Ark1 promotes the bi-orientation of any two kinetochore-containing entities that are connected. This is in accordance with findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dewar <italic>et al</italic> (2004)</xref>, who showed that budding yeast Ipl1 ensures the bi-orientation of two separate kinetochores on an unreplicated plasmid.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ark1 is required for the mono-orientation of sister chromatids in meiosis-I</title><p>When we tested the segregation of homologs during anaphase-I, we found that frequently at least one of the homologs was lagging and often the <italic>cen2</italic>-GFP signal of lagging homologs split in two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the sister kinetochores on one homolog, which normally attach to only one spindle pole, were pulled in opposite direction. To verify this assumption, we labeled only one of the homologous chromosomes 2 with GFP and determined the segregation pattern. Indeed, in about 12&#x00025; of anaphase-I cells, the GFP signal split in two when Ark1 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that sister chromatids were pulled to opposite poles and separated precociously. These data suggested that in the absence of Ark1, sister kinetochores erroneously become attached to opposite spindle poles during meiosis-I. In accordance, we found that a visible separation of sister centromeres could already be observed during metaphase-I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). We therefore considered the possibility that Ark1 is required for the localization and function of Moa1, which prevents bi-orientation of sister chromatids at meiosis-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Yokobayashi and Watanabe, 2005</xref>). However, visualization of Moa1-GFP did not reveal any difference between wild-type and <italic>ark1 s.o.</italic> cells during meiosis-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, no significant difference in Moa1 localization was observed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, the localization of Rec8 at the centromeric central core, which is important for mono-orientation of kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Yokobayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), was intact in the <italic>ark1 s.o.</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Thus, the mono-orientation defect caused by the reduction of Ark1 is likely different from the one caused by the absence of Moa1 or Rec8, suggesting that Ark1 and Moa1/Rec8 influence sister kinetochore mono-orientation in meiosis-I through distinct mechanisms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sister centromeres separate precociously after Ark1 depletion because of merotelic attachment rather than complete bi-orientation</title><p>Cells in which <italic>moa1</italic>&#x0002b; is deleted show entirely equational segregation of sister chromatids in meiosis-I if recombination is abolished by <italic>rec12</italic>&#x00394; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>).

In <italic>rec12</italic>&#x00394; <italic>moa1</italic>&#x00394; cells, all sister centromeres eventually segregated at anaphase-I even in the presence of Sgo1, implying that microtubule-mediated pulling on bi-oriented sister kinetochores can overcome Sgo1-mediated protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Vaur <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Yokobayashi and Watanabe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). The tension on homologs that are attached in a merotelic manner is expected to be less, because some microtubules on both sister kinetochores likely attach to the same pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>, &#x02018;<italic>sgo1</italic>&#x0002b;').

Noticeably, however, in fission yeast, a well-studied model in mitosis research, it was unknown whether the single Aurora kinase, Ark1, has any role in regulating the proper attachment of chromosomes during mitosis. Here, we demonstrate that Ark1 inhibition causes misattachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). As in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), Aurora seems necessary to destabilize syntelic attachment that fails to create tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, lagging chromatids occurred with high frequency when Ark1 was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Those might arise because attachment to microtubules is weak or dysfunctional, or because the corresponding kinetochore is attached to both spindle poles (merotelic attachment). We favor the latter hypothesis, since most sister chromatids in <italic>ark1-T7</italic> cells move to the spindle poles in anaphase-A with velocities comparable to those observed in wild-type cells (data not shown), indicating that there is no general problem with attachment or microtubule-dependent anaphase movement. In vertebrate cells, where kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachment can be visualized directly, it has been shown that Aurora-B is required to suppress merotelic attachment, possibly by destabilizing the faulty attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cimini <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Knowlton <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). We consider it an additional possibility that Aurora is required to build the kinetochore in a way that favors attachment of all microtubules on one kinetochore to the same pole. It has been proposed that fission yeast Pcs1, which is a homolog of one of the components of the budding yeast monopolin complex, is required to clamp together single microtubule-binding sites on one kinetochore, thus favoring their attachment to one pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Rabitsch <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).

In fission yeast, mono-orientation of sister kinetochores is regulated by Moa1 and Rec8, which may cooperatively promote the formation of a side-by-side structure of sister kinetochores through cohesion of the centromeric central core region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Yokobayashi and Watanabe, 2005</xref>). The depletion of Moa1 together with Rec12 or of Rec8 entirely disrupts the mono-orientation of sister chromatids at meiosis-I.

This indicates that Ark1 and Moa1 act in separate pathways to promote mono-orientation. Our experiments suggest that in the absence of Ark1, sister kinetochores on one homolog become attached in a merotelic manner so that they are torn apart at anaphase-I, even though they have the proper side-by-side configuration that favors mono-orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, the complicated chromosome segregation defects in meiotic cells depleted of Ark1 can be explained by the well-recognized role of Aurora in correcting malattachment of chromosomes.

After a further 7&#x02013;8 h of incubation at 30&#x000b0;C, cells were observed directly or fixed by methanol at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. To observe <italic>ark1-as2</italic> cells in meiosis, the cells were first incubated in MM with 5 g/l NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 8&#x02013;9 h, and then washed and incubated in MM without NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 4&#x02013;5 h before spotting on a plate with synthetic sporulation agar (SSA; SSL with agar; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Egel, 1971</xref>) containing 5 &#x003bc;M 1NA-PP1.

(<bold>A</bold>) To assess the percentage of equational segregation (light gray bars), one of the homologous chromosomes 2 was marked by GFP in the indicated strains and the segregation pattern was judged in asci that had formed four spores. The percentage of lagging chromosomes or chromatids (dark gray bars) was determined by staining fixed cells with DAPI and the TAT-1 antibody recognizing tubulin. (<bold>B</bold>) Model for the chromosome segregation defects after Sgo2/Ark1 versus Moa1/Rec8 depletion. The centromeric region of one homolog is shown. In <italic>sgo2</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>ark1 s.o.</italic> cells, the pair of sister kinetochores on one homolog tends to attach in a merotelic manner, that is, to both spindle poles, during metaphase-I. In anaphase, lagging homologs are common because of merotelic attachment. Eventually, both sister centromeres segregate to the same pole in most cases. If the protector Sgo1 is removed, sister centromeres segregate to opposite poles more frequently. Lagging chromatids are still observed after deletion of <italic>sgo1</italic>&#x0002b;, indicating merotelic attachment of single sister kinetochores. When <italic>moa1</italic>&#x0002b; or <italic>rec8</italic>&#x0002b; is deleted, sister kinetochores on one homolog lose their intimate connection. When <italic>rec12</italic>&#x0002b; is deleted in addition to <italic>moa1</italic>&#x0002b;, sister chromatids segregate completely equationally in anaphase-I. Nevertheless, lagging chromosomes occur, but deleting <italic>sgo1</italic>&#x0002b; abolishes their appearance.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="7601880f6"/></fig></floats-wrap></article>
