However, neutrophils are non-dividing cells with poor survival after isolation. Consequently, exogenous gene expression in neutrophils is challenging. Researchers have partially overcome these difficulties by performing studies in well-developed cell-free systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], with permeabilized neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and with cell lines that undergo some neutrophil functions, such as HL-60 cells or B-lymphoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Others have used virus-based expression systems, but these systems require laborious cloning into specific vectors and the procedures for viral infection are time consuming and potentially hazardous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Here we report the transfection and expression of genes into neutrophils by nucleofection. Using this technology, which delivers the vector directly into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], exogenous genes can be expressed in neutrophils in as short as 2 h after transfection, overcoming the difficulties associated with the short lifetime of these cells.</p><p>In innate immunity, neutrophils are crucial for the destruction of bacteria and fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To combat bacterial infection, neutrophils must perform functions that include migration to the inflammatory site, phagocytosis of invading microorganisms, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contribute to killing. The NADPH oxidase of neutrophils is a multisubunit enzymatic complex responsible for the monoelectronic reduction of oxygen to produce superoxide anion (O<sub>2<sup>-</sup></sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Free radical production is directly related to the bactericidal capacity of these cells since patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), whose NADPH oxidase is inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suffer recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. The NADPH oxidase comprises the cytosolic factors p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, p67<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>and p40<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, the membrane-associated cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558 </sub>and the accessory proteins Rac2 and Rap1a. The cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558</sub>, consisting of the glycoprotein gp91<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>and the protein p22<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, localizes in the plasma membrane as well as in the membrane of secretory vesicles, specific and tertiary granules. In resting neutrophils, the oxidase remains unassembled and, therefore, inactive. In response to adequate stimuli, the cytosolic factor p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>is phosphorylated at serine residues located at its carboxy terminus, then the phox homology (PX) domain located in its amino terminus is unmasked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, together with p67<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, translocates to the membrane-associated cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558</sub>. This switches the NADPH oxidase to its active form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The activation of the NADPH oxidase by a soluble stimulus like the formylated peptide N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) involves both early trafficking of the cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558 </sub>to the plasma membrane through degranulation and the subsequent translocation of the cytosolic factors to assemble the oxidase. The exposure of neutrophils to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulates a larger degree of degranulation than that observed in response to fMLP and induces the assembly of the NADPH oxidase not only at the plasma membrane but also at the membrane of the intracellular vesicles/granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. If neutrophils are exposed to particulate stimulus like opsonized microorganisms, phagocytosis takes place, and specific and azurophilic granules fuse with the phagosome to integrate the cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558 </sub>with the phagosomal membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and to release their contents into the phagolysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In all cases, the activation of the NADPH oxidase requires the interaction of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>and p22<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, which is mediated by the SH3 domains located in the carboxy terminus of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Recent studies suggested that the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, a phosphoinositide-binding module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], plays an important role in the translocation of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>towards biological membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We show that the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>does not translocate to the membranes of mature phagosomes during phagocytosis of opsonized-zymosan particles.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Transfection efficiency and cellular viability</title><p>To optimize the transfection of human neutrophils, we used the &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression vector pCMV-&#x003b2;gal, previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. After transfection, cells were incubated for 2, 4, 6 or 8 hours at 37&#x000b0;C and at the appropriate times were centrifuged, washed twice with PBS and lysed by sonication in 2% Nonidet P-40. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase activity was then measured using the &#x003b2;-gal Reporter Gene assay kit (Roche). Maximum galactosidase activity was observed at 2 h after gene transfer when using the proprietary transfection solution ''T'' (amaxa biosystems, Germany) and an electrical setting corresponding to program T27 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The transfection efficiency under these experimental conditions was 0.4 to 1%. The viability of neutrophils after the electrical pulse and after the 2-hour recovery period was 78.8 &#x000b1; 2.5% and 78.5 &#x000b1; 2.3%, respectively, evaluated using Trypan Blue exclusion. Next, we compared the efficiency of transfection of human neutrophils under various electrical settings corresponding to a series of second generation programs for amaxa nucleofectors. In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, we show that the electrical settings corresponding to programs U14 and Y01 resulted in higher transfection efficiency for similar experimental conditions based on flow cytometric analysis of neutrophils transfected with the vector pmaxGFP. Also in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, we show that the second generation programs (U14 and Y01) better preserve cell viability when evaluated by propidium iodide. For consistency and since the initial experiments were performed using program T27, this electrical setting was employed in subsequent experiments unless stated otherwise. Importantly, no differences in the subcellular distribution of the fluorescent chimeras were observed when using program Y01 instead of T27. Next, we used confocal microscopy to examine the transfection and expression of enhanced green fluorescent proteins encoded by the pEGFP (EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein) expression vector (Clontech<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) in neutrophils. To demonstrate further that the population of transfected neutrophils was fully functional, we transfected neutrophils with the NADPH oxidase cytosolic factor p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>as an EGFP chimera, and we stimulated cells with phorbol ester or with the formylated peptide fMLP which mimics bacteria-derived peptides and stimulates neutrophils through binding to the membrane receptor formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, we show that transfected neutrophils stimulated with PMA or fMLP can undergo morphological changes represented by the appearance of protrusions of the plasma membrane, presumably membrane ruffles. These membrane structures were enriched in EGFP-p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which is in agreement with previous reports describing the localization of NADPH oxidase factors at membrane ruffles after activation in non-primary cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The distribution pattern for EGFP was different from that of EGFP-p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>. EGFP was detected in the nucleus and cytosol, and was also detected in membrane protrusions in stimulated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Optimization of transfection and gene expression in human neutrophils</bold>.

In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, we show that electroporated cells have relatively low basal luminol-dependent chemiluminescence activity in the absence of stimuli. Importantly, they maintain their capacity to respond to stimuli. Nucleoporated neutrophils show ROS production kinetics similar to that of non-electroporated cells in response to PMA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Furthermore, electroporated neutrophils expressing an exogenous protein respond to stimulus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The response was detected using the nitroblue tetrazolium reaction. Formazan, the blue-black precipitate generated by superoxide anion-dependent NBT reduction, was evident in stimulated cells but undetectable in unstimulated, transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These results suggest that electroporated neutrophils conserve an intact NADPH oxidase. To further support this idea, we transfected neutrophils with a vector expressing wild type p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>downstream of EGFP and then stimulated the cells with PMA. The translocation of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>to the plasma membrane was followed in real time by confocal microscopy analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The results indicate that EGFP-p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, but not the EGFP control, undergoes translocation during activation further supporting the idea that electroporated neutrophils are functional and responsive.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Nucleoporated neutrophils conserve a responsive NADPH oxidase</bold>.

In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, we show that nucleoporated neutrophils have, in fact, a marked increase in CD11b molecules on their cellular surface. The level of CD11b at the plasma membrane after nucleoporation was even larger than that triggered by fMLP stimulation. The increase in the surface expression of CD11b was evident using either program T27 or the second generation program Y01 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In some experiments, two populations of cells were identified according to their level of surface expression of CD11b after nucleoporation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Cells expressing GFP were mainly distributed with the subpopulation of cells showing higher surface expression of CD11b (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). These results suggest that nucleofection induces the mobilization of secretory vesicles and, probably, tertiary granules, which are the subpopulation of neutrophil secretory organelles with the highest tendency to undergo exocytosis.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Surface expression of CD11b in nucleoporated neutrophils</bold>.

PX domains are also present in proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and cellular signaling including Vam7p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and PI3K-C2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], respectively. PX domains are phosphoinositide binding modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The affinity of the various PX domains for several phosphoinositides differs from protein to protein. In particular, the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>has been shown to bind preferentially to PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The mechanism mediated by the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>in the activation of the oxidase is controversial. One group has suggested that the phosphoinositide-binding activity of the p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>PX domain is essential for the membrane translocation of this protein and activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Other groups have indicated that the translocation of the p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>PX domain to the plasma membrane is not due to interactions with phospholipids but to association with the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and have shown in a variety of cell lines that the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>targets to cell membranes via interaction with moesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, while some researchers propose that a single residue substitution in the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>decreases its affinity to phosphoinositides and its binding to cell membranes in resting or PMA-stimulated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], others show that the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>translocates to the plasma membrane after activation in a phosphoinositide-independent manner in COS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The subcellular localization of the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>in human neutrophils has not yet been shown. To analyze this, we transfected human neutrophils with a vector for the expression of a chimera composed of EGFP upstream of the p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>PX-domain (EGFP-p47-PX, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The visualization of the subcellular distribution of the PX domain is somewhat difficult due to the relatively small size of these cells. However, the fluorescence intensity plots helped to identify an increase in the distribution of fluorescence towards the edge of the cells. We concluded that the p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>PX domain partially localizes at the plasma membrane in nucleoporated neutrophils. Localization of EGFP-p47-PX in intracellular structures was also evident, a phenomenon previously described in COS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Differently from the fusion protein EGFP-p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>(full-length) which required phorbol ester-mediated neutrophil activation for plasma membrane localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), the subcellular distribution of EGFP-p47-PX was not markedly affected by cellular stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Although the concentrations of PI(3,4)P<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3 </sub>in resting neutrophils are considered to be relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], it could be possible that PI3-kinases undergo some level of activation during nucleoporation thus increasing the membrane distribution of the PX domain in unstimulated cells. However, pretreatment of neutrophils with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 did not alter the pattern of protein distribution in EGFP-p47-PX transfected neutrophils or prevent the increase in the surface expression of CD11b after nucleoporation (not shown). Another possibility is that once exposed (the PX domain is masked in unphosphorylated full-length p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>), the PX domain could recognize pre-existent structures at the plasma membrane, possibly moesin, PI(4)P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], phosphatidic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] or even basal levels of PI 3-kinase products. From our experiments, it seems that the plasma membrane of nucleoporated neutrophils has the necessary molecular machinery to sequester, at least in part, the p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>PX-domain. The molecular basis of this mechanism remains to be clarified.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>The PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>localizes at the plasma membrane in resting and stimulated neutrophils</bold>.

The images were processed and analyzed for the distribution of the fluorescent proteins using the NIH image processing and analysis program IMAGE/J software. Scale bars = 3&#x003bc;m. For EGFP-p47-PX, separate cells are shown. For EGFP, the same cells are shown before and after stimulation. The results are representative of three independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2172-7-28-6"/></fig><p>During particle engulfment, the NADPH oxidase complex is assembled at the membrane of the phagosome so that superoxide anion is pumped into the core of the phagosome where the engulfed microorganism is killed. In particular, p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>has been shown to localize towards nascent and mature phagosomes in neutrophils after phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This poses the question of whether the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, which has been proposed to mediate the translocation of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>towards the cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558</sub>-containing plasma membrane and to participate in the activation of the NADPH oxidase in cells stimulated with soluble stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], could also be implicated in the assembly of the oxidase at the phagosome membrane. In an attempt to clarify this, we analyzed the distribution of the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>during phagocytosis. We transfected neutrophils with the expression vector pEGFP-p47-PX or with cDNA encoding a chimera of EGFP and RhoB, a small GTPase thought to function in the regulation of endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Then, we exposed the transfected cells to Texas Red-conjugated opsonized zymosan A particles, and protein distribution during phagocytosis was evaluated by confocal microscopy. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, we show that neutrophils expressing EGFP-RhoB or EGFP-p47-PX can undergo phagocytosis. From those experiments, it becomes clear that nucleoporated neutrophils conserve their ability to phagocytose opsonized particles. The accumulation of green fluorescence around the phagosome is evident in EGFP-RhoB-expressing neutrophils but was not observed in cells expressing EGFP-p47-PX (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Similar results were observed in HL-60 promyelocytic cells when differentiated to granulocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). These data suggest that the mechanisms of translocation of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>to the plasma membrane and to the phagosome membrane are different. It is likely that the translocation of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>to the phagosome does not involve the PX domain. One possibility is that the SH3 domains of p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, which have been largely shown to bind to the membrane-localized cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558 </sub>through interaction with the cytosolic domain of p22<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, are sufficient to translocate p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>to the phagosome. However, p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>was clearly detected in forming phagosomes in X-linked CGD neutrophils which lack cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558</sub>, indicating that the recruitment of this protein to the nascent phagosome is independent of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the same work, p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>was undetectable in phagosome membranes of mature phagosomes in neutrophils from X-linked CGD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting that p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>can not be retained at the phagosome in the absence of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558</sub>. Likewise, the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>localizes at the plasma membrane in the proximity of the opsonized particle in the nascent phagosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), but is not retained in the membrane of mature phagosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) despite the fact that moesin, the actin-binding protein shown to bind to the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, is present in phagosome membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, the reason why the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>is not retained in the mature phagosome may reside in the differential role that the products of class I and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase play during phagosome formation and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The product of class I PI 3-kinase, PI(3,4,5)P3, has been shown to be rapidly synthesized during phagosomal formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], but the accumulation was sharply restricted to the phagosomal cup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Conversely, PI(3)P, a product of class III PI 3-kinase, was only detected in sealed phagosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These data correlate with our observation that the PI(3,4,5)P3-binding domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>(PX domain) is present in membranes in the forming phagosome but is absent from the membrane of the mature phagosome. Although not explored here, it is also possible that the PI(3)P-binding domain of p40<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>(p40<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>-PX domain) is implicated in maintaining the cytosolic complex of the NADPH oxidase at the mature phagosome.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Distribution of exogenously expressed p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>-PX domain and RhoB during phagocytosis in human neutrophils</bold>.

Since phagocytosis of opsonized particles by neutrophils as well as their response to stimuli requires intact downstream signaling machinery, the results presented here suggest that transfected neutrophils are viable and fully functional. Using this methodology, we showed that the PX domain of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>is translocated to the plasma membrane but is not retained at the membrane of mature phagosomes suggesting that distinct mechanisms may operate during the activation of the NADPH oxidase at different subcellular sites in human neutrophils.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Transfection of human neutrophils and confocal microscopy</title><p>For our studies, we isolated neutrophils from healthy human donors as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and resuspended them in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Neutrophils were then stored on ice for 30 min or less before use. Immediately before transfection, cells were centrifuged at 1,800 rpm (800 &#x000d7; g) and 4&#x000b0;C for 5 min then resuspended in transfection buffer as indicated below. Ninety &#x003bc;L of neutrophil suspension (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells) were transferred to a nucleoporation cuvette (amaxa Biosystems, Germany), and 5 &#x003bc;g of the indicated cDNA were added to complete a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l. We found that this concentration of cells is essential to achieve maximum transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected in an amaxa nucleofector apparatus then immediately transferred to 8-well poly-L-lysine&#x02013;coated chambered glass slides (Lab-Tek) containing RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (50,000 to 100,000 cells per well in 400 &#x003bc;l of medium).

Briefly, two lines were drawn on each phagosome using the straight line tool. These generated four points where the lines intersected the phagosomal membrane. The intensity of fluorescence at the end of the lines (~ 1 &#x003bc;m outside the phagosome into the cytosol) was subtracted from the fluorescence intensity at the point where the lines intersected the phagosome (&#x00394;F<sub>I</sub>). The four independent values were averaged and used as representative of the &#x00394;F<sub>I </sub>for that particular phagosome.
