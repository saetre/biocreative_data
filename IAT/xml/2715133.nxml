The aim of this study was to investigate whether intestinal barrier dysfunction induced by indomethacin treatment affects the host response to intestinal microbiota in gluten-sensitized HLA-DQ8/HCD4 mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>HLA-DQ8/HCD4 mice were sensitized with gluten, and gavaged with indomethacin plus gluten. Intestinal permeability was assessed by Ussing chamber; epithelial cell (EC) ultra-structure by electron microscopy; RNA expression of genes coding for junctional proteins by Q-real-time PCR; immune response by <italic>in-vitro</italic> antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and cytokine analysis by cytometric bead array; intestinal microbiota by fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of systemic antibodies against intestinal microbiota by surface staining of live bacteria with serum followed by FACS analysis. Indomethacin led to a more pronounced increase in intestinal permeability in gluten-sensitized mice. These changes were accompanied by severe EC damage, decreased E-cadherin RNA level, elevated IFN-&#x003b3; in splenocyte culture supernatant, and production of significant IgM antibody against intestinal microbiota.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Indomethacin potentiates barrier dysfunction and EC injury induced by gluten, affects systemic IFN-&#x003b3; production and the host response to intestinal microbiota antigens in HLA-DQ8/HCD4 mice. The results suggest that environmental factors that alter the intestinal barrier may predispose individuals to an increased susceptibility to gluten through a bystander immune activation to intestinal microbiota.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten containing cereals, and in particular gliadin, the storage protein in wheat. It has recently been recognized that both the pathology and the clinical spectrum of CD varies considerably from severe to subtle, and that the clinical expression is not restricted to the presence of mucosal atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Cronin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Rostom1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The concept of gluten sensitivity (GS) incorporates a variety of pathologic, immunological, and clinical scenarios that may, or may not, form part of the &#x0201c;celiac&#x0201d; spectrum such as gluten-sensitive diarrhea, immunological mucosal response to gluten in family members of celiac disease, persistent positive specific serology for celiac disease in the absence of defined enteropathy, and subtle immunopathological changes in the intestine exposed to gluten. Typically, these disorders occur in individuals who carry the same HLA genotypes associated with celiac disease-DQ2 and DQ8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Troncone1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Verd1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This has led to the development of animal models of gluten-sensitivity that mimic certain aspects of gluten-induced pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Black1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. HLA-DQ8/HCD4 or single HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice that are sensitized with gluten develop an immune response to gliadin that involves both the adaptive and innate immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Black1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Verdu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Although these gluten-sensitive mice do not spontaneously develop intestinal atrophy, they exhibit gluten-dependent changes in gut neuromuscular and epithelial secretory function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Verdu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This model has proven useful for the preclinical testing of novel experimental therapies designed to block gluten-induced mucosal pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Pinier1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The presence of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genes are necessary but not sufficient for the development of CD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Green1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, as up to 25&#x02013;40&#x00025; of general populations in United States carry these genes and eat gluten, but do not develop a celiac lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Rostom1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Green1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, thus raising the possibility of contributing environmental and genetic risk factors yet to be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Kagnoff1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The net availability of gliadin to the lamina propria seems to be an important factor in the inflammatory response of celiac patients. The immobilization and haptenation of gluten components to the extracellular matrix proteins by tissue transglutaminase aids and allows reservoirs of antigenically potentiated gluten components to reach increased concentrations <italic>in vivo</italic>, and may even induce a widespread mucosal response against auto-antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Dieterich1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, celiac patients have been shown to increase systemic titres of IgA antibodies against collagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Dieterich1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Under normal conditions, the intestinal epithelium acts as a protective barrier restricting transport of luminal antigens, and only allows small and selective quantities to permeate the mucosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Fasano1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Arrieta1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, increased intestinal permeability has been demonstrated in patients with active CD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Bjarnason1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Bjarnason2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and their healthy relatives, suggesting that in a proportion of cases, intestinal barrier abnormalities may predate overt inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-vanElburg1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Altered barrier function could be a critical step in facilitating the host responses that contribute to the clinical expression of gluten sensitivity. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate whether alteration of intestinal barrier function using the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), indomethacin, enhances gluten-induced epithelial injury and influences subsequent host responses to gut luminal antigens. Our results show that indomethacin enhances gluten-induced changes in the mucosa leading to increased IFN-&#x003b3; release by gliadin-stimulated splenocytes and to systemic priming against intestinal microbiota antigens. In genetically predisposed hosts with long standing barrier abnormalities, this mechanism may lower the threshold of inflammatory responses to specific antigens.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Gluten sensitization and indomethacin treatment led to retardation of weight gain</title><p>Gluten sensitized mice and non-sensitized mice treated with indomethacin exhibited a mild retardation of weight gain after 7 weeks compared to non-sensitized controls.

Treatment with either gluten or indomethacin alone led to the production of very low titres of IgM antibodies directed against a subset of culturable bacteria. Gluten sensitization plus indomethacin treatment, however, resulted in induction of strong specific IgM responses directed against 40&#x02013;80&#x00025; of culturable bacteria. The anti-bacterial IgM induced was specific to the commensal microflora of the host and did not bind to Salmonella, which these mice have never been exposed to (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006472.s007">Figure S7</xref>). These data indicate that the combination of gluten-sensitization and increased intestinal permeability as induced by indomethacin treatment increased systemic priming to the commensal microflora.</p><fig id="pone-0006472-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006472.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Systemic antibodies against commensals.</title><p>Serum from indomethacin and gluten treated mice showed significant positive serum antibodies against their aerobic and anaerobic intestinal microbiota.

Our results demonstrate that gluten sensitization and long-term gluten challenge in HLA-DQ8/HCD4 mice alters intestinal permeability as assessed by increased transcellular macromolecular transport and a tendency for higher conductance values (paracellular pathway). This is in agreement with previous reports showing that gluten peptides have the ability to rapidly disrupt the apical junctional structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Drago1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Clemente1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, and can also be transported by an abnormal transcellular route <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-MatysiakBudnik1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the present manuscript, low-dose indomethacin induced permeability changes without producing macroscopic or microscopic ulcers. However, ultra-structural observations revealed epithelial cell abnormalities characterized by mitochondria with disrupted cristae in mice receiving indomethacin. Mucosal toxicity induced by gluten in HCD4/DQ8 mice was potentiated by indomethacin, as shown by more marked elevation of HRP flux and a significant increase in tissue conductance. After administration of indomethacin, C57BL/6 mice exhibited increased HRP flux, but no change in tissue conductance. Gluten sensitization however, did not induce barrier dysfunction in C57Bl6 mice, emphasizing the relevance of the DQ8 transgene in the model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006472.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Electron microscopy examination in gluten-sensitized HCD4/DQ8 mice treated with indomethacin revealed more structural abnormalities in the apical region of the epithelium compared to gluten alone-treated mice. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis demonstrated reduced E-cadherin RNA levels in gluten-sensitized plus indomethacin treated mice. E-cadherin is required for TJ formation and there is growing evidence for its role as modulator of TJ and intestinal barrier function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Guo1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Sander2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. E-cadherin expression is reduced in children with CD and gliadin has been shown to alter its expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Barshak1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results support the hypothesis that both gluten and indomethacin play a role in the expression of E-cadherin, and that this effect is potentiated in a genetically susceptible host when both agents are administered together. Marked reduction of E-cadherin may constitute a mechanism for the enhanced barrier dysfunction observed in gluten-sensitized and indomethacin-treated HCD4/DQ8 mice.</p><p>The marked changes in barrier function in gluten-sensitized plus indomethacin-treated mice were accompanied by increased IFN-&#x003b3; production in splenocyte cultures after incubation with PT-gliadin. These results suggest a shift towards a mild systemic pro-inflammatory state. Previous studies have shown that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent arachidonic acid metabolites are important in the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis, particularly in the immunoregulation of dietary antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Newberry1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, COX-2 inhibitors such as indomethacin may exacerbate the immune response to dietary antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Newberry1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results using <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation of splenocytes with PT gliadin and indomethacin, however, do not support a direct effect of indomethacin on splenocyte proliferation and IFN-&#x003b3; release. Thus, we hypothesize that the shift in the immune response may be due to an enhanced uptake of luminal contents, including commensal bacteria, through a more structurally damaged and permeable epithelium.</p><p>The intestinal epithelium regulates permeation of luminal antigens and excessive immune activation within the mucosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Fasano1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Yu1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The marked barrier defect in gluten-sensitized mice treated with indomethacin may not only allow an increased influx of gliadin peptides across the epithelium but also of other luminal antigens such as intestinal microbiota with potential bystander, pro-inflammatory effects. Germ-free rats have been reported to have a higher threshold for intestinal damage after indomethacin administration compared to specific pathogen-free (SPF) rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Robert1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Since inhibition of prostaglandins in the absence of an intestinal microbiota is less severe, the results raise the hypothesis that intestinal bacteria potentiate the development of indomethacin-induced mucosal lesions. Thus, dysmotility induced by gluten sensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Verdu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> or indomethacin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Porras2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, and/or the ability of indomethacin to induce small intestinal dysbiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Porras2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Dalby1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> may facilitate bacterial translocation. Due to a severely impaired intestinal barrier in both gluten-sensitized and indomethacin-treated mice, increased permeation of luminal bacteria may disturb the natural commensal homeostasis in the gut promoting a pro-inflammatory response. SPF mice have been shown to be systemically ignorant to their intestinal microbiota due to the geographic and functional separation between the mucosal and systemic immune system by the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Macpherson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Macpherson2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results show, however, that a low level of systemic priming against intestinal microbiota occurs in SPF mice treated with either gluten or indomethacin alone. Gluten-sensitized mice, in which barrier function is further perturbed by indomethacin treatment, show dramatic systemic priming to their intestinal microbiota. These data therefore imply that gluten-sensitization, in combination with indomethacin treatment, results in decreased mucosal containment of the commensal flora. NSAIDs have been shown to reduce the phagocytic properties of macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Furst1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we acknowledge that it is possible that in addition to changes in intestinal barrier function, indomethacin may have a dual effect by inhibiting macrophage function, allowing the persistence of live bacteria, and facilitating a systemic immune response against intestinal microbiota. F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell counts in the lamina propria of gluten plus indomethacin-treated mice were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006472.s008">Figure S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006472.s010">Protocol S1</xref>), however macrophage function was not assessed. The exact identities of the commensals to which gluten and indomethacin-treated mice are systemically primed in this model are not yet known but the absence of IgM binding to <italic>Salmonella</italic>, known to be absent from the commensal flora of our mice, strongly suggests the specificity of the IgM antibodies against commensal flora in our mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006472.s007">Figure S7</xref>). The clinical relevance of the loss of systemic ignorance against the intestinal microbiota remains to be established, however, systemic priming to the commensal flora represents a significant shift in the normal relationship between host and commensal bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Macpherson3">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, this may indicate a novel mechanism that could contribute to the progression of disease in a gluten-sensitive host. On the other hand, specific IgM against flora may be part of a protective mechanism mounted by the immune system to limit subsequent translocation and widespread inflammation. Additional host factors, such as an underlying immune dysbalance, may play a role in determining whether this mechanism will become maladaptive and contribute to widespread inflammation. A recent epidemiological study has determined that consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is a risk factor for the development of irritable bowel syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Ford1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. No epidemiological studies to date have investigated whether a history of NSAID consumption is also a risk factor for the protean clinical expression in gluten sensitivity.</p><p>Although the role of the intestinal microbiota in other chronic diseases of the gut is clearly established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-TlaskalovaHogenova1">&#x0005b;for review see 42&#x0005d;</xref> little is known about the role of abnormal immune responses to commensals in gluten and other food intolerances.

Interestingly, microbial seropositivity was also present in gluten-sensitive patient with no evidence of active CD.

The disappearance of anti-<italic>Saccaromyces cervisiae</italic>-antibodies (ASCA) after a gluten-free diet suggests that healing of mucosal lesions is related to microbial sero-markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-MallantHent1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a causal relationship between gut dysfunction, symptoms and microbial sero-responses in CD remains to be determined.

To this respect, a study in DQ8 mice has shown that oral challenge with <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> at the time of mucosal sensitization with gliadin and cholera toxin exacerbates the Th1 response induced in the model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-DArienzo1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is possible that dysbiosis or shifts in the composition of the intestinal microbiota at the time of gluten sensitization, and not necessarily the presence of a pathogen, contribute to enhance gluten-induced immune responses.

In this study, we observed significant alterations in the composition of the small intestinal microbiota in gluten-sensitized mice treated with indomethacin. It is unclear, however, if these changes are primary or secondary to the functional gut abnormalities observed in the model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006472-Verdu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that an environmental alteration of the intestinal barrier plays a critical role in determining host immune responses to gluten and intestinal microbiota antigens. Bystander luminal antigens such as components of the intestinal microbiota may contribute to enhance inflammatory responses to dietary antigens such as gluten. This mechanism may become important in genetically predisposed hosts with longstanding barrier abnormalities.
