However, the mechanisms of NF-&#x003ba;B degradation are unclear and can vary depending on the cell type. Cleavage of p65/RelA can produce an amino-terminal fragment that was shown to act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B, thereby promoting apoptosis. However, the opposite situation has also been described and the production of a carboxy-terminal fragment that contains two potent transactivation domains has also been related to the onset of apoptosis. In this context, a carboxy-terminal fragment of p65/RelA (&#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65), detected in non-apoptotic human T lymphocytes upon activation, has been studied. T cells constitute one of the long-lived cellular reservoirs of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Because NF-&#x003ba;B is the most important inducible element involved in initiation of HIV-1 transcription, an adequate control of NF-&#x003ba;B response is of paramount importance for both T cell survival and viral spread. Its major inhibitor I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; constitutes a master terminator of NF-&#x003ba;B response that is complemented by degradation of p65/RelA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and conclusions</title><p>In this study, the function of a caspase-3-mediated carboxy-terminal fragment of p65/RelA, which was detected in activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), was analyzed. Cells producing this truncated p65/RelA did not undergo apoptosis but showed a high viability, in spite of caspase-3 activation. &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 lacked most of DNA-binding domain but retained the dimerization domain, NLS and transactivation domains. Consequently, it could translocate to the nucleus, associate with NF-&#x003ba;B1/p50 and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, but could not bind -&#x003ba;B consensus sites. However, although &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 lacked transcriptional activity by itself, it could increase NF-&#x003ba;B activity in a dose-dependent manner by hijacking I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. Thus, its expression resulted in a persistent transactivation activity of wild-type p65/RelA, as well as an improvement of HIV-1 replication in PBLs. Moreover, &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 was increased in the nuclei of PMA-, PHA-, and TNF&#x003b1;-activated T cells, proving this phenomenon was related to cell activation. These data suggest the existence of a novel mechanism for maintaining NF-&#x003ba;B activity in human T cells through the binding of the carboxy-terminal fragment of p65/RelA to I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; in order to protect wild-type p65/RelA from I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; inhibition.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The family of transcription factors NF-&#x003ba;B regulates numerous genes controlling immune response, cell growth, and tissue differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These factors exist as dimeric complexes, comprising different proteins: NF-&#x003ba;B1/p50, NF-&#x003ba;B2/p52, p65/RelA, c-Rel, and RelB. The most important active heterodimer of NF-&#x003ba;B is p65/p50. All of these proteins contain a well-conserved amino-terminal region known as the Rel Homology Region (RHR) which is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization and nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is inhibited by a variety of mechanisms: first, through the association of the NF-&#x003ba;B dimers with three major inhibitory proteins I&#x003ba;Bs (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2;, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b5;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; second, through the inhibition of p65/RelA posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; third, via complete or partial degradation of p65/RelA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; and fourth, by replacement of active NF-&#x003ba;B dimers with dimers showing no transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The NF-&#x003ba;B pathway also provides an attractive target to viral pathogens. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is a rapid, immediate early event that occurs within minutes after exposure to a stimulus, does not require <italic>de novo </italic>protein synthesis (e.g. the basal pool of p65/RelA is very constant), and produces a strong transcriptional activation of several viral genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. As a result, NF-&#x003ba;B is essential in the regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The promoter-proximal (enhancer) region of the HIV-1 LTR contains two adjacent NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites that play a central role in mediating inducible HIV-1 gene expression in blood CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Besides, NF-&#x003ba;B also acts as a protector against apoptosis or programmed cell death, and is necessary and sufficient for preventing apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In fact, the ability to maintain NF-&#x003ba;B activity determines whether the cell survives or undergoes apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Degradation of p65/RelA is therefore an important mechanism for cell survival in many cell types. Putative recognition sequences for caspase-3 and -6-related proteases are present in the amino acid sequences of p65/RelA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This suggests that certain transduced signals could be responsible for the modulation of NF-&#x003ba;B activity by caspase-mediated cleavage of p65/RelA. The cleavage appears to be cell type- and stimulus-specific and occurs at different sites in the amino- and carboxy-terminus of p65/RelA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As a consequence, it is widely established that truncation of p65/RelA inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transactivation and ultimately leads to apoptosis. Therefore, caspase-3-related proteolysis may determine the duration of NF-&#x003ba;B activity in stimulated T cells and may play a critical role in the duration and potency of the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, a carboxy-terminal fragment of p65/RelA that can be detected in activated human blood T lymphocytes is analyzed. Amino-cleavage of p65/RelA was increased after treatment with stimuli as phytohemagglutinin (PHA), 5-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or TNF&#x003b1;, thereby proving this phenomenon is related to T-cell activation. However, despite previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], this amino-truncated p65/RelA was produced in T cells (PBLs and Jurkat) that did not undergo apoptosis. On the contrary, they showed a high viability and an increased NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent activation. This carboxy-terminal fragment of p65/RelA lacked most of the DNA-binding domains but retained the dimerization domain, the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the transactivation domains. Consequently, it was able to translocate to the nucleus, associate with NF-&#x003ba;B1/p50 and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, but could not bind DNA. In spite of this, amino-truncated p65/RelA was able to increase NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transactivation, as well as HIV-1 replication in a dose-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>p65/RelA is truncated in PHA-treated human blood T lymphocytes</title><p>PBLs isolated from the blood of healthy donors were cultured for 3 days with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml PHA and for 9 consecutive days with 300 U/ml IL-2. Cells were maintained without IL-2 for 18 hours before the experiment. Subcellular localization of p65/RelA was analyzed by immunoblotting and a major truncated fragment of p65/RelA (~55 kDa) was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). This form accumulated in the cytosol but was also gathered in the nucleus of PHA-treated T cells when the protein nuclear export was inhibited by adding Leptomycin B (LMB) &#x02013; a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] &#x02013; to the culture medium for 4 hours or when the cells were treated with the protein kinase C (PKC) activator PMA for 2 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, Nucleus). An immunoprecipitation assay was carried out with the same protein extracts by using an antibody against I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; to determine whether this cleaved p65/RelA could bind its major inhibitor. The truncated form of p65/RelA could be detected in the nucleus by immunoblotting with an antibody against the carboxy terminus of p65/RelA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) but not by an antibody against the amino terminus. As a result, this form was able to bind I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and was cleaved in the amino terminus of the protein; hence, it will be called from now on &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65. In addition, interaction between I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 in the nucleus was detected mainly when cells where treated with LMB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>, IB with anti-p65 COOH, lane 2), thereby proving the fast shuttling of &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 between nucleus and cytosol in activated T cells. It was also detected in the nucleus of PMA-activated T cells when the protein nuclear export was not inhibited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>, IB with anti-p65 COOH, lane 3). Activation of T cells with more physiologic stimuli as TNF&#x003b1; provided similar results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of a p65/RelA amino-truncated form in activated human T cells</bold>.

Consequently, this human T cell lymphoblast-like cell line could be used as a recipient for studying the cleavage of p65/RelA. In order to determine the association between cleavage of p65/RelA and T-cell activation, the p65/RelA wild-type (wt) gene was cloned in a tagging expression vector under the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (pCMV-Tag1 vector). Jurkat cells were then transiently transfected with the pCMV-p65wt-tag expression vector and treated with PMA immediately after transfection. Eighteen hours after transfection, cytosolic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>) and nuclear (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>) protein extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against the carboxy-terminus of p65/RelA. Densitometry of the gel bands was made to demonstrate that the increasing amount of &#x00394;NH2p65 in the presence of PMA does not necessarily correlate with the increasing expression levels of p65/RelA, neither endogenous p65wt nor transfected p65wt-tag, but to an inducible proteolysis caused by T-cell activation. In fact, the addition of PMA induced a more than 2-fold increase in the quantity of &#x00394;NH2p65, both in the cytosol and nucleus. Interestingly, there was only a single major degradation form of p65/RelA in Jurkat cells that corresponded to the major cleaved form also observed in PBLs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of tagged p65/RelA and endogenous p65/RelA in activated Jurkat cells</bold>.

Analysis of protein expression was performed 18 hours after transfection by immunoblotting using an antibody against the carboxy-terminus of p65/RelA in the cytosol (b) or in the nucleus (c). Gel bands were quantified by densitometry and background noise was subtracted from the images. Relative ratio of optical density units was calculated regarding to the gel band with less optical density. (d) Analysis of subcellular distribution of tagged p65/RelA was also determined by confocal microscopy. Cells were transiently transfected with 1 &#x003bc;g of pCMV-p65wt-tag expression vector per million of cells and PMA or PHA was added immediately after transfection.

Tagged p65/RelA could shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus and it mainly increased inside the nucleus after PMA or PHA activation. To prove that the subcellular distribution of the tagged p65/RelA proteins in T cells after activation with PMA or PHA was similar to the usual pattern described for endogenous p65wt, Jurkat cells transfected with the control plasmid pCMV-Tag1 and stained with an antibody against p65/RelA and a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). As expected, both p65wt-tag (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>) and p65wt (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>) showed a similar distribution pattern after activation with PMA or PHA.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of cleavage site at Asp<sup>97 </sup>through generation of uncleavable N-terminal p65/RelA mutants</title><p>Protein p65/RelA has been identified as a potential target for specific cleavage by caspase-3 and -6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). In order to determine whether caspases were involved in the cleavage of p65/RelA, Jurkat cells transiently transfected with pCMV-p65wt-tag expression vector were treated for 18 hours with PMA alone or in presence of either the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk at 100 &#x003bc;M or the specific caspase-3 and -6 inhibitor Ac-DMQD-CHO (at 10 or 100 &#x003bc;M to inhibit caspase-6 or both caspase-3 and caspase-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Consequently, cleavage of p65/RelA was produced by caspase-3 or -6 activity after induction of T cell activation. Moreover, measurement of the caspase-3 activity showed that it was increased more than 3-fold in Jurkat cells after treatment with PMA for 18 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Cleavage of p65wt-tag protein in Jurkat cells after PMA activation</bold>.

Analysis by immunoblotting with an antibody against the carboxy-terminus of p65/RelA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>) or by using an anti-FLAG tag M2 mAb (data not shown) revealed that &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65-tag was produced only when p65wt-tag or the mutant p65 V91L-tag (resistant to cleavage by caspase-6) were over-expressed but not when amino-acids at position 94 and/or 97 were mutated. Accordingly, &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 was produced in human T cells as a result of p65/RelA cleavage at <sup>94</sup>DCRD<sup>97 </sup>after caspase-3 activation. Moreover, cleavage of p65/RelA was produced promptly after induction of T-cell activation, because PMA had been added for 2 hours before analyzing the protein extracts.</p></sec><sec><title>Caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p65/RelA was produced in non-apoptotic human blood T cells upon activation</title><p>In order to further analyze the association between T-cell activation, caspase-3 activity, and cleavage of p65/RelA, human PBLs were incubated with PMA or PHA for 4 days and then analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody recognizing full length precursor of caspase-3 (32 kDa) as well as p17 and p20 subunits. Caspase-3 is expressed as an inactive 32 kDa precursor from which the p20 and p11 subunits are proteolytically generated during onset of apoptosis. Subsequently, the p20 peptide is truncated to generate the mature p17 subunit. The active caspase-3 heterodimer is composed of two p17 subunits and two p11 subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, procaspase-3 diminished while active subunit p17 increased &#x02013; mainly in the nucleus but also in the cytosol &#x02013; of PBLs treated with PHA. Upon PMA activation, although procaspase-3 did not diminish significantly in the cytosol, active subunit p17 was also detected in the nucleus, thereby proving that activation of caspase-3 is lesser with PMA than with PHA. Moreover, &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 progressively accumulated in the nucleus of these activated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>), according to the increasing proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Although there was a clear correlation between activation of caspase-3 and the increase of nuclear &#x00394;NH2p65, densitometric analysis of gel bands showed that there was no linear correlation between nuclear increase of &#x00394;NH2p65 and nuclear translocation of p65wt caused by T-cell activation. Moreover, increasing of caspase-3 activity was more than 1-fold higher in PBLs treated with PHA than with PMA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>), by this means explaining why degradation of p65wt was higher in PBLs treated with PHA than with PMA. NF-&#x003ba;B1/p50 also increased in the nucleus upon PHA or PMA activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>), but interestingly this protein was not cleaved in spite of its ability to also serve as a substrate for caspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Caspase-3 activity is related to the cleavage of p65/RelA in non-apoptotic PBLs after PMA- or PHA-activation</bold>.

It was determined that the production of HIV-1 p24-gag antigen was under the threshold limit of detection even when pCMV-p65wt-tag and/or pCMV-&#x00394;NH2p65-tag expression vectors were co-transfected, thereby proving that this phenomenon is exclusively related to NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent activity (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>HIV-1 infection is characterized by continuous viral replication throughout the illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] &#x02013; mainly in T lymphocytes and macrophages &#x02013; that ultimately leads to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). NF-&#x003ba;B is essential for the activation of HIV-1 in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In fact, although the HIV-1 LTR contains several additional DNA binding domains that bind other cellular transcriptional factors, only NF-&#x003ba;B and Sp1 binding sites are really indispensable for initiation of HIV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, control of NF-&#x003ba;B activation is essential to impede HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activation as well as viral replication. The activation of NF-&#x003ba;B can be inhibited by a variety of mechanisms, especially the synergistic combination of cytosolic sequestering by the inhibitor I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and degradation of p65/RelA.</p><p>Degradation of p65/RelA can occur through different pathways that vary depending on the cell type. This mechanism has been involved not only in the inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent activity but also in the onset of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Protein p65/RelA is a potential target for specific cleavage by caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but viruses such as picornaviruses can also promote a rapid and efficient proteolytic cleavage of the carboxy-terminus of p65/RelA by the viral protease 3C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The resultant amino-terminal fragment has also been detected in HUVEC cells and acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B, finally promoting apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This effect is caused because the elimination of the carboxy-terminus leaves an amino-terminal fragment that retains the ability to bind DNA but lacks the ability to initiate transcription. Similar cleavage can be performed by the human neutrophil elastase (HNE) that removes the carboxy-terminus of p65/RelA near a site predominantly cleaved by caspase-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, the opposite situation has also been described. The neutrophilic and monocytic proteinase 3 (PR3) removes the DNA-binding domain in the amino-terminus of p65/RelA by cleavage at a sequence near a caspase-3 cleavage site, leaving a carboxy-terminal fragment that contains two potent transactivation domains and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been described that caspase-mediated cleavage of p65/RelA at Asp<sup>97 </sup>in HeLa cells induced an amino-cleaved fragment of p65/RelA that was responsible for inducing apoptosis in the presence of 2,3-dichloro-5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (NA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. On the contrary, Qin Z et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] suggested that a caspase-3-like protease contributed to NF-&#x003ba;B activation through I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation, which finally caused apoptosis in rat striatal neurons through the activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Consequently, association of p65/RelA cleavage with the onset of apoptosis or with modulation of the NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transactivation is not widely understood and it appears to be dependent on the cell type. In this context, the amino-terminal cleavage of p65/RelA (&#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65) detected in PHA-, PMA-, or TNF&#x003b1;-stimulated PBLs has been investigated.</p><p>The Jurkat cell line does not show significant levels of endogenous &#x00394;NH2p65 even after PMA activation; hence it has been used as a recipient for this study because it is a lymphoblast-like cell line and can reproduce the environment of human PBLs. When p65/RelA was over-expressed in Jurkat cells by transfection of vector pCMV-p65wt-tag protein, a weak &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65-tag form &#x02013; coming from cleavage of p65wt-tag protein &#x02013; could be detected in the absence of activation. This cleavage was greatly enhanced when cells were also activated with PMA and measurement of caspase-3 activity showed that it increased in T cells more than 3-fold after treatment with PMA for 18 hours. However, &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65-tag was not detected when Jurkat cells were also treated with caspase inhibitors even upon PMA activation. Consequently, this specific degradation was produced by caspase activation. According to the observed molecular weight of &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 (~55 kDa), the potential site of cleavage was supposed to be at position <sup>94</sup>DCRD<sup>97 </sup>&#x02013; a putative recognition site DXXD for caspase-3 &#x02013; or at position <sup>91</sup>VGKD<sup>94 </sup>&#x02013; a putative recognition site V/I/LXXD for caspase-6. The correct cleavage site was identified at <sup>94</sup>DCRD<sup>97 </sup>because when amino acids at position 94 and/or 97 in p65wt-tag protein were changed, &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65-tag was not produced even after activation with PHA or PMA. This major cleavage site of p65/RelA has been previously reported in HeLa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and SK-Hep1 hepatoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] but not in human PBLs. Besides, Kang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] reported that &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 induced a slight decreasing of the transcriptional activity mediated by NF-&#x003ba;B in HeLa cells. But the transfection of different concentrations of the plasmid pCMV-&#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65-tag in 3T3-p65ko cells, Jurkat or PBLs did not induce significant variations in the NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transcriptional activity. Moreover, T-cell viability was not diminished after over-expression of &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65-tag protein in these cells. These contradictory data could be due to the cell type used for studying the cleavage of p65/RelA. Activation of caspase-3 is very complex and can be promoted through different pathways in different cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]: e.g., deprivation of growth factors in endothelial HUVEC cells produced a caspase-mediated carboxy-terminal cleavage of p65/RelA that acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B, finally causing cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; but deprivation of serum in the culture medium of Jurkat cells did not induce detectable apoptosis (data not shown).</p><p>On the other hand, PMA has been currently described as a potential inhibitor of apoptosis in human T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; PHA is a mitogen usually used to induce HIV-1 replication and significant apoptosis has not been reported under this stimulus; and TNF&#x003b1; treatment does not result in the death of Jurkat cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, when PBLs were exposed to PMA or PHA for 4 days the amount of procaspase-3 decreased in the cytosol as long as the active nuclear caspase-3-p17 subunit increased up to 4-fold, although these cells were largely viable. Moreover, an increase in caspase-3 activity correlated with the increasing cleavage of p65/RelA, although NF-&#x003ba;B1/p50 remained stable. Accordingly, if these cells were apoptotic, p65/RelA and NF-&#x003ba;B1/p50 protein levels would decrease, as occurs in both Jurkat and PBLs with the onset of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Consequently, activation of T cells did induce caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p65/RelA in a process unrelated to apoptosis.</p><p>In fact, effector caspase-3 can be processed following T-cell activation in the absence of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It has been described that caspase-3 translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus after activation in apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, although human PBLs showed nuclear activity of caspase-3 after treatment with PMA or PHA, these cells were viable and caspase-3 activation did not affect T cell proliferation. Moreover, although PMA activates caspase-3 through the PKC signaling pathway and this leads ultimately to apoptosis in a gastric cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], caspases also play a central role in T lymphocyte activation as well as in IL-2 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Accordingly, activation of caspase-3 should be considered in the context of the general environment of the cell, where the equilibrium between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors will determine if the cell undergoes apoptosis or survives. In this context, Varghese et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] described that treatment of Jurkat cells with diethylmaleate (DEM) induced apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 but PMA was able to restore the XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) levels in DEM-treated cells, which blocks apoptosis by directly binding to caspase-3, -7 and -9. Similar mechanisms should occur in PMA or PHA treated T cells that promote cell survival and proliferation in spite of the activation of caspase-3. Moreover, treatment of Jurkat cells with DEM also induced degradation of p65/RelA to &#x00394;NH2p65 (data not shown), thereby proving that degradation of p65/RelA is not enough to induce apoptosis at least in T cells but other processes such as the decrease in pro-apoptotic factors as XIAP should be involved. Besides, it has been suggested that caspase-1, -3 and -6 could not be the primary caspases required for apoptosis in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Because &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 was mainly observed after T cell activation, this form could be somehow involved in NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transcriptional activity. Protein &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65-tag retained the dimerization domain, NLS, and both transactivation domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] but it lacks the DNA-binding domain. As a result, it could bind I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and NF-&#x003ba;B1/p50 but not DNA, neither as a homodimer nor as a heterodimer with NF-&#x003ba;B1/p50. This can be explained because both subsites containing the residues that contact DNA present in each subunit of the dimer are necessary to bind the complex to the DNA backbone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. On the other hand, the mutation of NF-&#x003ba;B1/p50 that disrupted DNA binding could not affect the ability of association with other members of the NF-&#x003ba;B family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Accordingly, the deletion of amino acids 1&#x02013;97 in protein p65/RelA did not interfere with the ability of interaction with NF-&#x003ba;B1/p50 or I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, although it impaired the ability to bind to DNA, likely by modification of the structural conformation of the heterodimer. Likewise, in a similar mechanism, other dimers such as p65wt/&#x00394;NH2p65 would also be unable to bind DNA, thereby ruling out the possibility that those dimers could be responsible for the transcriptional activation observed when &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65-tag was over-expressed along with p65wt-tag. In fact, over-expression of increasing quantities of &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65-tag protein in the 3T3-p65ko cell line &#x02013; maintaining the p65wt-tag protein concentration as invariable &#x02013; showed that NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent activation increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 3-fold. On the other hand, &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 was able to bind I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and when nuclear export was obstructed with LMB in PHA-treated PBLs, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; showed high affinity to &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65. This effect suggested the possibility that after &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 was generated &#x02013; probably in the nucleus by activated caspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] &#x02013;, it would hijack I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, being actively exported to the cytosol and thereby permitting a sustained NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent activity by free p65wt. The active shuttling of &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 from the nucleus to the cytosol would explain why it largely accumulated in the nucleus of PHA-activated PBLs after treatment with LMB. But when in vitro translated proteins were mixed at different ratios in the presence of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; to evaluate the affinity of both proteins for this inhibitor, data showed that there was similar affinity of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; for &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 and p65wt. This could be explained because the translated proteins could present different behavior in vitro and in vivo. However, these results did not rule out the possibility that when &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 was over-expressed, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; could bind preferentially to this cleaved form in the nucleus.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is essential for triggering HIV-1 LTR-transcription in blood CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and these cells are one of the long-lived cellular reservoirs of HIV-1 in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this context, the importance of p65/RelA degradation in HIV-1 infected human blood T cells was also analyzed. Evaluation of the HIV-1 replication in PBLs after the over-expression of pCMV-p65wt-tag and/or pCMV-&#x00394;NH2p65-tag plasmids was performed in resting conditions to evaluate the virus production due exclusively to the transfected tagged p65/RelA proteins and not to the endogenous p65/RelA induced upon activation. Data showed that HIV-1 replication was also enhanced in resting PBLs co-transfected with both p65wt-tag and &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65-tag proteins &#x02013; ratio 1:2 &#x02013; in comparison with PBLs transfected only with p65wt-tag protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Activation of T cells induced caspase-mediated cleavage of p65/RelA at Asp<sup>97</sup>. This carboxy-terminal fragment of p65/RelA was observed in the cytosol although it also accumulated in the nucleus when cells were also treated with PMA, PHA, TNF&#x003b1;, or LMB, a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Because active forms of caspase-3 accumulated in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], p65/RelA should be degraded at the nuclear compartment. Then, &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 would bind I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and would be rapidly exported to the cytosol, due to the fast nucleocytosolic shuttling of NF-&#x003ba;B in PBLs even in resting conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This mechanism would protect the nuclear full-length p65/RelA from I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; inhibition and would permit a sustained NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transcriptional activity, thereby increasing HIV-1 replication in human T cells. This function has never been described before for a carboxy-terminal fragment of p65/RelA, which is generally supposed to be a previous form before complete degradation in pro-apoptotic cells. Consequently, these findings describe a novel pathway in the activation and regulation of the NF-&#x003ba;B/I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; system in human T cells, the best-defined reservoir of HIV-1 latent infection. More studies will be necessary to evaluate the importance of degradation of p65/RelA to &#x00394;NH<sub>2</sub>p65 and of caspase-3 activity in the mechanisms of HIV-1 latency and replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated from blood of healthy donors by centrifugation through a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (Pharmacia Corporation, North Peapack, NJ).

Reaction mixture containing 200 &#x003bc;l of HBS solution (50 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 140 mM NaCl, pH7.05), 200 &#x003bc;l of 250 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>solution and 5 &#x003bc;g of DNA, was incubated at room temperature for 1 minute and then added to cells drop by drop. Cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C, 5%CO<sub>2 </sub>for 12 hours. Transfection mix was removed and fresh medium was added. After incubation for 12 hours, cells were trypsinized, washed and luciferase expression was analyzed. Although 3T3 cells are supposed to be calcium intolerant cells, no significant cell death was observed after 12 hours in presence of calcium precipitate.</p></sec><sec><title>Caspase-3 activity and cell viability</title><p>Caspase-3 activity has been measured with the Colorimetric CaspACE&#x02122; Assay System (Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS1x and lysed by freeze-thaw cycles. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15.000 &#x000d7; g for 20 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C and supernatants were collected and protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. For each experimental point, 25 &#x003bc;g of total protein extracts were analyzed with the colorimetric substrate Ac-DEVD-<italic>p</italic>-nitroaniline (pNA) 0.1 mM. The assay was incubated over-night at 22&#x000b0;C and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Calculation of caspase specific activity was determined by the construction of pNA standard curve.</p><p>Cell viability was determined with the CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS1x and resuspended in lysis buffer. After incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature to stabilize luminescent signal, cell lysates were deposited in an opaque-walled multiwell plate and analyzed in an Orion Microplate Luminometer with Simplicity software (Berthold Detection Systems, Oak Ridge, TN).</p></sec><sec><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>For immunofluorescence assays, cells were immobilized in PolyPrep slides (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde-0.025% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. After washing twice with 0.1% glycine/PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 minutes. After washing, cells were treated with 1 mg/ml NaBH<sub>4 </sub>for 10 minutes. Incubation for 1 hour at room temperature with each primary and secondary antibodies and subsequent washes were performed with PBS/2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.05% saponine buffer. Coverslips were immobilized with 70% glycerol/PBS. Images were obtained with a Radiance 2100 confocal microscope (BioRad, Hercules, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation assays</title><p>Cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts were obtained as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using a BSA standard curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Control of purity of nuclear and cytosolic extracts was determined by immunoblotting with an antibody against p105 (exclusive cytosolic distribution) and p50 (clone H-119, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Ten micrograms were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose paper (GE Healthcare). After blocking and incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, proteins were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL).</p><p>Cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. In brief, 100 &#x003bc;g of nuclear or cytosolic proteins were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with 10 &#x003bc;g of an agarose-conjugated antibody against I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), gently shaking, in RIPA buffer (1 &#x000d7; PBS, 0.1%SDS, 1%NP-40) and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (DOC). In case of anti-FLAG mAb, 100 &#x003bc;g of protein extracts were incubated with 4 &#x003bc;g of anti-FLAG for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C and then 150 &#x003bc;g of goat anti-mouse IgG agarose-conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Protein extracts were then incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with gentle shaking. Immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation at 4&#x000b0;C, 2.500 rpm for 5 minutes and washed four times with RIPA/DOC buffer. Finally, the agarose pellet was denatured at 95&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)</title><p>Nuclear protein extracts and TNT co-traduced proteins (3 &#x003bc;g) were analyzed using the [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP-labeled double-stranded synthetic wild-type HIV enhancer oligonucleotide 5'-AGCTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGA-3' containing both -&#x003ba;B consensus motifs. The nucleoprotein-oligonucleotide complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel.</p></sec><sec><title>HIV-1 replication assay</title><p>Resting PBLs were transfected with pNL4.3-Renilla, pNL4.3-wt or pdI-NF vectors. Viral replication was assessed after 72 hours by quantification of HIV-1 p24 gag antigen in culture supernatants using an enzyme-like immunoassay (Innotest&#x02122; HIV Ag mAb, Innogenetics, Barcelona, Spain) or by Renilla quantification. Briefly, cells were resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;l of lysis buffer 1&#x000d7; provided by Renilla Luciferase Assay System Kit (Promega), incubated for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C and centrifuged 5 minutes at 13.000 rpm.
