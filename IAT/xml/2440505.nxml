Synaptic dysfunctions may be at the origin of cognitive impairments, however the link between prenatal inflammation and synaptic defects remains to be established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In this study, we show that prenatal alteration of microglial function, including inflammation, induces delayed synaptic dysfunction in the adult. DAP12 is a microglial signaling protein expressed around birth, mutations of which in the human induces the Nasu-Hakola disease, characterized by early dementia. We presently report that synaptic excitatory currents in mice bearing a loss-of-function mutation in the DAP12 gene (DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice) display enhanced relative contribution of AMPA. Furthermore, neurons from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> P0 pups cultured without microglia develop similar synaptic alterations, suggesting that a prenatal dysfunction of microglia may impact synaptic function in the adult. As we observed that DAP12<sup>KI</sup> microglia overexpress genes for IL1&#x003b2;, IL6 and NOS2, which are inflammatory proteins, we analyzed the impact of a pharmacologically-induced prenatal inflammation on synaptic function. Maternal injection of lipopolysaccharides induced activation of microglia at birth and alteration of glutamatergic synapses in the adult offspring. Finally, neurons cultured from neonates born to inflamed mothers and cultured without microglia also displayed altered neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>Our results demonstrate that prenatal inflammation is sufficient to induce synaptic alterations with delay.

We first demonstrated that the ratio between AMPA and NMDA receptor (AMPAR, NMDAR) currents is increased in adult DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice, as compared to wild-type (WT). Then, by analyzing pure neuronal cultures from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> P0 pups, we investigated the impact of the prenatal period in inducing late synaptic defects. Finally, as we observed that DAP12<sup>KI</sup> animals displayed a transient microglial activation at birth, we compared their synaptic phenotype with the one of WT animals having experienced a pharmacologically-induced inflammation during their fetal development. We conclude from both genetical and pharmacological models that prenatal activation of microglia has a delayed impact on synaptic function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mutation of the microglial protein DAP12 enhances relative AMPAR contribution to glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus</title><p>We previously reported that in the synapses of the Schaffer collaterals onto CA1 pyramidal neurons of DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice, the NMDA receptors (NMDARs) were more sensitive to the NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil, and the AMPARs were more permeable to calcium, as compared with WT mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002595-Roumier1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Noteworthy, in synapses formed by dentate gyrus granule cells onto interneurons, it has been shown that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-permeable AMPARs and high content of NR2B in NMDAR result in an enhanced contribution of AMPAR to the glutamatergic response, with high ratio of AMPAR- versus NMDAR-evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002595-Lei1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, in order to further understand the consequence of DAP12 mutation on synaptic function, we have now addressed the relative contribution of AMPAR vs. NMDAR EPSCs in the Schaffer collateral synapses formed onto CA1 pyramidal neurons in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice. In WT mice, the ratio of AMPAR- over NMDAR-mediated currents was 0.23&#x000b1;0.05 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9), while in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice, this ratio was enhanced &#x0223c;2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g001">Fig 1A</xref>; DAP12<sup>KI</sup>: 0.45&#x000b1;0.08; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10; p&#x0003c;0.03). Thus, the relative contribution of AMPAR vs. NMDAR to glutamatergic currents is increased in the hippocampus of mutant mice. With electron microscopy analysis, we found that the synaptic density was unchanged in the hippocampus of DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice (supplementary data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002595.s001">Fig S1B</xref>), but the density of perforated synapses was significantly increased in the stratum radiatum of their CA1 area (supplementary data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002595.s001">Fig S1CD</xref>). This is consistent with the enhanced AMPAR/NMDAR ratio in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> hippocampus, since perforated synapses are more enriched in AMPARs than in NMDARs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002595-Ganeshina1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0002595-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002595.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>DAP12 mutation induces an increased ratio of AMPAR vs. NMDAR currents in adult hippocampal slices, whereas DAP12 is expressed only by microglia around birth.</title><p>(A) Ratio of AMPAR vs. NMDAR currents in hippocampal slices.

DAP12 mutation impacts glutamatergic transmission in the adult, but we previously demonstrated that it ceases to be expressed in the hippocampus at this age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002595-Roumier1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. To solve this paradox, we examined more precisely the expression pattern of DAP12 in developing hippocampus of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g001">Fig 1B</xref>). At E17, microglia were sparse and mostly ameboid. A majority displayed DAP12 immunoreactivity, albeit at low level. At P0, the density of microglia increased, and most displayed a bright immunostaining for DAP12. Between P0 and P3, the microglia became ramified and the fraction of DAP12-expressing microglia decreased. At P7, microglia were mostly ramified, and few DAP12-positive microglia were detected. Given that DAP12 is mainly expressed before P3 and that glutamatergic synapses are generated post-natally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002595-Steward1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, we hypothesized that microglial dysfunction induced by DAP12 mutation has impacted the prenatal development of neurons with delayed consequences on synaptic function. To test this hypothesis, we cultured neurons from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> and WT littermate P0 pups in the presence of AraC, so as to eliminate microglia. Neurons were grown for at least two weeks in culture to allow maturation of glutamatergic synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002595-Rao1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. At that point, neuronal cultures were more than 99&#x00025; pure (supplementary data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002595.s002">Fig S2</xref>). Fluorometric calcium imaging was used to monitor neuronal activity. Since spontaneous activity was moderate in hippocampal cultures, all recordings were performed in the presence of the potassium channel blocker 4AP (50 &#x000b5;M) to increase the global network activity. Under these conditions, neurons cultured from WT and DAP12<sup>KI</sup> P0 displayed similar activity (coefficient of variation of calcium fluctuation in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> cultures: 115&#x000b1;4&#x00025; of WT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Yet, in the presence of 6-cyano-7 nitroquinoxline-2 (CNQX), an AMPAR antagonist, neuronal activity was significantly lower in neurons cultured from mutant as compared with WT littermates (coefficient of variation of calcium fluctuations in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> cultures: 66&#x000b1;2&#x00025; of WT; n&#x0003e;600; p&#x0003c;0,0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These results are consistent with the enhanced AMPAR/NMDAR currents ratio observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. They indicate that the contribution of AMPARs to neuronal activity is increased in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> neurons cultured in the absence of microglia. This increased contribution of AMPAR may possibly reflect an increased proportion of excitatory synapses containing AMPA receptors. To test this, glutamatergic synapses and AMPAR were identified by vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGlut1) and by GluR1 immunoreactivities, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g002">Fig 2C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g002">Figure 2D</xref> shows that the proportion of excitatory synapses colocalized with GluR1-positive puncta was significantly increased in cultures from mutant pups as compared with WT pups (n&#x0003e;160; p&#x0003c;0.0001). In conclusion, neurons from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> P0 pups cultured in the absence of microglia exhibit an enhanced relative contribution of AMPAR to excitatory transmission, which is compatible with the synaptic phenotype observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.

We did not observe this decrease in our present analysis of hippocampal cultures and hippocampal synapses morphology. This apparent discrepancy probably results from the fact that in order to get an adequate amount of material, the prior PSD analysis had been performed on whole cortex extracts, and this may have occluded subtle modifications of synaptic AMPARs restricted to the more specific regions under investigation in our current study. Moreover, recent reports in the literature have demonstrated that switching synaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs with those containing NR2A, dramatically reduces LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002595-Barria1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, the enhanced LTP previously observed in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> hippocampus may be the consequence of the modifications of NMDARs. In order to get an insight into the mechanism linking DAP12 loss-of-function and neuronal phenotype, we characterized the microglial alterations induced by the mutation. We showed that DAP12<sup>KI</sup> microglia cultured from P0 pups express higher levels of inflammatory markers such as NOS-2, IL1&#x003b2;, and IL6, as compared with their WT counterparts. The inflammatory status of DAP12<sup>KI</sup> was further confirmed by the detection of a transient microgliosis in new-born, but not in adult mice brains.

This demonstrates that prenatal inflammation suffices to alter synaptic function. However, this does not exclude the possibility that prenatal inflammation also has long-lasting effects on tissue and secondarily impacts neuronal or synaptic dysfunction.

At 15 DIV, we counted 350 cells without finding any microglia, indicating that the percentage of microglial cells was less than 0,3&#x00025;. C: RT-PCR on neuronal (2, 8 or 13 days-old), astrocytic (&#x0201c;Astro.&#x0201d;) or microglial (&#x0201c;Mg.&#x0201d;) cultures. &#x0201c;-RT&#x0201d;: template without reverse-transcriptase. Each PCR was performed on cDNA corresponding to 3 ng of ARN. 30 cycles were used to amplify the cDNA of: NR1 (NMDAR1, neuronal marker), GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein, astrocytic marker), Iba1 (ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1, microglial marker). GFAP is barely detected in 8 and 13 days-old neuronal cultures, whereas it is detected in 2 days-old neuronal and in astrocytic cultures (positive control). Iba1 is not detected in neuronal cultures, but is expressed in the microglial culture (positive control).</p><p>(0.79 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002595.s002.tif" mimetype="image"
