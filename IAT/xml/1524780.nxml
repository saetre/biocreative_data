Gravitational effects on biological events and functions, including the mechanism of gravity sensation in cells, remain unclear. Previous spaceflight experiments have reported the irregular formation of cytoskeletal fibers in spaceflown experimental cells. Lewis <italic>et al</italic>. observed that the microtubule filaments extended from a poorly defined centrosome in human lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Gruener and Hughes-Fulford reported that actin reorganization responded to the gravity level and showed abnormal assembly of actin stress fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the field of space biology, to examine the effects of microgravity on biological events in ground-based research, clinostat is often used to simulate the microgravity condition. A three-dimensional (3D) clinostat is an apparatus that nullifies the effect of gravity, and it has been used in substitution studies on microgravity effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

The activation of Rho is catalyzed by the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and activated Rho proteins subsequently induce the formation of actin stress fibers in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) is one of the RhoA-selective RhoGEFs that are directly regulated by activated G<sub>&#x003b1;12/13 </sub>proteins and play a key role in oncogenic transformation induced by G protein-coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we found that the activation of the small GTPase Rho was influenced by the simulated microgravity generated by the 3D clinostat.

We determined whether the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is observed in the bovine brain microvascular endothelial (BBME) cells cultured in the simulated microgravity condition. We first observed the F-actin filament by rhodamine-phalloidin staining. BBME cells are adherent cells and normally show actin stress fibers (red) under the stationary condition as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. After exposure to clinorotation for 72 h, the cores of the actin filaments formed clusters, which are indicated by arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, and stress fibers were distinctly observed in the control cells. Paxillins (green), which are cytoskeletal proteins involved in actin-membrane attachment, were also observed more distinctly in the control cells than in the clinorotated cells. These observations clearly indicated that clinorotation caused the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of altered gravity on actin stress fiber formation in BBME cells</bold>.

BBME cells were cultured as described in the Methods section. After 72 h, the cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and anti-paxillin antibody in combination with Alexa Fluor 488 to detect the actin stress fibers and paxillins, respectively.

RT-PCR was performed using the total RNA isolated from the clinorotated and stationary control cells as templates and all the 60 primer sets listed in the additional files (see Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, a total of 60 PCRs were run, and each contained a different combination of 5' and 3' primers. From the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis images, we identified 62 DNA segments that showed different expression levels under clinorotation (data not shown). The DNA sequences of some segments could be determined, and homology searches were performed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program from the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), Shizuoka. Although the function of the identified segments was unknown, two segments showed high homology to human RhoGEF or the activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule.</p><p>One of the segments that showed differential expression levels in the mRNA fingerprinting demonstrated substantial similarity to the 3' region of human LARG mRNA, which is one of the RhoGEFs. We performed several cloning experiments to obtain longer cDNAs corresponding to this segment. Full-length bovine LARG cDNA, including the open reading frame (ORF), was obtained using the RT-PCR, 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and 3' RACE methods. The resulting assembled cDNA comprised 8,364 nucleotides including a 4,635-bp ORF corresponding to a predicted 1,544 amino acid (aa) polypeptide similar to that of human LARG. The predicted protein showed the greatest similarity to human and mouse LARG proteins (92.3% and 89.4% aa identity, respectively). The molecular weight of the protein was estimated as 172.7 kDa; this is the same as that of the human and mouse LARG proteins. Therefore, we concluded that this protein was bovine LARG. The alignments of the bovine, human, and mouse protein sequences are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> (the nucleotide sequence of bovine LARG cDNA will appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database [DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB188499">AB188499</ext-link>]). No other protein sequence in GenBank, except the bovine LARG and translated bovine LARG expressed sequence tags, showed a higher similarity to the human and mouse LARG proteins. These facts strongly indicate that the cloned bovine LARG cDNA corresponds to a bonafide bovine orthologue of the human gene. Motif analysis of the bovine LARG protein sequence revealed the presence of four conserved functional domains, namely, the closely juxtaposed Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, the PDZ domain and the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain. As expected, the PDZ and PH domains of the bovine, human, and mouse proteins are highly conserved, and they showed the highest degree of sequence conservation. The PDZ domains of these proteins are identical, whereas the PH domains differ by a single conservative amino acid substitution. It is important to note the remarkably high degree of conservation of the entire N-terminal part of the LARG protein encompassing the PDZ domain. Within the first 265 amino acid residues, substitutions were observed in several amino acids, indicating an overall identity of 98%. In comparison, the regions between the PDZ and RGS domains and the RGS and DH domains as well as the entire C-terminal domains are substantially more variable. For example, the region between the PH domain and the C terminal of bovine LARG has an aa identity of 84.5% and 79.9% with those of human and mouse LARG, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence alignment of the bovine, human, and mouse LARG proteins</bold>.

The microgravity environment has been reported to cause reduction in the secretion of growth hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], blunting of the response to mitogen activation in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], retardation of osteoblast growth, and disorganization of cytoskeletal formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Cytoskeletal formation is highly sensitive to alteration in gravity. It was reported that in cells, the actin microfilament system constitutes the gravity-sensitive cell component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and that microgravity affects cytoskeletal formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This disorganization is caused by differences in the gravity level between the space (microgravity) and ground (1G) environments. In ground-based studies, a 3D clinostat is commonly used to simulate microgravity conditions. It has been reported that the results obtained using clinorotation were similar to those obtained in spaceflight experiments, suggesting that clinorotation is effective in simulating microgravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which the gravity signal is converted to an intercellular signal is unclear.</p><p>It is well known that the small G proteins of the Rho family regulate the remodeling of actin fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the influence of microgravity on the Rho signaling pathway caused the disorganization of actin, and we examined the differences in gene expression between the static and clinorotated cells by using the mRNA fingerprinting method. We found that several gene fragments responded to the altered gravity. Subsequently, we identified a part of the LARG fragment that was downregulated under clinorotation. The <italic>LARG </italic>gene has been identified in some vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]; however, this is the first study that has identified the entire bovine <italic>LARG </italic>gene. Motif analysis of the bovine LARG protein sequence demonstrated the presence of four conserved functional domains &#x02013; the DH, PH, PDZ, and RGS domains. These four domains displayed a high degree of sequence conservation in the bovine and human/mouse proteins.</p><p>Our western blotting result showed that the total amount of Rho protein increased in the clinorotated cells, although the disorganization of actin fibers was observed. These results indicated that clinorotation affects not only Rho expression but also Rho activation. The real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting results demonstrated that the LARG expression significantly decreased in the clinorotated cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In mammalian cells, three RhoGEFs, namely, LARG, p115-RhoGEF, and PDZ-RhoGEF have been identified as RhoA-selective RhoGEFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These RhoGEFs have close homologs and contain a regulator of G protein homology domains. In our results, the level of the LARG proteins showed a milder decrease (87.8% of the level in the stationary control) than that of active RhoA (60.2% of the normal level). We suspected downregulated expression of not only the LARG proteins but also the other RhoGEFs. In consequence, the downregulation of these RhoGEFs does not induce Rho activation and subsequently results in the disorganization of the actin fibers under simulated microgravity.</p><p>We demonstrated that clinorotation induces the inactivation of Rho; however, the manner in which LARG transcription is downregulated under simulated microgravity has yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, we assumed that changes in the level of gravity also affect the upstream regulation of Rho, such as that via the heterotrimeric G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], or the downstream regulation of Rho via Rho effectors such as p160ROCK (Rho kinase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Recently, it has been pointed out that numerous cytoskeletal and signaling molecules mediate the interaction between actin and the focal adhesion molecules involved in mechanosensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In order to identify the exact molecule that converts the gravity signal into the intercellular signal, it is necessary that the upstream and downstream regulation of Rho signaling, including regulation via heterotrimeric G proteins, RhoGEFs, and Rho effectors such as Rho kinase, be the focus of future investigations.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed regulation of Rho signaling</bold>. The Rho signaling pathway may play an important role in the mechanism of gravity sensation in cells. Our results indicate that the gene expression of RhoGEF (LARG) is downregulated under simulated microgravity. As a result of the downregulation, the activation level of Rho becomes lower and the actin fibers are subsequently disorganized. The upstream and/or downstream regulation of Rho signaling may be involved in the process that converts the gravity signal into the intercellular signal.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-7-19-6"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We concluded that the simulated microgravity generated by clinorotation affected Rho activation, particularly, the <italic>LARG </italic>gene expression, and this effect resulted in the disorganization of the actin fibers.

The whole cell lysate from the cells was prepared using a lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 1% NP-40; 1 mM dithiothreitol; and 5% glycerol at 4&#x000b0;C. The whole cell extract was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 5&#x02013;10% gradient gel for LARG detection and 15% gel for RhoA and GAPDH detection) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) at 15 V for 60 min at room temperature. The membrane was blocked with 5% dry fat milk and incubated subsequently with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 with a 1:100 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody (26C4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), a 1:100 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-LARG antibody (H70; Santa Cruz), and a mouse monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAPDH) antibody (Imgenex, San Diego, CA). Immunocomplexes were visualized using an ECL Plus chemiluminescence kit (Amersham). Signals were densitometrically quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Rho GTPase activity assay</title><p>Active RhoA was measured using a G-LISA RhoA activation assay biochem kit (luminnometric assay; Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
