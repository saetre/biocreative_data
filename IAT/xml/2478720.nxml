Glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD) is an enzyme central to the glutamate and energy metabolism of the cell. In addition to the single, GLUD-encoding gene present in all mammals (<italic>GLUD1</italic>), humans and apes acquired a second <italic>GLUD</italic> gene (<italic>GLUD2</italic>) through retroduplication of <italic>GLUD1</italic>, which codes for an enzyme with unique, potentially brain-adapted properties. Here we show that whereas the GLUD1 parental protein localizes to mitochondria and the cytoplasm, GLUD2 is specifically targeted to mitochondria. Using evolutionary analysis and resurrected ancestral protein variants, we demonstrate that the enhanced mitochondrial targeting specificity of GLUD2 is due to a single positively selected glutamic acid-to-lysine substitution, which was fixed in the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of GLUD2 soon after the duplication event in the hominoid ancestor &#x0223c;18&#x02013;25 million years ago. This MTS substitution arose in parallel with two crucial adaptive amino acid changes in the enzyme and likely contributed to the functional adaptation of GLUD2 to the glutamate metabolism of the hominoid brain and other tissues. We suggest that rapid, selectively driven subcellular adaptation, as exemplified by GLUD2, represents a common route underlying the emergence of new gene functions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Little is known about the functional evolution of new hominoid genes. In this study, we utilized a combination of evolutionary analyses and cell biology experiments to unveil a novel mode by which the human- and ape-specific glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme (GLUD2) functionally adapted. We find that whereas the GLUD1 parental protein (present in all mammals) localizes to mitochondria and also to the cytoplasm, GLUD2 is specifically targeted to mitochondria. Using resurrected ancestral proteins and site-directed mutagenesis, we show that the optimized mitochondrial targeting capacity of GLUD2 is due to a single positively selected amino acid substitution in its N-terminal targeting sequence, which occurred soon after the duplication event in the ape ancestor 18&#x02013;25 million years ago. The specialization in mitochondrial localization is probably linked to the function of GLUD2 in the glutamate metabolism of the brain (recycling of glutamate in astrocytes), but is likely also of functional relevance in other tissues in which GLUD2 is expressed. We suggest that in addition to the traditionally considered modes of functional adaptation (changes in gene expression and/or the biochemical function of the protein), rapid and selectively driven subcellular adaptation to specific ancestral compartments may represent a common yet previously little-considered mechanism for the origin of new gene functions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The process of gene duplication is the major mechanism underlying the origin of new gene functions and has thus significantly contributed to the emergence of adaptive evolutionary novelties during evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Li1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Lynch1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

A small number of functional ape-specific duplicates created by these mechanisms have been identified (e.g. refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Marques1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Yu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>).

It is encoded by the intronless <italic>GLUD2</italic> gene, which emerged via the reverse transcription of a messenger RNA from its parental gene <italic>GLUD1</italic> in the hominoid ancestor 18&#x02013;25 million years ago (Mya) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Burki1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

We show that whereas GLUD1 localizes to the mitochondria as well as the cytoplasm, GLUD2 is specifically targeted to mitochondria, due to a single key amino acid substitution in its signal peptide, which emerged in the common hominoid ancestor and appears to have been fixed under the influence of positive selection. The enhanced mitochondrial targeting capacity of GLUD2 probably reflects further selectively driven optimization of this enzyme to the glutamate/energy metabolism of the brain and other tissues. More generally, the evolution of GLUD2 represents a remarkable example of rapid, selectively driven subcellular adaptation and thus reveals a novel mode for the functional adaptation of new duplicate genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Positive Selection in the Targeting Sequence of GLUD2</title><p>We previously identified selectively driven substitutions in the mature GLUD2 protein that led to altered enzymatic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Burki1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

To this end, we traced the evolutionary history of the full-length <italic>GLUD2</italic> coding sequence (including the MTS-encoding sequence), focusing on the first two internal branches after the duplication event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

We thus hypothesized that GLUD2 might have functionally adapted by evolving altered subcellular targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>GLUD2 Is Specifically Targeted to Mitochondria</title><p>To explore this hypothesis, we first used an <italic>in silico</italic> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Small1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) to predict subcellular localization of reconstructed ancestral GLUD2 MTS variants, representing sequences before (sequence upon duplication event, node A) and after (great ape ancestor, node C) the period of positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, this analysis suggested a substantially higher mitochondrial targeting probability for the node C targeting sequence (0.92) than for that of node A (0.28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To experimentally test these predictions, we synthesized the reconstructed MTSs for the node A and node C variants and fused them to a fluorescent (GFP) reporter. As GLUD2 is thought to have particularly adapted to a function in degrading neurotransmitter glutamate in astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Plaitakis1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Kanavouras1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, we transfected a human astrocyte-derived cell line (LN229, glioblastoma) with a vector encoding these recombinant proteins. These experiments revealed a striking pattern. We found that the node A MTS-GFP fusion protein localized to mitochondria, as expected, but that it could also be detected in the cytoplasm in most cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1B, 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000150.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, the node C MTS protein localized specifically to mitochondria in the vast majority of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1C, 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000150.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, consistent with the <italic>in silico</italic> predictions, our experimental analysis strongly suggests that the MTS of GLUD2 evolved the capacity to more specifically target the GLUD2 enzyme to mitochondria during the period of positive selection.</p><p>Further localization experiments showed that&#x02014;similarly to the node A protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1B, 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000150.s001">Figure S1</xref>)&#x02014;the human GLUD1 MTS-GFP fusion protein generally localizes to both mitochondria and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000150.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This suggests that GLUD1 preserved the ancestral localization pattern since the time of the duplication event (node A), which is consistent with the paucity of amino acid substitutions during GLUD1 evolution and its low mitochondrial targeting prediction value (0.30, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>These experiments also showed that the human GLUD2 MTS retained the increased mitochondrial targeting capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000150.s001">Figure S1</xref>), in agreement with the high mitochondrial localization probability (0.92) estimated <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the enhanced mitochondrial targeting specificity of the GLUD2 MTS was preserved after the period of positive selection on the lineage leading to humans. We obtained similar results for two other cell lines (human HeLa cells and COS7 from African green monkeys), further supporting the notion of a subcellular targeting shift of GLUD2 during its early evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000150.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>To more precisely date the shift of the GLUD2 targeting specificity, we assessed the subcellular localization of GLUD2 from the last common hominoid ancestor (node B). We found that the resurrected node B protein localized specifically to mitochondria in the majority of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000150.s001">Figure S1</xref>), consistent with the high mitochondrial prediction value (0.91, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

The E7K and D25H substitutions introduce additional positively charged amino acids at one side of the &#x003b1;-helix within a previously weakly positively charged patch. Opposite to this charged patch, an ancestral patch with hydrophobic amino acids is found, which has remained largely unchanged during the evolution of GLUD2. Thus, the two positively selected substitutions are predicted to promote the formation of an amphipathic helix, which may function as an optimized MTS.</p><p>Consistently, changing these residues in the different GLUD sequences alters the <italic>in silico</italic> predictions of the GLUD mitochondrial targeting capacities. In particular, the E7K substitution dramatically alters these predictions. For example, introducing this substitution into the human GLUD1 sequence leads to an increase of the mitochondrial targeting probability from 30&#x00025; to 90&#x00025;, whereas the D25H substitution increases the GLUD1 wild type value to only 35&#x00025;. The predominant effect of E7K is expected, given that this substitution represents the more radical substitution, as it replaces a negatively charged residue with a fully positively charged amino acid (see above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the E7K substitution was the key contributor to the evolution of optimized mitochondrial targeting of GLUD2.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we introduced the E7K substitution into the MTS of human GLUD1 using site-directed mutagenesis. Remarkably, the mutant GLUD1<sup>E7K</sup> MTS shows a dramatic increase in mitochondrial localization capacity relative to the wild type variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g004">Figure 4</xref>), which is indistinguishable from those observed for extant or ancestral GLUD2 variants from node B and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000150-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000150.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

GLUD2 evolved its unique enzymatic properties soon after the duplication event in the common hominoid ancestor (&#x0223c;18&#x02013;25 Mya), on the basis of two positively selected amino acid substitutions in the mature protein (see introductory paragraph and refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Burki1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Plaitakis1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Kanavouras1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Here we have identified an additional mechanism through which GLUD2 appears to have functionally adapted. We show that GLUD2 evolved an enhanced mitochondrial targeting specificity, mainly by virtue of a single amino acid change in its MTS, which also appeared during the period of positive selection in the common hominoid ancestor. Thus, while its parental protein GLUD1 localizes to mitochondria (as previously reported, ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Mastorodemos1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>) but also to the cytoplasm, the subcellular localization of GLUD2 is largely restricted to mitochondria.</p><p>What was the selective benefit of the enhanced mitochondrial targeting capacity of GLUD2? We propose two&#x02014;not mutually exclusive&#x02014;scenarios that may explain this observation. First, in addition to its mitochondrial function, <italic>GLUD1</italic>-encoded GDH may have an&#x02013;as yet&#x02013;unknown function in the cytoplasm, akin to other mitochondrial enzymes (e.g., fumarase, ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Soltys1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>). Due to the changes in its targeting sequence upon the retroduplication event, the ape-specific GLUD2 protein evolved a specific function in one of these ancestral compartments&#x02013;the mitochondrion. This subcellular adaptation might have been particularly relevant with respect to the presumed function of GLUD2 in astrocytes (see above), where it is thought to be involved in the degradation/metabolism of neurotransmitter glutamate&#x02014;a process taking place in mitochondria. We note, however, that recent work revealed that <italic>GLUD2</italic> (similarly to <italic>GLUD1</italic>) is transcribed in many or most human tissues (Bryk et al., unpublished). This finding is in contrast to a previous study, which suggested that <italic>GLUD2</italic> is rather specifically expressed in brain, retina, and testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Shashidharan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, the subcellular adaptation of GLUD2 is likely of functional significance for hominoid tissues in general.</p><p>A second possibility that might explain the more specific mitochondrial targeting of GLUD2 involves the rather large variability of mitochondrial membrane potentials, which depend on the tissue and cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Scheffler1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Berger1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. While mitochondria in tissues such as heart and muscle have high membrane potentials (i.e., they are more negatively charged inside the mitochondrial matrix than mitochondria in cells from other tissues), glial cells&#x02014;such as astrocytes&#x02014;have lower membrane potentials. Thus, GLUD2 may have evolved a more positively charged targeting sequence to compensate for the low membrane potential of mitochondria in astrocytes, thus ensuring efficient import of <italic>GLUD2</italic>-encoded GDH into mitochondria in these glial brain cells.</p><p>Further work is required to more precisely understand the physiological implications of the enhanced mitochondrial localization specificity of this recently emerged hominoid protein. In any event, our results suggest that the shift in subcellular targeting specificity of GLUD2 was beneficial to the evolution of the glutamate/energy metabolism of the hominoid brain and/or other tissues, as it appears to have been driven by positive selection.</p><p>More generally, our study provides a remarkable example of a novel mode for the origin of new gene functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-ByunMcKay1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Marques2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

We thus suggest that in addition to changes in gene expression and/or the biochemical function of the protein, rapid and selectively driven subcellular adaptation (by either neo- or sublocalization) is likely to represent a common mechanism underlying the emergence of new gene function.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Evolutionary Analysis</title><p>The phylogenetic tree of the <italic>GLUD1/GLUD2</italic> sequences coding for the mitochondrial targeting peptide was based on the known <italic>GLUD</italic> topology (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Burki1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, which also corresponds the commonly accepted hominoid species phylogeny). <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> ratios and the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes in the phylogenetic tree were estimated using the codeml free-ratio model as implemented in the PAML4 package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000150-Yang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.
