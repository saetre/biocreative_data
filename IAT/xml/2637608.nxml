NKG2D contributes to anti-tumour and anti-viral immune responses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The ligands for NKG2D in humans are diverse proteins of the MIC and ULBP/RAET families that are upregulated on the surface of virally infected cells and tumours.

We show that both transcripts are frequently expressed in cell lines derived from epithelial cancers, and in primary breast cancers. The full-length transcript, RAET1G1, is predicted to encode a molecule with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains that are unique amongst NKG2D ligands. Using specific anti-RAET1G1 antiserum to stain tissue microarrays we show that RAET1G1 expression is highly restricted in normal tissues. RAET1G1 was expressed at a low level in normal gastrointestinal epithelial cells in a similar pattern to MICA. Both RAET1G1 and MICA showed increased expression in the gut of patients with celiac disease. In contrast to healthy tissues the RAET1G1 antiserum stained a wide variety or different primary tumour sections. Both endogenously expressed and transfected RAET1G1 was mainly found inside the cell, with a minority of the protein reaching the cell surface. Conversely the truncated splicing variant of RAET1G2 was shown to encode a soluble molecule that could be secreted from cells. Secreted RAET1G2 was shown to downregulate NKG2D receptor expression on NK cells and hence may represent a novel tumour immune evasion strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We demonstrate that the expression patterns of ULBP5RAET1G are very similar to the well-characterised NKG2D ligand, MICA. However the two isoforms of ULBP5/RAET1G have very different cellular localisations that are likely to reflect unique functionality.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The activating immunoreceptor NKG2D has been established as an important component of the innate immune system.

According to the paradigm of NKG2D mediated immune recognition, ligands for the receptor are expressed on cells subject to stress, for example cells infected with viruses such as HCMV, or during tumourigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Lodoen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Coudert1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The importance of NKG2D in viral infection is evidenced by the fact that both human and murine cytomegalovirus encode immune evasion molecules designed to prevent cell surface expression of NKG2D ligands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Lodoen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>NKG2D ligands are widely expressed on cancer cells. Activation of DNA damage pathways during tumour development has been reported to be a central mechanism leading to NKG2D ligand expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Gasser1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. There is evidence that NKG2D participates in a process of immunosurveillance for cancer. In mice, the ectopic expression of NKG2D ligands mediates immune responses to transplanted tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Cerwenka1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Diefenbach1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Neutralising NKG2D with antibodies decreases host protection to experimentally induced tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Smyth1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and an NKG2D knockout mouse showed an increased susceptibility to some model cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Guerra1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore it is proposed that in order to progress, cancers must evade NKG2D mediated immune responses. One evasion mechanism may be the production of TGF-&#x003b2; by tumours, which downregulates NKG2D expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Lee1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Castriconi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Intriguingly NKG2D ligands possess markedly different domain structures. ULBP1-3 molecules are GPI anchored to the cell surface, whilst MICA/B, ULBP4/RAET1E, and ULBP5/RAET1G have transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of variable length and sequence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Cosman1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Chalupny1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Bacon1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Bahram2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. NKG2D ligands are also capable of being expressed independently of each other<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Cosman1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Pende1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Eagle2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that NKG2D ligands may not all be functionally equivalent. The predominant driver of NKG2D ligand diversity is proposed to be an immunological arms race with viruses, which have in turn acquired a varied array of immunoevasin molecules that prevent NKG2D ligands being expressed at the cell surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Eagle1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However this is not the whole story. NKG2D ligands have clearly evolved other unique properties that do not relate to their susceptibility to viral immunoevasins. One example is MICA, which possesses motifs that allow it to be targeted to specific membranes in specialised epithelial cell layers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Suemizu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore it is essential to examine the expression profile and properties of individual MIC and ULBP/RAET molecules to get a fuller understanding of NKG2D function.</p><p>Two alternative transcripts of ULBP5/RAET1G have previously been identified (named RAET1G1 and RAET1G2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Bacon1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Radosavljevic1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Sections were dewaxed, pre-treated with mild cell conditioner 1 (Tris borate/EDTA, pH 8.0) then incubated in the rabbit anti RAET1G antibody at 10 &#x000b5;g/ml for 20 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Staining was optimised by staining with a range of antibody concentrations 10 &#x000b5;g/ml was selected as the optimum concentration. For detection an avidin/biotin block preceded application of biotinylated goat anti rabbit (DakoCytomation code E0432) diluted 1/100 for 8 min at 37&#x000b0;C. The biotinylated antibody was then detected using a streptavidin/biotin/peroxidase kit (Ventana, DAB MAP&#x02122;, code 760-124). The protocol was completed by automated haematoxylin counterstaining followed by manual dehydration clearing and mounting in resinous mountant. Controls were included within each immunohistochemical runs. Anti lysozyme and vimentin antibodies were used as positive controls to verify the antigenic preservation of the tissue cores. These controls provided positive staining in all tissue cores. To establish if any staining present in the tissues was due to non-specific interaction of the detection reagents slides were also processed without the RAET1G antibody. No tissue staining was observed in these preparations. Images of the stained tissue microarray cores were automatically captured using an Ariol SL-50 automated image capture and system (Applied Imaging Inc) using a &#x000d7;20 objective.

With this reagent we observed downregulation of NKG2D with 100 ng/ml protein after 24 hours incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004503-g008">Figure 8E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>NKG2D ligands display considerable diversity in domain structure, and can be expressed independently from each other in cell lines. They are therefore highly unlikely to play functionally identical roles in human disease processes. In order to understand the implications of NKG2D ligand diversity it is necessary to investigate differences, and similarities, in the properties of individual MICA and ULBP/RAET molecules. Here we present the first in depth characterisation of RAET1G1 and RAET1G2.</p><p>A systematic search for RAET1G1 protein expression revealed that it has a very restricted expression pattern in healthy tissues. The most striking finding was a staining pattern in the colon and intestinal epithelium similar to that of MICA. Others have previously shown that in the normal gut MICA is found largely inside the cell, however increased expression and/or redistribution of protein to the cell surface may occur in autoimmune conditions such as CD and Crohn's disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Hue1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Tieng1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Allez1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Once at the cell surface MICA can facilitate NKG2D mediated recognition of the gut epithelium and could be a factor in triggering autoimmune attack. Upregulation of cell surface MICA on epithelial cells has been described on binding of a pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> protein, AfaE, to CD55<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Tieng1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. TLR3 signalling has also been shown to induce expression of the mouse NKG2D ligand RAE-1 in the intestinal epithelium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Zhou1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore it is suggested that changes in gut flora may be a trigger for inducing cell surface expression of NKG2D ligands on gut epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Tieng1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Zhou1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been shown that some MICA expressing melanoma cell lines do not necessarily express significant levels of MICA at the cell surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Fuertes1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation was interpreted as an immune evasion strategy by the cancer, which had switched on a mechanism to retain MICA inside the cell.</p><p>Our data show an apparent intracellular staining of RAET1G1 in gut epithelial cells. This distribution was confirmed with a GFP-RAET1G1 fusion protein that was largely intracellularly distributed in the ER and golgi, with only a minority of the protein at the cell surface. It is possible that RAET1G1 could have an as yet undefined function inside the cell. Alternatively it is possible that stimuli exist that can trigger its mobilisation to the cell surface.</p><p>RAET1G1 expression was widespread in a range of different epithelial tumour types and is therefore a novel tumour marker. In order to evade immune recognition via NKG2D it has been proposed that tumours release soluble NKG2D ligands from the cell surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Groh3">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This has the effect of downregulating receptor expression, rather than simply blocking receptor binding to cellular ligand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Groh3">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of MICA and ULBP2 the mechanism for shedding of protein from the cell surface is thought to involve proteolytic cleavage by metalloproteinases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Salih1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Waldhauer1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. A truncated splicing variant of RAET1G, termed RAET1G2, was widely expressed in primary breast cancer, was secreted from cells, and can downregulate NKG2D expression. This finding has been confirmed in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Cao1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed a soluble, secreted splicing variant of RAET1E has also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004503-Cao2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> Therefore expression of soluble isoforms of RAET1G and RAET1E could allow cancer cells to produce soluble NKG2D ligand without the need for metalloproteinase activity. Demonstrating the presence of soluble RAET1G2 protein in cancer patients is the obvious next step, however it will be technically challenging to produce specific antibodies as RAET1G2 is 95&#x00025; identical to the ULBP2 molecule. In addition RAET1G has a highly similar promoter to ULBP2 and in all 20 cell lines screened in this study RAET1G splicing variants and ULBP2 were co-expressed (data not shown).</p><p>Examination of RAET1G1 and RAET1G2 expression in clinically defined sample sets of different cancers will be crucial to assess the diagnostic/prognostic potential of the molecules. RAET1G also represents a potential avenue for cancer therapy, for example by inducing its expression on NKG2D ligand negative tumours or as a target for anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Cherie Blenkiron, Carlos Caldas, and Paul Lehner for kind gifts of reagents.
