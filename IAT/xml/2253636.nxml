The mechanism of TCR signal initiation, or triggering, remains unclear. An interesting aspect of this puzzle is that although soluble agonist pMHCs cannot trigger TCR even at high concentrations, the same ligands trigger TCR very efficiently on the surface of APCs. Here, using lipid bilayers or plastic-based artificial APCs with defined components, we identify the critical APC-associated factors that confer agonist pMHCs with such potency. We found that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are triggered by very low numbers of monomeric agonist pMHCs anchored on fluid lipid bilayers or fixed plastic surfaces, in the absence of any other APC surface molecules. Importantly, on bilayers, plastic surfaces, or real APCs, endogenous pMHCs did not enhance TCR triggering. TCR triggering, however, critically depended upon the adhesiveness of the surface and an intact T cell actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we propose the receptor deformation model of TCR triggering to explain the remarkable sensitivity and specificity of TCR triggering.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Using the T cell receptor (TCR) as a sensor, T cells of the immune system constantly migrate in lymphoid organs and probe the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for foreign antigens, a sign of pathogen infection. Antigen binding by TCRs leads to T cell activation and subsequent immune response to combat the pathogens. Interestingly, although T cells respond well to antigens on APCs, they do not recognize the same antigens in solution. What is it that makes antigens on APCs recognizable? To address this, we used lipid bilayers and plastic surfaces to construct artificial APCs with defined antigen number, composition, and configuration. We found that T cells respond to very few individual foreign antigens on artificial APCs, and contrary to some current opinion, formation of antigen clusters on APCs is not required for antigen recognition by T cells. TCR triggering, however, requires T cell adhesion to the APC surface and then occurs only if the T cells are able to move. We propose that at the dynamic T cell&#x02013;APC interface, antigen on APCs activates T cells by applying force to the TCR and deforming its structure, which cannot be achieved by soluble antigens due to their lack of anchorage.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Why is it that T cells are blind to antigens in solution but highly sensitive to antigens anchored on a surface?

Engagement of TCRs by agonist pMHCs initiates a signal, which is transmitted to the nucleus via kinase cascades and protein translocation, leading, ultimately, to T cell activation. In clear contrast to advances in our understanding of intracellular TCR signaling pathways, the question of how binding of pMHC initiates or triggers TCR signaling remains unclear &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. This is despite knowledge gained from the study of triggering mechanisms of other receptor systems, for example, the conformational change of G protein-coupled receptors and the dimerization of growth factor receptors. The difficulty in resolving the mechanism of TCR triggering is attributed to the complexity of multichain TCR/CD3 structure, the diversity of peptides presented by MHCs on APCs, and importantly, the complex environment where pMHC-TCR interaction takes place.</p><p>One fundamental question still unanswered is the minimum requirements for TCR triggering. In terms of the pMHC ligand, a critical question is whether a monomeric agonist pMHC alone can trigger TCR independently, or whether it must act cooperatively with another neighboring pMHC, either agonist or endogenous, as a dimer to simultaneously engage, and in effect crosslink, two TCRs. In terms of the environment or the context of TCR triggering, critical questions are whether soluble agonist pMHCs are capable of triggering TCR or if they must be surface-anchored, whether molecules other than pMHCs on APCs, e.g., costimulatory molecules, contribute to TCR triggering, and whether and how physical and mechanical aspects of the T cell&#x02013;APC interaction play a role in TCR triggering. There are reports showing that TCR is no different from receptors for soluble ligands, e.g., hormone receptors, and that soluble monomeric pMHCs are sufficient to trigger TCR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. These data suggested that TCR must be triggered through either TCR conformational change or heterodimerization of TCR and CD4 or CD8 coreceptor via simultaneous pMHC binding. In these studies, however, binding of peptides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; or pMHC molecules to the surface of the cell or culture dish was difficult to rule out. Mechanistically, with one exception &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, rather extensive crystallography studies have not revealed global large-scale conformational changes of TCR after engagement of agonistic pMHCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. It is also uncertain whether coreceptors play a role in TCR triggering, since TCR triggering in vitro and in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; can occur in the complete absence of CD4 or CD8. Moreover, these studies are contradicted by data showing the total lack of TCR triggering capability of soluble agonist pMHCs in solution even at very high concentrations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. In sharp contrast, however, many studies have demonstrated the remarkable potency of a few agonist pMHCs on APCs to trigger TCR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. If TCR triggering by agonist pMHCs depends upon the context of the APC, then the question becomes what else at the interface of T cell&#x02013;APC interaction contributes to TCR triggering.</p><p>Based upon observations of T cell activation by antibody crosslinking, TCR crosslinking by agonist&#x02013;agonist pMHCs has been proposed as the mechanism of TCR triggering. This theory relies upon the presence of putative agonist&#x02013;agonist pMHCs on the APC surface, and is supported by observations that a significant fraction of MHCs on APCs are immobile &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;; thus, two agonist pMHC monomers could act as a dimer if they are immobilized close to each other. However, since TCR can be triggered by only a few agonist pMHCs amongst a huge number of endogenous pMHCs on the APC, the chance of agonist&#x02013;agonist pMHC formation should be very small. Getting around this issue is a recent theory that TCR is triggered by a &#x0201c;pseudodimer&#x0201d; of an agonist pMHC and an endogenous pMHC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, based upon data showing that some endogenous pMHCs enhance TCR triggering by agonist pMHCs. In addition to the possible contribution of endogenous pMHCs on APCs, van der Merwe and colleagues have postulated that the two-dimensional (2D) nature of the pMHC&#x02013;TCR interaction plays a critical role in triggering. The proposed kinetic-segregation model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b030">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d; suggests that TCR signal initiation is induced by segregation of small kinase-associating molecules and large phosphatase-associating molecules at the tight junction between a T cell and an APC, leading to a net increase in tyrosine kinase activity proximate to the TCR/CD3 complex. This model would obviate the need for receptor crosslinking and require only monomeric agonist pMHC.</p><p>With conflicting data and the multiple models proposed, it is clear that there is no consensus regarding the mechanism of TCR triggering. A solution to this puzzle would be aided by definition of the critical factors involved in the T cell&#x02013;APC interaction that directly contribute to TCR triggering by agonist pMHCs. Here, we test TCR triggering using artificial APCs consisting of fluid lipid bilayers or fixed plastic surfaces with defined components. We demonstrate that TCR can be triggered by a very low number (1&#x02013;10) of monomeric agonist pMHCs. TCR triggering is independent of endogenous pMHCs and of any other molecule found on real APC surfaces, but is critically dependent upon (1) surface-anchoring of pMHC, (2) T cell adhesion to the surface, and (3) intact actin cytoskeletal function. Based upon these data, and incorporating the impact of mechanical stress on pMHC-TCR binding kinetics, we propose the receptor deformation model of TCR triggering by monomeric pMHCs on a surface. In this model, TCR is triggered by TCR/CD3 conformational changes induced by a cytoskeletal pulling force, transferred via specific pMHC-TCR interactions with sufficient resistance to rupture under force.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Establishment of a Lipid Bilayer-Based Artificial APC System</title><p>To anchor pMHCs on a fluid surface, we developed a planar lipid bilayer-based artificial APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). This consisted of a glass-supported lipid bilayer anchored with pMHC and ICAM-1, via interactions between nitrilo triacetic acid-Ni (NTA-Ni) lipid head groups on the bilayer and 6&#x000d7; histidine (HisTag) at the membrane-proximal ends of the proteins. An initial consideration was that artificial pMHC dimers may be formed by monomers immobilized in close proximity on lipid bilayers with defects in fluidity or homogeneity. Avoidance of such de facto dimer formation was crucial for interpretation of our experimental data. To this end, a novel technique of lipid bilayer expansion was employed to achieve a higher level of large-scale lipid bilayer homogeneity and fluidity compared to previously reported methods. The newly expanded area of lipid bilayer showed excellent homogeneity and stability in buffer containing bovine serum albumin (BSA), with no defects visible by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). As expected, given its genesis by lipid translocation, the newly expanded lipid bilayer showed a high level of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of a spot of 4-&#x003bc;m radius, indicating a mobile fraction of close to 100&#x00025; and a calculated diffusion coefficient of approximately 0.8 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), in agreement with typical lipid diffusion rates in biological membranes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.

The difference in shape and range of the response curves to IEk on streptavidin versus ELISA plates is likely a result of their different surface properties (see Text S1).

We wished to determine whether the ability of APCs to activate T cells could be altered by replacing a major proportion of the original diverse endogenous peptide population with a peptide having putative enhancing or nonenhancing effects on TCR triggering. Murine B-cell lymphoma CH27 cells expressing IEk were incubated with biotinylated &#x003b2;2m peptides (&#x003b2;2m-bio), ER60 peptides (ER60-bio), or scrambled ER60 peptides (ER60scrbl-bio) at high concentrations for 20 h. To determine the degree of IEk occupancy by the biotinylated peptides, pulsed cells were stained with streptavidin-Cy5, and the fluorescence intensity was compared with CH27 cells stained with biotinylated anti-IEk monoclonal antibody, 14-4-4s (14-4-4s-bio), followed by streptavidin-Cy5. The peptides were biotinylated at the N-terminus, so each peptide bound to one streptavidin-Cy5. The number of streptavidin-Cy5 each 14-4-4s-bio antibody could bind was determined using a gel filtration chromatography-based assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060043-sg005">Figure S5</xref>), and the result was used to correct for differences in fluorescence intensity. Using this assay, we determined that &#x003b2;2m-bio, ER60-bio, or ER60scrbl-bio peptides occupied about 59&#x00025;, 17&#x00025;, or 3&#x00025;, respectively, of IEk molecules on the surface of CH27 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060043-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). The peptide binding was IEk-specific; only a very low level of binding was observed on the mutant murine B-cell lymphoma, M12.C3, which is deficient for MHC class II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060043-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). The CH27 cells were then briefly incubated with FITC-labeled MCC peptides (MCC-FITC) before adding to a T cell stimulation assay. MCC-FITC pulsing led to comparable FITC levels on CH27 cells prepulsed with &#x003b2;2m-bio, ER60-bio, or ER60scrbl-bio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), while maintaining relatively consistent IEk occupancy by biotinylated endogenous peptides (unpublished data).

If this were the case, then skewing the endogenous peptide population on the CH27 surface towards ER60 or &#x003b2;2m should significantly enhance or reduce, respectively, the chance of pseudodimer formation, and lead to different degrees of T cell activation upon stimulation by comparable levels of agonist MCC peptides. In contrast, in our hands, T cells stimulated with CH27 cells prepulsed with either ER60-bio or &#x003b2;2m-bio showed very similar IL2 production to cells prepulsed with the control ER60scrbl-bio peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), a peptide which did not significantly alter the original endogenous peptide makeup.

The inability of this bilayer to become a nonadhesive surface made it unsuitable for studies of the role of adhesion in TCR triggering.

Therefore, cytochalasin D treatment completely blunted T cell calcium responses to real or artificial APCs. To test whether actin cytoskeletal rearrangement is required for sustaining calcium flux that has already been initiated by real APCs, cytochalasin D was introduced after the calcium flux of untreated T cells reached peak levels. In agreement with a previous report &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, cytochalasin D quickly suppressed calcium flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g005">Figure 5</xref>E).

Intact actin cytoskeletal function is therefore required for TCR triggering by both artificial APCs and real APCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrate, using artificial APCs, that surface anchoring, adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton enable monomeric agonist pMHCs to trigger TCR with remarkable potency. T cells responded to an average of three and of 0.83 agonist pMHCs anchored on lipid bilayers and fixed plastic surfaces, respectively. Due to the nonaverage Poisson distribution of the ligands on the surfaces, the responding T cells might have contacted as many as seven and three agonist pMHCs, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060043-sd002">Text S2</xref>). Although it is possible that T cells may have responded to a larger number of agonist pMHCs on lipid bilayers due to their diffusion and accumulation underneath T cells over time, the general agreement between the required numbers of ligands on lipid bilayers and plastic surfaces suggests that TCR can be triggered by a very low number of agonist pMHCs anchored on fluid or fixed surfaces.</p><p>We believe that an alternative interpretation of our data, i.e., that TCR was triggered by agonist pMHC dimers, is unlikely for the following reasons. First, we took great caution in generating and purifying IEk-MCC proteins to minimize the existence of dimers in our protein preparation. The very low number of surface-anchored agonist pMHCs required for TCR triggering (&#x0003c;10 per cell) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g002">Figures 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g002">2</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g003">3</xref>A, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060043-sd002">Text S2</xref>) makes it highly unlikely that TCR was triggered by dimer contamination in the protein preparation, which certainly did not contain &#x0003e;10&#x00025; dimers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060043-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). Second, to exclude the possibility of &#x0201c;de facto&#x0201d; dimer formation by immobilization of two agonist pMHCs within close proximity by chance, we developed the lipid bilayer-based artificial APC system and went to great lengths to ensure the homogeneity and fluidity of the bilayer. Third, although dimers might, theoretically, form spontaneously between monomeric pMHCs diffusing freely on the bilayer, the necessary intrinsic affinity between MHC molecules is not supported by experimental evidence. Despite the availability of such highly sensitive techniques as surface plasmon resonance, no quantitative measurement of affinity between MHC molecules has been documented, suggesting that the affinity between MHC molecules is extremely low, if there is any. This is consistent with the fact that MHC-MHC dimers have not been observed in the vast majority of MHC crystallography studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b048">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. The possibility of such a scenario is further reduced by the presence of a large number of &#x0201c;diluting&#x0201d; endogenous or null pMHCs. The lack of affinity between MHC molecules may not be relevant, if TCRs exist as dimers on the T cell and &#x0201c;recruit&#x0201d; two pMHC monomers sequentially. Whether TCRs are present as dimers on the T cell surface, however, is highly controversial &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b053">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Even if TCRs were dimers, the fast dissociation rate of agonist pMHC-TCR binding under force (discussed below) would make it very difficult to successfully recruit the second agonist pMHC molecule, especially when the number of agonist pMHCs is low. Finally, the shape of the T cell dose response curve further supports the sufficiency of monomeric pMHC for triggering. T cells responded to increasing numbers of IEk-MCC on the bilayer or on fixed surfaces in a sublinear fashion, as opposed to a second order dependence (<italic>y</italic> &#x0003d; <italic>ax</italic><sup>2</sup>) that would have indicated a requirement for IEk-MCC dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The sublinear response is consistent with the wide dynamic range observed in T cell responses to IEk-MCC on both lipid bilayers and plastic surfaces, and may indicate a progressive suppression of T cell sensitivity to increasing doses of agonist pMHCs. The physiological significance of this phenomenon remains to be investigated, but similar responses have been observed in other biological systems, such as the response of rod cells to photons triggering the photoreceptor, rhodopsin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our observation that one to ten agonist IEk-MCC alone triggered not only TCR-induced calcium flux, but also IL2 production, calls into question the purported requirement for help by endogenous pMHC. Indeed, using mouse T cells with a transgenic TCR of the same specificity, endogenous IEk-ER60 and null IEk-99A, which were shown to enhance TCR triggering by IEk-MCC in the previous report, did not, in our hands, enhance TCR triggering by IEk-MCC on fluid lipid bilayers or fixed plastic surfaces. As evidenced by our analyses using circular dichroism and peptide pulsing experiments, the lack of help by IEk-ER60 could not be attributed to incorrect protein folding or lack of peptide in the binding groove (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060043-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060043-sg002">S2</xref>D).

The lack of help for TCR triggering by endogenous pMHC was further supported by our observation that biasing the endogenous peptide population on real APCs with ER60 or &#x003b2;2m peptides did not affect T cell activation by MCC peptides. This discrepancy may be partially explained by the different methodologies used in these studies. We consistently used MHC molecules with covalently linked peptides expressed in insect cells. In the previous report, both MHC with covalently linked peptides and empty MHC loaded with synthetic peptides were used, sometimes in the same experiment. The relative MHC occupancies by the different peptides were not determined. The differing results of T cell activation by real cells pulsed with peptides may be due to the fact that two totally different cell types were used in the two studies: previously, CHO cells expressing empty GPI-anchored IEk versus, in our study, CH27 B cells expressing IEk, as well as the appropriate adhesion and costimulatory molecules of real APCs. Again, in the previous study, the relative level of different peptides on the surface of CHO cells was not determined.</p><p>Theoretically, some aspects of the pseudodimer model of TCR remain to be reconciled with what has been learned regarding TCR triggering and pMHC-TCR interaction. The hypothesis that CD4 bridges the pseudodimer is not well supported by experimental data. Coreceptors bind MHC with very limited affinity and stability and with a fast off-rate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, CD4 has been shown to associate with TCR/CD3 via Lck and ZAP-70 in response to CD3 stimulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;, but not on resting T cells. Another issue is that the role of endogenous pMHC is not clearly explained in the pseudodimer model. Intuitively, it seems that recruitment of free TCR-CD4 to an agonist pMHC-TCR binding pair would be easier than recruitment of the TCR-CD4 complex bound to endogenous pMHC anchored on an opposing membrane. The resulting complex should function equally well as a pseudodimer. Finally, using TAP-deficient cells, previous reports demonstrated that endogenous pMHCs had a negligible effect on the activation by agonist pMHCs of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which express the same TCR/CD3 complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>What is it, then, that transforms a nonfunctional soluble monomeric agonist pMHC in solution into a powerful TCR triggering unit once it is attached to a surface? Recent data suggest that the mechanism of TCR triggering must include features unique to 2D binding. These include the need for two opposing membranes to reach the confinement length for association of membrane-anchored ligands and receptors, especially ones with small dimensions such as TCR and pMHC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;. What has been omitted, however, is that a bound ligand&#x02013;receptor pair, including pMHC-TCR, is constantly stressed and may be ruptured by forces from the active cytoskeletal rearrangement that supports the dynamic engagement between T cells and APCs. Recent in vivo studies using two-photon microscopy have characterized the interaction between T cells and antigen-loaded APCs in lymph nodes during the first 2 h as serial and dynamic, with T cells engaging and disengaging APCs at a speed of 5.4 &#x003bc;m/min &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. T cells move with a velocity of 2.6 &#x003bc;m/min even at later stages of dynamic T cell/APC clustering. In this context, a single specific interaction between a TCR and an agonist pMHC may not be able to maintain the small, close membrane&#x02013;membrane contact zone and keep tyrosine kinases and phosphatases segregated, as proposed in the kinetic-segregation model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b030">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. We demonstrate, in this study, that TCR triggering requires not only T cell adhesion to a surface, but also a functional actin cytoskeleton, consistent with the possibility that detaching forces are important in TCR triggering.</p><p>Here, taking into consideration the dynamic aspect of the 2D interaction between T cells and APCs, especially its likely impact on the dissociation of pMHC-TCR, we propose the receptor deformation model of TCR triggering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060043-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In this model, when a T cell encounters and scans an APC, pMHC and TCR interact when and where a sufficiently close membrane&#x02013;membrane contact is formed. pMHC-TCR interaction per se, however, does not trigger TCR. A signal is initiated when the binding pair is pulled by a detaching force originating from cytoskeletal rearrangement, a force originally intended to detach the membrane&#x02013;membrane contact for T cell movement. The pulling force induces a conformational change of the &#x003b1;&#x003b2; TCR, which is then transferred to the intracellular domains of the CD3 complex through interactions between their extracellular domains and transmembrane domains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, it may directly cause changes in the relative positioning and orientation of the components of the TCR/CD3 complex. This pulling force may also induce conformational changes of the coreceptor binding domains of MHC molecules, and lead to better recruitment or conformational change of the coreceptors. The signal is initiated by increased access to and phosphorylation of ITAM domains of the CD3 complex by the coreceptor-associated tyrosine kinase, Lck. Therefore, the critical factor that determines whether a particular pMHC-TCR binding can lead to signaling is whether the binding has sufficient mechanical strength and appropriate kinetics to deliver an external force to TCR or pMHC to induce a conformational change, rather than the affinity, kinetics, or conformational change under zero force, as proposed in previous models.</p><fig id="pbio-0060043-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>The Receptor Deformation Model of TCR Triggering</title><p>(A) Interaction of pMHC and TCRs at the membrane&#x02013;membrane contact site of the T cell/APC interface facilitated by adhesion molecules.

Part of this force is delivered to the TCR/CD3 complex via pMHC-TCR binding. Binding between agonist pMHC and TCR is strong enough to deliver a force that deforms the TCR/CD3 complex to a conformation capable of initiating an activation signal. Weak binding between TCR and self pMHC breaks before such a force can be delivered. This binding could, however, deliver a weak force that causes minor receptor deformation, leading to a survival signal. The detaching force might also deform the MHC molecule to a conformation that binds coreceptors with higher affinity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0060043.g007"/></fig><p>The receptor deformation model provides a solution to the problem of how the binding between TCRs and pMHCs, both of which have hugely variable binding interfaces, leads to a uniform signal initiating conformational change of the TCR/CD3 complex. It also explains how T cells can detect an extremely low number of agonist pMHCs, alone, anchored on surfaces, as we observed in this study. Although under zero force, the half-life of binding (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) of many agonist pMHC-TCR pairs has been reported to be more than 10 s, and as long as 50 s for strong agonists &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;, it could be much shorter under a pulling force, because the dissociate rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>) increases exponentially with force &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;. Together, with the locomotion and dynamic morphological changes of the T cells, and the active lateral movement of TCR and pMHC on the fluid membranes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;, a fast dissociation could allow rapid triggering of multiple neighboring TCRs by a single agonist pMHC in a short period of time, leading to efficient temporal and spatial accumulation and integration of multiple signals, as previously proposed by the serial engagement model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, the receptor deformation model offers the &#x0201c;rupture force&#x0201d; of pMHC-TCR binding (the force needed to rupture the binding) as the mechanism by which T cells distinguish structurally similar agonist and endogenous pMHCs. This is supported by the excellent correlation found between rupture force and the zero force <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;, which is correlated with TCR triggering by pMHC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. It is intriguing to speculate that weak rupture forces between TCR and endogenous pMHC may support minor changes of the TCR/CD3 complex and generate survival signals. Finally, this model is consistent with experimental evidence that cognate pMHC-TCR interaction induces a conformational change in the CD3 complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b074">74</xref>&#x0005d;. Also, force-induced conformational change has been documented in other ligand-receptor systems, such as the conformational change of LFA-1 &#x003b1; domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d; and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> adhesin FimH &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b076">76</xref>&#x0005d; in response to shear forces.</p><p>The receptor deformation model is very different from a previously proposed raft-TCR collision model that also involves force, in which the movement of lipid rafts on T cells driven by actin or shear stress promotes collision of raft-associated Lck and the TCR/CD3 complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;. This model works through increased kinase-TCR proximity, rather than conformational change. In the raft-TCR collision model, the force is applied laterally on the lipid raft and does not impact the binding kinetics of pMHC-TCR interaction. Our model is also distinct from the permissive geometry model, which proposes that TCRs are present as oligomeric clusters on T cells, and that binding of multimeric agonist pMHCs with a certain permissive geometry triggers TCRs through changes in the relative positioning of individual TCRs within the cluster &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b078">78</xref>&#x0005d;. The key differences are that changes in TCR geometry are induced solely by pMHC-TCR interaction, without the requirement of external mechanical force, and that multimeric pMHCs are required for triggering.</p><p>Notwithstanding its uniqueness and advantages, the receptor deformation model needs to be reconciled with the well-documented observation that soluble multimeric agonist pMHCs trigger TCR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b079">79</xref>&#x0005d;. In our opinion, the fact that T cells can be activated via a receptor crosslinking mechanism used by B cells is not surprising, given their similarity in evolution, development, antigen receptor structure, and intracellular signaling pathways. Our work does not exclude the possibility that when agonist pMHCs are present at extremely high levels on APCs, TCR crosslinking is a functional mechanism of TCR triggering. In this situation, the chance of two neighboring MHC molecules, both presenting agonist peptides, may be reasonably high. This, and the fact that a high proportion of MHC molecules on the APC surface is immobile &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060043-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, make it plausible that two monomeric agonist pMHCs might be stably localized in close enough proximity to act as functional dimers capable of crosslinking TCRs. Given the rarity of agonist pMHCs on APCs under physiological conditions, however, a mechanism that does not rely on TCR crosslinking, such as receptor deformation, is likely to be the main working mechanism of TCR triggering.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide strong evidence that extremely small numbers (&#x0003c;10 per cell) of surface-anchored agonist pMHCs trigger TCR, independent of endogenous pMHCs, but dependent upon adhesion and intact cytoskeletal function. We propose the receptor deformation model, in which cytoskeletal rearrangement delivers the driving force for TCR triggering. Given its merits in providing a straightforward mechanism of TCR triggering and in explaining both the high sensitivity and the high specificity of agonist pMHC detection by T cells, we believe that this model warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice, chemicals, constructs, and antibodies.</title><p>B10.BR H-2<sup>k</sup> mice and 5C.C7 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and Taconic, respectively.
