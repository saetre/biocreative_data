Germ line retroviruses in certain inbred mouse strains replicate and infect other cells within the hematopoietic system. Integrated proviruses may alter the expression of nearby genes, because the long terminal repeat (LTR) elements contain enhancers and promoters of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003823-Sorensen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. If a proviral integration alters gene expression in such a way that it gives a growth advantage to host cells, a clonal expansion of those cells can occur, ultimately leading to tumor formation. Somatic proviral insertions contained in tumor tissue act as a molecular tag for the identification of genomic loci containing genes with oncogenic transformation ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003823-Uren1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, several AKXD recombinant inbred mouse strains were examined that harbor endogenous replication competent proviruses in their germline and have a high incidence of lymphoma formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003823-Weiser1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

All insertions were clustered very tightly at the start of the SET domain-containing gene, <italic>Prdm14</italic>. Previously, it was thought that insertions at this CIS would affect <italic>Tif2</italic>, since human <italic>TIF2</italic> acts as a fusion oncogene with <italic>MOZ</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003823-Carapeti1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003823-Liang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. When this fusion oncogene is overexpressed in mice via retroviral transduction, the mice consistently develop acute myeloid leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003823-Deguchi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas tumors with insertions at <italic>Evi32</italic> are lymphoblastic lymphomas. Furthermore, we have found that <italic>Tif2</italic> transcripts are not altered in tumors with insertions at <italic>Evi32</italic>. Instead, each of the tumors with insertions at <italic>Evi32</italic> expresses <italic>Tif2</italic> at a level that is similar to or lower than normal hematopoietic organs. However, in all <italic>Evi32</italic> tumors, <italic>Prdm14</italic> is highly overexpressed. Furthermore, in one <italic>Evi32</italic> tumor, expression of <italic>Prdm14</italic> is driven from the LTR elements of the integrated provirus. Proviral-gene fusions have been observed at other oncogenes, which are activated by the insertion, including <italic>Evi3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003823-Warming1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The chance that a retrovirus would integrate in such a manner as to allow expression of <italic>Prdm14</italic> directly from the LTR elements is unlikely without this event contributing to tumor formation.

However, for <italic>Prdm14</italic>, we observed high expression of a PR-domain containing transcript in all <italic>Evi32</italic> lymphomas.

Furthermore, three of four of the <italic>Evi32</italic> tumors were identified from AKXD strain 27. This is probably due to strain specific genetic background differences in strain 27 that predispose mice to <italic>Prdm14</italic>-induced lymphoid cancer. Therefore, additional genes in AKXD-27 may cooperate with <italic>Prdm14</italic>. Identifying these cooperating genes may uncover mechanisms by which <italic>Evi32</italic> tumorigenesis occurs. This illustrates the importance of using multiple genetic backgrounds in retroviral mutagenesis screens. If AKXD-27 had not been included, <italic>Evi32</italic> would not have been identified as a common insertion site in our study.

Interestingly, expression of the pluripotency marker <italic>Oct-3/4</italic> was observed in all AKXD tumors examined here, allowing for the possibility that pluripotency may play a role in tumor susceptibility when Prdm14 is overexpressed. Together, these observations suggest that the function of <italic>Prdm14</italic> in tumor development may be promoted in cells with a less differentiated phenotype.
