The staircase-like organization of the stereocilia bundle is dynamically maintained by variable actin turnover rates. Two unconventional myosins were previously implicated in stereocilia length regulation but the mechanisms of their action remain unknown. MyosinXVa is expressed in stereocilia tips at levels proportional to stereocilia length and its absence produces staircase-like bundles of very short stereocilia. MyosinVIIa localizes to the tips of the shorter stereocilia within bundles, and when absent, the stereocilia are abnormally long. We show here that myosinVIIa interacts with twinfilin-2, an actin binding protein, which inhibits actin polymerization at the barbed end of the filament, and that twinfilin localization in stereocilia overlaps with myosinVIIa. Exogenous expression of myosinVIIa in fibroblasts results in a reduced number of filopodia and promotes accumulation of twinfilin-2 at the filopodia tips. We hypothesize that the newly described interaction between myosinVIIa and twinfilin-2 is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of slower rates of actin turnover in shorter stereocilia, and that interplay between complexes of myosinVIIa/twinfilin-2 and myosinXVa/whirlin is responsible for stereocilia length gradation within the bundle staircase.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair cells are specialized epithelial cells equipped with bundles of actin filled, microvilli-like cellular projections called stereocilia, that transform mechanical sound signals into electrical ones and enable the sensation of hearing to occur. The rows of stereocilia form staircase-like bundles that are deflected by sound waves thus increasing the tension on interstereocilial links and activating transduction channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Hudspeth1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The stereocilia length gradation and overall shape of the hair bundle are critical for hair cell frequency selectivity and its sensitivity. The actin filaments in the stereocilium core are uniformly polarized such that their barbed (plus, polymerizing) ends are located at stereocilia tips. The actin cores of stereocilia undergo continuous turnover at a rate proportional to stereocilia length. The polymerization of stereocilial actin starts at the tips and follows a treadmilling mechanism so that the organization of stereocilia bundles is dynamically maintained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Rzadzinska1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. It remains unclear how a single cell can regulate differential actin renewal rates between rows of stereocilia.</p><p>Two of the unconventional myosins present in stereocilia show interesting distributions within bundles. The levels of myosinXVa at the stereocilia tips are correlated with stereocilia lengths from the early embryonic stages of bundle development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Rzadzinska1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In the absence of myosinXVa or its interacting partner whirlin, all stereocilia are very short and exhibit reduced gradation in stereocilia heights within each bundle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Probst1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Prosser1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In adult wild type stereocilia myosinVIIa is enriched at the tips from the second and shorter rows only and when myosinVIIa is absent the stereocilia are abnormally long <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Prosser1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In whirlin and myosinXVa mutant mice myosinVIIa is present in the tips of all stereocilia, which indicates that the stereocilia tip localization of myosinVIIa and whirlin/myosinXVa is mutually exclusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Prosser1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

The list of major regulators of actin cytoskeleton includes proteins from the cofilin, profilin and twinfilin families. Cofilin is known to sever and depolymerise actin filaments at their pointed ends, whereas profilin inhibits spontaneous actin filament nucleation but also converts ADP-actin monomers to polymerization-competent ATP-monomers and localizes them to the sites of rapid filament assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Helfer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Paavilainen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Twinfilin is an evolutionarily conserved protein, which inhibits actin filament assembly by sequestering actin monomers and by capping filament barbed ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Paavilainen2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to actin, twinfilin binds heterodimeric capping protein and, at least in budding yeast, this interaction is necessary for twinfilin's correct sub-cellular localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Falck1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Inactivation of twinfilin results in defects in cortical actin patches in budding yeast and in abnormal bristle morphology in <italic>Drosophila</italic> due to uncontrolled polymerization of actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Goode1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Wahlstrom1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In mammals there are three isoforms of twinfilin, twinfilin-1, twinfilin-2a and twinfilin-2b. Twinfilin-2a and -2b are generated from the same gene through alternative promoter usage and differ only at the N-terminal region. Twinfilin-1 and twinfilin-2a/b share &#x0223c;65&#x00025; sequence identity and the residues shown to be important for actin binding are highly conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Vartiainen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Nevalainen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Twinfilin-1 is the major isoform during development and in adult non-muscle cells, twinfilin-2a is expressed almost ubiquitously but at lower levels than twinfilin-1 and both twinfilin-1 and twinfilin-2a are highly expressed in hair cells. Twinfilin-2b is the predominant isoform of heart and skeletal muscles and appears to be expressed only in these tissues. Although the two mammalian twinfilin isoforms have distinct expression patterns their affinities for actin monomers or capping protein are comparable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Nevalainen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Vartiainen2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Exogenous myosinVIIa expression in fibroblasts negatively affects number of filopodia and encourages accumulation of twinfilin-2 at the filopodia tips.

However, the subcellular localization and function of twinfilins in hair cells was not known. Using previously characterized antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Vartiainen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> we found that twinfilin-1 immunofluorescence was evenly distributed along the length of adult wild type stereocilia at P40 (when stereocilia bundles are fully mature from a morphological and physiological point of view) (supplemental data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007097.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>) while being undetectable in developing bundles up to P6 (when the stereocilia bundles just reach morphological maturation) (data not shown). Unfortunately none of the three available antibodies specific to twinfilin-2a/b worked on mouse tissues (data not shown) in immunofluorescence. However, the antibodies recognizing all twinfilin isoforms (pan-twinfilin antibody) showed a greater enhancement of pan-twinfilin-specific immunofluorescence within the flattened area of the pointed tips of shorter stereocilia of outer and inner auditory hair cells and vestibular hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007097-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Pan-twinfilin staining was present in the tips of the tallest (most lateral) stereocilia but visibly less abundant than in shorter stereocilia on samples showing entire bundles and samples in which only the most lateral stereocilia were visible (where bundles were bent towards shorter stereocilia). Pan-twinfilin staining enhancement at the tips of shorter stereocilia was absent at P2 (when stereocilia are both elongating and widening), weak at P7 (supplemental data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007097.s002">Fig. S2</xref>) but strong and very clear in stereocilia of adult animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007097-g001">Fig. 1A&#x02013;C</xref>). In some inner hair cell stereocilia we were able to resolve two distinct spots of pan-twinfilin staining, each spot of about 160 nm diameter, which is at the resolution limit of standard fluorescence microscopes. Other tips showed a single elongated spot of twinfilin staining measuring approximately 470&#x000b1;70 nm (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;57). We believe that the elongated spots are likely to represent the merging of two &#x0223c;200 nm dots that could not be resolved individually. The observed staining pattern with weakening of fluorescence signal between dots suggests that each dot consists of two foci with centres about 200 nm apart each of which is formed by the binding of multiple antibody molecules. The measurements of the objects whose sizes are close to the microscope resolution limit on fluorescent images is not definitive and the size of a spot will depend on fluorescence intensity and threshold chosen. Therefore, the dimensions of the immunoflourescent spots we describe should be treated as approximate. In order to establish if the two adjacent dots of twinfilin specific immunofluorescence that we observe are likely to localize within a single stereocilium tip, as opposed to within two different stereocilia, we measured the length of the tips (length of the tips&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;the long axis diameter of the ellipsoid that demarks the shape of the stereocilia in its &#x0201c;tented&#x0201d; state). We found that the average length of tips of shorter stereocilia is about 440&#x000b1;50 nm (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;123). We therefore believe that the double spots of twinfilin staining, or the single elongated spots, localize to single tips of the shorter stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007097-g001">Fig. 1B and E&#x02013;G</xref>). In addition the pan-twinfilin staining enhancement was also observed within pericuticular necklace region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007097-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0007097-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007097.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Pan-twinfilin localizes to the tips of shorter stereocilia.</title><p>Confocal images showing the distribution of pan-twinfilin in stereocilia bundles.

Therefore we analyzed twinfilin distribution in bundles formed by abnormally long stereocilia (myosinVIIa-null hair cells) and abnormally short stereocilia (hair cells lacking myosinXVa and/or whirlin). In order to analyze the relationship between the localization of twinfilin and myosinVIIa expression, we harvested auditory sensory epithelia from <italic>Myo7a<sup>4626SB/4626SB</sup>Hprt<sup>(Myo7a)Brd/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mosaic female mice at P40.

As anti-myosinVIIa and anti pan-twinfilin antibodies are both rabbit polyclonal we were not able to indicate myosinVIIa-deficient hair cells by immunostaining or to evaluate co-localization of these two proteins. However, the characteristic morphological changes (smaller apical surface with bundles formed by fewer, disorganized and abnormally long stereocilia) allowed us to easily distinguish complemented and non-complemented (myosinVIIa-deficient) hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007097-Prosser1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

During development of the stereocilia bundles the kinocilium moves to the periphery, stereocilia lengthen and widen gradually until they reach a predetermined size and the excess stereocilia are resorbed. The stereocilia near the kinocilium start to elongate first and they finish elongation last, forming the tallest and the most lateral row. The stereocilia length gradation within the bundle staircase is established before the full length is reached and most of the growth of stereocilia occurs postnatally.
