A conserved PCNA-binding motif is found in a subset of PCNA-interacting proteins, including p21, suggesting that the regulation of these interactions is important for the co-ordination of DNA replication and repair. We have identified several classes of protein which bind to Drosophila PCNA. Two of these proteins contain the consensus PCNA-binding domain: one is the Dacapo protein, a Drosophila homologue of p21(WAF1/Cip1), and the second is the transposase encoded by the Pogo DNA transposon . A conserved PCNA-binding domain is also present in a human relative of Pogo , named Tigger , suggesting that this domain has a functional role in this class of transposable element. This raises interesting possibilities for a novel method of transposition in which the transposase might be targeted to replicating DNA. Finally, we have investigated the use of this conserved PCNA-binding domain as a predictor of PCNA-binding capacity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
