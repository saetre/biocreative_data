A clearer understanding of the pro-death/pro-survival signaling pathways and their downstream targets is critical to the development of therapeutic interventions to mitigate permanent neurological damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We demonstrate here that the transcriptional repressor ZEB1, thought to be involved in regulating the timing and spatial boundaries of basic-Helix-Loop-Helix transactivator-mediated neurogenic determination/differentiation programs, functions to link a pro-survival transcriptional cascade rapidly induced in cortical neurons in response to experimentally induced ischemia. Employing histological, tissue culture, and molecular biological read-outs, we show that this novel pro-survival response, initiated through the rapid induction of p63, is mediated ultimately by the transcriptional repression of a pro-apoptotic isoform of p73 by ZEB1. We show further that this phylogenetically conserved pathway is induced as well in the human cortex subjected to episodes of clinically relevant stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The data presented here provide the first evidence that ZEB1 induction is part of a protective response by neurons to ischemia. The stroke-induced increase in ZEB1 mRNA and protein levels in cortical neurons is both developmentally and phylogenetically conserved and may therefore be part of a fundamental cellular response to this insult. Beyond the context of stroke, the finding that ZEB1 is regulated by a member of the p53 family has implications for cell survival in other tissue and cellular environments subjected to ischemia, such as the myocardium and, in particular, tumor masses.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypoxic/Ischemic (H-I) insult to the CNS is an important cause of neurological morbidity, with severe cases resulting in life-long deficits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Ferriero1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Janardhan1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Such a role is not, however, supported by the phenotype of the ZEB1 KO mouse, in which bHLH-triggered differentiation programs appear unaltered. Rather, at birth, ZEB1 knockout mice are about one-third to one-half proportionately smaller in size than their heterozygous or wild-type littermates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Takagi1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, consistent with it playing a role in cellular survival (and/or in regulation of the cell cycle). Here, we present data that strongly supports such a role for ZEB1 in neuronal survival in the context of ischemic insult in the CNS, by serving as a critical link in a transcriptional cascade involving pro-apoptotic isoforms of p63 and p73. Specifically, we demonstrate that ZEB1 protein expression levels in cortical neurons in vivo are highly induced early in response to the experimental administration of permanent unilateral stroke in both the developing and mature brain. Similar levels of induction of human ZEB1 protein are seen in cortical samples derived from pathology specimens of stroke victims. Over-expressed ZEB1 is protective in primary cortical neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), while, conversely, primary cultures of cortical neurons from ZEB KO mice are over twice as vulnerable to this insult. The ischemic increase in ZEB1 results, in part, through transcriptional induction by p63, itself induced early in response to stroke. We show further that the neuro-protective effects mediated by this increase in ZEB1 protein are the consequence, at least in part, of its binding to and repressing the TAp73 gene. This is the first demonstration, through the elucidation of this novel transcriptional cascade, of a functional role for ZEB1 in cell survival, and in neuronal protection in particular.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ZEB1 protein is rapidly induced in cortical neurons by ischemia</title><p>A recent report demonstrating that a shift in intracellular redox levels to a net reducing environment (for example, as a result of hypoxia) dramatically increased the functional activity of a ZEB1 co-repressor, C-terminal binding protein 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Zhang1">&#x0005b;CtBP1; 22&#x0005d;</xref>, prompted us to ask whether ZEB1 may itself be subject to regulation by O<sub>2</sub> levels in the brain.

The data presented here provide the first evidence that the transcriptional repressor ZEB1: 1) is dramatically induced in response to experimentally-administered permanent stroke, as well as in the human cortex in response to clinically relevant acute ischemic episodes; 2) can protect primary neuronal cultures against OGD and other pro-death insults; 3) decreases neuronal vulnerability to OGD in a dose-dependent fashion; 4) is itself transcriptionally up-regulated by p63 in this pathological context; 5) may inhibit, mitigate or delay neuronal apoptosis in an acute time frame by repressing TAp73. The stroke-induced increase in ZEB1 mRNA and protein levels in cortical neurons is both developmentally and phylogenetically conserved and may therefore be part of a fundamental cellular response to this insult. Beyond the context of stroke, the finding that ZEB1 is regulated by a member of the p53 family has implications for cell survival in other tissue and cellular environments subjected to ischemia, such as the myocardium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Jefferson1">&#x0005b;for review, see 32&#x0005d;</xref> and, in particular, tumor masses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Griffin1">&#x0005b;for review, see 33&#x0005d;</xref>. This is the first report ascribing a role for ZEB1 in cellular survival, substantiating a recent report by Grooteclaes et. al., showing that one of ZEB1's co-repressors, CtBP1, itself has anti-apoptotic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Grooteclaes1">&#x0005b;24, and see below&#x0005d;</xref>.

We are currently examining the relative contribution that each of these two closely related transcriptional repressors makes, individually and together, to cellular survival in response to hypoxic/ischemic challenge.</p><p>In light of the entirety of the data presented here, it will be clearly important to know not only how long ZEB1 induction persists beyond the 72 hr period we observed histologically (in both the neonatal and adult rat cortex, data not shown), but to map out the regional and cellular specificity of this induction with respect to the expanding ischemic lesion. Further, in the context of a mild ischemic episode, or experimental pre-conditioning, is ZEB1 induced, and does evidence of persistent induction correlate with the protective effects of these mild insults?</p><p>The importance of maintaining certain ZEB1-target genes in the off state in this context is underscored as well by our finding that primary cortical neurons isolated from ZEB KO mice are over twice as sensitive to OGD as their wt counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). This is further reinforced by a recent microarray-based study from the laboratory of Frisch (in the context of tumor progression), demonstrating that CtBP1 can target a number of epithelial-specific and pro-apoptotic-specific genes, and, potentially, play a key role in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the relatively hypoxic interior of a tumor mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Grooteclaes1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Over-expressed ZEB1 was able to protect cortical neurons in culture from a number of biologically-relevant insults with the exception of the widely studied neurotransmitter/regulatory molecule nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). This result is important not only because of the well established role of NO in a wide variety of normal and patho-physiological processes, including many neurodegenerative diseases and stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Dawson1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, but as well may offer a clue about the mechanistic basis for ZEB1's neuroprotective activity. At lower or physiological levels, NO itself has been shown to be neuroprotective, while intermediate and higher levels can cause apoptosis and necrosis, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Lipton1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Calabrese1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Moncada1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, as with any bio-active agent, the ultimate effect of NO will depend on many factors, such as neuronal cell-type, age of the culture, percentage of glial cells, media components, source and half-life of the NO-donor, cellular redox state, etc.</p><p>Regardless of the experimental conditions, it is interesting that ZEB1 could protect our cortical cultures from an insult &#x02013; excitotoxicity &#x02013; which is known to trigger an nNOS-mediated increase in intracellular NO/reactive nitrogen species, but not from a direct challenge with nitric oxide itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> and see corroborating data in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004373.s003">Figures S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004373.s004">S4</xref></bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004373.s005"><bold>S5</bold></xref>). One possible explanation for this result is that the levels of reactive nitrogen species generated in our excitotoxicity experiments fell below the threshold that can overcome ZEB1 protection &#x02013; a level clearly attained in the experiments in which an NO donor was administered alone. Primary cultures of cortical neurons do not become sensitized to excitotoxic insult until they have expressed at least a threshold level of NMDA receptors, about 14 DIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Dawson2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. To minimize the possible influence of culture-derived excitotoxic effects (e.g. NMDA receptor mediated induction of nNOS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Dawson1">&#x0005b;refs. 47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Dawson2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>) primary cortical neurons were challenged with the NO donor between 4 and 6 DIV. As ZEB1 can protect against reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from administration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to these cultures, it is possible that under the conditions we employed here, the ROS generated as a result of excitotoxic challenge predominates over NO-derived reactive nitrogen species.</p><p>While the NO-donor compound, S-nitroso-glutathione (SNOG/GSNO), had clear neuro-toxic effects at the concentration employed here (250 &#x000b5;M), it's relatively long half-life (compared to other NO donors) may have contributed both to it's toxicity, and it's potential for non-physiological nitroslyation. Nitric oxide-mediated nitrosylation of cysteine sulfhydryl groups has been shown to occur on and regulate the activity not only of NMDA receptors, but of various other ion channels, signaling intermediates, enzymes and transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore possible that NO could nitrosylate ZEB1 itself (for example, on cysteine residues in the zinc-finger DNA-binding domains) disrupting it's functional (and hence, neuro-protective) activity by, for example, disrupting its binding capacity/specificity, etc.). Even if such a modification were a normal regulatory component of ZEB1 activity, it would likely be amplified to a patho-physiological extreme as a consequence of mass action resulting from the experimental introduction of high levels of both NO (via addition of an NO donor) and ZEB1 (via transfection of an expression vector). Similar non-physiological nitrosylation reactions have been shown in some cases to cause recipient protein mis-folding and precipitate an apoptotic cellular response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Calabrese1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Such a covalent modification could, as well, simply result in a loss of function (e.g. a regulatory off switch) that reduced or eliminated ZEB1's neuroprotective capacity. Further experimental approaches are clearly warranted to determine the mechanistic basis for the ZEB1 &#x02013; NO relationship.</p><p>The p63&#x02192;ZEB1&#x022a3;p73 transcriptional cascade described here parallels recent results demonstrating a role for another well-characterized E-box-binding zinc-finger transcriptional repressor, SLUG, in protecting hematopoietic precursor cells subjected to low levels of ionizing radiation. In that case, radiation-induced p53 transcriptionally activates SLUG, which, after binding to the PUMA promoter, blocks subsequent p53-mediated up-regulation of that gene, allowing these cells to survive a relatively mild insult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Wu1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our finding that the p63&#x003b2; mRNA is induced in response to ischemia to an extent far greater than the other isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>) is particularly interesting in light of the results of Jacobs et. al. in their recent analysis of growth factor-withdrawal-mediated apoptosis of sympathetic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Jacobs2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In that report, withdrawal of nerve growth factor (NGF) caused the up-regulation of the gamma isoform of p63 (albeit with slower kinetics, 22 hrs after withdrawal before the visualization of p63&#x003b3; protein induction), while beta isoform levels remained relatively constant. Whether stroke-mediated recruitment of the beta splicing variant is related to cell type (cortical neuron vs. sympathetic), or insult (ischemia vs. growth factor withdrawal), is unknown at present. Our analysis of the functional activity of p63 on the ZEB1 promoter showed that both the TA&#x003b2; and &#x00394;N&#x003b2; isoforms could bind to and transactivate through their cognate site in the ZEB1 promoter. While TAp63&#x003b3; did show binding activity, neither the TA&#x003b3; nor &#x00394;N&#x003b3; isoforms showed any significant trans-activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g005"><bold>Figure 5B and 5C</bold></xref>). As the antibody employed in the anti-p63 ChIP assay (monoclonal 4A4) recognizes an epitope common to all p63 isoforms, we do not know, as yet, which (or which combination) binds to the ZEB1 promoter in vivo.</p><p>Our results using SiRNA on primary cortical neurons derived from either wt or ZEB1-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g006">Figure 6</xref>) demonstrate that approximately 60&#x00025; of OGD-mediated induction of ZEB1 can be attributed to p63. Surprisingly, the OGD-mediated induction of &#x00394;Np63 (about seven-fold) is itself reduced by half in the absence of ZEB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g006">Figures 6a and 6b</xref>), suggesting the existence of a positive regulatory feed-back loop between these proteins, though the mechanistic basis for this (ZEB1 represses a repressor of p63?) remains to be determined. In the aggregate, these data not only reinforce the existence of the ischemia/OGD-mediated regulatory links we have established here between p63, ZEB1 and p73, but imply a further feedback loop between either ZEB1 or p73 and p63.</p><p>In the hours immediately following the onset of ischemia, our data indicate as well that the protein levels of the (generally) pro-survival &#x00394;N isoforms of both p63 and p73 increase relative to the (generally) pro-apoptotic TA isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g004"><bold>Figures 4C, 4D</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g006"><bold>6A</bold></xref>). While the mechanistic basis for this is at present unknown, our data suggest that the ischemia-mediated transcriptional repression of TAp73 by ZEB1 may be critical to establishing a &#x00394;Np73/TAp73 ratio that favors, at least in an acute time frame, a pro-survival outcome.</p><p>Although the mechanism(s) of cell death &#x02013; apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, or a hybrid or combination of these &#x02013; remains a matter of debate, an emerging consensus in the literature maintains that apoptosis plays a more significant role in ischemic injury in the developing brain, with necrosis becoming the more predominant &#x02013; though not exclusive &#x02013; form in the mature brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Back1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Kuan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Zhu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. At either stage of development, we have demonstrated here that the ischemia-mediated induction of a novel neuro-protective protein &#x02013; ZEB1 &#x02013; is an early event, occurring as early as 90 minutes after the ischemic insult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g001"><bold>Figures 1</bold></xref><bold>and</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004373-g004"><bold>4</bold></xref>).</p><p>As in the case of the well-studied p53-regulated response to environmental insults, the ultimate fate of a neuron challenged with ischemia depends on whether the integration of signaling events and the subsequent genetic response exceeds the threshold required to precipitate a death response. Our finding that p63 is induced early in the ischemic cortex and initiates a transcriptional cascade that manifests, ultimately, in an increase in the ratio of pro-survival &#x00394;Np73 to the pro-apoptotic TAp73, may provide one mechanistic basis for how a neuron might survive a mild ischemic episode. In a severe, prolonged stroke, this rapidly-induced cellular defense response (analogous to the parallel up-regulation in neurons of the pro-survival Erythropoietin receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Siren1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>), will, of course, be overwhelmed by the weight of pro-death signaling (as well as the depletion of cellular ATP).

Based on our current detailed understanding of how p53 family isoforms can transcriptionally cross-regulate and hetero-tetramerize with one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004373-Haupt1">&#x0005b;for review, see 37&#x0005d;</xref>, however, it is likely that the regulatory cascade we describe here is far more complex.

Second, in addition to permanent FCI, does ZEB1 play a role in other types of hypoxic-ischemic-mediated injury, in particular ischemia/reperfusion injury (i.e. in the context of increased reactive O<sub>2</sub> species in vivo) and traumatic brain injury, as well as in other neuro-degenerative diseases?

Third, in addition to p63-mediated transcriptional induction, what other mechanisms, transcriptional or otherwise, play a role in vivo in the dramatic ischemia-mediated increase in ZEB1 protein levels (not to mention the mechanistic basis for the rapid induction of p63). Lastly, in addition to p73, which other pro-death genes/pathways are targeted by ZEB1?</p><p>We have presented compelling evidence that ZEB1 induction is part of a protective response by neurons to ischemia.
