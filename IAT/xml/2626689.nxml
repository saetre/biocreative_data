Recent studies have identified a new subset of T cells that selectively produce IL-17 (Th17 cells; Bettelli, E., T. Korn, and V.K. Kuchroo. 2007. <italic>Curr. Opin. Immunol.</italic> 19:652&#x02013;657; Kolls, J.K., and A. Linden. 2004. <italic>Immunity.</italic> 21:467&#x02013;476), but the regulation of IL-17 production by innate immune cells is less well understood. We report that in vitro stimulation with IL-23 induced IL-17 production by recombination activating gene (Rag) 2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes but not Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> common &#x003b3; chain<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes.

In vivo challenge with the yeast cell wall product zymosan rapidly induced IL-17 production in these cells. Genetic deletion of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 reduced but did not abrogate IL-17 production in LTi-like cells. Thus, it appears that splenic LTi-like cells are a rapid source of IL-17 and IL-22, which might contribute to dynamic organization of secondary lymphoid organ structure or host defense.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>C.M.

Th17 cells produce IL-17 or IL-17A and IL-17F, which are major mediators of inflammation and are critical for host defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). IL-6, IL-21, and TGF-&#x003b2;1 are critical factors that promote Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Although IL-23 was originally thought to be important for inducing naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to become Th17 cells, naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells do not express IL-23Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Rather, IL-23 is now thought to affect the expansion, maintenance, and pathogenicity of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). IL-23 also induces IL-17 production from &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells and invariant NKT (iNKT) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Regardless of exactly how IL-23 works, current evidence clearly argues that IL-23&#x02013;mediated IL-17 production is crucial in host defense and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23 share the ability to activate Stat3, which was shown to be critical for Th17 cell differentiation in mouse and man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Stat3 directly regulates the <italic>Il17</italic> and <italic>Il21</italic> genes but also regulates IL-23R expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Furthermore, the aforementioned cytokines acting via Stat3 induce the retinoic acid&#x02013;related orphan receptor &#x003b3;t (ROR&#x003b3;t), the master regulator of Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to T cells, much less is known about the ability of innate cell subpopulations to produce IL-17. We report that splenic lymphoid tissue inducer&#x02013;like cells (LTi-like cells) constitutively express ROR&#x003b3;t, IL-23R, CCR6, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), and produce IL-17 and IL-22. Interestingly, the yeast wall product zymosan elicited IL-17 production by LTi-like cells in vivo. Whether the production of IL-17 and IL-22 influences the architecture of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and contributes to host defense will be important issues to examine in the future.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>IL-23 induces IL-17 production by a population of common &#x003b3; chain (&#x003b3;c)&#x02013;dependent non&#x02013;T, non&#x02013;B cells</title><p>To determine if there are considerable proportions of innate immune cells that produce IL-17, we examined Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that have few T and B cells. We first assessed whether IL-17 production occurred in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes after stimulation with various cytokines. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, IL-23 alone induced IL-17A production by WT splenocytes, presumably indicative of an effect on memory T cells. Consistent with the idea that memory T cells are lacking in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the effect of IL-23 was reduced in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes still produced about one third as much IL-17A as WT splenocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Other cytokines used separately or in combination with IL-23 had no effect on IL-17A production; however, IL-4 suppressed IL-23&#x02013;induced IL-17A production by WT and Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072713/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072713/DC1</ext-link>). In addition to memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, iNKT cells are another important source of IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), but such cells are lacking in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Accordingly, anti-CD3/28 or &#x003b1;-galactosylceramide (&#x003b1;-GalCer) stimulation induced IL-17A production by WT splenocytes but not Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes (Fig. S1, B and C). Collectively, these data suggest that although T and NKT cells are both major producers of IL-17, populations of non&#x02013;T, non&#x02013;B cells can also produce IL-17.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>IL-23 and zymosan induce IL-17 production in a population of non&#x02013;B, non&#x02013;T cells.</bold> (A) WT or Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes were cultured in the presence of the indicated cytokines for 48 h, and IL-17A in culture supernatants was measured by ELISA.

In addition to lacking T and B cells, Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also lack NK cells.

We used markers for a variety of innate immune cells expected to be present in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> spleens but failed to detect IL-23&#x02013;mediated IL-17A production in granulocytes, macrophages, or DCs (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072713/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072713/DC1</ext-link>). A prominent &#x003b3;c-dependent lineage that rapidly produces cytokines upon stimulation is the NK cell. Based on the response to IL-23 in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes and loss in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes, we thought that NK cells could be IL-17 producers. However, contrary to our expectations, the majority of IL-17A&#x02013;producing CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells did not express NK1.1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Thus far, our results have indicated that neither T, NKT, NK cells (all &#x003b3;c dependent) nor &#x003b3;c-independent myeloid cells were a major source of IL-17 production in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> spleens. We did observe that in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes stimulated with IL-23 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, left), a considerable proportion of the IL-17A&#x02013;producing non&#x02013;T cells expressed CD4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, right).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells produce IL-17.</bold> Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes were cultured in the absence (Control) or presence of IL-23 for 24 h.

As indicated in Fig. S2, we did not detect IL-23&#x02013;mediated IL-17A production by CD11C<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC populations. The latter, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, have been shown to be present in SLOs of fetal and adult mice and are termed LTi's and LTi-like cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Importantly, LTi-like cells are greatly reduced in &#x003b3;c<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>We next determined whether isolated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup> LTi-like subsets produced IL-17 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, top). In fact, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> (bottom), we observed IL-17A production by isolated LTi-like cells in response to IL-23. Moreover, directly isolated LTi-like cells produced more IL-17A in the presence of PMA/ionomycin (Iono), which was dramatically enhanced by IL-23 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, bottom). In contrast, LTi-negative subsets produced minimal IL-17A (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072713/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072713/DC1</ext-link>). Consistent with Fig. S2, isolated CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells did not produce IL-17A with IL-23 stimulation (unpublished data). Another source of LTi-like cells in an adult mouse is the intestinal lamina propria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Interestingly, LTi-like cells in the lamina propria from WT mice produced IL-17A after stimulation with PMA/Iono (Fig. S5).

LTi-like cells have been shown to express IL-7Rs (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072713/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072713/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Therefore, we modified the cell-culture conditions by adding IL-7 to maintain cells for the initial 48 h, followed by IL-23 for another 6 h. As shown in Fig. S7 A, IL-17A and IL-17F mRNA expression was potently induced by IL-23 in the presence of IL-7. These results suggest that LTi-like cells quickly enhance the production of IL-17 in response to IL-23, and this cytokine does not simply serve to keep these cells alive.</p><p>It is well known that Stat3 is activated by IL-23 and other inducers of Th17 cell differentiation, and the absence of Stat3 abrogates IL-17 production by T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). We therefore assessed the proportion of IL-17A&#x02013;producing LTi-like cells in Stat3-deficient mice. Not surprisingly, we found that IL-23&#x02013;mediated IL-17A production was decreased in Stat3-deficient LTi-like cells of <italic>Stat3<sup>fl/fl</sup>; MMTV-Cre</italic> or <italic>Stat3<sup>fl/fl</sup>; CD4-Cre</italic> splenocytes compared with those of <italic>Stat3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> splenocytes, although IL-17A production was not completely abrogated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and not depicted). Because Cre-mediated deletion of STAT3 is &#x0003e;90% in both systems (unpublished data), there seems to be both STAT3-dependent and -independent pathways for the production of IL-17 in LTi-like cells. We also observed that IL-23 up-regulated mRNA expression of Stat3 and Stat4 but not GATA3 in LTi-like cells (Fig. S7 B).

As memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells respond to IL-23 because of constitutive expression of its receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), we evaluated mRNA expression of IL-23R and IL-12R&#x003b2;1 in LTi-like cells. Consistent with their rapid responsiveness to IL-23, LTi-like cells constitutively expressed IL-23R mRNA at levels significantly greater than T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). LTi-like cells also expressed slightly higher levels of IL-12R&#x003b2;1 mRNA compared with those of memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

In contrast, expression of IL-6R&#x003b1; and IL-17RA mRNA in LTi-like cells was much lower compared with that in T and B cells (unpublished data). Recently, the AHR has been reported to be expressed in Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Interestingly, LTi-like cells also expressed AHR mRNA at levels equivalent to those in Th17 cells polarized for 72 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Furthermore, IL-23 up-regulated mRNA expression levels of IL-23R, ROR&#x003b3;t, and AHR (Fig. S7 C).</p><p>Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), splenic LTi-like cells were found to be CD30L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>OX40L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-7R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Thy1.2<sup>high</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup>CD62L<sup>low</sup> (Fig. S6).

Additionally, it has recently been shown that CCR6 identifies a population of human memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that selectively produce IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), we found that most of the splenic LTi-like cells express CCR6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Approximately half of the CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> LTi-like cells coexpressed CXCR5 and CCR7 (unpublished data), suggesting that the expression of those chemokine receptors on LTi-like cells is heterogeneous, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). On the other hand, the expression of CXCR3, CCR5, or CCR4, which are preferentially expressed on Th1 or Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), was low on splenic LTi-like cells (Fig. S6 and not depicted).</p></sec><sec><title>LTi-like cells produce IL-17 during zymosan-induced inflammation in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>We next determined whether LTi-like cells produced IL-17 in vivo in an inflammatory setting.

Despite the importance of Th17 cells, it is becoming increasingly clear that they are not the only source of IL-17. Clearly, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T and iNKT cells produce IL-17 to protect against bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In addition, a recent study provides evidence that IL-23 can drive IL-17 production by innate immune cells in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p><p>We were very impressed by the loss of IL-17 production in Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We initially suspected that this pointed to production of IL-17 by NK cells but were surprised by the failure to see IL-17 production by NK1.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). However, LTi-like cells are also dependent on &#x003b3;c cytokines for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Before our studies, it was known that these cells expressed ROR&#x003b3;t, which was required for their function in LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). ROR&#x003b3;t has several important functions, but it is now clear that one function is the regulation of Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). We confirmed that splenic LTi-like cells constitutively express ROR&#x003b3;t (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and that IL-23 further up-regulated its expression (Fig. S7 C), arguing that this factor is essential in controlling IL-17 and IL-22 production by non&#x02013;T cells. Interestingly, fresh LTi-like cells also constitutively expressed more AHR than polarized Th17 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). LTi-like cells also constitutively expressed IL-23R and CCR6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>), similar to CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-23R<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> human memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which are major producers of IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Thus, the expression of ROR&#x003b3;t, AHR, CCR6, and IL-23R seems to be the signature to define IL-17&#x02013; and IL-22&#x02013;producing cells in both adaptive and innate immune cells.</p><p>LTi-like cells are involved in the proper formation of peripheral LNs, the spleen, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue by highly expressing lymphotoxin &#x003b1;, lymphotoxin &#x003b2;, and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Our data indicate that splenic and gut LTi-like cells also produce IL-17 and IL-22 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5 B</xref>; and Fig. S7, A and D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). It has been recently shown that blocking IL-17 results in disruption of the germinal center&#x02013;like formation in the spleen, and restoration of the lymphoid microanatomy is dependent on the proliferative accumulation of LTi-like cells in SLOs during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). In addition, the cross talk between bacteria, LTi cells, stromal cells, DCs, and B cells seems to be essential for isolated lymphoid follicle formation in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). LTi-like cells might help organize the development of lymphoid tissues through the production of IL-17. In addition, IL-17 and IL-22 act on epidermal cells, producing antimicrobial products that protect the host from extracellular bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Our in vivo experiments in which Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice challenged with zymosan produced IL-17 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) are consistent with the notion that splenic LTi-like cells might participate in host defense. It is therefore possible that splenic LTi-like cells exist not only for the development of SLOs but also for the rapid response to pathogens that elicit IL-17 and IL-22. Thus, our report brings to light new potential roles of LTi-like cells in host defense in addition to their known roles in regulating lymphoid architecture.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Recombinant cytokines and antibodies.</title><p>Mouse IL-6, IL-12, IL-21, IL-23, and TGF&#x003b2;-1 were purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems.
