However, their role in the development of Th1/Th2 effector functions following infection has not been investigated. Here we dissect the function of CAT2 by studying two infectious disease models characterized by the development of polarized Th1 or Th2-type responses. We show that CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are significantly more susceptible to the Th1-inducing pathogen <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. Although <italic>T. gondii</italic> infected CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice developed stronger IFN-&#x003b3; responses, nitric oxide (NO) production was significantly impaired, which contributed to their enhanced susceptibility. In contrast, CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice infected with the Th2-inducing pathogen <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> displayed no change in susceptibility to infection, although they succumbed to schistosomiasis at an accelerated rate. Granuloma formation and fibrosis, pathological features regulated by Th2 cytokines, were also exacerbated even though their Th2 response was reduced. Finally, while IL-13 blockade was highly efficacious in wild-type mice, the development of fibrosis in CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was largely IL-13-independent. Instead, the exacerbated pathology was associated with increased arginase activity in fibroblasts and alternatively activated macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, by controlling NOS2 and arginase activity, CAT2 functions as a potent regulator of immunity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Recent studies conducted with amino transporter <italic>Slc7a2</italic>-deficient mice (CAT2) demonstrated that NOS2 activity in macrophages is regulated by CAT2. NOS2, which synthesizes nitric oxide, regulates numerous important activities, including resistance to infectious organisms, tumor development, and autoimmune diseases. It also competes with the enzyme Arginase-1 (Arg1) for the common substrate L-arginine. However, the role CAT2 in the regulation of Arg1 activity has not been previously examined. Therefore, we infected CAT2-deficient mice with the helminth parasite <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> or with the protozoan pathogen <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, two organisms that trigger highly divergent host immune responses. Strikingly, following infection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice developed parasite egg&#x02013;induced lesions in the liver that were 3 to 4 times larger than wild type and hepatic fibrosis (a feature of severe schistosomiasis) was exacerbated, indicating a general worsening of disease in the absence of CAT2. The CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were also more susceptible to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, demonstrating that CAT2 is critical for the development of protective cell-mediated immunity. Thus, these studies identify CAT2 as a powerful regulator of host immune responses, which may have major implications for a variety of infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue macrophages comprise a heterogeneous population of cells, recently separated into three major categories based on their unique functional capabilities.

One of the major products of arginase is L-ornithine, a precursor in the production of polyamines and proline, which control cell proliferation and collagen production, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000023-Bronte1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000023-Morris2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Because T cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts all compete for arginine, the increased arginase activity in CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages and fibroblasts may have reduced arginine levels in the granulomatous tissues, resulting in the local suppression of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses, as has been postulated recently in related studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000023-Rutschman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000023-Su1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000023-Taylor1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since CAT2 fibroblasts displayed an unusual activated phenotype, we examined whether production of the sIL-13R&#x003b1;2 was also altered in the CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Decreased production of the sIL-13R&#x003b1;2 could provide a simple and straightforward explanation for their exacerbated IL-13-driven pathological responses. Surprisingly, the exact opposite was observed. Indeed, serum levels of sIL-13R&#x003b1;2 were either the same or slightly increased in the infected CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Thus, we questioned whether the development of fibrosis in CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was in fact dependent on IL-13. To formally address this question, we performed a series of studies with neutralizing antibodies to IL-13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000023-Yang1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Strikingly, although IL-13 blockade had a highly significant anti-fibrotic effect in WT mice, CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were unresponsive. These observations, when combined with the reduced IL-13 and enhanced IL-13R&#x003b1;2 responses, suggest that the development of fibrosis in CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is to a large extent IL-13-independent.</p><p>When viewed together, the data point to fibroblasts and AAM&#x000f8;'s as the key mediators of the exacerbated pathological response, since arginase activity was increased in the CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. In the case of fibroblasts, the enhanced arginase response also appeared to be independent of Th2 cytokine stimulation. Arg1 and &#x003b1;-SMA expression also colocalized in the granulomatous livers and both proteins were expressed at much higher levels in the infected CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, confirming that there were more activated myofibroblasts. However, there was no evidence of spontaneous liver fibrosis in uninfected CAT2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, suggesting that a chronic inflammatory stimulus or some type of tissue damage was needed to initiate the fibroproliferative response. Nevertheless, a recent study found that CAT2-deficient mice are susceptible to the development of spontaneous inflammation in the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000023-Rothenberg1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. The same group also showed that CAT2 expression is linked with the development of asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000023-Zimmermann1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, mucosal tissues, which are repeatedly exposed to irritants, may be particularly sensitive to changes in CAT2 activity. As such, CAT2 may be involved in the regulation of a wide variety of diseases that are normally associated with chronic Th2 responses.</p><p>In conclusion, these studies demonstrate for the first time that CAT2 is critically important for the development of IFN-&#x003b3;/NO-dependent immunity to the intracellular protozoan pathogen <italic>T. gondii</italic>. In addition, by inhibiting arginase activity in fibroblasts and alternatively-activated macrophages, CAT2 functions as a powerful negative regulator of type-2 cytokine-driven pathology. Thus, these findings may have major implications for a wide variety of infectious and inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice, parasite infections, and antigen preparation</title><p>Female C57BL/6 were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000023-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.
