Here we report that the Kaposi's sarcoma&#x02013;associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) directly functions as a component of the EC<sub>5</sub>S ubiquitin complex targeting the tumor suppressors von Hippel-Lindau <italic>(VHL)</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> for degradation. We have characterized a suppressor of cytokine signaling box-like motif within LANA composed of an Elongin B and C box and a Cullin box, which is spatially located at its amino and carboxyl termini.

Cellular proteins destined for degradation are covalently linked to ubiquitin by a process called ubiquitylation. This highly regulated process controls a broad range of fundamental cellular functions, including signal transduction, development, and apoptosis. Many pathogens invade host cells by mimicking, blocking, or redirecting the activity of the cellular ubiquitin system. Understanding the unique biological functions targeted by these pathogens is a key goal in developing strategies for prevention and protection against their invasions. This report describes a unique functional role of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma&#x02013;associated herpesvirus, a large DNA virus that persists in primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. LANA can modulate hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; activities by down-regulation of the critical tumor suppressors von Hippel-Lindau <italic>(VHL)</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> in B lymphoma cells. In this pathway, LANA directly mimics and serves as an adaptor molecule for a specific E3 ubiquitin complex through an unconventional protein motif, to stimulate the ubiquitylation and degradation of both <italic>VHL</italic> and <italic>p53</italic>. This is of fundamental importance because it raises the interesting question as to whether this process is linked to regulation of infection and pathogenesis by tumor viruses associated with human cancers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Cai QL, Knight JS, Verma SC, Zald P, Robertson ES (2006) EC<sub>5</sub>S ubiquitin complex is recruited by KSHV latent antigen LANA for degradation of the <italic>VHL</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> tumor suppressors<italic>.</italic> PLoS Pathog 2 (10): e116.

One cDNA identified in this screen was found to encode Elongin C. Since Elongin C has been shown to directly bind to BC-box containing proteins which usually interact with Elongin B and C complex (Elongin BC), the association of LANA with Elongin C in yeast is likely to also involve Elongin B. To confirm the binding results from the yeast two-hybrid screen, we examined in vitro binding assays of Elongin BC to LANA. In in vitro translated &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;-labeled methionine, different truncated forms (N: 1&#x02013;340 amino acids &#x0005b;aa&#x0005d;, C: 762-1162 aa, and NC: 1&#x02013;32&#x00037;&#x00302;929-1162 aa) of LANA with myc tag were incubated with glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-fused Elongin B (Elo. B) or Elongin C (Elo. C) beads. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, LANA did not bind Elongin B, whereas it clearly bound to Elongin C. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of LANA predominantly interacted with Elongin C. This was further confirmed by reverse immunoprecipitation (IP) using a myc-tagged LANA N truncated polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6). In further experiments, association between LANA and the Elongin BC complex was assessed in co-IP experiments. Interestingly, Elongin B efficiently precipitated with the amino-terminal domain of LANA only when incubated along with Elongin C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, compare lanes 6 and 7).</p><p>To specifically address the question as to whether or not LANA does associate with the Elongin BC complex in KSHV-infected cells, co-IP assays were done in PEL cells positive for KSHV as well as an isogenic set of BJAB cell lines with and without KSHV infection. The results of this assay nicely showed that LANA associates with Elongin B as well as Elongin C in the PEL cell line BCBL-1 as well as in a KSHV-infected BJAB cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). This suggests that LANA does exist in complex with Elongin BC in KSHV-positive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The LANA/Elongin BC Complex Interacted with a Cul5/Rbx1 Module</title><p>The Elongin BC complex was shown to be involved in ubiquitylation as a component of the ECS E3 complex. To determine whether the Elongin BC complex could function as an adaptor which links LANA to a Cullin/Rbx1 module, thus reconstituting an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, IP assays against myc tag were performed on lysates of Saos-2 cells cotransfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-Rbx1 and HA-Cullin (Cul2 or Cul5) in the presence or absence of myc-tagged LANA expression vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

Further experiments with or without Elongin BC coexpression demonstrated that LANA&#x02013;Elongin BC complex did assemble with the Cul5/Rbx1 module to reconstitute a multiprotein complex containing LANA, Elongin BC, Rbx1, and Cul5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) and the Elongin BC complex can increase the affinity of LANA interaction with Cul5 and Rbx1 module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The SOCS-Box&#x02013;Like Motif Is Essential for LANA Association with Cul5&#x02013;Elongin BC Complex</title><p>A well-known family of Elongin BC&#x02013;interacting proteins, including <italic>VHL</italic> tumor suppressor and SOCS proteins, has been recently identified as SOCS-box proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. These proteins directly interact with Elongin BC through their conserved BC-box motif &#x0005b;(A/P/S/T)L-x<sub>3</sub>-C-x<sub>3</sub>-(A/I/L/V)&#x0005d; and associate with Cullin proteins through the conserved Cul-box motif &#x0005b;&#x003a6;xxLPxP&#x0005d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, the two Cul boxes, the Cul2 box and the Cul5 box, are specific for distinguishing binding with the different Cullin proteins (Cul2 or Cul5). To determine whether LANA interacts with Elongin BC and the Cullin protein through its SOCS-box motif, we first aligned the sequence of LANA with <italic>VHL</italic> and SOCS (1, 2, and 3) proteins. Our analysis showed that LANA probably also contains an SOCS-box&#x02013;like motif based on the hydrophobic homology of consensus sequences. However, the BC box and Cul box in this viral SOCS-box motif are atypical as distinguished from the BC box which is usually close to the Cul box found in SOCS-box motifs of cellular proteins. In KSHV LANA these motifs were separately located from each other in the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal domains. Furthermore, in contrast to the <italic>VHL</italic> Cul2 box and SOCS protein Cul5 box, the LANA Cul box was significantly similar to the Cul box of the SOCS protein family. This supports the evidence of LANA associated with Cul5, not Cul2, protein in the IP assay above. Additionally, the ORF73 homolog of LANA encoded by other gammaherpesvirus, including the rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) or herpesvirus saimiri (HVS A11 and C488), also contains a similar SOCS-box&#x02013;like motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).</p><p>To confirm that LANA associates with Elongin BC and Cullin 5 protein through its BC-box and Cul box motif, the corresponding site-specific mutation and deletion of the LANA SOCS-box&#x02013;like motifs were generated. Co-IP assays using different LANA mutants showed that the BC-box motif deletion mutant resulted in a failure of LANA to bind with the Elongin BC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Additionally, LANA mutants with specific site mutations in the BC-box motif also resulted in a decrease in the ability of LANA to bind to the Elongin BC complex when compared with wild-type (WT) LANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). LANA binding with Cul5/Rbx1 module and Elongin BC complex was completely disrupted when the SOCS-box motif was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Cul5 is known to interact with Elongin BC complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b045">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, when the LANA Cul-box motif deletion mutant was coexpressed with Elongin BC and tested for binding to the Cul5/Rbx1 module and Elongin BC complex, we observed that the LANA mutants with Cul5 box deletion had same remaining binding activity to the Cul5/Rbx1 module and Elongin BC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). To confirm Cul-box motif is necessary for LANA to specifically bind Cul5 protein, further experiments were performed and demonstrated that LANA with the Cul-box deleted lost binding to the Cul5 protein when assayed without the Elongin BC complex coexpression (unpublished data). Taken together, these data suggest that these motifs are critical for LANA interaction with the Elongin BC/Cul5/Rbx1 module and indicate that BC-box motif and Cul-box motif are likely to be in close proximity in terms of the spatial structure of the LANA protein in order to constitute an intact SOCS-box motif.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The LANA&#x02013;Elongin BC Complex Is Capable of Assembling with Cul5/Rbx1 Module to Reconstitute an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase</title><p>To investigate whether the LANA&#x02013;Elongin BC&#x02013;Cul5&#x02013;Rbx1 complex possesses ubiquitin ligase activity, the complex was immunoaffinity purified and assayed for its ability to activate formation of polyubiquitin chains by the E2 ubiquitin&#x02013;conjugating enzyme Ubc5a in the presence of ATP, the E1 ubiquitin&#x02013;activating enzyme Uba1, and GST-ubiquitin.

The results showed that the level of WT LANA protein remained constant for at least 24 h after treatment of cyclohexamide to cells cotransfected with LANA along with Elongin BC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, left panel, and 4B). However, in the absence of cotransfected Elongin BC when an SOCS-box deletion mutant of LANA was used, almost 50&#x00025; of the LANA protein was lost within 5 h. Thus, WT LANA protein exhibits increased stability when coexpressed with Elongin BC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020116-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, right panel, and 4B). In contrast to WT LANA, the &#x00394;SOCS LANA mutant exhibited similar instability in the presence or absence of cotransfected Elongin BC (unpublished data), suggesting a requirement for the SOCS-box&#x02013;like motif of LANA for enhanced stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Levels of the Tumor Suppressors <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>VHL</italic> Are Significantly Reduced in LANA-Expressing Cells</title><p>To determine the effect of LANA on targeted protein degradation, we examined the endogenous levels of some cellular tumor suppressors (such as <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>VHL</italic>) expression in KSHV-positive (BCBL-1, JSC-1, BC-3, and BC-1) and -negative (BJAB, Louckes, and DG75) cell lines.

The KSHV-encoded latent protein LANA was originally identified as a major viral antigen whose expression plays a crucial role in replication and maintenance of the viral episomes in PEL cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b048">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we demonstrated that the KSHV-encoded LANA protein interacts with the Elongin BC complex through the binding of Elongin C to the LANA BC-box motif located within its amino terminus. The LANA&#x02013;Elongin BC complex was capable of assembling with a Cullin/Rbx1 module to reconstitute a multiprotein complex with ubiquitin ligase activity. Furthermore, the facts that LANA only associated with Cul5, and not with Cul2, and that a mutation in the Cul-box motif of LANA at its carboxyl terminus abolished Cul5 binding in the absence of Elongin BC indicate that LANA can directly interact with Cul5. Interaction of the Elongin BC complex with the BC box markedly increased the stability of LANA protein, suggesting that it may be necessary to protect LANA from degradation in order to assemble the functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, as previously proposed for SOCS-box family proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;.

Binding of the Elongin BC complex served to stabilize LANA, and binding to Cul5 provided a bridge to recruit Rbx1 and activate the ubiquitin-conjugating process.</p><p>Ubiquitin conjugation to protein substrates is strictly regulated by the specificity of the ubiquitin&#x02013;protein E3 ligase complex. Therefore, identification of key regulators of angiogenesis in human cancers targeted for proteasomal degradation and mediated by KSHV-encoded LANA is highly significant. Previous evidence has shown that HIF-1&#x003b1; is a critical regulator of numerous cellular growth factors and can also function as a regulator of tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis and is commonly overexpressed in a number of human cancers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b054">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;.

The Cul5&#x02013;Elongin BC complex was shown to interact with a number of SOCS-box&#x02013;containing proteins, such as MUF1, ASB2, and the SOCS family of proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020116-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;.
