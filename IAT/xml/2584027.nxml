In addition, the meiosis-specific septin Spr28 displays similar behavior, suggesting that this is a common feature of septins. Septin association to microtubules is a consequence of the nutrient limitation signal, since it is also observed when haploid cells are incubated in sporulation medium and when haploid or diploid cells are grown in medium containing non-fermentable carbon sources.

Septin association to microtubules also occurs during growth in non-fermentable carbon sources.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that produces the haploid cells needed for sexual reproduction. Completion of meiosis is normally coupled to differentiation programs that produce gametes. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, sporulation is triggered in diploid cells in the absence of nitrogen and in the presence of a non-fermentable carbon source, such as acetate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. During meiosis, one round of S phase is followed by two meiotic divisions that generate four haploid nuclei. During meiosis II, a differentiation program starts, resulting in the formation of spores (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Encapsulation of the four haploid nuclei into spores requires the modification of the spindle pole body (SPB) by the incorporation of several meiosis-specific proteins to form the meiosis II outer plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Once the meiosis II SPB outer plaque has been assembled, secretory vesicles coalesce on this structure to form flattened double-membrane sheets termed prospore membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The prospore membranes continue to expand during meiosis II, and at the time of nuclear division each prospore membrane completely engulfs the nuclear lobe to which it is anchored via the SPB. At the end of meiosis II, each prospore membrane closes around the daughter nucleus (and associated cytoplasm), creating immature spores. The final step of spore formation requires the <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of a spore wall, which occurs in the lumen between the two prospore membranes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). This spore cell wall is responsible for the stress resistance of spores.</p><p>Septins are a family of filament-forming proteins that play crucial roles in morphogenesis. In yeasts, during vegetative growth septins are normally assembled in a ring-like structure at the site where the septum between mother and daughter cells is to be placed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The structure, dynamics and regulation of septins are well known in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Their biological functions in vegetative yeast cells are two-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]: first, they act as a scaffold for anchoring other regulatory proteins that control the establishment of the septation site and cytokinesis, bud-site selection, and spindle positioning. Second, they form a diffusion barrier to control the molecular trafficking between mother and daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. There are seven septin genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In vegetative cells, the septin ring is composed of five septins: Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, Cdc12 and Shs1/Sep7. During the sporulation program, two additional septins, Spr3 and Spr28, are specifically induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In meiotic cells, transcription of two of the vegetative septins -<italic>CDC3 </italic>and <italic>CDC10- </italic>is also upregulated, while expression of <italic>CDC11, CDC12 </italic>and <italic>SHS1 </italic>is similar to vegetative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, the Ssp1 protein was recently proposed to be a non-conventional septin required for prospore membrane closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. During spore formation, septins disappear from the bud neck and relocalize later to specific regions of the developing spore. In early meiosis II, septins are assembled as four ring-like structures surrounding each SPB, after which they expand into a pair of bars or sheets that run parallel to the long axis of the prospore membrane as it grows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. After closure of the prospore membrane, the septins become diffusely localized at the spore periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Even though septins are closely associated with the prospore membrane, disruption studies have revealed only modest sporulation defects in septin mutants, suggesting that septins may function redundantly in spore formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Septin organization onto the prospore membrane requires Gip1, a sporulation-specific regulatory subunit of the Glc7 protein phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. During sporulation, Gip1 and Glc7 colocalize with septins throughout prospore membrane formation. Mutation of <italic>GIP1 </italic>leads to the failure of septins to localize to the prospore membrane, indicating that Gip1 may organize and form part of the septin complex.</p><p>Even though septin localization has been reported during spore formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], no data exist in regards to septin localization during the early phases of meiosis, from disassembly of the vegetative bud neck septin ring to the formation of the ring-like structures that surround the prospore membrane. Here, we provide evidence that the nutrient limitation signal that triggers the sporulation process also induces the disassembly of the septin bud neck ring and relocalization of the septin subunits to the nucleus. Septins remain associated with microtubules during the meiotic divisions, rather than being dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and later, during the spore morphogenesis program, they are detected associated to the nascent prospore membranes surrounding each nuclear lobe. Septin association to microtubules was also observed when cells were grown vegetatively in media containing non-fermentable carbon sources, such as acetate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cdc11 localizes with microtubules during meiosis I and meiosis II</title><p>Previous studies reported that the Cdc11 septin localizes to the prospore membranes at the end of meiosis II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Some fluorescence associated with the microtubules was also observed, although it was attributed to the strong tubulin signal. To analyze the localization of Cdc11 during the different phases of meiosis in greater detail, indirect immunofluorescence was used. The wild-type strain AN120 was incubated in sporulation medium and aliquots were collected at different times after the induction of sporulation. Septin localization was analyzed using anti-Cdc11 antibodies. Samples were stained with DAPI to monitor progression through meiosis. The results obtained indicated that Cdc11 clearly localized in a pattern that was reminiscent of the SPB and the astral microtubules during early meiosis. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, cell 1). During later stages of meiosis, Cdc11 localized to spindle microtubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, cells 2&#x02013;3) during meiosis and the prospore membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, cells 4&#x02013;5), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Finally, in post-meiotic cells, Cdc11 appeared uniformly distributed throughout the membranes that surrounded the developing spore (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, cell 6).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cdc11 localization during meiosis</bold>.

During meiosis I, Cdc11 was first observed in prophase cells in a structure that was coincident with the SPB and microtubules, as judged by the similar pattern observed for septins and microtubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, cell 1). During metaphase I and anaphase I, microtubules assembled the meiosis I spindle in the nucleus, and septin localization was also coincident (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, cells 2&#x02013;3). As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], at the onset of meiosis II a fraction of Cdc11 was detected concentrated in ring-like structures that surrounded the four spindle-pole bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, cell 4), which corresponded to the first stages of prospore membrane assembly, although some fluorescence was also associated with the meiotic spindle. In the later stages of meiosis II (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, cells 5&#x02013;6), Cdc11 appeared localized around the prospore membrane as it expanded to engulf the nuclear lobes and also around the spores. In all cases, a fraction of Cdc11 remained associated with the microtubules during meiosis II until final disassembly of the spindle, at which time Cdc11 was only found in the membranes surrounding the spores (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, cell 7). Thus, Cdc11 co-localized with the tubulin cytoskeleton during meiosis I and meiosis II.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cdc11 localizes to tubulin cytoskeleton during meiosis before its association with the prospore membrane</bold>.

(C) Cdc11 and Tub1 co-immunoprecipitate during sporulation. Protein extracts prepared from sporulating cells carrying TUB1-GFP (sporulation) or grown to mid-logarithmic phase (vegetative) were incubated in the presence (lane 3) or absence (lane 1) of anti-Cdc11 antibody. Extracts from the wild-type strain grown in the same conditions were used as controls (lane 2). Proteins were probed with anti-GFP antibody. The lower panels show a Western blot of the extracts used for the immunoprecipitations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-9-55-2"/></fig><p>The specificity of the staining was assessed using several controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Wild-type exponentially growing cells were stained with anti-Cdc11 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, cell 1) or doubly stained with anti-Cdc11 and anti-tubulin antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, cell 2). No Cdc11 signal was detected associated with microtubules or the mitotic spindle in any of the two controls. To further confirm the specificity of the staining, immunofluorescence was also performed in sporulating wild-type cells using anti-GFP antibodies and either of two secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa 488 and anti-mouse Alexa 633). No staining was detected in these controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, cells 3 and 4). Thus, these results rule out the possibility that the apparent Cdc11 localization to the microtubules might be due to mixed signals from different channels or non-specific antibody binding. They also confirm that Cdc11 is indeed associated with the spindle during greater part of meiosis.</p><p>To examine the localization of Cdc11 and microtubules more precisely, we used a spectral confocal microscope. The results showed that Cdc11 and tubulin had a similar localization through the different phases of meiosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The co-localization between Cdc11 and tubulin after transfer to sporulation medium was observed in cells that had not initiated meiotic divisions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, cell 1). Cdc11 localization with microtubules was maintained during meiosis I and meiosis II (cell 2). However, analysis of the overlaid signals indicated that there was a partial overlap in the localization of Cdc11 and tubulin, since there were some regions in which the signal was perfectly coincident, but also other regions in which only one of the signals was present. These results indicate that Cdc11 is associated with the microtubules and SPB during meiosis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, although the colocalization is not complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Septins interact with microtubules during sporulation</title><p>To obtain physical evidence of the interaction between septins and microtubules during sporulation, immunoprecipitation assays were used. A wild-type strain expressing <italic>TUB1-GFP </italic>was transferred to sporulation medium and cells were collected after 10 h to prepare protein extracts. DAPI staining of the culture indicated that around 40% of the cells had 4 nuclei and around 5% were binucleated at this time point. Samples were immunoprecipitated using anti-Cdc11 antibody and the presence of tubulin in the immunoprecipitates was analyzed using anti-GFP antibody. The results indicated that the anti-Cdc11 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate Tub1-GFP from protein extracts prepared from sporulating cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, lane 3). The Cdc11-Tub1 interaction was specific, since no Tub1-GFP was immunoprecipitated from cells lacking Tub1-GFP (lane 2) or when anti-Cdc11 was omitted from the reaction (lane 1). It has been reported that microtubules interact with the septin ring during vegetative growth, and that this interaction is necessary for the alignment of the spindle along the mother-bud axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To test whether the Cdc11-Tub1 physical interaction was also detected during vegetative growth, we repeated the immunoprecipitation from exponentially growing vegetative cells and in this case, it was not possible to detect physical interaction between Tub1-GFP and Cdc11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that Cdc11 not only colocalizes with microtubules but that it is physically associated with tubulin during meiosis as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Cdc10 and Spr28 also colocalize with microtubules during meiosis</title><p>To test whether other septins had a similar distribution to that observed for Cdc11, we analyzed the localization of two additional septins: Cdc10 and the sporulation-specific septin Spr28. To this end, we used strains carrying either Cdc10-GFP or Spr28-GFP and the localization of the proteins was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-GFP antibodies, since in our hands, the GFP fluorescence was very weak during meiosis I and could not be clearly distinguished from the cytoplasmic background. Cdc10 was also found associated with linear structures resembling meiotic spindles during meiosis I and meiosis II (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Similarly, the sporulation-specific septin Spr28 also localized to microtubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These results therefore suggest that other septins, not just Cdc11, associate with microtubules during meiosis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Cdc10 and Spr28 also localize with microtubules</bold>.

So, we decided to check if in the absence of some septins, such as the sporulation-specific septins Spr3 and Spr28, Cdc11 was able to localize correctly during sporulation. To test this, Cdc11 localization was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence in a <italic>spr3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>spr28</italic>&#x00394; double mutant in sporulating conditions. The results showed that Cdc11 localization in the double mutant was generally similar to that in the wild-type strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), and it was found associated with meiotic spindles during meiosis I and meiosis II. Upon induction of prospore membrane assembly, Cdc11 localized to the nascent prospore membranes, although Cdc11 did not display the concentrated bar-like structures seen in wild type cells. These results indicate that the Cdc11 interaction with microtubules and its assembly in the structure that surrounds each nuclear lobe does not require the sporulation-specific septins Spr3 and Spr28 suggesting structural differences between septin complexes localized to different sites.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>SPR3 </italic>and <italic>SPR28 </italic>are required for septin organization during meiosis II</title><p>The failure of Cdc11 to localize to bars during meiosis II in the <italic>spr3 spr28 </italic>strain was reminiscent of the localization previously described for Cdc11 and Cdc3 in sporulating <italic>spr3 </italic>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To investigate the requirements for septin organization in the prospore membrane during meiosis II further, the localizations of GFP fusions to five different septins -Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, Spr3, and Spr28- were analyzed during sporulation in <italic>spr3 </italic>and <italic>spr28 </italic>single mutants. In wild type cells, all five proteins localized in the bar pattern during meiosis II and were distributed uniformly around the prospore membrane in post-meiotic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In the <italic>spr28 </italic>single mutant, although the other four septins associated with the prospore membrane during meiosis II, they localized uniformly around the membrane rather than being restricted into bars. This indicates that Spr28 is necessary for the tight organization of septins on the prospore membrane. The phenotype of the <italic>spr3 </italic>mutant was even more severe. All four of the other septins are localized diffusely through the cytosol and failed to associate with the prospore membrane, though a weak association with the prospore membrane was sometimes seen, particularly for Cdc11. The delocalization of Cdc11-GFP visualized by GFP fluorescence is more dramatic than that seen using anti-Cdc11 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). However, in all cases it is clear that the sporulation-specific septins are important for the proper association of Cdc11 with the prospore membrane during meiosis II.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of septins in the prospore membrane of sporulating cells</bold>.

It has been reported that meiotic cells treated with benomyl arrest in G1 if microtubule perturbation occurs as they enter the meiotic cycle and in G2 if they are already undergoing the pre-meiotic S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To completely depolymerize the microtubules without affecting progression through meiosis, cells were incubated in sporulation medium for 10 h and then transferred to sporulation medium containing 120 &#x003bc;g/ml benomyl. After 15 minutes of incubation with the drug, the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence using anti-Cdc11 and anti-tubulin antibodies. Progression through meiosis was monitored by staining the cells with DAPI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Even though around 70% of the cells had completed meiosis II at this time point, cells in previous stages of meiosis were also present at lower frequency, and some examples are shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>. Exposure to benomyl caused a complete depolymerization of microtubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, cells 1&#x02013;3), and only the SPBs exhibited reactivity with anti-tubulin antibodies (cells 1&#x02013;2). Interestingly, microtubule disorganization also resulted in Cdc11 delocalization from the linear structures found during early phases of meiosis, and this septin was only detected associated with the tubulin remaining in the SPBs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, cell 1) or diffuse in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, cell 2). However, in late meiosis II cells and post-meiotic cells, in which Cdc11 was found associated respectively with the microtubules and the prospore membrane or the prospore membrane only, microtubule depolymerization had no effects on Cdc11 localization on the prospore membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, cell 3), suggesting that Cdc11 association with the prospore membrane is independent of microtubules and tubulin. In a mock-treated culture, no effects on microtubule or Cdc11 localization were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, cells 4&#x02013;5). Therefore, these results indicate that Cdc11 localization to the meiotic spindle requires the stability of the microtubule cytoskeleton.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Cdc11 localization to microtubule does not require Gip1</bold>.

However, after 1 h of incubation in sporulation medium, Cdc11 was found to be associated with microtubules in more than 90% of the cells.

Spo20 is a sporulation-specific protein that is required for spore morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Spo20 is necessary for the coalescence of precursor vesicles on the SPB to form the prospore membrane, and it localizes to this nascent structure during metaphase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Colocalization experiments using GFP-Spo20<sup>51&#x02013;91 </sup>and anti-Cdc11 revealed that during metaphase II, Spo20 started to accumulate around the SPB and nascent prospore membranes, and Spo20 localization to this region was usually detected before Cdc11 appearance at the PSMs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, cell 1). Cdc11 started to assemble the ring-like structures that colocalized with Spo20 in metaphase II (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, cell 2), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As the prospore membrane grew in size during anaphase II, Cdc11 signal increased at the prospore membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, cell 3). The association with the prospore membrane was then maintained in post-meiotic cells during spore development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, cell 4). These results suggest that the signal that induces Cdc11 localization to the nascent prospore membranes is dependent on the initiation of the differentiation program and occurs after prospore membrane assembly has started.</p></sec><sec><title>Septin association to microtubules is dependent on the nutrient starvation signal</title><p>When entering sporulation, diploid cells are exposed to two different nutritional stimuli, exposure to a non-fermentable carbon source and nitrogen deprivation. As a consequence of these signals, diploid cells initiate a developmental program that promotes the formation of spores. To test whether bud neck septin ring disassembly and relocalization of the septin subunits to the microtubules was a consequence of the induction of the meiotic program or a response to the nutrient starvation signal, Cdc11 localization was analyzed in the AN117-16D strain, one of the parental haploid strains of AN120. Haploid cells were incubated for 24 h in YPAcetate medium before transfer to the sporulation medium, samples were removed at different time-points and stained with anti-Cdc11 antibody to analyze Cdc11 localization. The results indicated that Cdc11 associates to microtubules in haploid cells with similar kinetics to that previously described for diploid cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, right panel). Thus, these data indicate that septin relocalization to microtubules occurs shortly after transfer to sporulation medium, and that nutrient limitation, and not the induction of the sporulation program, must be the signal that triggers this reorganization of the septins.</p><p>In the course of these experiments, we noticed that some Cdc11 was present at the microtubules in some cells even at time 0 (cells growing in YPAcetate), suggesting that this septin could also interact with the tubulin cytoskeleton during vegetative growth depending on nutritional growth conditions. So, to analyze in further detail the nature of the nutrient signal, we studied Cdc11 localization in haploid cells that were vegetatively grown in different media, collecting samples at different stages of the growth curve. We used media containing different carbon sources (such as YPD, YPAcetate and YPGlycerol) and media containing poor nitrogen sources (see Materials and Methods) to distinguish different nutritional stimuli. Our results showed that nitrogen starvation did not alter the distribution of Cdc11 compared with cells grown in YPD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). However, growth in non-fermentable carbon sources, such as acetate and glycerol, resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells displaying microtubule staining or a mixed pattern, both the neck and microtubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Other carbon sources, such as glucose or raffinose, did not modify septin localization at the bud neck (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and data not shown). Thus, these data suggest that Cdc11 translocation from the neck to the microtubules depends on the nutritional signal, primarily on the carbon source, and this response to the carbon source is enhanced by nitrogen starvation.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Non-fermentable carbon sources induce Cdc11 localization to microtubules</bold>.

Both strains (<italic>rho</italic><sup>+ </sup>and <italic>rho</italic><sup>-</sup>) were grown in YPD overnight and the cells were then inoculated to YPAcetate to analyze Cdc11 localization when cells cannot respirate. The results indicated that Cdc11 distribution (neck or microtubules) was similar in the two strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). To confirm this result, the haploid strain AN117-16D (<italic>rho</italic><sup>+</sup>) was grown in YPAcetate to mid-logarithmic phase and transferred to AcK 2% (the strongest inducer of Cdc11 association to microtubules observed) with or without sodium azide to inhibit respiration and Cdc11 distribution under these conditions was analyzed. Samples were taken at different times after the inoculation and stained with anti-Cdc11 antibodies. No significant differences were observed between the two conditions, (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>) suggesting that inhibition of the electron transfer chain does not interfere with septin localization to microtubules. Together, these results indicate that septin relocalization to microtubules is not a consequence of the induction of the sporulation program, but it is specifically induced by a nutritional signal depending on the carbon source. Furthermore, the metabolic change from fermentation to respiration does not promote septin association with microtubules.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Septins are conserved GTP-binding proteins that play essential roles in morphogenesis in fungi and higher eukaryotic cells. In budding yeast, septins form a series of filaments that assemble as a ring at the bud neck during vegetative growth. Septin rings are thought to function as a scaffold to recruit proteins to the bud neck and as a boundary domain to restrict diffusion during budding and cytokinesis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). Previous reports have shown that in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>septins localize to the PSM during sporogenesis, although it is not known what their function is in this process. It has been proposed that septins could be required for the correct assembly of PSMs, although mutants lacking several septins have no defects in spore formation, which suggests that septins could act redundantly during this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the course of the analysis of the role of the Cdc15 kinase during sporulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we used Cdc11 as a marker for analysis of PSM morphology by indirect immunofluorescence and noticed that Cdc11 had a localization pattern similar to that of the microtubule cytoskeleton at early time-points of the sporulation time-course. In addition, previous reports had already observed the localization of several septins, such as Cdc11 or Spr3, at the microtubules although it was assumed that it was a cross of fluorescence channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><sec><title>Dynamic behavior of septins during sporulation</title><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, septin localization at the bud neck during vegetative growth is relatively constant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. By contrast, our results show here that septins localization and behavior is much more variable through the process of sporulation. Analysis of septin localization during sporulation has been addressed by using two different techniques, <italic>in vivo </italic>analysis using GFP fusions and immunofluorescence in fixed cells. Microtubule association of Cdc11 and other septins was mainly detected by indirect immunofluorescence, while it was not detected using GFP fusions. Conversely, prospore membrane localization was clearly seen with both techniques. One possible reason to explain these differences is the relative amounts of septins associated with these two structures. It could be that the fraction of septins that interact with the microtubule cytoskeleton is low and that its interaction is very dynamic, making difficult its detection <italic>in vivo</italic>. On the other hand, fixation of the cells for immunofluorescence could stabilize the fraction of septins associated to microtubules or modify the proteins, facilitating its detection with specific antibodies.</p><p>During sporulation, Cdc11 localizes to different cell compartments; the SPBs, astral microtubules (cytoplasm), the meiotic spindle (nucleus) and the PSM. The association of Cdc11 with microtubules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments, although our results do not indicate whether the interaction between tubulin and septins is direct or mediated by other proteins. Furthermore, analysis of Cdc10 and Spr28 localization indicated that septin-microtubules interaction during sporulation is not exclusive to Cdc11, but it is a characteristic of other septins as well. Spr28 and Cdc10 localization to the microtubules was weak but both proteins strongly accumulated at the PSMs later in sporogenesis, whereas the Cdc11 signal was more intense in the microtubule cytoskeleton and declined during spore wall formation. Colocalization of Spr28-GFP and Cdc11 (data not shown) supported the idea that affinity for microtubules or the PSM is different. Although this observation should be verified in greater detail, it is possible that these differences only reflect the different temporal pattern of expression of the genes during sporulation, since <italic>SPR28 </italic>and <italic>CDC10 </italic>are induced as middle sporulation genes while <italic>CDC11 </italic>is constitutively expressed, but at a lower level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Our experiments show that tubulin-Cdc11 interaction and Cdc11-PSM interaction during sporulation are independent. This is supported by several experiments: First, depolymerization of the microtubule cytoskeleton using benomyl resulted in delocalization of the fraction of Cdc11 that was associated to tubulin, but it had no effect on those molecules that were localized to the PSM. In contrast, the absence of <italic>GIP1 </italic>is sufficient to disorganize septins at the PSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], but has no effects on the septins localizing to the microtubule cytoskeleton. Second, nutritional experiments and the fact that Spo20 vesicles arrived earlier than Cdc11 to the meiotic outer plate of the SPB suggests that Cdc11 localization to microtubules and PSM are independently regulated and respond to different signals. Thus, our results clearly indicate that Cdc11-microtubule association is triggered by a nutritional signal and also occurs during vegetative growth, while septin-PSM association is part of the developmental program that leads to the production of spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The genetic requirements for these different localizations are also distinct during sporulation. During vegetative growth, absence of an essential septin results in defects in the localization of the other septins and septin ring disassembly. In contrast, during sporulation, Cdc11 can localize to microtubules in the absence of <italic>SPR3 </italic>and <italic>SPR28 </italic>or <italic>GIP1</italic>, but its subsequent localization on the prospore membrane is altered. In the absence of <italic>SPR28</italic>, the remaining septins cannot form discrete bars but are localized uniformly around the prospore membrane throughout meiosis II. Mutation of <italic>SPR3 </italic>is distinct from <italic>spr28</italic>&#x00394; in that not just the sheets, but the association of the remaining septins with the prospore membrane is greatly reduced. In this respect, mutation of <italic>SPR3 </italic>resembles a <italic>gip1 </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, though the function of the septins at the prospore membrane remains obscure, the sporulation-specific septins play direct and distinct roles in the organization of septin complexes during sporulation. The differential genetic requirements for septin localization at different stages of sporulation suggest that the organization of the septins themselves is changing during this process. It is noteworthy that the ability of Spr3 to associate with other septins depends on the phase of the life cycle. When ectopically expressed in vegetative cells, Spr3 does not localize with other septins at the bud neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Taken together, these observations suggest that both the localization and the organization of the septins are changing dynamically throughout sporulation.</p><p>One possible explanation for these observations is that the stoichiometry of the septin subunits could be different during the successive phases of the sporulation process, and these differences could be important for their association to microtubules or PSM. Structural studies of mammalian septins suggest that the basic organization of a septin filament is a heterotrimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It may be that different combinations of septins produce filaments with different properties. If so, understanding what these changes are and how they are regulated in yeast could prove insightful in other organisms which, like <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, express more than three septin proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Septin-Tubulin interactions</title><p>Septin-tubulin interactions had been previously observed in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but this interaction was not analyzed in this organism. However, in mammalian cells, septins localize not only to the plasma membrane but also throughout the cytoplasm, interacting with the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons, where they act as a scaffold for cytoskeleton-binding proteins (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). For example, the mammalian septin Sept9 (formerly known as MSF) colocalizes during interphase with actin, microtubules and another mammalian septin, Sept2 (Nedd5) during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Sept2 filaments are associated with actin fibers, and play a role in stabilization of actin stress fibers preventing actin turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It has also been shown that Sept2 and Sept9 can align along microtubules during interphase in PC12 and HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and Sept2 has been reported to associate with spindle microtubules during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, in mammalian cells septins not only interact with microtubules or actin cytoskeleton, but also control their organization and stability. This is the case of the mammalian septin complex composed of Sept2/6/7, which regulates microtubule stability through an interaction with the microtubule-binding protein MAP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] or actin organization through nuclear accumulation of the adaptor protein NCK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Moreover, it has also been suggested that Sept9 might have a function in microtubule organization during cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In yeast, it is unlikely that septins may play a similar role in microtubule cytoskeleton organization, although it has been reported that microtubules interact with the septin ring to align the mitotic spindle along the mother-bud axis during vegetative growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Septin localization to microtubules and nutritional stimuli</title><p>In unicellular organisms, sporulation is a process necessary for cells to survive when environmental conditions change. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, sporulation is triggered in response to nitrogen deprivation and, this process is induced when cells are grown in a non-fermentable carbon source such as acetate. Analysis of Cdc11 localization in sporulating cells indicated that Cdc11 localized to the microtubules shortly after transfer to sporulation medium, and the same pattern was observed also in haploid cells, suggesting that the nutritional stimulus is the main signal responsible for the change in septin distribution. A deeper analysis of Cdc11 localization to microtubules in haploid cells has resulted in the following conclusions: 1) Cdc11 associates with microtubules during vegetative growth under certain nutritional stimuli, so Cdc11 can interact with tubulin independently of the developmental stage; 2) Non-fermentable carbon sources, such as acetate or glycerol, were the signal triggering Cdc11 association with microtubules; 3) the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources <italic>per se </italic>and not the transition to the respiratory metabolism is the origin of the stimulus that promotes Cdc11 localization to the tubulin cytoskeleton; and 4) though nitrogen starvation cannot trigger septin relocalization to microtubules, the absence of nitrogen enhances the effect of a non-fermentable carbon source. Thus, these results suggest that Cdc11 has the ability to interact to tubulin at different moments of the yeast life cycle.</p><p>At the moment, we do not know the exact nature of the signal that triggers Cdc11 association to microtubules. One possibility is that it involves changes in the intracellular concentration of a secondary messenger, such as cAMP or intracellular pH, allowing the interaction of tubulin and septins, two families of structural proteins, to maintain cytoskeleton polymerization under these conditions. Whether these complexes constitute only a response to intracellular changes or they have an active role has yet to be elucidated. The first possibility in good agreement with results from mammalian cells, in which Sept2 polymerizes forming structures inside the cytoplasm without any defined function when actin cytoskeleton is perturbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In budding yeast, release of septins from the neck and polymerization of proteins in the cytoplasm could be a mechanism to store proteins temporarily until intracellular conditions would be reestablished to promote an active role of these proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Nutrient limitation in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>triggers the sporulation process, but it also induces the disassembly of the septin bud neck ring and relocalization of the septin subunits to the nucleus.

Plasmid pSB211 expressing <italic>CDC11-GFP </italic>was similarly constructed by amplification of the fusion gene from genomic DNA and subsequent cloning into pRS314 as an <italic>Xho</italic>I-<italic>Sma</italic>I fragment. pM2 (<italic>CDC10-GFP</italic>) and pRS316-<italic>CDC3-GFP </italic>have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy techniques</title><p>Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:100 and incubated for 1 h. Samples were washed 5 times with PBS-BSA 1% and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:200) for 1 h. After incubation, antibodies were removed by washing thoroughly with PBS buffer. The primary antibodies used were: anti-tubulin (Sigma 75168); anti-Cdc11 (sc7170, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-GFP (Living colors 8371, Becton Dickinson). Different secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488, 594 or 633 (Invitrogen Molecular Probes) were used. Samples were mounted in mounting media (Vectashield mounting medium; Vector Laboratories, CA) and observed under a Leica DMXRA microscope equipped for Nomarski optics and epifluorescence. Images were captured using a Photometrics Sensys CCD camera. Images shown correspond to a single focal plane. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Leica TCS SL spectral confocal microscope and the images were analyzed with the Leica Confocal Software.</p><p>For microtubule depolymerization, AN120 cells were sporulated for 10 h and then resuspended in 2% potassium acetate plus 120 &#x003bc;g/ml benomyl, prepared as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Cells were then fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde at 4&#x000b0;C and stained with anti-Cdc11 and anti-tubulin antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Protein extracts and immunoprecipitations were prepared as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Samples were separated in NUPAGE Novex 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) according to recommendations of the supplier. Proteins were transferred to P-Hybond membranes (GE Healthcare) using an X-Cell Sure Lock Mini-Cell system (Invitrogen). Anti-actin (69100, ICN), anti-Cdc11 (Y415 sc7170, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-GFP (Living colors 8371, Becton Dickinson) were used as primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (NA931V, GE Healthcare) or anti-rabbit antibody (NA934, GE Healthcare) were used as secondary antibodies. Detection of proteins was performed using the ECL kit (GE Healthcare).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MEP&#x02013;H performed most of the experiments, participated in their design and helped to draft the manuscript.
