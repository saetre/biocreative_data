The method is based on the suppressive PCR principle, associated with a Cot1 pre-hybridization step. In recent work we demonstrated that hyperprolificity observed in Booroola ewes is associated with a mutation in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor IB gene (<italic>BMPR-IB</italic>). We applied HSA between ovarian cDNA and DNA from four BAC clones containing <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> in order to test for the presence of other genes expressed in ovary and to isolate additional <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> exon sequences.

Typically, candidate regions are contained in a set of recombinant BACs or YACs, and candidate genes have to be searched for in a large stretch of DNA sequence. This step has often been an obstacle to gene discovery. Different methods have been elaborated to select region-specific cDNAs based on filter or oligo(dT)&#x02013;latex hybridization and amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c3">3</xref>), large scale genomic fragment screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c8">8</xref>), sequence analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c10">10</xref>), exon trapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c11">11</xref>) or PCR methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c12">12</xref>). Each method has its own advantages, but no single method is rapid and simple.</p><p> Here we describe a novel and simple method termed hybrid specific amplification (HSA) based on the suppressive PCR principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c13">13</xref>), which selects and amplifies the common sequences of two complex DNA samples while eliminating repeated sequences. The use of oligonucleotide adapters that form strong clamps ensures the specificity of the method, such that only fragments with two different adapters will be amplified whereas fragments with one type of adapter will not be selected due to the suppressive effect on PCR of the adapters.</p><p> Our previous work showed that a mutation in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor IB gene (<italic>BMPR-IB</italic>) is associated with hyperprolificity in Booroola sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c14">14</xref>). The Booroola locus is contained in a set of four ovine BACs. In human the corresponding chromosomal region has been shown to contain two identified genes: <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> and <italic>UNC5C</italic> (only <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> is expressed in the ovary).</p><p> In this context, we have used HSA to analyze ovarian genes contained in the four BACs. Preliminary results using HSA directly between BAC DNA and ovarian cDNA yielded a high percentage of repeated sequences (data not shown). In order to eliminate the repeated sequences, we introduced a Cot1 DNA prehybridization step in the method. The major part of the <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> sequence was obtained with HSA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Biological materials</title><p>Four ovine BACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c15">15</xref>) were used: 118b4, 300f2, 320h12 and 382c4.

The 25 &#x000b5;l PCR amplification mixture contained 1 U Platinum <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (Gibco BRL), 2.5 &#x000b5;l of 10&#x000d7; PCR buffer (Gibco BRL), 100 &#x000b5;M dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 &#x000b5;l of each primer (10 &#x000b5;M). The first PCR was carried out using 1 &#x000b5;l of diluted hybridization mixture and primers P1 and P2 with the following parameters in a Perkin Elmer 9600 thermocycler: 5 min initial elongation at 75&#x000b0;C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 66&#x000b0;C, 150 s extension at 68&#x000b0;C and 10 s at 94&#x000b0;C, followed by 7 min final extension at 68&#x000b0;C. A second PCR was done using 2 &#x000b5;l of the first PCR reaction and nested primers PN1 and PN2 with the same parameters as those mentioned above, except for the annealing temperature (68&#x000b0;C), extension temperature (72&#x000b0;C) and cycle number (15).</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning and analysis of HSA products</title><p>PCR products were inserted into pCR 2.1 TOPO using the TA Cloning Kit from Invitrogen. Inserts were amplified for 25&#x000a0;cycles using the PN1 and PN2 nested primers, monitored by 1&#x00025; agarose gel electrophoresis and single strand conformation analysis (SSCA) for uniqueness. PCR products were dotted on a Hybond-N nylon filter and hybridized with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled Cot1 DNA probe obtained by random priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c21">21</xref>).

RT&#x02013;PCR was carried out on 1 ng of ovine ovarian cDNA and PCR amplifications were conducted on BACs, genomic DNA and SMART cDNA.</p><p> Sequence analysis and alignments were carried out with GCG software (Genetics Computer Group, 1991) and Multalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c22">22</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Principle of hybrid specific amplification</title><p>A schematic representation of the method is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne087f1">1</xref>. This method is based on the suppressive PCR effect. The different hybrid products are described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne087f1">1</xref>. Fractions 1 and 2 belong either to the non-common fraction of the two DNA samples or to an abundant fraction of the samples (normalization effect). Only one kind of adapter is present at both ends of these DNA fragments. During PCR the adapters will form a &#x02018;panhandle-like&#x02019; structure with a strong clamping effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c13">13</xref>). This conformation prevents annealing of the primers and thus amplification of the fragment during each PCR step. This PCR suppressive effect was confirmed on <italic>Rsa</italic>I-digested genomic DNA ligated with a single type of adapter (data not shown). Fraction 3 represents heteroduplexes between genomic DNA (or cDNA) and Cot1 DNA and can only be amplified at a linear rate. The use of Cot1 DNA with no adapter allows attenuation of the repeated sequences in genomic DNA. Fraction 4 will not amplify due to the absence of adapters. Only fraction 5, which represents the common fraction of the two samples and has two different adapters, will be exponentially amplified.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of clones</title><p>HSA was applied to ovarian cDNA and the four BACs spanning the <italic>FecB</italic> locus. Insert sizes in the selected clones varied from 100 to 1000 bp. Screening for clones containing repeated DNA was performed by filter hybridization with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled Cot1 DNA. In the absence of Cot1 prehybridization in HSA virtually all clones were positive. When the prehybridization step was included only 20 of 480 clones were positive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne087f2">2</xref>), confirming that elimination of repeated sequences was efficient. The Cot1-positive clones were excluded from further analysis.</p><p> Cot1-negative clones were analyzed on agarose gels and 192&#x000a0;clones with an insert size of &#x0003e;200 bp were selected. A redundancy screening test was performed by SSCA; 52 clones were selected to be sequenced and 44 informative sequences were obtained.</p><p> Each clone was first compared to the ovine <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> cDNA sequence and to the human BAC 115m7. Sequence alignments allowed a distinction between three different classes of fragments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne087f3">3</xref>A). (i) Four fragments showing a complete sequence match between cDNA and genomic DNA were isolated, one corresponding to 5&#x02032;-UTR and three to 3&#x02032;-UTR sequences not previously identified. 5&#x02032;-RACE PCR and RT&#x02013;PCR with primers for known <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> exons and clone sequences confirmed that these sequences were effectively <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> sequences. (ii) We also observed cDNA fragments spanning consecutive exons between <italic>Rsa</italic>I restriction sites, spanning exons 3&#x02013;7 and 9&#x02013;10. No fragments spanning exons 7&#x02013;9 and 11&#x02013;12 were observed. (iii) The last class of clones is genomic fragments composed of exon and flanking intron sequence. In addition, one clone (marked by an asterisk in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne087f3">3</xref>A) flanked by <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> intron sequences matches the exon 11 sequence. The principle of HSA could not explain how this clone was isolated.</p><p> On sequence alignment seven clones did not match with <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> sequences or with any identified gene contained in the genetic interval (e.g. <italic>UNC5C</italic>). Further RT&#x02013;PCR analysis confirmed that these clones could have been isolated due to the presence of contaminant DNA. Therefore, HSA did not trap any other ovarian genes.</p><p> Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne087tb1">1</xref> summarizes the results obtained. With the use of Cot1 DNA only 4&#x02013;5&#x00025; of clones were assigned as repeated sequences. Amongst all sequenced clones, 85&#x00025; could be effectively identified as <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> sequences. The major part of the coding sequence of <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> was obtained by HSA and the method isolated fragments from the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTR regions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Amongst the <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> sequences we obtained two categories: 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTR sequences (fragments identical between cDNA and genomic DNA) and coding sequences which spanned consecutive exons or were composed of exon and flanking intron sequences. The hybridization process which enabled the generation of such hybrid molecules is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne087f3">3</xref>B. Hybridization actually occurs at only one end of the fragment. During the &#x02018;end-filling&#x02019; step the second adapter is synthesized on the other strand. This kind of fragment can thus be exponentially amplified. Characterization of such sequences requires sequence comparison against databases that are largely available, especially since the recent human genome sequencing efforts.</p><p> The application of HSA to our model was highly beneficial. One fragment corresponds to the 5&#x02032;-region, whose existence was confirmed by 5&#x02032;-RACE (data not shown). This sequence could be a non-coding exon of <italic>BMPR-IB</italic>, resulting from a different promoter or alternative splicing system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c23">23</xref>). Three fragments of the 3&#x02032;-UTR region were obtained. These fragments were sequenced and added to the <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> sequence. Apart from the inner fragments (exons 7&#x02013;9 and 11&#x02013;12), HSA isolated the major part of the <italic>BMPR-IB</italic> gene. Another objective of the application of HSA was to look for other ovarian genes. None of the other seven clones could be identified as ovarian genes. Computational analysis and RT&#x02013;PCR experiments also rejected this hypothesis.</p><p> One major improvement of HSA is the attenuation of repeated sequences. Thus, in most other methods, and in HSA without a Cot1 DNA prehybridization step, final analysis of the clones obtained reveals at least 25&#x00025; of clones containing repeated sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne087c12">12</xref>). Introducing a Cot1 prehybridization step prevents this problem. Only 5&#x00025; of the selected clones were assigned as repeated sequences.</p><p> A lot of methods have been elaborated to look for genes contained in BACs or YACs. Each strategy has its own advantages and is complementary to the others. Exon trapping works well but is labor intensive and may fail due to an interaction between host cell genes and the genes of interest. Moreover, the exon trapping method is not tissue specific. Results from computational prediction methods are only partially reliable and give inconsistent results. Direct hybridization selection has also found some use, but it is problematical with rarely expressed genes and repeated sequences.</p><p> We have described an additional approach to this problem. In contrast to other methods, HSA is a relatively simple and easy method to select chromosome-specific cDNA avoiding the repeated sequence background. Furthermore, HSA does not require specific equipment or large amounts of biological material. Moreover, this method has a wide range of applications as it can isolate every common fraction between two samples, whatever their nature.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gne087f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Schematic description of the HSA principle (only the major class of hybridization products is represented).
