While one F-box protein mediated signal transduction route has been discovered, mechanisms of auxin signalling are still partially unknown. Effects of differential accumulation of auxin have been closely analyzed in Arabidopsis roots, where auxin mediates stem cell specification, maintenance of the root meristem, patterning and growth. At the cellular level, auxin is interpreted differentially in a tissue- and dose-dependent manner. Auxin concentrations that promote cell expansion in shoot tissues inhibit cell elongation and promote cell division in roots suggesting that in addition to the importance of auxin distribution and local auxin concentration, differences of cell responsiveness also play critical roles. In the presence of auxin, Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins are recruited by the F-box protein TIR1 within the SCF<sup>TIR1</sup> complex, polyubiquitinylated and degraded <italic>via</italic> the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-Mockaitis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-Badescu1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

It remains, however, unknown whether auxin is required for ABP1-driven downstream responses and what is ABP1's role in plant root growth.</p><p>Primary root growth is sustained by cell division within the root meristem, which ensures the continuous production of new cells that elongate and differentiate.

The recombinant antibody was detected in enriched microsomal samples of ethanol induced SS12K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and we showed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments that the scFv12 produced in Arabidopsis interacts with AtABP1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). ABP1 was still detected in root samples expressing the scFv12 whereas the protein was not detected in induced antisense samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). At three days post germination (dpg), ethanol induced SS12S, SS12K and ABP1AS plants exhibited similar phenotypes displaying drastic root growth reduction of 60 to 80&#x00025; compared to ethanol induced control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g001">Figure 1D&#x02013;H</xref>). To determine which cellular alterations were responsible for such severe root growth defect, we performed a detailed analysis of SS12K and ABP1AS primary roots. The size of the meristem of ABP1 inactivated roots is about one third of that of controls which correlates with a reduced number of meristematic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g002">Figures 2 A&#x02013;H</xref>). Differentiated cortical cells reach a similar length as in control roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g002">Figure 2J</xref>), indicating that longitudinal elongation is not defective in ABP1 inactivated plants. The root diameter is, however, reduced by more than 40&#x00025; due to decreased radial expansion but the radial tissue organisation inherited from the embryonic root pattern is unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g002">Figure 2I, K, L</xref>).

To discriminate among these possibilities we first made use of the G2/M phase <italic>pCYCB1::DboxCYCB1;1:UIDA</italic> reporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-ColonCarmona1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> to evaluate the effect of ABP1 inactivation on the mitotic activity of meristematic cells. After short term ABP1 inactivation, expression of DboxCYCB1;1:GUS is severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g003">Figure 3A&#x02013;C</xref>), indicating that cells are no longer dividing and also that cells are not arrested in G2 or at the G2/M transition. Expression analysis of G1/S cell cycle markers revealed rapid changes in the mRNA accumulation of various markers after inactivation of ABP1, notably an increase in mRNA accumulation for the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED protein (RBR) and the E2Fc transcriptional repressor, and a moderate to strong decrease for Cyclin Dependent Kinase inhibitors (KRPs) and early D-type Cyclins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). D-type cyclins have been proposed to integrate various signals and to be limiting for the G1 to S phase transition through their interaction with CDK and further phosphorylation of RBR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-Menges1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesized that the rapid decrease in D-type Cyclin expression and/or the increase in RBR following inactivation of ABP1 could disturb the CYCLIN D/RBR regulatory pathway and thus contribute to the arrest of cell division. We then explored whether compensating for these expression changes by either overexpressing CYCD3.1 or reducing RBR expression would be sufficient to restore cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g003">Figure 3E&#x02013;L</xref>). In a wild-type background, increased CYCD3.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-Menges1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> or decreased RBR (rRBr line) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-Wildwater1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> do not change root growth rate and meristem size but supernumerary stem cells appear post-embryonically in the columella and lateral root cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g003">Figure 3E, G, I, K</xref>). We crossed these lines with SS12K plants and focused on root stem cells. In ethanol induced SS12K,CYCD3.1OE roots, supernumeray cells sometimes with aberrant cell plate formation are observed as in the CYCD3.1OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g003">Figure 3G,H</xref>), indicating that increased expression fo CYCD3.1 in ABP1 inactivated cells is sufficient to restore cell division in stem cells. Similarly, in ethanol induced SS12K,rRBr roots, additional stem cell layers are generated as in the rRBr control line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g003">Figure 3K, L</xref>). Therefore, both overexpression of CYCD3.1 and reduction of RBR bypass the cell cycle arrest mediated by inactivation of ABP1 in root cap stem cells, suggesting that the CYCLIN D/RBR pathway is operating downstream of ABP1. Future investigations will be necessary to identify the signaling pathway connecting ABP1 to the G1/S regulatory complex and to provide a comprehensive view of the role of ABP1 and auxin in cell division.</p><fig id="pone-0006648-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006648.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>ABP1 inactivation inhibits cell division in root meristem.</title><p>A&#x02013;C, Gus staining revealing DboxCYCB1;1-GUS pattern at the root tip of A, ethanol induced wild-type; B, non induced SS12K and C, 24 h ethanol induced SS12K.

We analysed the effect of exogenous auxin on the major auxin responses: cell division, cell elongation and gene expression. We first attempted to reactivate cell division in the root meristem by treatment with various concentrations of exogenous auxin. Based on DboxCYCB1;1:GUS detection, we found that cell division cannot be reactivated in root meristem of ABP1 inactivated plants whatever the auxin concentration applied (not shown), thus revealing an insensitivity to auxin of the cells towards the response of division.

This effect resulted from a reduced elongation of the cells as observed for the control at lower concentrations. Roots inactivated for ABP1 were less sensitive than control to primary root elongation inhibition caused by auxin, indicating that ABP1 is also required for this auxin response. Interestingly, it is not a complete insensitivity to auxin as observed for division but a shift in sensitivity suggesting that ABP1 is likely to contribute to this auxin response together with other regulators.</p><fig id="pone-0006648-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006648.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Inactivation of ABP1 impairs auxin responsiveness.</title><p>A, Auxin dependent root growth curve of ethanol induced Col0, ABP1AS and SS12K.

The permissive effect of auxin on cell division is dependent on ABP1. In root stem cells, the D-type CYCLIN/RETINOBLASTOMA (RBR) pathway acts downstream of ABP1 and controls the G1/S transition. In meristematic cells, ABP1 might also affect the D-type CYCLIN/RBR pathway but other critical regulators of the G1/S transition phase are dependent on ABP1 activity. ABP1 contributes to the auxin control of cell elongation by modulating a zone of competence for PLETHORA and by acting on the auxin-mediated regulation of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors. It is worthwhile noticing that expression of <italic>PLTs</italic> was reported to be regulated downstream of ARF transcription factors (Auxin Response Factors) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-Aida1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and consequently of Aux/IAAs.

Interestingly, this effect is consistent with auxin's permissive role in cell division. Based on analysis of root stem cells, ABP1 affects the D-type CYCLIN/RBR regulatory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006648-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Although the molecular link between ABP1 and these cell cycle regulators may not be direct, it is clear that ABP1 is essential for the regulation of the G1/S transition. Within the CYCLIN D/RBR pathway there are multiple potential targets, amongst which CDK inhibitors (KRPs) and E2F transcriptional factors are additional relevant targets. For example, E2Fc has been reported to negatively affect cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-delPozo1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and we cannot exclude that the increased accumulation of E2Fc mRNAs in ABP1 inactivated seedlings also contributes to the inhibition of cell division.

The E2Fc protein is however submitted to rapid degradation in an ubiquitin dependent manner and changes at the RNA level might not reflect the amount of protein.

By conferring on the root cells a relative sensitivity to auxin, ABP1 contributes to the regulation of cell behavior at the transition zone, likely contributing to deciphering the gradient of auxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-Grieneisen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-Blilou1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-Ljung1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and the cross-talk between auxin and cytokinin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-DelloIoio1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006648-DelloIoio2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.
