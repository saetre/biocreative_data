The inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis is characterized by depleted goblet cells and a reduced mucus layer, but the aetiology remains obscure. In this study we used random mutagenesis to produce two murine models of inflammatory bowel disease, characterised the basis and nature of the inflammation in these mice, and compared the pathology with human ulcerative colitis.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>By murine <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea mutagenesis we identified two distinct noncomplementing missense mutations in <italic>Muc2</italic> causing an ulcerative colitis-like phenotype. 100&#x00025; of mice of both strains developed mild spontaneous distal intestinal inflammation by 6 wk (histological colitis scores versus wild-type mice, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and chronic diarrhoea. Monitoring over 300 mice of each strain demonstrated that 25&#x00025; and 40&#x00025; of each strain, respectively, developed severe clinical signs of colitis by age 1 y. Mutant mice showed aberrant Muc2 biosynthesis, less stored mucin in goblet cells, a diminished mucus barrier, and increased susceptibility to colitis induced by a luminal toxin. Enhanced local production of IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IFN-&#x003b3; was seen in the distal colon, and intestinal permeability increased 2-fold. The number of leukocytes within mesenteric lymph nodes increased 5-fold and leukocytes cultured in vitro produced more Th1 and Th2 cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-13). This pathology was accompanied by accumulation of the Muc2 precursor and ultrastructural and biochemical evidence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in goblet cells, activation of the unfolded protein response, and altered intestinal expression of genes involved in ER stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and wound repair. Expression of mutated Muc2 oligomerisation domains in vitro demonstrated that aberrant Muc2 oligomerisation underlies the ER stress. In human ulcerative colitis we demonstrate similar accumulation of nonglycosylated MUC2 precursor in goblet cells together with ultrastructural and biochemical evidence of ER stress even in noninflamed intestinal tissue. Although our study demonstrates that mucin misfolding and ER stress initiate colitis in mice, it does not ascertain the genetic or environmental drivers of ER stress in human colitis.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Characterisation of the mouse models we created and comparison with human disease suggest that ER stress-related mucin depletion could be a fundamental component of the pathogenesis of human colitis and that clinical studies combining genetics, ER stress-related pathology and relevant environmental epidemiology are warranted.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Michael McGuckin and colleagues identify two mutations that cause aberrant mucin oligomerization in mice.

The two main types of IBD are Crohn's disease, which mainly affects the small bowel, and ulcerative colitis (UC), which mainly affects the large bowel (colon). Both types tend to run in families and usually develop between 15 and 35 years old. Their symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and unintentional weight loss. These symptoms can vary in severity, can be chronic (persistent) or intermittent, and may start gradually or suddenly. There is no cure for IBD (except removal of the affected part of the digestive tract), but drugs that modulate the immune system (for example, corticosteroids) or that inhibit &#x0201c;proinflammatory cytokines&#x0201d; (proteins made by the immune system that stimulate inflammation) can sometimes help.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Although the clinical and pathological (disease-associated) features of Crohn's disease and UC are somewhat different, both disorders are probably caused by an immune system imbalance. Normally, the immune system protects the body from potentially harmful microbes in the gut but does not react to the many harmless bacteria that live there or to the food that passes along the digestive tract. In IBD, the immune system becomes overactive for unknown reasons, and lymphocytes (immune system cells) accumulate in the lining of the bowel and cause inflammation. In this study, the researchers use a technique called random mutagenesis (the random introduction of small changes, called mutations, into the genes of an organism using a chemical that damages DNA) to develop two mouse models that resemble human UC and that throw new light on to how this disorder develops.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers establish two mutant mouse strains<italic>&#x02014;Winnie</italic> and <italic>Eeyore</italic> mice&#x02014;that develop mild spontaneous inflammation of the colon and chronic diarrhea and that have more proinflammatory cytokines and more lymphocytes in their colons than normal mice. 25&#x00025; and 40&#x00025; of the <italic>Winnie</italic> and <italic>Eeyore</italic> mice, respectively, have severe clinical signs of colitis by 1 year of age. Both strains have a mutation in the <italic>Muc2</italic> gene, which codes for MUC2 mucin, the main protein in mucus. This viscous substance (which coats the inside of the intestine) is produced by and stored in intestinal &#x0201c;goblet&#x0201d; cells. Mucus helps to maintain the intestine's immunological balance but is depleted in UC. The researchers show that the manufacture and assembly of Muc2 molecules is abnormal in <italic>Winnie</italic> and <italic>Eeyore</italic> mice, that less mucin is stored in their goblet cells than in normal mice, and that their intestinal mucus barrier is reduced. In addition, an incompletely assembled version of the molecule, called Muc2 precursor, accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; the cellular apparatus that prepares newly manufactured proteins for release) of goblet cells, leading to overload with abnormal protein and causing a state of cellular distress known as the &#x0201c;ER stress response.&#x0201d; Finally, the researchers report that MUC2 precursor also accumulates in the goblet cells of people with UC and that even the noninflamed intestinal tissue of these patients shows signs of ER stress.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that mucin abnormalities and ER stress can initiate colitis in mice. Results from animal studies do not always reflect what happens in people, but these findings, together with those from the small study in humans, suggest that ER stress-related mucin depletion could be a component in the development of human colitis. The results do not identify the genetic changes and/or environmental factors that might trigger ER stress in human colitis, but suggest that once initiated, ER stress might interfere with MUC2 production, which would lead to a diminished mucus barrier, expose the lining of the intestine to more toxins and foreign substances, and trigger local mucosal inflammation. The release of inflammatory cytokines would then damage the intestine's lining and exacerbate ER stress, thus setting up a cycle of intestinal damage and inflammation. Clinical studies to look for genetic changes and environmental factors capable of triggering ER stress and for ER-stress related changes in human UC should now be undertaken to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050054">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050054</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus Encyclopedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000249.htm">Crohn's disease</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000250.htm">ulcerative colitis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/crohns">Crohn's disease</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/colitis">ulcerative colitis</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Information and support for patients with inflammatory bowel disease and their caregivers is provided by the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ccfa.org">Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America</ext-link> and by the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nacc.org.uk">UK National Association for Colitis and Crohn's Disease</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin">mucins</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus">mucus</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="21"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Heazlewood CK, Cook MC, Eri R, Price GR, Tauro SB, et al.

In the large intestine mucus completely fills the crypts and forms a thick coating over the mucosal surface. MUC2 mucin is the major macromolecular constituent of intestinal mucus, and is responsible for its high viscosity and forming a protease-resistant matrix that retains molecules vital to host defence. MUC2 contains a large central O-glycosylated domain and N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich domains that homo-oligomerise &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;, forming a complex molecular lattice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. MUC2 is N-glycosylated in the ER, where initial homo-oligomerisation occurs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, and the complex then moves into the Golgi apparatus where O-glycosylation, the final stages of oligomerisation, and packaging into granules occur &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Mucins stored intracytoplasmically in granules form the characteristic goblet cell theca from where they are secreted constitutively and in response to stimuli.</p><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), characterized by chronic or recurrent relapsing gastrointestinal inflammation, are broadly grouped by clinical and pathological features into two groups&#x02014;Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Evidence from animal models indicates that failure to suppress immunity to the abundant intestinal foreign antigen load can cause inflammation. Maintaining the normal balance between competence to respond to intestinal pathogens while not generating an inflammatory response to commensals appears to depend on the integrity of the mucosal and epithelial barriers, proinflammatory signalling pathways (especially via NF-&#x003ba;B), and regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses in the intestine and draining lymphoid organs. Disruption of any of these components has been shown to result in intestinal inflammation in animal models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Defects in these components have been implicated in human IBD, although fundamental knowledge of underlying pathogenesis remains very poorly understood, with even the most well-established defect, <italic>CARD15</italic> mutations, elucidating only a subset of white patients with ileal Crohn's disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, and with a penetrance less than 4&#x00025;. Furthermore, the pathogenic pathways that distinguish UC from Crohn's disease remain obscure.</p><p>Goblet cell and secreted mucus phenotypes represent important differences between the two diseases: in Crohn's disease, there is typically an increase in goblet cells and a thicker mucus layer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas in UC there is a reduction in goblet cells, decreases in MUC2 production &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; and sulfation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, accumulation of MUC2 precursor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, and a reduction in secreted mucus. Although it remains unclear whether changes in mucus are causative or secondary to inflammation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, the lack of these changes in Crohn's disease indicate they are not a universal consequence of intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, a reduction in a specific biochemical fraction of colonic mucin has been described in UC patients and in their unaffected monozygotic twins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, and engineered changes in intestinal mucin glycosylation result in enhanced susceptibility to toxin-induced colitis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, raising the possibility that genetic defects in mucin physiology or biochemistry predispose to UC. On the other hand, in <italic>Muc2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice the colitis phenotype appears to arise only on a permissive genetic background &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, and transgenic depletion of goblet cells not only does not trigger spontaneous inflammation, it unexpectedly reduces dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colonic injury &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

Furthermore, despite an apparently normal mucus barrier, heterozygotes exhibited a restricted intestinal ER stress phenotype and an intermediate phenotype of sensitivity to luminal toxins, consistent with ER stress contributing to epithelial damage and environmentally induced inflammation. Finally, the presence of a large number of stressed cells within the intestinal epithelium and the production of IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-13, are likely to attenuate epithelial tight junction integrity, leading to the impaired epithelial barrier function we demonstrate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;.

The mutant strains contain fewer goblet cells due to apoptosis, less Muc2 is likely to be secreted per goblet cell due to misfolding and the UPR-initiated translational block, and the mucin that is secreted could be incorrectly oligomerised and affect the rheological properties of mucus. The relative importance of ER stress and changes to the mucus barrier cannot be easily distinguished, because they are inextricably linked and may well act in concert.

We also show concomitant expression of GRP78, providing biochemical evidence of ER stress.</p><p>The size and complexity of Muc2 are likely to render it particularly susceptible to aberrations in folding and assembly of the oligomeric complex. Hyperoligomerisation of the recombinant <italic>Winnie</italic> D3 domain caused retention in the secretory pathway, which is consistent with altered Muc2 homo-oligomerisation being the cause of ER retention in vivo. Even though N-terminal oligomerisation of Muc2 is thought to occur in the Golgi, the presence of ribosomes in vacuole membranes and the lack of O-glycans on the accumulated precursor show that aberrant oligomerisation with the <italic>Win</italic> mutation occurs in the ER. The complex nature of misfolded oligomerised Muc2 is likely to present a major challenge to the ER machinery responsible for denaturing and removing misfolded proteins from the ER for degradation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. The more severe ER stress in the goblet cells deep in the crypts of the proximal large intestine is consistent with the longer lifespan (15&#x02013;21 d) of these cells compared with the surface goblet cells in the proximal colon and goblet cells in the distal colon and small intestine (4&#x02013;5 d) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus the extended lifespan of goblet cells following mucosal damage could unmask genetic susceptibilities to ER stress and amplify the effects of environmental ER stressors.</p><p>Based on evidence from <italic>Winnie</italic> and <italic>Eeyore</italic>, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in oligomerisation domain-encoding exons of <italic>MUC2</italic> may identify individuals predisposed to intestinal disease. The D-domains of MUC2 share very high homology with the blood clotting glycoprotein von Willebrand Factor (vWF) which also forms homo-oligomers.

There are at least 30 nonsynonomous SNPs in the exons encoding MUC2 oligomerisation domains, warranting comprehensive studies in IBD focused on these <italic>MUC2</italic> exons.</p><p>Although MUC2 is the most likely candidate for misfolding mutations, mutations in genes encoding any proteins with a predilection for misfolding, as well as in the genes encoding ER chaperones, elements of the UPR, and/or detoxification proteins (e.g., <italic>MDR1</italic>) could trigger the ER stress pathway to colitis. The resultant UPR could lead to a translational block decreasing MUC2 synthesis, and the ER stress could cause MUC2 misfolding, even in the absence of mutations in MUC2, duplicating the ER stress/reduced mucus barrier phenotype. Similarly, inappropriate responses to the normal level of misfolding occurring in secretory cells could trigger the ER stress pathway to intestinal inflammation. Highlighting likely interindividual differences in the response to misfolded proteins, it was recently shown that the class of genes with the highest level of inherited variation in expression were genes involved in the UPR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Thus, a complex genetic basis for UC but involving the same pathway revealed by single alleles with strong effects (such as <italic>Win</italic> and <italic>Eey</italic>) is plausible. Furthermore, this mechanism could account for a complex interaction with environmental triggers. Candidate triggers include intestinal viruses, bacteria, dietary toxins, reactive oxygen species, and bile salts, which can directly cause or exacerbate ER stress. Furthermore, local inflammation itself can also enhance ER stress via the actions of reactive oxygen species and TNF-&#x003b1; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050054-b074">74</xref>&#x0005d;, demonstrating how a chronic cycle of ER stress, mucus depletion, and inflammation could arise.

Changes in production of other goblet cell molecules involved in barrier function and/or activation of immunity during goblet cell ER stress could also have important impacts.

Thus the severity of ER stress, the nature of the UPR, and the degree of inflammation in response to intestinal ER stress are likely to be dependent on a range of other genetic factors, consistent with the multiallelic nature of IBD.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations of This Study</title><p>Although the study shows that mice with aberrant mucin assembly and ER stress develop inflammation similar to human UC, the cellular and molecular pathways leading to inflammation remain to be fully characterized. There are also differences in the physiology of the intestine in the mouse, including the distribution and lifespan of goblet cells, that could influence translation of our findings to human physiology. Our study confirms previous studies showing signs of ER stress in UC but does not ascertain the genetic or environmental drivers of ER stress in UC, relate the ER stress to differing clinical phenotypes, nor explore the effects of treatment. Comprehensive, appropriately powered studies combining genetics, clinical pathology (including biochemical and ultrastructural assessment of ER stress), and environmental epidemiology are required to address the involvement of ER stress in human IBD.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The evidence is consistent with a model of UC pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050054-g013">Figure 13</xref>) in which ER stress due to genetic susceptibility and/or environmental factors results in MUC2 precursor accumulation and decreased production of glycosylated MUC2 by individual goblet cells leading to smaller/loss of goblet cell thecae, a reduced lifespan of individual goblet cells, and a decreased total MUC2 production. In this scenario a diminished mucus barrier would lead to greater toxin and antigen exposure, driving further ER stress, with both the depleted mucus barrier and ER stress triggering local mucosal inflammation. Local inflammatory cytokines could increase epithelial permeability and directly exacerbate ER stress through reactive oxygen species production, leading to an unresolving cycle of epithelial damage and inflammation. In this model of colitis, goblet cell ER stress and a diminished mucus barrier are intrinsically linked concurrent events, irrespective of whether the trigger is a genetic lesion predisposing to misfolding, a lesion resulting in an inappropriate UPR, or an environmental insult.</p><fig id="pmed-0050054-g013" position="float"><label>Figure 13</label><caption><title>A Model for ER Stress in the Pathophysiology of Intestinal Inflammation</title><p>This model recognizes that genetic and environmental factors can combine to invoke ER stress, reduced mucus production, and inflammation. Local inflammation can then exacerbate ER stress, potentially establishing a chronic cycle of inflammation in susceptible individuals.
