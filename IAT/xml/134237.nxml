Real-time QRT&#x02013;PCR assays were carried out on a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using intercalation of SYBR Green as the fluorescence reporter. Reactions were carried out using the SYBR Green kit from PE Applied Biosystems following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Isoform-specific real-time QRT&#x02013;PCR assays were designed to discriminate between RNAs including or excluding specific exons (see supplementary Table C and Fig. S1).

All primer pairs showed at least a 20 cycle difference between cDNA clones for exon inclusion and exon exclusion, indicating an &#x0223c;10<sup>6</sup>-fold specificity.

Primer pairs and sequencing conditions were developed to amplify 16 regions of the <italic>XPC</italic> gene spanning &#x0223c;33 kb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f1">1</xref> and supplementary Tables A and B). The human <italic>XPC</italic> gene was previously reported to have 15 exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c12">12</xref>). We found an additional 1.6 kb intron within exon 5 (between nucleotides 726 and 727) that splits this region into exons 5.1 and 5.2. The 16 exons of the human <italic>XPC</italic> gene range in size from 82 bp (exon 10) to 882 bp (exon 8) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f1">1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb1">1</xref>). The 15 introns vary from 0.08 kb (intron 11) to 5.4 kb (intron 1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f1">1</xref>). The nucleotide sequence in 10 regions was determined and submitted to GenBank (accession nos AF261892&#x02013;AF261901).

The human <italic>XPC</italic> gene intronic splice donor and acceptor site sequences and their location in the coding <italic>XPC</italic> sequence are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb1">1</xref>.</p><p>The information contents of the <italic>XPC</italic> splice donor and acceptor sites were evaluated using an information theory-based approach incorporating information weight matrices that reflect features of nearly 2000 published donor and acceptor sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c10">10</xref>). Information is an additive measure of sequence conservation and describes the degree to which a member contributes to the conservation of an entire sequence family in contrast to examining only the consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c13">13</xref>). Information content is defined as the number of choices needed to describe a sequence pattern, using a logarithmic scale in bits. The magnitude of the information content indicates how strongly conserved a base is in natural splice junction binding sites, with &#x0223c;2.4 bits being the apparent minimal functional value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c14">14</xref>). All but one of the <italic>XPC</italic> splice sites demonstrate information contents that range from 4.1 bits (donor splice site in intron 12) to 17.4 bits (acceptor splice site in intron 5.1), consistent with functional activity but with considerable variation in strength (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb1">1</xref>). The exception is the acceptor splice site of intron 3, which possesses a very low information content (&#x02013;0.1 bits).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA levels by real-time QRT&#x02013;PCR</title><p>Real-time QRT&#x02013;PCR is an extremely sensitive and specific technique for measurement of specific mRNA levels in human cells (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c15">15</xref>). For this study isoform-specific primers were designed using the same principles that have been developed for allele-specific PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c17">17</xref>). We first created an assay for <italic>XPC</italic> cDNA that includes exon 12 by designing a sense primer that recognizes the exon 11&#x02013;exon 12 junction (oCCB-331) and pairing it with an antisense primer that is contained in exon 12 (oCCB-337, supplementary Fig. S1 and Table C). This assay was applied to RT reactions from duplicate RNA samples from nine normal skin fibroblast cultures (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb2">2</xref>). Close agreement was found between duplicate samples. In addition, similar results were obtained using a second primer pair that detects the exon 12&#x02013;exon 13 junction (oCCB-333 and oCCB-335 in supplementary Fig. S1; data not shown). The normal level of <italic>XPC</italic> cDNA was 294 &#x000b1; 15.7 fg pXPC-3 with a range of 197&#x02013;348 fg based on measurement of message that contained exon 12 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb2">2</xref>). Assuming 100&#x00025; efficiency of the RT reaction, this corresponds to an average of &#x0223c;10 <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA molecules&#x0002f;cell. However, since we do not know the efficiency of the RT reaction, all real-time QRT&#x02013;PCR results will be expressed in terms of fg pXPC-3.</p></sec><sec><title>Relationship of splice acceptor information content to extent of exon 4 and 7 skipping</title><p>The information theory-based approach along with the exon recognition model of vertebrate splicing predicts that splice acceptors with high information content would be less likely to be associated with exon skipping than splice acceptors with low information content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c18">18</xref>). We found that the splice acceptor for exon 7 had an information content of 12.3 bits, while that for exon 4 had an information content of &#x02013;0.1 bits (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb1">1</xref>). This predicts that normal cells would contain a smaller amount of alternatively spliced <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA that skipped exon 7 than <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA that skipped exon 4. Isoform-specific primers were developed for QRT&#x02013;PCR to measure mRNA that skipped exon 7 (using oCCB-382, a primer that includes the junction of exons 6 and 8) and that skipped exon 4 (using oCCB-364, a primer that includes the junction of exons 3 and 5.1). These primers are designed only to detect exon skipping. For example, primer oCCB364 spans the exon 3&#x02013;exon 5.1 junction and has a 3&#x02032; two base mismatch with exon 4, which allows us to discriminate between the two isoforms (supplementary Fig. S1 and Table C). These were paired with primers oCCB-384 and oCCB-368, respectively.</p><p>RT reactions from normal fibroblasts contained extremely little detectable <italic>XPC</italic> cDNA that skipped exon 7 (nine normal fibroblast lines had a mean of 0.2 &#x000b1; 0.01 fg; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb2">2</xref>).

These three markers are in linkage disequilibrium and are consistent with a haplotype of PAT<sup>&#x02013;</sup>&#x0002f;intron 11 C&#x0002f;exon 15 A in &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of the donors and PAT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;intron 11 A&#x0002f;exon 15 C in &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of the donors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f3">3</xref>, lower).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of a splice acceptor polymorphism on exon 12 skipping</title><p>Information theory analysis indicated that an intron 11 splice acceptor site with an A at position &#x02013;5 would have a lower information content (5.1 bits) than a splice acceptor site with a C at that position (7.5 bits) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f2">2</xref>). This analysis would predict that <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA from cells with the A at &#x02013;5 would have a greater amount of alternatively spliced message that skipped exon 12 in comparison to cells with C at that position. A real-time QRT&#x02013;PCR assay was developed utilizing an isoform-specific primer that spans the exon 11&#x02013;exon 13 junction (oCCB-330; supplementary Fig. S1 and Table C) to measure <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA with deletion of exon 12. Skipping of exon 12 creates a premature stop codon which may trigger nonsense-mediated decay. Treatment of the fibroblasts with emetine prior to harvesting RNA stabilized this alternatively spliced product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c20">20</xref>). Emetine treatment elevated the level of alternatively spliced <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA isoforms that deleted exon 4, 7 or 12 approximately 4- to 7-fold (data not shown). Normal fibroblasts with the A&#x0002f;A genotype had a 2.6-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.005) greater proportion of alternatively spliced <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA with deletion of exon 12 in comparison with cells from donors with the C&#x0002f;C genotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f4">4</xref>A). The A&#x0002f;C heterozygotes had an intermediate level (1.8-fold, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.01) of increase in the proportion of <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA with deletion of exon 12 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f4">4</xref>A). Similar results were seen in the absence of emetine (data not shown).</p><p>The real-time QRT&#x02013;PCR assays were used to examine the relative proportion of <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA with deletion of exon 12 in a panel of 24 normal human tissues. While most tissues showed 0.1&#x02013;0.5&#x00025; skipping of exon 12, there was greater skipping (2&#x02013;5&#x00025; skipping) of exon 12 in muscle, bone marrow, fetal brain, plasma blood leukocytes and stomach (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Function of <italic>XPC</italic> cDNA with deletion of exon 12</title><p>A host cell reactivation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c21">21</xref>) was employed to assess the function of wild-type <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA and alternatively spliced mRNA that skipped exon 12. This assay measures the ability of cells to repair DNA damage in a UV-treated plasmid (which contained a luciferase reporter gene) 2 days after transfection <italic>in vivo</italic>. The three normal fibroblast strains that were homozygous for the <italic>XPC</italic> intron 11 C&#x0002f;C genotype had significantly higher post-UV relative luciferase activity than that of three normal fibroblasts with the A&#x0002f;A genotype (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f4">4</xref>B). The three normal fibroblasts with the A&#x0002f;C genotype had intermediate post-UV relative luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f4">4</xref>B). Post-UV host cell reactivation was also measured in a lymphoblastoid cell line (XPH310BE) from the parent of an XP patient who is heterozygous for a mutation in intron 11 that leads to a elevated level (15.6&#x00025;) of exon 12 skipping and from a normal donor (AG10107) with a low level (1&#x00025;) of exon 12 skipping. There was a significantly lower level of relative luciferase activity in the XP heterozygote cells (8.0&#x00025;) than in the normal cells (13.4&#x00025;) (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.04, one tailed <italic>t</italic>-test) (data not shown). Both the fibroblast and lymphoblast results indicate that an increasing proportion of alternatively spliced XPC mRNA that skips exon 12 is associated with decreased DNA repair activity in normal cells.</p><p>In order to directly assess the function of the <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA that skips exon 12 we co-transfected expression vectors containing either wild-type <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA or <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA with deletion of exon 12 along with UV-treated luciferase plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f5">5</xref>). Repair-deficient XP-C cells show very low post-UV luciferase expression relative to the untreated plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f5">5</xref>A). Co-transfection of the XP-C cells with UV-treated plasmid along with another plasmid expressing wild-type <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA results in increased luciferase activity reflecting complementation of the DNA repair defect by the wild-type <italic>XPC</italic> cDNA. In contrast, co-transfection of the XP-C cells with a UV-treated luciferase plasmid along with a plasmid expressing <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA with deletion of exon 12 showed no significant complementation.

This technique combines real-time quantitative PCR with reverse transcription of mRNA into cDNA. The advantages of this technique include a very large dynamic range and the capability for absolute quantitation of cDNA by the use of a standard curve. This technique is extremely sensitive, with the potential to measure &#x0003c;1 molecule&#x0002f;cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c15">15</xref>). The mean value of 295 fg pXPC-3 for the amount of normally spliced <italic>XPC</italic> cDNA derived from 50 ng total RNA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb2">2</xref>) corresponds to an average of &#x0223c;10 <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA molecules&#x0002f;cell, assuming 100&#x00025; efficiency of the RT reaction. This number is similar to the 5&#x02013;8 transcripts&#x0002f;cell estimated for another NER gene, <italic>XPA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c22">22</xref>), and is in line with average transcript levels for other genes. Warrington <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c23">23</xref>) looked at the expression of 7000 genes in human adult and fetal tissues and found that most transcripts were detected at &#x02264;5 copies&#x0002f;cell. Lockhart and Winzeler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c24">24</xref>) found that the peak of the expression profile for 40 000 human genes lies between 5 and 10 copies&#x0002f;cell.</p><p>Information theory is an important tool to rank normal and mutant splice junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c14">14</xref>). Some of the exon and intron junctions were corrected based on genomic DNA sequencing and employing information theory. Most splice junctions that are fully functional have an information content of at least 2.4 bits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c14">14</xref>). The <italic>XPC</italic> splice acceptor and donor sites all had very high information contents, ranging from 4.1 to 17.4 bits. The only exception was the exon 4 splice acceptor site, which had an information content of &#x02013;0.1 bits.</p><p>We attempted to determine if a splice acceptor site with low information content was more likely to result in increased skipping of the following exon in comparison with an exon with high information content. The splice acceptors at exons 4 (&#x02013;0.1 bits) and 7 (12.3 bits) were chosen for study since they had markedly different information contents. Accordingly, real-time QRT&#x02013;PCR assays were developed to measure the level of <italic>XPC</italic> cDNA with deletion of exon 7 or 4. The level of <italic>XPC</italic> cDNA skipping exon 7 was very low, with an average of 0.07&#x00025;. In contrast, the <italic>XPC</italic> cDNA skipping exon 4 was &#x0223c;10 times greater at 0.7&#x00025; (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb2">2</xref>). This indicates a relationship between information content and extent of exon skipping. The very low information content of the acceptor at exon 4 (&#x02013;0.1 bits) would suggest that this would be a very poor splice site and result in even greater levels of exon 4 skipping than we observed. Examination of the exon 4 splice acceptor sequence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb1">1</xref>) reveals a run of five uridines upstream of five adenines. In spite of the low information content, the five uridines should be a strong binding site for U2AF<sup>65</sup>, the protein that recognizes polypyrimidine tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c26">26</xref>). In addition, a strong splice donor (10.6 bits) lies 124 nt downstream at the 3&#x02032; end of exon 4 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf469tb1">1</xref>) and most likely functions as a splicing enhancer sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c27">27</xref>). Additional intronic or exonic splicing enhancer elements may also be present and help to compensate for the poor splice acceptor site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c28">28</xref>).</p><p>A new SNP was discovered in the <italic>XPC</italic> intron 11 splice acceptor. This polymorphism results in lower information content in an acceptor with A (5.1 bits) than with C (7.5 bits). We predicted that more exon 12 skipping would be found in cells with the A&#x0002f;A genotype than in cells with the C&#x0002f;C genotype. Using a real-time QRT&#x02013;PCR assay to measure the extent of skipping of exon 12 there was a genotype-dependent increase in skipping of exon 12.</p><p>The presence of premature termination codons in the message decreases the levels of most (but not all) known mRNAs, a process called &#x02018;nonsense-mediated message decay&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c31">31</xref>). Multiple alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms of the <italic>XPG</italic> gene have been described in normal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c32">32</xref>). Alternative splicing that eliminates the ATG start site in the XP-V gene (DNA polymerase &#x003b7;) has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c33">33</xref>). Multiple splice variants of the human base excision repair protein, DNA polymerase &#x003b2;, are common in normal bladder tissues and bladder cancer and appear to be related to the information content of the splice donor and acceptor sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c34">34</xref>). Recent analyses of the EST database and the sequence of the human genome suggest that at least 38&#x00025; of human mRNAs have alternatively spliced forms with an average of 2.75 splice forms per spliced gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c35">35</xref>). Thus alternative splicing significantly increases the size of the proteome.</p><p>Two common polymorphisms were reported in the <italic>XPC</italic> gene: an intron 9 insertion&#x0002f;deletion polymorphism (PAT) and an exon 15 A&#x0002f;C polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c19">19</xref>) &#x0223c;9 kb apart in the <italic>XPC</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f3">3</xref>). There was non-disjunction between these polymorphisms and the intron 11 SNP. Thus the C of intron 11 appears to be linked to the PAT<sup>&#x02013;</sup> allele and the exon 15 A allele in one haplotype covering at least 9 kb on chromosome 3. PAT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is linked to the exon 15 C allele and the A in intron 11 in another haplotype. Haplotypes covering 3&#x02013;84 kb on chromosome 5 have been reported in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c37">37</xref>). There was equal DNA repair function of both the exon 15 A and the exon 15 C alleles as measured in the host cell reactivation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c19">19</xref>). In contrast, deletion of exon 12 results in loss of function of the <italic>XPC</italic> cDNA in correcting the defect in XP-C cells with the host cell reactivation assay and also results in dominant negative inhibition of function in normal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f5">5</xref>A and B). We also found that increasing amounts of exon 12 skipping are associated with reduced DNA repair in normal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf469f4">4</xref>A and B). There is evidence that HHR23B protein binds to the exon 12 region of XPC protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c38">38</xref>).</p><p>Epidemiologic study of cancer patients showed that the PAT<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup> genotype was associated with a 1.85-fold increase in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf469c39">39</xref>). The mechanism of this increased cancer risk has not been determined. The present study suggests a possible explanation. The PAT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> allele is in linkage disequilibrium with the A allele of intron 11 splice acceptor, which has a lower information content than the C allele and is associated with a higher frequency of deletion of exon 12. This exon 12 deleted <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA isoform has reduced DNA repair activity. While cells with the A&#x0002f;A genotype in intron 11 have normal levels of full-length <italic>XPC</italic> mRNA, there is evidence of a dominant negative suppression of DNA repair in normal cells by the <italic>XPC</italic> exon 12 deleted cDNA and reduced DNA repair in cells with the <italic>XPC</italic> intron 11 A&#x0002f;A genotype. Thus the increased cancer susceptibility may be related to a reduced level of DNA repair in PAT<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup> patients. This linkage analysis establishes a correlation between the genotype of the <italic>XPC</italic> gene and cancer predisposition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_30_16_3624__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_30_16_3624__1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_30_16_3624__2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="nar_30_16_3624__gkf469_tables.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf469f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structural map of the human <italic>XPC</italic> gene.
