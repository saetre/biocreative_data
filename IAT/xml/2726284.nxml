It is thought that the selectivity of the drug binding site in EmrE is defined by two negatively charged glutamate residues within a hydrophobic pocket formed from six of the &#x003b1;-helices, three from each monomer of the asymmetric EmrE homodimer. It is not apparent how such a binding pocket accommodates drugs of various sizes and shapes or whether the conformational changes that occur upon drug binding are identical for drugs of diverse chemical nature. Here, using electron cryomicroscopy of EmrE two-dimensional crystals we have determined projection structures of EmrE bound to three structurally different planar drugs, ethidium, propidium and dequalinium. Using image analysis and rigorous comparisons between these density maps and the density maps of the ligand-free and TPP<sup>+</sup>-bound forms of EmrE, we identify regions within the transporter that adapt differentially depending on the type of ligand bound. We show that all three planar drugs bind at the same pocket within the protein as TPP<sup>+</sup>. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that, while retaining the overall fold of the protein, binding of the planar drugs is accompanied by small rearrangements of the transmembrane domains that are different to those that occur when TPP<sup>+</sup> binds. The regions in the EmrE dimer that are remodelled surround the drug binding site and include transmembrane domains from both monomers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>multidrug resistance</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd><kwd>conformation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>EmrE is an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Small Multidrug Resistance (SMR) protein that couples inward translocation of two protons with the counter-transport of a broad range of hydrophobic cations, such as tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP<sup>+</sup>), ethidium and methyl viologen.<xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2</sup></xref> EmrE contains 110 amino acids that form four transmembrane (TM) &#x003b1;-helices.<xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3,4</sup></xref> A low resolution (7.5&#x000a0;&#x000c5;) projection structure<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and 3D structure of EmrE in complex with its substrate TPP<sup>+</sup> have been determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) of two-dimensional (2-D) crystals.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The structure revealed that EmrE is composed of eight helices arranged as an asymmetric dimer within the membrane.

Such a &#x02018;simple&#x02019; binding pocket would reduce the evolutionary constraints on the protein and ensure broad substrate specificity. However, it is not clear how the binding of EmrE can accommodate drugs of different sizes and shapes, and whether different conformational changes are required.</p><p>We have, therefore, used cryo-EM of 2-D crystals to determine the projection structures of EmrE bound to three different substrates to address this question. Comparison of these projections with those obtained previously, with and without TPP<sup>+</sup> bound, shows that the multidrug binding site of EmrE is flexible and adopts distinct conformations dependent on the nature of the substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Crystallization of EmrE with various substrates</title><p>EmrE was previously crystallized by dialysis in the presence of lipids to form 2-D crystals either with or without bound TPP<sup>+</sup>, a high-affinity substrate<xref rid="bib3 bib5 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3,5,16</sup></xref> that binds to EmrE with an affinity of 2&#x000a0;nM<sup>7</sup>. All the previously obtained projection maps and the low-resolution 3D structure of EmrE were determined using these 2-D crystals. To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying the substrate promiscuity of EmrE, it was critical to gather structural data on its complexes with other drugs. Therefore, three different substrates were chosen to investigate properties of the EmrE drug binding pocket. Ethidium (Eth<sup>+</sup>), propidium (PP<sup>2+</sup>) and dequalinium (DQ<sup>2+</sup>) all differ structurally from TPP<sup>+</sup> by being predominantly planar molecules rather than tetrahedral (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a).<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Eth<sup>+</sup> contains a planar triple aromatic ring system and, although PP<sup>2+</sup> is very similar to Eth<sup>+</sup>, it contains a second tertiary amine and therefore carries a 2+ charge. Finally, DQ<sup>2+</sup> has two planar cationic &#x02018;head groups&#x02019; separated by an aliphatic C10 linker.</p><p>Radioligand competition binding assays showed that each of the ligands possesses micro- or submicromolar affinity for EmrE, with K<sub>i</sub> values for Eth<sup>+</sup>, PP<sup>2+</sup> and DQ<sup>2+</sup> of 1.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, 19&#x000a0;nM and 83&#x000a0;nM, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b). Crystallisation trials were therefore performed in the presence of either excess Eth<sup>+</sup>, PP<sup>2+</sup> or DQ<sup>2+</sup> to obtain 2-D crystals of the various EmrE&#x02013;substrate complexes. Crystals of the Eth<sup>+</sup>-bound form of EmrE were of reasonable quality, although they were not as good as TPP<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;EmrE crystals. However, the inclusion of either PP<sup>2+</sup> or DQ<sup>2+</sup> during 2-D crystallizations resulted in either extremely poorly ordered crystals or large unordered vesicles, both unsuitable for structure determination. We speculated that the reason for this disorder was due to the amphipathic nature of PP<sup>2+</sup> and DQ<sup>2+</sup>, which resulted in them partitioning into the lipid bilayer and disrupting the molecular interactions necessary for 2-D crystal formation. We therefore had to use substrate exchange to substitute the TPP<sup>+</sup> in 2-D crystals of the TPP<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;EmrE complex for either PP<sup>2+</sup> or DQ<sup>2+</sup>. Ligand exchange was accomplished by dialyzing 2-D crystals of TPP<sup>+</sup>-bound EmrE against a 1000-fold excess of buffer containing either PP<sup>2+</sup> or DQ<sup>2+</sup> for 5&#x000a0;h. The extent of the ligand exchange was estimated by using [<sup>3</sup>H]TPP bound to EmrE 2-D crystals during the exchange reaction. Only 1&#x02013;3% of radioactive TPP<sup>+</sup> remained bound to the 2-D crystals of EmrE after a 5&#x000a0;h incubation following a 1000-fold dilution of the 2-D crystals when the dialysis buffer contained either PP<sup>2+</sup> or DQ<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c), suggesting that the structural data would be dominated (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;97%) by contributions from EmrE bound to the exchanged ligand. Under the conditions used for the ligand exchange, equilibrium was nearly reached, but longer incubations could have resulted in a further deterioration of crystallinity, so exchange reactions were limited to 5&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec><title>Projection structures of ethidium-, propidium- and dequalinium-bound EmrE</title><p>The crystals obtained in the presence of Eth<sup>+</sup> were smaller than the TPP<sup>+</sup>-bound crystal form, but reasonably well ordered, judged by optical diffraction of the cryo-EM micrographs and further image processing. The projection structure was obtained by merging data from the 12 best images. The resolution of the projection structure extended to 7&#x000a0;&#x000c5;, comparable to that of the previously determined EmrE projections with and without TPP<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The crystals that underwent ligand exchange (PP<sup>2+</sup>- and DQ<sup>2+</sup>-bound crystal forms) were morphologically indistinguishable from the parental TPP<sup>+</sup>-bound EmrE 2-D crystals. However, image processing revealed that the substrate exchange procedure led to distortions within the crystals and, subsequently, to loss of their quality. Most of the imaged EmrE 2-D crystals suffered fragmentation and were rendered unsuitable for structural work. We hypothesise that the disruption of the crystal lattice was largely due to partitioning of the PP<sup>2+</sup> or DQ<sup>2+</sup> into the lipid bilayer and disrupting EmrE crystal contacts, although we cannot fully discount contributions from an additional conformational change accompanying the binding of PP<sup>2+</sup> or DQ<sup>2+</sup>. Only a small proportion of crystalline areas within a few of the observed 2-D crystals remained sufficiently ordered for further processing. To obtain the projection structures for PP<sup>2+</sup>- and DQ<sup>2+</sup>-bound forms of EmrE, 7 and 5 images were merged, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b and c, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Despite the strong effects of ligand exchange on the crystallinity of the specimen, the PP<sup>2+</sup>&#x02013;EmrE and DQ<sup>2+</sup>&#x02013;EmrE projection maps contained reliable information at 8&#x02013;9&#x000a0;&#x000c5; (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): the effective resolution thresholds for both projection maps were 8.2&#x000a0;&#x000c5;. All three projection structures obtained from Eth<sup>+</sup>-, PP<sup>2+</sup>- and DQ<sup>2+</sup>-bound EmrE crystals had <italic>p</italic>2 symmetry, identical to the TPP<sup>+</sup>-bound crystals.</p></sec><sec><title>Averaged projection structures of EmrE bound to mono- and bivalent planar substrates</title><p>At the resolution of the projection maps obtained, all secondary structure features seen in the higher resolution projections of EmrE were clearly resolved (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The repetitive unit in the crystals was the crystallographic tetramer (coloured either blue or red in each of the maps in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), but previous work shows that the minimal functional unit for substrate binding is the dimer.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Careful inspection clearly revealed small differences between the two halves of the tetramer related by two fold non-crystallographic symmetry of EmrE in each of the projection maps. These discrepancies between the dimers were more pronounced in the density maps obtained with PP<sup>2+</sup> and DQ<sup>2+</sup>, where only a limited amount of data was available. To improve further the resolution of the asymmetric dimer, the two dimers in the crystallographic tetramer were averaged using the MRC software for electron micrograph analysis,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> as described in &#x0201c;Materials and Methods&#x0201d;. The resulting averaged maps calculated from the data and merged to 7&#x000a0;&#x000c5; are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Evident from the red contours in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the asymmetry within the crystallographic tetramer was highest in the PP<sup>2+</sup>-bound EmrE projection map, although the data extended to about the same resolution as that for the DQ<sup>2+</sup>-bound form (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, &#x0201c;RMS mirr.&#x0201d;).</p><p>The three projection structures of EmrE were superficially similar to each other and to those obtained previously (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In order to quantitatively assess the similarity between all ligand-bound (TPP<sup>+</sup> and planar drugs) and ligand-free (apo-) EmrE projection maps, we also calculated the averaged dimer TPP<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;EmrE map from the <italic>p</italic>2-symmetrised projection structure<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> (as described under &#x0201c;Materials and Methods&#x0201d;; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The apo form (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a) did not require averaging, because the projection maps from which it was derived were in space group <italic>c</italic>222 that contains a crystallographic in-plane 2-fold relating the two asymmetric dimers in the tetramer.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Thus, interpolation and averaging served two purposes, improving the signal/noise level in the resulting projection structures and, more importantly, allowing the direct comparisons of the projection maps calculated from 2-D crystals with either <italic>p</italic>2 (TPP<sup>+</sup>, Eth<sup>+</sup>, PP<sup>2+</sup> and DQ<sup>2+</sup>) or <italic>c</italic>222 symmetry (apo-EmrE).</p><p>The resolution at which the comparisons of all maps could be performed was limited by the resolution of the DQ<sup>2+</sup>-bound EmrE map (effective resolution threshold of 8.2&#x000a0;&#x000c5;). To choose an optimal resolution, we merged and averaged all five maps at 7, 8, 9 and 10&#x000a0;&#x000c5;. We then determined the &#x0201c;RMS difference&#x0201d; (the RMS deviation of the total density from the average density in the map; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) for difference maps between each projection map and the TPP<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;EmrE. We found that the RMS deviations, and therefore the experimental error, were lowest at 9&#x000a0;&#x000c5; for all planar ligand-bound EmrE projection maps. Therefore, all maps were compared and cross-correlated at 9&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution. The maps of TPP<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;EmrE, Eth<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;EmrE and apo-EmrE contained structural information below that threshold, and were compared separately at 7&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Detailed comparisons between projection maps</title><p>Comparisons were made between all the projection maps and plotted at either 9&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) or, where the data allowed, at 7&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> provides the cross-correlation coefficients for all the comparisons. From these data it is clear that there are three distinct projection structures, namely apo-EmrE, TPP<sup>+</sup>-bound EmrE and planar drug-bound EmrE. The differences between apo-EmrE and TPP<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;EmrE have been previously described<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and are reproduced in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b, with the large negative density peak at the B2/C2 boundary representing bound TPP<sup>+</sup>. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c&#x02013;e show similar negative peaks, which are likely to represent either Eth<sup>+</sup>, PP<sup>2+</sup> or DQ<sup>2+</sup> in each case. In addition, there are density differences in each of the different density maps for Eth<sup>+</sup>, PP<sup>2+</sup> and DQ<sup>2+</sup> in the C1 area, suggestive of a movement of this helix, as seen upon TPP<sup>+</sup> binding, although there appears to be an increase in the magnitude of the movement when planar drugs are bound, compared to TPP<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>f&#x02013;h).</p><p>Additional changes are seen in the areas A3, D3 and D4 of the 7&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution map &#x02018;Eth<sup>+</sup> minus TPP<sup>+</sup>&#x02019; (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>c). These changes are associated with the helices that form the substrate binding pocket, whereas there appear to be fewer and smaller density changes associated with the pair of helices in squares B&#x00026;C, 4&#x00026;5. These two helices may represent helix 4, one from each monomer, and are notable in that they are about 9&#x000a0;&#x000c5; apart centre to centre along their whole length and so probably represent a strong and stable association; in addition, being separated from the ligand binding pocket, it is unlikely they are contributing to any conformational change during ligand binding.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Versatile recognition of diverse chemical structures is a feature of the multidrug binding proteins and transporters. Most of what we know about the structural basis of multi-specific drug recognition comes from the structural studies on the soluble multidrug binding proteins, such as BmrR and QacR,<xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14,15</sup></xref> and from the X-ray structures of the multidrug transporter of the RND family member, AcrB<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> (several other putative multidrug transporter structures have been solved, albeit without any substrates bound<xref rid="bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,19</sup></xref>). The structures of these proteins revealed large drug binding sites containing discrete subsites in which different drugs can bind.<xref rid="bib14 bib15 bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14,15,20</sup></xref> In some cases, binding of several drugs was shown to occur simultaneously, leading to a &#x02018;cross-talk&#x02019; between the ligands and their binding sites.<xref rid="bib20 bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20,21</sup></xref> Importantly, in all cases where multidrug binding proteins or transporters were co-crystallized with the drugs, recognition of different drugs by the same binding site was associated with little, if any, difference in the conformational state of the protein.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>The drug binding site of EmrE is formed by the transmembrane domains of the protein. This puts several evolutionary constraints on the EmrE drug binding site: (i) there must be at least two orientations of the substrate binding site (inward- and outward-facing orientation), with different affinities for the substrates, allowing substrate translocation across the bacterial inner membrane; (ii) inherently, this implies a certain degree of flexibility of the protein; (iii) specificity for multiple drugs must be combined with strong coupling to the H<sup>+</sup>-gradient, preventing &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; passage of ions or small molecules. Maintaining these three conditions would present a challenge for a small protein like EmrE with a large pocket containing multiple discrete binding sites for different classes of drugs.</p><p>Here, using cryo-EM we show that, to accommodate drugs with planar and tetrahedral geometry, EmrE undergoes distinct conformational rearrangements. The structural changes are similar for mono- and bivalent planar drugs (Eth<sup>+</sup> and PP<sup>2+</sup>, respectively). We are able to identify the position of the bound ligand in all three new projection structures at 9&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution (confirmed for Eth<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;EmrE down to 7&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution), confirming that there are no subsites for different substrates in the EmrE binding site. Furthermore, we identify three regions surrounding the drug binding site, which change in response to binding of planar drugs (Eth<sup>+</sup>, PP<sup>2+</sup> and DQ<sup>2+</sup>) in a way different from the changes upon TPP<sup>+</sup> binding. Remodelled regions of the protein include transmembrane helices in area A2 and B3, as well as the junction between helices at the boundary between areas 2 and 3. The peak corresponding to movement of the helix in area C1 is broadened in the planar drug&#x02013;EmrE projection structures, although its position is not greatly changed. This may indicate intrinsic flexibility of this region of the protein, a property that may be necessary for drug binding and translocation across the membrane. The precise nature of the conformational changes will remain unresolved until 3D structures at higher resolution become available.</p><p>Our findings indicate that in contrast to other multidrug binding proteins, rather than having a large cavity with discrete niches for different substrates, EmrE has evolved a binding site that is remodelled dependent on the geometry of the substrate. Remodelling is achieved by subtle changes in the structure of the protein, resulting in altered positions of the transmembrane domains within the projection structures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Expression and purification of EmrE was performed as described previously.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Briefly, <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes containing 6xHis-tagged EmrE were solubilized with dodecylmaltoside (DDM, Glycon, Germany).

A saturating amount of the resulting 2-D crystals was mixed with [<sup>3</sup>H]TPP<sup>+</sup> (final concentration 400&#x000a0;nM; Amersham) in the crystallization buffer (Tris pH 7.5, NaCl 100&#x000a0;mM, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1&#x000a0;mM).

Longer incubations were avoided to prevent deterioration of the crystals.</p></sec><sec><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Crystals were deposited onto glow-discharged carbon-coated electron microscopy grids, blotted, washed with a solution containing 2% glucose, blotted again, and plunged into liquid nitrogen. The frozen grids were loaded onto a liquid nitrogen-cooled Gatan 626 cryostage and analysed by low-dose cryo-EM techniques (10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;e &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;2</sup>) on a Technai F20 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200&#x000a0;keV. Images were collected with flood beam illumination at a magnification of 50,000&#x000d7;&#x02013;58,000&#x000d7;. The quality of the images was assessed by optical diffraction. The best images were digitized using the MRC KZA scanner with a 6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m step size.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Image processing was performed using the MRC package. Projection structures were built according to previously described procedures, using MRC software.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Averaging of the asymmetric dimers within the crystallographic tetramer was done using INTERPO, a program for image interpolation. In brief, the <italic>p</italic>2 maps were rotated by approximately 17&#x000b0; (slightly different angles were used for each map; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), to enable assignment of an orthogonal (90&#x000b0;) coordinate system to each projection map. This allowed the direct comparison of maps from either <italic>p</italic>2 or <italic>c</italic>222 crystal forms. An area corresponding to the EmrE crystallographic tetramer was cut out from each map using LABEL, and then the same program was used to create a mirror image of the cut out image. TWOFILE was then used to calculate difference maps between the two mirror images. Iterative adjustment of the angle of rotation and the position of the cut out region was performed until the lowest RMS deviation of the mirror difference map was reached (&#x0201c;RMS mirr.&#x0201d;; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The procedure was repeated with all projection maps merged at 7, 8, 9 and 10&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution. TWOFILE was then used to compare the averaged projection maps at corresponding resolutions; each projection map was scaled to obtain minimal RMS of the difference map (&#x0201c;RMS diff.&#x0201d;; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Cross-correlation of the difference maps was performed with the mean density values, using the equation: &#x003c3;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;(A&#x000b7;B)/<italic>sqrt</italic>(A<sup>2</sup>&#x000b7;B<sup>2</sup>), where A and B are mean densities of the two correlated difference maps; multiplication of images required for the cross-correlation calculation was done using TWOFILE.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank R.
