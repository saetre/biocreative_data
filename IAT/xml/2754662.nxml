In plants, Programmed Cell Death (PCD) is required both for normal development and to face stress conditions (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Williams1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). One well characterised example of plant PCD is the hypersensitive response (HR), a localised cell death induced by pathogen attacks which allows confinement of the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Morel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Many studies focusing either on the signalling pathways controlling PCD or on the cellular effectors, have improved our understanding of this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Williams1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Reape1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, as well as phytohormones such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) or ethylene appear to be key players for HR regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Overmyer1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Once PCD promoting signals are perceived by plant cells, effectors of the suicide programme are activated. In animal cells, the molecular bases of PCD are well described, but to date, plant homologues of mammalian core apoptosis regulators have been scarce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Williams1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, several mutants have been isolated that are affected in the control of PCD. Notably, about 40 lesion mimic mutants (LMM) have been described: these mutants form spontaneous lesions in the absence of pathogen challenge. Mutated genes in LMM could thus correspond to repressors of PCD (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Lorrain1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of clear sequence conservation between animals and plants, an alternative strategy to isolate PCD regulators or effectors is to search for functional homologues. This approach led to the identification of Caspase-like activities in plants (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Reape1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>). In animal cells, the Proliferating Cells Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell proliferation: it functions as a processivity factor for DNA polymerase, but is also the target of regulatory proteins, including pro-apoptotic factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Maga1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>). We previously isolated ATXR5 and ATXR6, two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SET (Suvar(3&#x02013;9), Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax)-domain proteins for their ability to bind <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PCNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Raynaud1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These proteins are involved in histone methylation and heterochromatin formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Jacob1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we showed that their over-expression induced cell death respectively in pollen and anther endothetium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Raynaud1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, raising the possibility that they may function as positive regulators of PCD. We identified <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> myo-inositol synthase AtIPS1 as an interactor of ATXR5 (C. Raynaud, unpublished data).</p><p>Although it was first isolated from muscles, myo-inositol (MI) is a ubiquitous compound found in all living organisms. MI is synthesised from D-glucose in three steps: first glucose is phosphorylated by the hexokinase, second, glucose-6-P is converted to 1L-myo-Inositol-1-P by the 1L-myo-Inositol-1-Phosphate synthase (hereafter referred to as IPS), and finally, 1L-myo-Inositol-1-P is dephosphorylated by a phosphatase to produce free MI. The second step is the rate limiting step for MI biosynthesis in most organisms, including plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Loewus1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Loewus2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. IPS are well-conserved enzymes found both in eukaryotes and in prokaryotes. In plant cells, inositol derivatives play critical and diverse biological roles. These include phosphate storage in the form of phytic acid (an hexaphosphorylated form of MI), cell wall biogenesis, control of auxin physiology, membrane biogenesis, signal transduction and stress tolerance (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Loewus2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>). In salt-tolerant or cold-tolerant plant species, myo-inositol biosynthesis seems to play a pivotal role in protection mechanisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Bohnert1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>). For example in ice plant (<italic>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</italic>), an IPS homologue has clearly been demonstrated to participate in salt-stress tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Ishitani1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, in <italic>Spirodella polyrrhiza</italic>, the expression of the <italic>TUR1</italic> gene, encoding IPS is induced in dormant buds (turions) in response to ABA and could be involved in their high tolerance to environmental stress such as salt stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Smart1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. However, such a role seems to highly depend on the species: over-expression of <italic>TUR1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> results in elevated levels of MI, but does not increase salt-stress tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Smart2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Loss-of-function approaches have been conducted in several plant species to inactivate IPS. Most of these studies were aimed at reducing phytate contents in grains of crop plants, because phytate is detrimental for both human nutrition and the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Raboy1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, down-regulation of IPS activity is generally unfavourable for plant development: in maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>), low phytic acid mutants display a reduction of seed dry weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Raboy2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and in soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>), reduction of IPS expression with an RNAi strategy results in seed abortion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Nunes1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, down-regulation of IPS <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> results in pleiotropic defects including reduced apical dominance, altered leaf morphology, decreased tuber yield and precocious senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Keller1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>AtIPS1</italic> was initially isolated based on its ability to complement a yeast mutant defective for the <italic>INO1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Johnson1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>; AtIPS1 belongs to a family of three <italic>IPS</italic> genes. Recently, Murphy <italic>et al.</italic> reported that <italic>Arabidopsis atips1</italic> and <italic>atips2</italic> mutants display reduced phytic acid accumulation and that <italic>atips2</italic>, but not <italic>atips1</italic> is compromised in resistance to various pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Murphy1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we identified AtIPS1 as an interacting partner of ATXR5 and ATXR6, two proteins that could play a role in the control of cell proliferation or cell death. In agreement with this hypothesis, <italic>atips1</italic> mutants displayed spontaneous lesions on rosette leaves. To gain insight on the control of cell death and more specifically on the role of MI biosynthesis in plants, we functionally characterised <italic>AtIPS1</italic>. We show that lesions formed on <italic>atips1</italic> leaves correspond to PCD and that <italic>atips1</italic> is likely a novel lesion mimic mutant (LMM). We discuss the plausible relationships between inositol metabolism and the control of PCD.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>AtIPS1 interacts with ATXR5 and ATXR6, and accumulates both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus</title><p>To gain further insight into ATXR5 function, and to identify protein partners potentially involved in the control of PCD, a yeast two-hybrid screening was performed, leading to the identification of AtIPS1 (1-L-myo-inositol-1P synthase; E.C.5.5.1.4), a protein that could also bind ATXR6 (C. Raynaud, unpublished data). Mutant lines for <italic>AtIPS1</italic> were obtained. Plants mutated for <italic>AtIPS1</italic> exhibited spontaneous cell death when transferred to long day conditions to induce flowering. The isolated clone encompassed a truncated form of the AtIPS1 protein lacking the first 146 amino-acids. To confirm the interaction, yeast was re-transformed using this construct or a construct corresponding to the full length protein (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007364-t001">Table 1</xref>). The short version of AtIPS1 was found to interact with ATXR6 and with a splicing variant of ATXR5 lacking its PCNA binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Raynaud1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The full length protein was capable to interact with itself or with the truncated form, consistent with the fact that the protein functions as trimers or tetramers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Loewus2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, the full length protein could not interact with ATXR5 and ATXR6, suggesting that the N-terminus of the protein is not required for this interaction. It has been shown previously that truncated cDNAs detected valid two-hybrid interactions that were not seen when using full length ORFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-FromontRacine1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The lack of interaction between ATXR5/6 and the full-length version of AtIPS1 might be due to the involvement of AtIPS1 in competing interactions with itself or even possibly with the yeast INO protein.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0007364-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007364.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>AtIPS1 interacts with ATXR5 and ATXR6 in the yeast two-hybrid system.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0007364-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0007364.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pGAD424</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">shAtIPS1-AD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">flAtIPS1-AD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PCNA1-AD</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pGBT-9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATXR5-BD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0002b;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATXR6-BD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0002b;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATXR5&#x02592;ex2-BD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">flAtIPS1-BD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">nd</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>pGAD424 contains the activation domain of GAL4 (AD) while pGBT-9 contains its DNA-binding domain (BD). shAtIPS1: truncated form of AtIPS1 lacking its first 146 amino-acids, flAtIPS1: full length AtIPS1 protein.

To determine more precisely where lesions started we performed leaf sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007364-g003">Figure 3A, D</xref>). Lesions with collapsed, organelle-free cells were observed on each side of secondary veins.

This could stem from an inhibition of either cell proliferation or cell growth. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we measured leaf surface area and cell size of <italic>atips1-1</italic> mutants. In <italic>atips1-1</italic> subjected to long-day conditions, we observed a three fold reduction of leaf surface area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007364.s003">Figure S3B, D</xref>). Leaf cells were slightly smaller than that of the wild-type, since we observed an increase in the number of cells per mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007364.s003">Figure S3A, C</xref>). However, this moderate change in cell size cannot account for the reduction of leaf surface area. We therefore concluded that the leaves of the mutants contain fewer cells, pointing to an inhibition of cell division.</p><p>We next wondered whether lesion formation and growth inhibition were triggered by photoperiod or light intensity. To test this, <italic>atips1-1</italic> mutants were cultivated under high-light and SD conditions (8 h day/16 h night 225 &#x000b5;E/m<sup>2</sup>/s). Lesion formation was observed in these conditions, demonstrating that it is triggered by the quantity of light received by the plant rather than by day length. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that under these conditions lesions appeared after one week instead of 4 days, they spread more slowly and plant growth was much less reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007364.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p>The extensive lesions in <italic>atips1-1</italic> and <italic>atips1-2</italic> did not prevent flowering and seed setting, although seed production was decreased relative to the wild type (data not shown). Interestingly, the extent of cell death was dependent on the developmental stage at which plants were transferred under LD: the older the plants at the time of transfer, the fewer lesions were observed on leaves. Furthermore, although <italic>atips1-1</italic> and <italic>atips1-2</italic> had qualitatively identical phenotypes, <italic>atips1-2</italic> appeared more severely affected. We thought that this could be due to the fact that <italic>atips1-2</italic> is in the Ws background, whereas <italic>atips1-1</italic> is in the Col-0 background. One difference between Col-0 and Ws is that Ws flowers earlier than Col-0.

Interestingly, although there are three isoforms of IPS in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> sharing more than 90&#x00025; identity in their amino-acid sequence, the three mutants have contrasting phenotypes: we found that disruption of <italic>AtIPS1</italic> affects several aspects of seedling growth and development and results in spontaneous lesion formation on leaves.

Although down-regulation of <italic>StIPS</italic> has been reported to induce early senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Keller1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, we think that lesion formation in <italic>atips1</italic> is more related to HR than to senescence. Indeed, expression of the senescence marker <italic>SAG12</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Gepstein1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> remains unchanged in <italic>atips1-1</italic> after transfer under restrictive conditions. Furthermore, the transcriptome of <italic>atips1-1</italic> mutant is highly similar to that of wild-type plants facing pathogen attacks or treated with ozone, a method commonly used to simulate HR, but not to that of senescing plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007364-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Therefore <italic>atips1</italic> should be regarded as a LMM. LMM have been classified into two groups: initiation mutants that form localized cell death spots of determinate size and propagation mutants which are unable to control the rate and extent of the lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Lorrain1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Murphy <italic>et al.</italic> found that <italic>atips1</italic> resistance to the avirulent pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> harbouring the avirulent gene <italic>AvrB</italic> and to viruses was similar to that of the wild-type, indicating that HR is not modified in this mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Murphy1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, we found that <italic>atips1</italic> is more resistant than wild-type to the Noco2 isolate of <italic>H. parasitica</italic>, suggesting that basal defence is enhanced in the mutant. This could be attributed to an increased production of SA in response to pathogen inoculation, since <italic>atips1-1/35S::NahG</italic> plants were as susceptible as the wild-type to this pathogen. However, because the phenotypes of <italic>atips1-1</italic> and <italic>35S::NahG</italic> plants are additive, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>AtIPS1</italic> and SA may affect plant resistance to <italic>H. parasitica</italic> via independent mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Lesion formation in <italic>atips1</italic> is developmentally regulated</title><p>Our results suggest that lesion formation in <italic>atips1</italic> is affected both by the amount of light received by the plants and by day-length. Indeed, <italic>atips1</italic> mutants displayed more severe lesion formation and growth reduction when grown under 16 h light at 45 &#x000b5;E/m<sup>2</sup>/s than when grown under 8 h light at 225 &#x000b5;E/m<sup>2</sup>/s, even though the total amount of light received per day was much higher under the latter conditions. In addition, the severity of symptoms of <italic>atips1</italic> mutants in restrictive conditions was much reduced if plants were kept for several weeks under permissive conditions. These observations suggest the existence of cross-talks between developmental signals and the cellular mechanisms responsible for lesion formation in <italic>atips1</italic> mutants. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that genes up-regulated in <italic>atips1-1</italic> under restrictive conditions are down-regulated in the Mir-0 ecotype that flowers over a month later than Col-0 in our growth conditions. Furthermore, we observed that lesion formation was drastically reduced when the <italic>atips1</italic> mutation was introduced in the <italic>gi-6</italic> background that strongly delays flowering. Although we cannot rule out that the latter result could be caused by the enhanced tolerance of <italic>gi</italic> to oxidative stress, due to increased ascorbate peroxidase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Cao1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Kurepa1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, our results are in agreement with the assumption that oxidative stress tolerance and longevity are linked in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Kurepa1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

In fact, DNA fragmentation is believed to be a marker of PCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Reape1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we showed that lesion formation is mainly dependent on SA accumulation, demonstrating that it is not due to necrosis but to a regulated cellular process. In <italic>atips1</italic>, the onset of PCD appears to be triggered when plants are exposed to a high irradiance (see above), and many up-regulated genes under restrictive conditions are involved in oxidative stress response, pointing to a potential role of ROS production in chloroplasts. In both animal and plant cells, mitochondria are cellular executioners of PCD. Their central role involves integrating stress and/or PCD signals that ultimately cause the release of mitochondrial molecules which in turn trigger cell-death cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Reape2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. In plant cells, ROS can be generated in several cellular compartments, including chloroplasts. Recently, evidence has been provided for a role of chloroplasts in HR-like cell death in tobacco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Liu1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Possibly then, PCD in <italic>atips1</italic> mutants could be induced by increased ROS production in chloroplasts. In support to this hypothesis, we observed that lesion formation is abolished in <italic>atips1</italic> mutants re-transformed with a construct encompassing an artificial micro-RNA (a-miRNA) targeting <italic>GUN4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Schwab1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007364.s008">Figure S8</xref>).

However, GUN2-5 proteins were all found to be involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis; as a result, down-regulation of <italic>GUN4</italic> via amiRNA led to reduced chlorophyll accumulation. Interestingly, Ishikawa reported that disruption of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis suppressed lesion formation in <italic>len1</italic>, another LMM mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Ishiwaka1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>That said, the observation that <italic>atips1-1</italic> mutants are not more sensitive than the wild-type to oxidative stress may appear conflicting with the hypothesis that PCD in the mutant could be triggered by ROS production in chloroplasts. Interestingly, microarray analysis revealed that up-regulated genes under permissive conditions become down-regulated after transfer to restrictive conditions. Reciprocally, down-regulated genes under SD were up-regulated under LD. We propose that <italic>atips1-1</italic> mutants grown under permissive conditions may have become acclimated to a certain constitutive level of stress, allowing them to better face moderate oxidative stress than wild-type. Upon transfer to restrictive conditions, oxidative stress in the mutant may reach a threshold above which PCD would be triggered. Lesion formation in <italic>atips1</italic> could hence be triggered by chloroplastic signals, while the role of MI or MI derivatives in the cellular response to these signals remains to be established.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>What is the link between MI metabolism and cell cycle or PCD regulation?</title><p>The cellular mechanisms underlying lesion formation and the increase in pathogen resistance are not clear. They could be due in part to modifications in inositol signalling. Indeed, in animal cells, PI3K and PKB are major regulators of PCD by blocking pro-apoptotic pathways (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Duronio1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>). To date, the role of this signalling pathway in the control of plant PCD has been little documented, but a reduction in the cellular content of MI may affect PI3K-dependent inhibition of PCD in <italic>atips1</italic>. In addition, Ortega <italic>et al.</italic> reported that IP<sub>3</sub> production played a role in HR response of lemon seedlings against <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Ortega1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, PCD induction in <italic>atips1</italic> may be due to alterations in sphingolipid metabolism as shown previously for the <italic>acd5</italic> and <italic>acd11</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Liang1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Brodersen1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

Hence, spontaneous PCD in <italic>atips1</italic> may result from the alteration of various inositol-related signalling pathways. In agreement with such a hypothesis, we found that spraying the plants with inositol could suppress lesion formation, indicating that inositol production, and not the AtIPS1 protein itself, is required to prevent lesion formation. Lesion formation in <italic>atips1</italic> could also be due to the requirement of MI as a precursor for several molecules involved in stress tolerance. Indeed, <italic>cat2</italic> mutants which are compromised in ROS detoxification display spontaneous lesion formation when grown under LD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Queval1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, galactinol treatment also suppressed lesion formation in <italic>atips1</italic>, suggesting that it could be due to enhanced oxidative stress, since galactinol has been proposed to act as a scavenger of ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Nishizawa1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. However, <italic>atips1</italic> did not show enhanced susceptibility to oxidative stress: galactinol may therefore fulfil other functions such as signalling in plant cells as suggested by Kim <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007364-Kim1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.

For each array, the raw data comprised the logarithm of median feature pixel intensity at wavelengths 635 (red) and 532 nm (green). No background was subtracted. In the following description, log ratio refers to the differential expression between two conditions. It is either log2 (red/green) or log2 (green/red) according to the experimental design. Array-by-array normalization was performed to remove systematic biases. First, we excluded spots that were considered badly formed features. Then, we performed global intensity-dependent normalization using the LOESS procedure to correct the dye bias. Finally, for each block, the log ratio median calculated over the values for the entire block was subtracted from each individual log ratio value to correct print tip effects on each metablock. To determine differentially expressed genes, we performed a paired t test on the log ratios, assuming that the variance of the log ratios was the same for all genes. Spots displaying extreme variance (too small or too large) were excluded. The raw P values were adjusted by the Bonferroni method, which controls the FWER (family-wise error rate). We considered as being differentially expressed the genes with an FWER &#x0003c;5&#x00025;.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007364.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Structure of AtIPS genes and position of the T-DNA insertions.
