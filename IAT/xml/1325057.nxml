The genomic structure and testes-specific expression of zonadhesin is known for many mammalian species. All zonadhesin genes characterized to date consist of meprin A5 antigen receptor tyrosine phosphatase mu (MAM) domains, mucin tandem repeats, and von Willebrand (VWD) adhesion domains. Here we investigate the genomic structure and expression of zonadhesin-like genes in three species of fish.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The cDNA and corresponding genomic locus of a zonadhesin-like gene (<italic>zlg</italic>) in Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) were sequenced. Zlg is similar in adhesion domain content to mammalian zonadhesin; however, the domain order is altered. Analysis of puffer fish (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>) and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) sequence data identified zonadhesin (<italic>zan</italic>) genes that share the same domain order, content, and a conserved syntenic relationship with mammalian zonadhesin. A zonadhesin-like gene in <italic>D. rerio </italic>was also identified. Unlike mammalian zonadhesin, <italic>D. rerio zan </italic>and <italic>S. salar zlg </italic>were expressed in the gut and not in the testes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We characterized likely orthologs of zonadhesin in both <italic>T. rubripes </italic>and <italic>D. rerio </italic>and uncovered zonadhesin-like genes in <italic>S. salar </italic>and <italic>D. rerio</italic>. Each of these genes contains MAM, mucin, and VWD domains. While these domains are associated with several proteins that show prominent gut expression, their combination is unique to zonadhesin and zonadhesin-like genes in vertebrates. The expression patterns of fish zonadhesin and zonadhesin-like genes suggest that the reproductive role of zonadhesin evolved later in the mammalian lineage.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Molecules that are directly involved in reproduction are often subject to rapid evolutionary change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Zonadhesin (ZAN) is one such molecule that has undergone domain expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and positive selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in mammals. ZAN is a multi-domain sperm protein that is implicated in the species-specific binding of egg and sperm. Porcine (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) ZAN was first described by Hardy <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] as a protein expressed by developing sperm that would bind to the zona pellucida of the egg. Since its initial discovery, zonadhesin has been identified in several other mammals, including mouse, human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and rabbit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recent data suggest the processed zonadhesin localizes to the acrosomal matrix and binds the zona pellucida during the acrosome reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The discrete domains of mosaic proteins are known to be important in the evolution of new genes. Domain subunits can be rearranged, duplicated or deleted to produce a variety of proteins with different functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Zonadhesin structure is unique in its combination of protein domains. All mammalian zonadhesin genes are predicted to encode: a signal peptide, a multiple meprin A5 antigen receptor tyrosine phosphatase mu (MAM) domain, multiple trypsin-like inhibitor (TIL) domains, multiple von Willebrand D (VWD) cell adhesion domains, multiple hepta-peptide repeats that form the mucin domain, multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, a single transmembrane domain and short intracellular domain at the carboxyl terminus. The domain order is the same for all mammals studied, with the main difference being the number of MAM and VWD domains. These individual domains each have a particular function and are found in many other mosaic proteins.</p><p>The extracellular VWD domain occurs in a family of immediate-early genes that are growth regulators and is thought to have an adhesive function. This modular domain is found in a variety of mosaic proteins including von Willebrand factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], apolipoprotein B, vitellogenins, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and mucins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Biochemical studies of pig zonadhesin have shown that the ZAN precursor is processed and the MAM domains are removed leaving the VWD domain to interact with the zona pellucida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While the role of the VWD in sperm-egg binding has been addressed, the role of the mucin-repeats and the MAM domains is still unknown.</p><p>The mucin or MUC domain is the primary functional domain of mucin proteins. Mucins are a diverse group of heavily glycosylated proteins that are the major component of mucus. Mucins function to lubricate surfaces and are the first line of defence against pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Most of the secreted mucins contain a domain with sequence similarity to VWD and a domain composed of a variable number of tandem repeats that code for serine-, threonine- and proline-rich repeat peptides that are potential glycosylation sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Two mucin-like genes that are similar to zonadhesin include alpha-tectorin, which is involved in non-syndromical autosomal dominant hearing impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and Fc fragment of IgG binding protein (FCGBP). By virtue of sequence identity, the closest relative to mammalian zonadhesin is FCGBP and this similarity is mostly seen in the TIL and VWD domains. <italic>FCGBP </italic>is expressed in the mucosa of the small and large intestines, epithelial colon cells and the placenta and is thought to play a role in the mucosal immune system through the promotion of multivalent IgG and the trapping of antigen IgG complexes in the mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The 170 amino acid MAM domain distinguishes zonadhesin from other VWD and mucin repeat containing genes such as <italic>FCGBP</italic>. MAM domains have adhesive function and are found in several proteins including protein-tyrosine phosphatases, neuropilins and meprins. Meprins are metalloendopeptidases that have been found in the intestinal brush border and renal membranes of mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. While their role in the zonadhesin protein is unknown, MAM domains are important for multimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and have conserved cysteine residues that are responsible for covalent interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>When this study began, zonadhesin expression had only been described in the testes. Only zonadhesin was thought to encode MAM domains, mucin repeats, and VWD domains and no non-mammalian zonadhesin orthologs had been reported. For these reasons we were interested in Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) zonadhesin-like ESTs from a gut-derived library that encoded the MAM, mucin and VWD domains. Here we describe the cDNA, genomic structure, and expression patterns of this Atlantic salmon zonadhesin-like gene. We also use comparative genomic and expression analyses to uncover additional zonadhesin-like genes, as well as orthologs of zonadhesin, in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) and puffer fish (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Characterization of a zonadhesin-like gene in <italic>S. salar</italic></title><p>A gene similar to mammalian zonadhesin was identified during an expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis of Atlantic salmon. We assembled this zonadhesin-like gene (<italic>zlg</italic>) from five overlapping ESTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; the largest of which [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CK990464">CK990464</ext-link>] was sequenced by primer walking from both directions and assembled to give a 4388 bp sequence. PCR primers were designed to the 3'-end of the EST and used to amplify a probe for hybridization to Atlantic salmon genomic DNA and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library filters (Probe 1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Organization and Southern blot analysis of the Atlantic salmon zonadhesin-like gene (<italic>zlg</italic>)</bold>. A) Domain structure, probe locations, and EST coverage of the Atlantic salmon Zlg. The three VWD domains, the two MAM domains and the mucin domain are shown. The signal peptide (SP) and poly (A) tail are also indicated. Probe 1 included 177 nucleotides of the 3'-UTR and 206 nucleotides of VWD3 in the coding region. Probe 2 included 233 nucleotides of the 3'-end of VWD1. The 4388 bp EST covers the full length of the cDNA sequence except for the 5'-UTR which is estimated to be approximately 200 bp by comparison to Northern blot data. B) Southern blot analysis of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout genomic DNA. Gene copy number was assessed by genomic hybridization. Twenty micrograms of Atlantic salmon (A.S.) and rainbow trout (R.T.) genomic DNA were digested with four enzymes, <italic>Eco</italic>R I, <italic>Hind </italic>III, <italic>Bam</italic>H I and <italic>Bgl </italic>II and hybridized with radiolabeled probe 1 representing the 3'-end of the <italic>zlg </italic>mRNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-6-165-1"/></fig><p>Probing of 91,776 BAC clones on five Atlantic salmon genome BAC library filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] resulted in one positive BAC. This BAC (722P12) was subcloned, sequenced, and assembled into a 138,345 base pair contiguous sequence [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY785950">AY785950</ext-link>]. The assembly had more than 3000 high quality sequence reads and 10 fold sequence coverage in most regions. One gap of 500 bp was filled by PCR followed by sequencing from both directions. An <italic>in silico </italic>restriction digest matched experimental digests. The zonadhesin-like gene was the only gene found on this BAC. All other open reading frames were associated with LINE, SINE and transposon related repetitive elements.</p><p>Comparison of 722P12 against itself using Dotter and PipMaker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] did not reveal any recent domain expansions or duplications. The Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] was used to identify conserved domains of the predicted protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The SMART algorithm was used to detect three VWD domains (amino acid positions 31&#x02013;198, 415&#x02013;578 and 1277&#x02013;1498), a VWC domain at (position 365&#x02013;425), and two MAM domains (positions 708&#x02013;870 and 895&#x02013;1056). This tool also located three low complexity regions that corresponded to the mucin domains predicted by the computer program NetOGlyc 3.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These mucin domains occurred at positions 1091&#x02013;1099 and 1115&#x02013;1158 with a smaller low complexity region located between nucleotides 693 and 704. These results were corroborated using the InterPro domain prediction computer program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The SMART and InterPro domain prediction tools, in agreement with Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy data, did not find any transmembrane domains in the salmon Zlg. In contrast, the SMART tool detected a transmembrane domain at the expected location for zonadhesins from other species.</p><p>Using two distinct probes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), only one copy of <italic>zlg </italic>was found in Atlantic salmon by Southern blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). However, two bands occurred when the same probes were used with rainbow trout genomic DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Probe 1, which contained sequence homologous to the 3'-UTR of <italic>zlg </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), would be expected to be specific for this gene; however, probe 2 spanned VWD1 and could be expected to hybridize with related zonadhesin-like genes. Both probes gave similar results and only probe 1 data is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. Southern blot analysis did not reveal any other genes in Atlantic salmon other than <italic>zlg</italic>. This suggests that if another zonadhesin-like gene does exist in Atlantic salmon it is likely quite divergent from <italic>zlg</italic>.</p><p>The 5'-end of the <italic>zlg </italic>cDNA coding sequence was obtained by PCR using primers designed to the predicted translation start site on the BAC sequence. The final assembly of the cDNA was 4,791 bp [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY785949">AY785949</ext-link>]. The total length of the mRNA found by Northern blot was just over 5 Kb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The additional length of the mRNA is likely comprised of the 5'-UTR of <italic>zlg</italic>. The cDNA aligned completely to the BAC and the 23 consecutive exons of the zonadhesin-like gene utilized canonical splice sites. The cDNA has a predicted ORF of 4,518 bases that encodes a 1,506 amino acid protein. The predicted protein starts with a methionine and has a putative signal peptide of 18 amino acids. A poly (A) signal of AATAAA was identified by Genscan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] at 4770 bp from the start codon of the cDNA, 241 bp downstream of the stop codon.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of the Atlantic salmon <italic>zlg </italic>mRNA</bold>. A) Expression of the zonadhesin-like gene was analyzed in a variety of tissues. Ten micrograms of total RNA from liver, brain, spleen, kidney, midgut, hindgut, foregut and gonads from male and female Atlantic salmon was blotted on a positively charged nylon membrane and hybridized with radiolabeled probe 1 representing the 3'-end of the Atlantic salmon <italic>zlg </italic>mRNA. B) Analysis of the Atlantic salmon <italic>zlg </italic>tissue expression pattern by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR. <italic>Zlg </italic>primers ('probe 1' primer set) were used to test for the presence of the <italic>zlg </italic>cDNA. The EST to which the primers were designed [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CK990464">CK990464</ext-link>] and BAC 722P12 were used as positive controls. The genomic region encompassed by the primers contains two introns of 395 and 441 bp yielding a 1219 bp band upon amplification. C) Ubiquitin primers were used as a positive control for mRNA presence. <italic>zlg </italic>(ZAN neg) and ubiquitin (Ubi neg) template-free negative controls were included.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-6-165-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Salmo salar <italic>zlg </italic>expression</title><p>Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to identify tissues expressing the <italic>zlg </italic>mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Liver, brain, kidney, spleen, foregut, midgut, hindgut and gonads were taken from one male and one female Atlantic salmon. Male and female salmon showed expression in the liver, midgut and hindgut. However, expression in the spleen only occurred in the male and expression in the foregut only occurred in the female. A weak band was present in the ovarian sample and expression was not observed in the testes. This gene does not appear to be expressed in either male or female brain or kidney.</p><p>Northern blot results were similar to the RT-PCR results and showed a single band in male midgut and hindgut, and female midgut and foregut (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). A weak band was seen in the Northern blot analysis of liver from both male and female fish (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Unlike the RT-PCR results, Northern blot analysis did not detect a transcript in the male spleen and female hindgut. This discrepancy could be due to the higher sensitivity of the PCR experiment. The <italic>zlg </italic>expression pattern differed from the testes-specific expression known for mammalian zonadhesin. To clarify the relationship between <italic>zan </italic>and <italic>zan</italic>-like genes, we looked for related genes in the genomes of other fish.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic analysis of the zebrafish <italic>zan </italic>locus</title><p>An initial inspection of the ZV4 (September 6<sup>th</sup>, 2004 release) whole genome shotgun (WGS) assembly of the <italic>D. rerio </italic>genome suggested there are two copies of zonadhesin that exist at two distinct loci. One copy is found at linkage group 7 (scaffold 588) and consists entirely of whole genome shotgun reads. The second copy is found at linkage group 24 (scaffold 1965) and resides within a completely sequenced BAC from the CHORI-211 library [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BX649275">BX649275</ext-link>]. The ZV3 assembly contained only one copy of zonadhesin that also assembles into linkage group 7. It is important to note that the ZV3 assembly consisted entirely of whole genome shotgun reads; the ZV4 assembly incorporated finished BAC sequence into the ZV3 assembly; and that both assemblies are considered 'pre-assemblies' that need to be analyzed with caution. The location of zonadhesin at linkage group 7 is supported by the fact that other genes with significant similarity to human chromosome 7q22 map to the same region of the <italic>D</italic>.<italic>rerio </italic>genome. These genes include acetylcholine esterase, serpine, <italic>AP1S1</italic>, unnamed product FLJ39237, unnamed protein product FLJ10925 and mucin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of zebrafish BACs to the linkage group 7 of the ZV4 whole genome shotgun assembly</bold>. Approximately 600 Kb of the zonadhesin locus from the ZV4 assembly is shown on the x-axis. Alignments of this region to zebrafish BACs, the puffer fish (fugu) <italic>zan </italic>locus (Scaffold 860) and human 7q22 were performed using MultiPipMaker. Regions of high conservation consisting of gap-free alignments of at least 100 bp and 70 percent nucleotide sequence identity are shown in red and other locally aligned regions are shown in green. RepeatMasker [45] was used to mask zebrafish repeats before the alignments were made.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-6-165-3"/></fig><p>The regions surrounding the <italic>zan </italic>locus at both linkage groups were inspected for possible segmental duplications. BAC clones (both finished and unfinished) that aligned to a 600 kb region surrounding the <italic>zan </italic>locus at linkage group 7, or a 1 MB region at linkage group 24, were obtained and aligned to both loci using the BLASTZ algorithm through the MultiPipMaker web server. Our analysis showed that the zonadhesin-containing BAC BX649275 integrated completely into linkage group 7 and was &#x02245; 97% identical overall, not including indels. Seven additional BACs from the DKey library aligned to the scaffold and produced an acceptable tile through the entire <italic>zan </italic>locus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In contrast, only a portion of BAC BX649275 and a portion of BX640466.9 aligned to the <italic>zan </italic>locus at linkage group 24. This is suggestive of an assembly artifact that resulted in the assignment of a second zonadhesin gene to linkage group 24.</p><p>The differences between individual BACs, and between BACs and linkage group 7, can be as high as 3%. This amount of polymorphism is higher than the 0.5% polymorphism rate expected from the whole genome shotgun sequence, which came from approximately 1000, 5 day old embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Despite this high rate of polymorphism, the existence of one zonadhesin locus at linkage group 7 is supported by the large tile of overlapping clones at linkage group 7, and the rapidly evolving nature of zonadhesin genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Prediction of the zebrafish <italic>zan </italic>transcript and domain structure</title><p>We further analysed the zonadhesin gene found on the completely sequenced BAC (BX649275). The 4,616 amino acid translation product of the putative <italic>zan </italic>gene lacked a signal peptide, but contained the domain structure of: two MAM domains; a mucin domain; nine VWD domains; and a transmembrane region. This domain organization is typical of zonadhesin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The entire zonadhesin gene was also contained within 13 unordered pieces from the clone DKey-3K24 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CR848737.2">CR848737.2</ext-link>].

The predicted cDNA from CR848737.2 differs from the cDNA of BX649275 by 0.8%.

This primer set produced a doublet in both male and female (the larger band in the female was very faint) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The female bands were approximately 50 bp larger than the male bands. The differences between individuals may be due to a variation in mucin domain length since mucin domains have been shown to be variable in other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The second primer set flanked the ninth VWD domain and the third stretched from the epidermal growth factor domain to the cytoplasmic domain.

However, domain numbers between species are variable and this variability appears to have been influenced by tandem duplication. Tandem duplications have occurred in both mammalian and fish species and are most prevalent in the VWD domain region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It is this region which, at least in mammals, has been shown to be important for zona pellucida binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. While multiple VWD domains are found in all characterized zonadhesins, recent expansion of this domain is seen in the mouse and in the zebrafish. Repeated tandem duplication in the mouse zonadhesin gene resulted in 20 copies of a two-exon segment encoding a partial VWD3 domain that increased the length of the protein by over 2000 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In zebrafish, the double duplication of two domains homologous to the puffer fish VWD1 and VWD2, as well as a portion of the VWD3 domain (containing 17 VWD-coding exons), resulted in an additional 34 exons that encoded 4 additional full VWD domains and two partial VWD domains in the zebrafish Zan (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>The ancestral zonadhesin likely looked similar to the puffer fish Zan as it is very similar in length and domain structure to most mammalian zonadhesins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The puffer fish gene also has slightly higher identity with the human zonadhesin gene at 52% (indels removed) compared with the 50% identity between zebrafish and human whereas the zebrafish and puffer fish genes are 62% identical.</p><p>The five VWD domains of the puffer fish also cluster with the four in human (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The last four VWD domains of puffer fish Zan seem to be homologous to the last four human domains; although, the first VWD domain of puffer fish also has high similarity to the second domain in human. This may be the result of an ancient duplication of the first two VWD domains in puffer fish and subsequent loss of the new first domain. This inheritance is similar to that of the MAM domains.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogeny of the VWD and MAM domains of zonadhesin and zonadhesin-like genes</bold>.

This pattern of similarity could be explained by a duplication of both MAM domains in the human lineage and subsequent loss of the fourth domain. This phylogeny, in combination with the conserved domain order and synteny between fish and mammal zonadhesin loci, supports the orthologous relationship of these genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic and phylogenetic analysis of genes with a domain content similar to zonadhesin</title><p>Until this study, zonadhesin was generally thought to be unique in its domain content as no other genes were reported to contain MAM, mucin, TIL and VWD domains. However, the characterization of the salmon <italic>zlg </italic>revealed all of these domains, but in a different order (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The expression of <italic>zlg </italic>is similar to zebrafish zonadhesin which, in addition to domain content, established a possible evolutionary link between these genes. Examination of GenBank sequences also revealed that zonadhesin-like genes have been found in gut tissues of other species; however, the automated annotation is based on the similarity of the TIL and VWD domains of <italic>FCGBP</italic>. For example, there are three human colon ESTs [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AI984139">AI984139</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AI983786">AI983786</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AI983612">AI983612</ext-link>] that are annotated as similar to zonadhesin; however, these genes align perfectly to the <italic>FCGBP </italic>gene at chromosome 19q13.2.

This search uncovered several regions with VWD-containing proteins without any detectable MAM domains, some of these possibly related to FCGBP proteins. One interesting exception was a zonadhesin-like gene found on zebrafish chromosome 2. This putative zebrafish <italic>zlg </italic>encodes a 1,308 amino acid protein containing three MAM domains, the first of which is flanked by short (15 amino acid) mucin-like low complexity regions. The MAM domains are followed by two VWD domains. This gene structure is reminiscent of <italic>S. salar </italic>Zlg and shows that a zonadhesin ortholog and a <italic>zan</italic>-like gene exist together in the zebrafish genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>The search for zonadhesin-like genes in chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) did not reveal an obvious zonadhesin ortholog but rather a prediction of a FCGBP-like protein residing on chromosome 9 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XP422715.1">XP422715.1</ext-link>]. We analysed the corresponding region of the <italic>G. gallus </italic>genome and utilized additional EST evidence and <italic>in silico </italic>predictions to obtain a putative transcript that encodes a 4,770 amino acid gene product. This gene product contains three MAM domains in addition to VWD and mucin-type O-glycosylation sites after each of the MAM domains. Overall, this MAM-mucin-TIL-VWD series of domains is reminiscent of all zonadhesins and is evidence for a common evolutionary origin of zonadhesin, the zonadhesin-like genes and the Fc fragment of IgG binding protein(<italic>FCGBP</italic>).</p><p>We extracted the MAM and VWD domains of representative zonadhesin and zonadhesin-like genes and performed a phylogenetic analysis (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> respectively). In addition to the clustering of fish and mammalian zonadhesin, both phylogenetic trees suggest an evolutionary relationship among the zonadhesin-like genes. In particular, the zebrafish Zlg MAM1 and MAM2 domains grouped with the salmon Zlg MAMs as well as two of the chicken FCGBP-like MAM domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The grouping of the MAM domains of these proteins indicates that the zonadhesin-like genes represent a novel gene family that is distinct from zonadhesin.</p><p>Although the phylogeny is more complex with many nodes not well supported, the evolutionary relationship between the fish Zlgs and the chicken FCGBP-like gene was also observed for the VWD domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). For example, the VWD1 domains of the fish Zlgs clustered with the VWD2 and VWD5 domains of the chicken FCGBP-like gene. A second clade consisting of the VWD2 domains of salmon and zebrafish Zlg, and the VWD3 and VWD6 domain of the chicken FCGBP-like gene also formed. The clade containing puffer fish ZAN VWD5, human ZAN VWD4 and salmon Zlg VWD3 also suggests that zonadhesin is closely related to the zonadhesin-like genes. The human FCGBP VWD domains all formed a single clade except for VWD1 which grouped with the chicken FCGBP-like VWD1 and 4 (data not shown). Overall, the phylogenies of the VWD and MAM domains combined with the expression patterns of: fish zonadhesins, fish and chicken zonadhesin-like genes, <italic>FCGBP</italic>, mucin, and several MAM containing proteins, suggest that these mosaic genes share a common ancestor.</p></sec><sec><title>Zonadhesin in the context of other sperm-egg interacting proteins</title><p>Many mammalian zona pellucida adhesion molecule candidates appear to have evolved from different physiological processes. Well known examples of sperm proteins with enzymatic function that have been 'hijacked' into playing non-enzymatic roles in sperm-egg interactions include: B4GALT1/GalTase (beta 1,4 galactosyltransferase), SPAM1/PH-20 (hyaluronidase), HK1/ZRK/p95 (hexokinase), and ARSA/SLIP1 (aryl-sulfatase-A; reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]). Evidence for immune-system hijacking events comes from the discovery of several complement system proteins in human spermatozoa, seminal plasma and follicular fluid (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]). The partial activation of the complement system (without engaging the membrane attack complex) in acrosome-reacted spermatozoa suggests how components of a conserved immune system pathway could play a new role in sperm-egg recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although the function of the fish zonadhesin and zonadhesin-like genes is not known, their expression in the gut and absence of expression in the testes, combined with their homology to gut-expressed genes of the mucosal immune system (i.e. <italic>FCGBP </italic>and mucin), suggest that zonadhesin was also 'hijacked' by the mammalian reproductive system.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified zonadhesin genes in zebrafish and puffer fish that are similar in domain order and content to all known mammalian orthologs.

In addition to these orthologs, we characterized zonadhesin-like genes (<italic>zlg</italic>) in Atlantic salmon, zebrafish and chicken. While the Atlantic salmon <italic>zlg </italic>contained the same domains found in zonadhesin, the order of these domains was altered and the expression was found predominantly in the gut and not in the testes.

Genomic regions from all significant matches were extracted and gene prediction analysis was performed using Genscan.</p></sec><sec><title>Domain predictions and phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Protein domains were predicted using SMART and InterPro prediction tools and the domains were extracted from the parent nucleotide and protein sequences. Multiple sequence alignments of the extracted domains were done using ClustalX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] followed by manual inspection. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">additional file 2</xref> for VWD and MAM multiple alignments respectively. Neighbor-joining trees were created using MEGA3. Consensus trees based on 1000 pseudoreplicates are reported with the bootstrap support values indicated above the respective nodes. Gaps were removed and we reported phylogenetic data using the Poisson correction model with uniform rates across all sites. Neighbor-joining trees were also performed using the Poisson correction model with unequal rates across sites using gamma distance parameters 0.65 and 2.25. While some of the less supported nodes changed, the clades discussed here did not vary substantially using these different parameters for either the MAM or the VWD trees. We also used the equal input model using either uniform rates across all sites or unequal rates across all sites using gamma distance parameters 0.65 and 2.25. Again these parameters did not change the topology of the clades discussed in the text.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PNDH carried out the molecular genetic studies, sequencing and sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript.
