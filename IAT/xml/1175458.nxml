However, in the putative active site of ATL proteins, a tryptophan (W<sup>83</sup>) residue replaces the cysteine at the known active site of alkyltransferases. The <italic>Escherichia coli atl</italic> gene was expressed as a fusion protein and purified. Neither ATL nor C<sup>83</sup> or A<sup>83</sup> mutants transferred [<sup>3</sup>H] from [<sup>3</sup>H]-methylated DNA to themselves, and the levels of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyl guanine (<italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG) in substrate DNA were not affected by ATL. However, ATL inhibited the transfer of methyl groups to human alkyltransferase (MGMT). Inhibition was reduced by prolonged incubation in the presence of MGMT, again suggesting that <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in the substrate is not changed by ATL. Gel-shift assays show that ATL binds to short single- or double-stranded oligonucleotides containing <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG, but not to oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoguanine, ethenoadenine, 5-hydroxycytosine or <italic>O</italic><sup>4</sup>-methylthymine. There was no evidence of demethylation of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG or of glycosylase or endonuclease activity. Overexpression of ATL in <italic>E.coli</italic> increased, or did not affect, the toxicity of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;-nitro-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosoguanidine in an alklyltransferase-proficient and -deficient strain, respectively. These results suggest that ATL may act as a damage sensor that flags <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG and possibly other <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-alkylation lesions for processing by other repair pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-methylguanine (<italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG) is a potentially mutagenic and toxic lesion in DNA that is one of the many products of damage by certain classes of carcinogenic and chemotherapeutic alkylating agents. The processing of this lesion is thus of considerable interest in both the etiology and treatment of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). It is well established that the biological effects of such agents can be extensively prevented by the highly conserved DNA repair protein <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase, which reverses <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG damage in DNA by the stoichiometric and auto-inactivating transfer of the methyl group to a cysteine residue in its active site (P<underline>C</underline>HRV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Some prokaryotes, including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, contain two alkyltransferase genes: the inducible <italic>ada</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and the constitutively expressed <italic>ogt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), and other prokaryotes contain only one of these genes. Human cells express a single <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase [referred to as MGMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>)].</p><p><italic>In silico</italic> analysis has revealed a family of genes we have called the alkyltransferase-like (ATL) genes because of their extensive amino acid sequence similarity to the alkyltransferase proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The <italic>E.coli</italic> ATL is 21 and 19% identical and 34 and 30% similar to OGT and MGMT, respectively. Alignment of ATL and other alkyltransferase sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) shows that in ATL, the alkyltransferase active site cysteine residue (C<sup>145</sup>) has been replaced with a conserved tryptophan (W<sup>83</sup> in the <italic>E.coli</italic> ATL). ATL proteins are common among prokaryotes, with <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans R1</italic> being an example of a prokaryotic organism containing ATL that does not have a recognizable alkyltransferase gene (i.e. one encoding the characteristic PCHRV). Within the eukaryotes, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> contains a sequence homolog of ATL. Interestingly, this organism also does not possess an alkyltransferase protein. The method by which such organisms process <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in DNA, if any, is not known.</p><p>In order to define the possible role of ATL in the processing of alkylation damage in DNA, we isolated and overexpressed the gene from <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified the protein. We characterized the protein, and two site-directed mutants in a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using, as putative substrates, <italic>N</italic>-[<sup>3</sup>H]-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea-methylated DNA and short synthetic oligonucleotides containing <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG or other modified bases.

Conversion of the ATL putative active site W<sup>83</sup> to C<sup>83</sup> (or, as a negative control, A<sup>83</sup>) did not confer methyl transfer capacity on the ATL protein under the incubation conditions used. As expected, conversion of the active site C<sup>145</sup> in human MGMT to W<sup>145</sup> removed its methyl transfer capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The nature of the MGMT assay would not allow us to assess if [<sup>3</sup>H]-methyl groups had been released from the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in substrate DNA into solution by ATL or if the strong acid hydrolysis step of the assay may have degraded a putative methylated ATL protein to acid solubility. To determine this, we used mild acid hydrolysis and HPLC to determine the amounts of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in substrate DNA. Incubation with ATL for 6 h had no detectable effect on <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG levels, whereas methyl transfer to the human MGMT under protein limiting conditions substantially reduced the amounts of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in the substrate.

While MGMT restored the blocked digest site and resulted in two fragments following PstI digestion, no such cleavage was seen following incubation with ATL again indicating that demethylation had probably not occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ATL inhibits the action of MGMT on <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in DNA</title><p>Although ATL displays no ability to release or transfer methyl groups from <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in substrate DNA, we found that the ability of MGMT to transfer methyl groups was extensively inhibited by the presence of ATL during the incubation. In initial assays, ATL was pre-incubated with substrate DNA for 10 min and then a protein-limiting amount of MGMT was added and incubation continued for a further 50 min. Under these conditions, inhibition of MGMT activity was proportional to the amount of ATL added. The C<sup>83</sup> or A<sup>83</sup> mutant proteins were both, and to a similar extent, rather less effective than wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The MGMT W<sup>145</sup> mutant did not inhibit methyl transfer by wild-type MGMT under the assay conditions used (data not shown).</p><p>The ATL-mediated inhibition of MGMT was reversible. Using amounts of the wild type, C<sup>83</sup> or A<sup>83</sup> proteins that were approximately equally effective in the inhibition of MGMT seen above (1.4, 5.7 and 5.7 &#x003bc;g, respectively), progressively more methyl transfer to MGMT occurred with time up to 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The wild-type and both mutant proteins showed almost identical kinetics of loss of inhibition. In agreement with the methyl transfer assays (see above), HPLC analysis also showed that MGMT could partially deplete the levels of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in substrate DNA after 6 h incubation in the presence of ATL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ATL binds specifically to <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in DNA</title><p>To examine the mechanism by which ATL inhibited the action of MGMT on <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in substrate DNA, we incubated <sup>32</sup>P-labelled synthetic oligonucleotides containing single <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG residues with purified ATL and analysed the products by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging.

That the shifted band had the same electrophoretic mobility when either single- or double-stranded substrate was used may indicate that ATL had denatured the double-stranded oligonucleotide.

In the isogenic <italic>ada</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>/ogt</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain (GWR111), which is MNNG-sensitive, there was a greater protection provided by human MGMT, but there was no effect of ATL overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The primary sequence similarities between ATL and prokaryotic and eukaryotic alkyltransferase proteins led us to hypothesize that ATL may have a role in processing the type of DNA damage that is repaired by MGMT. The presence of a tryptophan residue in place of cysteine at the region of ATL that is homologous to the active site of MGMT suggested that the ATL protein would not be an alkyltransferase but might be an unusual demethylase, glycosylase or endonuclease. Whether or not conversion of the W<sup>83</sup> to C<sup>83</sup> would confer alkyltransferase activity was also considered.</p><p>Our initial approach was to assess the effect of ATL and the C<sup>83</sup> and A<sup>83</sup> mutants on [<sup>3</sup>H]-methylated substrate DNA. Under assay conditions in which MGMT was highly effective, no transfer of radioactivity to protein was evident with any of these proteins. The absence of transfer activity in the C<sup>83</sup> mutant, which has the putative active site sequence identical to that of MGMT, is intriguing, given that many of the other residues around the active site of MGMT that are required for alkyl transfer function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) are also present in ATL. Presumably, other amino acid residues essential for this function are missing from ATL.</p><p>Although no <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG processing was seen (see below), it was very clear that preincubation of the substrate DNA with ATL could almost completely inhibit the transfer of methyl groups from <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG to human MGMT. This was also the case but to a lesser extent, with the mutant ATL proteins, whereas no inhibition was seen using similar quantities of the W<sup>145</sup> mutant of MGMT. For all three ATL proteins, continuing the incubation after the addition of MGMT resulted in progressively more methyl transfer to MGMT, suggesting that the binding was competitive with that of MGMT. The mutations we had introduced did not appear to have a major impact on such binding. We cannot exclude the possibility that the reversal of inhibition represents a slow denaturation of the ATL proteins, although the gel-shift assay results that involved thermal denaturation suggest that this might not be the case. However, it seems more likely that the bound ATL protein is in equilibrium with the free protein and that MGMT competes with ATL for the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in substrate DNA. These data are difficult to interpret since, given that the assay for ATL activity is indirect, we cannot determine the number of functionally active ATL molecules, so the stoichiometry of the inhibition cannot be established. Inhibition of MGMT by ATL resembles the action of the A<sup>145</sup> mutant of MGMT, which binds to <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG and is reported to mask it from nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Masking and protection of <italic>O</italic><sup>4</sup>-methylthymine in DNA against nucleotide excision repair has also been observed with wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) MGMT.</p><p>The slow reversal of MGMT inhibition by ATL provides further evidence that the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in the substrate DNA was not affected by ATL. We confirmed this by HPLC analysis of the substrate following incubation with amounts of ATL that inhibited MGMT. This showed no change in the amounts of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG that had been structurally modified by ATL, as had originally been reported for the action of the <italic>ada</italic> alkyltransferase on <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), but that the products co-eluted with the marker <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG seems improbable but was made even less likely by the use of reverse-phase HPLC. This also demonstrated no ATL-mediated decrease in the size of the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG peak (data not shown).</p><p>Binding of ATL to <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG was further confirmed in non-denaturing gel-shift assays using either single- or double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides containing single <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG residues, paired in the latter case with T, C, G or A. We also showed that this binding is specific insofar as oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoguanine, ethenoadenine, 5-hydroxycytosine or <italic>O</italic><sup>4</sup>-methylthymine did not bind to ATL under the same conditions. The ability of ATL to bind to <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in the oligonucleotides appears to be preserved after heat denaturation, suggesting that the protein is thermostable, or rapidly renatures upon cooling.</p><p>MGMT did not result in any visible gel shift using <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG-containing oligonucleotides under the conditions we used, indicating that ATL binding may have been much stronger than that of MGMT. However, it has been shown that modification of the active site cysteine residue alters the affinity of MGMT for DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and this may be the reason that we did not see a gel shift with this protein.</p><p>In support of the HPLC analyses, restriction endonuclease digestion of ATL-treated <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG-containing oligonucleotides did not restore the PstI site therein and thus gave no evidence of a demethylase activity; we did not see evidence of glycosylase or endonuclease activity on the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG-containing oligonucleotides. It is important to note that in most of the assays we have used one set of experimental conditions and we cannot exclude the possibility that different conditions may have led us to other conclusions. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to conclude that ATL binds specifically to <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in methylated DNA and one consequence of this is that access of MGMT to the damage is restricted. The ability of ATL to bind but not to modify <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in DNA suggests that it may act as a damage sensing protein that flags such damage for processing by other repair pathways. However, in most of the organisms we have examined <italic>in silico</italic> (the exceptions being <italic>S.pombe</italic> and <italic>Deinococcus</italic>), ATL encoding genes are present in addition to recognizable alkyltransferase genes. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results indicate that ATL may mask <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG from efficient repair by such alkyltransferases.</p><p>This possibility was examined by the overexpression of ATL in isogenic <italic>E.coli</italic> strains differing in endogenous alkyltransferase activity. Thus, in the wild-type AB1157 strain, and in support of the <italic>in vitro</italic> results, ATL increased the toxic effects of the methylating agent MNNG, presumably by attenuating the repair of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG by the endogenous alkyltransferases. In non-adapted <italic>E.coli</italic>, this would predominantly be by OGT and to a lesser extent by ADA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Overexpression of human MGMT in this strain complemented the effects of the endogenous proteins and reduced the toxicity of MNNG. In the MNNG-sensitive <italic>ada</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>/ogt</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain, overexpression of human MGMT had a very substantial protective effect, but ATL did not affect the toxicity of MNNG. This suggests that ATL is not the rate-limiting step in <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG processing in the absence of OGT and ADA, again in support of the <italic>in vitro</italic> data.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the ATL protein from <italic>E.coli</italic> has the ability to bind specifically to <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in oligonucleotides and DNA without methyl transfer or removal or glycosylase or endonuclease activity. The binding strongly, but reversibly, inhibits the action of MGMT on <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in substrate DNA. Overexpression of ATL in <italic>E.coli</italic> increases the toxicity of MNNG probably via binding to <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG and inhibition of endogenous alkyltransferase. It seems reasonable to speculate that the function of ATL is not the inhibition of alkyltransferase activity. It is more likely that it act as a damage sensor that flags <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-alkylguanine lesions for processing by other pathways. It would thus complement alkyltransferase activity in situations where the number or type of lesions present are not effectively repaired by alkytransferase.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Prof. A.
