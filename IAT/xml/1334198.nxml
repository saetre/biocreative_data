This asymmetric control of activities represents one important form of cell polarity. There are significant gaps in our understanding of the components involved in generating and maintaining polarity during chemotaxis. Here we characterize a family of complexes (which we term leading edge complexes), scaffolded by hematopoietic protein 1 (Hem-1), that organize the neutrophil's leading edge. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE)2 complex, which mediates activation of actin polymerization by Rac, is only one member of this family. A subset of these leading edge complexes are biochemically separable from the WAVE2 complex and contain a diverse set of potential polarity-regulating proteins. RNA interference&#x02013;mediated knockdown of Hem-1&#x02013;containing complexes in neutrophil-like cells: (a) dramatically impairs attractant-induced actin polymerization, polarity, and chemotaxis; (b) substantially weakens Rac activation and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-<italic>tris</italic>-phosphate production, disrupting the (phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-<italic>tris</italic>-phosphate)/Rac/F-actin&#x02013;mediated feedback circuit that organizes the leading edge; and (c) prevents exclusion of activated myosin from the leading edge, perhaps by misregulating leading edge complexes that contain inhibitors of the Rho-actomyosin pathway. Taken together, these observations show that versatile Hem-1&#x02013;containing complexes coordinate diverse regulatory signals at the leading edge of polarized neutrophils, including but not confined to those involving WAVE2-dependent actin polymerization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The authors describe a group of multiprotein complexes, scaffolded by Hem-1 (a subset of which also contain WAVE2), that are involved in generating and maintaining cellular polarity in neutrophils.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Directed cell polarity is necessary for unicellular organisms to hunt and mate, for metazoan development, and for leukocytes to mediate inflammation and immune responses. Migrating cells need to make different actin assemblies at the front and the back and to maintain physical separation of signals for these assemblies.

GFP-Hem-1, found throughout the cytosol of unstimulated cells, rapidly translocates to the cell periphery on exposure to a uniform concentration of a tripeptide chemoattractant, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). As the cells polarize, Hem-1 goes on to accumulate almost exclusively at the leading edge, with spatial and temporal dynamics similar to those of ruffling and protrusion of the pseudopod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>). Endogenous Hem-1 also concentrates at the leading edge of polarized neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) as well as intracellular puncta. These puncta are not observed for GFP-tagged Hem-1 and may represent the cytosolic pool of Hem-1 complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Hem-1 Subunit of the WAVE Regulatory Complex Exists in Pools outside of the WAVE2 Complex</title><p>The <italic>trans</italic>-inhibitory mode of WAVE regulation raised the possibility that Hem-1&#x02013;containing complexes might also control effectors other than WAVE2. If so, Hem-1 complexes should exist in biochemical pools distinct from WAVE2, be more abundant than WAVE2, and associate with proteins other than or in addition to WAVE2. All these predictions were confirmed in leukocyte lysates.</p><p>Pools of Hem-1 can be biochemically separated from the WAVE2 complex. Immunoblotting with antibodies raised against Hem-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) showed that essentially all Hem-1 in neutrophil lysates fractionates by gel filtration in large complexes centered at about 600 kDa (Hem-1 is only 128 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Hem-1 and WAVE2 partially overlap in eluates from gel filtration columns, but the Hem-1 peak is broader than that of WAVE2, and high-molecular-weight pools of Hem-1 are found in fractions devoid of WAVE2. Hem-1 similarly shows a much broader biochemical profile than WAVE2 when neutrophil lysates are subjected to chromatography on two different ion exchange columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g002">2</xref>D).</p><p>If Hem-1 is present in complexes in addition to the WAVE2 complex, its cellular abundance should be greater than that of WAVE2. We quantitated the relative concentrations of Hem-1 and WAVE2 in leukocyte cytosol, using native purified pig leukocyte WAVE2 complex as a standard; the standard contains equimolar concentrations of Hem-1 and WAVE2. Serial dilutions of the WAVE2 complex versus leukocyte cytosol reveal a 2.8-fold greater abundance of Hem-1 than of WAVE2 (360 versus 130 nM) in undiluted leukocyte lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), indicating that more than 60&#x00025; of Hem-1 is not associated with WAVE2. Excess Hem-1 is associated with other proteins, because the Hem-1 in crude lysates migrates on gel filtration in complexes at least as large as the WAVE2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Moreover, pools of Hem-1 in excess of WAVE2 are unlikely to associate primarily with other WAVE isoforms, because only WAVE2 is identified in Hem-1 immunoprecipitates from HL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) and only trace amounts of WAVE1 and WAVE3 protein are present in HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Hem-1 forms large complexes with proteins other than WAVE2.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Putative Polarity Regulators Coimmunoprecipitate with Hem-1</title><p>To identify possible non-WAVE effectors for the regulatory subunits of the WAVE complex, we used peptide antibodies to immunoprecipitate endogenous Hem-1 from neutrophil-like HL-60 lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Antibodies raised against an internal or a C-terminal Hem-1 peptide both effectively precipitated Hem-1 along with CYFIP1/PIR121 and its homolog CYFIP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), which are usually associated with Hem-1 homologs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040038-t001">Table 1</xref>). Only the antibody directed against the internal Hem-1 epitope coimmunoprecipitated the other known components of the WAVE2 complex (indicated by blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), suggesting that different Hem-1 epitopes are exposed in different protein complexes. In contrast, no detectable proteins are immunoprecipitated with control IgG under these conditions.</p><p>In addition to the expected components of the neutrophil WAVE2 complex, both Hem-1 antibodies also immunoprecipitate several excellent candidates for regulating the positive and negative feedback loops involved in leukocyte polarity. In particular, Hem-1 coimmunoprecipitates with proteins that could play a role in excluding myosin activity from the leading edge, including myosin light chain phosphatase (the catalytic subunit and the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit Mypt1) and two different Rho-specific GTPase activating proteins (GAPs)&#x02014;RhoGAP4 and myosin IXB (which is a myosin motor and a Rho-specific GAP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040038-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">see Discussion</xref>). Furthermore, Hem-1 associates with proteins that could play a role in front positive feedback, including Vps34 and Abi-1 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">see Discussion</xref>). The proteins unambiguously identified by mass spectrometry in Hem-1 immunoprecipitations are shown at their relative positions in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).</p><p>The most abundant coimmunoprecipitating proteins could be identified in small-scale immunoprecipitations from 300 &#x003bc;l of neutrophil cytosol; these include RhoGAP4 (a hematopoietic Rho-specific GAP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040038-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040038-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;), myosin light chain phosphatase, and Vps34, a class III phosphatidylinositol-3&#x02032;-kinase (PI3K). Like WAVE2, these proteins comigrate with Hem-1 as high-molecular-weight complexes on gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), suggesting that a substantial portion of these proteins could be associated with some of the same regulatory subunits (e.g., Hem-1 and CYFIP1/2) that are also found in the WAVE complex. Indeed, knockdown of Hem-1 decreases the amount of RhoGAP4 present in high-molecular-weight gel filtration fractions, suggesting a significant partitioning of RhoGAP4 in Hem-1 complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). These novel leading edge complexes are unlikely, however, to contain WAVE2, which can be separated from them with conventional chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).</p><p>Additional evidence suggests that RhoGAP4, myosin light chain phosphatase, and Vps34 are associated with Hem-1&#x02013;scaffolded complexes distinct from the WAVE2 complex. For example, myosin light chain phosphatase, WAVE2, and RhoGAP4 exhibit different elution profiles from one another on cation and anion exchange columns (data not shown). Moreover, Hem-1 antibodies immunoprecipitated RhoGAP4 from lysates of dHL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g003">Figure 3</xref>D1), and antibodies generated against RhoGAP4 immunoprecipitated Hem-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g003">Figure 3</xref>D2), but not WAVE2 (data not shown). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that Rhogap4, WAVE2, and other components are present in larger complexes that do not survive immunoprecipitation and ion exchange, we favor the interpretation that they represent separate Hem-1 complexes. Three proteins that associate with Hem-1/Hem-2&#x02014;including Abi-1 (one of the subunits of the WAVE2 complex), Nck (an SH2/SH3 domain containing adaptor protein that is known to bind the Hem-1 homolog Hem-2/Nap125), and RhoGAP4&#x02014;contain highly homologous SH3 domains, which may represent a general binding motif for components of the leading edge complexes. Indeed, the SH3 domain of RhoGAP4 sufficed to pull down Hem-1 from neutrophil lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g003">Figure 3</xref>D3).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Actin Polymerization and Polarity Require Hem-1</title><p>To assess potential roles of leading edge complexes in cell polarity, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete Hem-1 in dHL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

Moreover, the cellular distribution of polymerized filamentous actin (F-actin) differs markedly in control versus Hem-1&#x02013;depleted cells treated in suspension with fMLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Unstimulated cells have relatively low levels of cortical F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040038-g004">Figure 4</xref>D1).

While residual functions at the leading edge of these cells may reflect activity of a small amount of residual Hem-1, it is also possible that fMLP regulates actin polymerization by mechanisms that do not include either Hem-1 or WAVE-family proteins and that may or may not involve Rac. In accord with the latter idea, genetic ablation of SCAR, the only WAVE homolog expressed of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Dictyostelium discoideum</named-content>, produces amoebae that retain considerable ability to polarize and migrate toward a source of chemoattractant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040038-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040038-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

Partially purified WAVE2 complex was used to quantitate relative concentrations of Hem-1 and WAVE2 in pig leukocyte lysates. The ratio of all of the components of the WAVE2 complex is 1:1 in the purified complex. Protein concentrations can be determined by fitting a single point to a standard curve or by comparing two dilution series to one another. The latter is a more accurate means to calculate protein concentration. When plotted from 0&#x000d7; to 1&#x000d7; dilution on the x-axis, the ratio of the slopes of two dilution series indicates their relative concentrations. The WAVE2 complex was serially diluted into pig leukocyte lysate (top curves&#x02014;dilution into lysate is necessary because some proteins blot differently in buffer versus lysate) or pig leukocyte lysate was serially diluted into buffer (bottom curves). Both blots (Hem-1 and WAVE2) are from the same dilution series and the same gel. For this experiment, 14.8 nM WAVE2 complex standard and 1:20 pig leukocyte lysate represent 1&#x000d7; dilution (from which the 0.1&#x000d7;, 0.2&#x000d7;, 0.3&#x000d7;, and 0.4&#x000d7; dilutions were prepared). The relative slopes of the curves in each blot indicate concentration of proteins in the lysate versus the WAVE2 standard. Thus, for this experiment, the Hem-1 concentration in pig leukocyte lysate (E1) is 31.9/26.4 or 1.2&#x000d7; the concentration of the WAVE2 complex standard. Thus, 1.2 &#x000d7; 14.8 (concentration of Hem1 in Wave2 complex standard) &#x000d7; 20 (dilution factor of pig lysate) = approximately 360 nM Hem-1 in a 1&#x000d7; pig leukocyte lysate. Similarly, WAVE2 (E2) is 12.4/27.9 or 0.45&#x000d7; the concentration of the WAVE2 complex standard. Thus, 0.45 &#x000d7; 14.8 (concentration of WAVE2 in 2 complex standard) &#x000d7; 20 (dilution factor of pig lysate) = approximately 130 nM WAVE2 in a 1&#x000d7; pig leukocyte lysate.

The leading and trailing edges of the cell are organized by different GTPases. Rac plays a role in two positive feedback circuits that organize the leading edge and drive stable protrusion (we call this nested feedback circuit Rac/actin/PIP<sub>3</sub> positive feedback). A separate GTPase (Rho) organizes myosin-based contraction at the trailing edge, primarily through inactivation of myosin light chain phosphatase, leading to local phosphorylation and activation of myosin light chain. Several positive and negative feedback circuits are essential for the proper organization of cell polarity, but not all of the proteins involved in these circuits are known. In this paper, we discuss several leading edge protein complexes that play a role in organizing of the leading edge. These leading edge complexes link Rac with actin assembly (Activity 1) and play a role in a Rac positive feedback circuit (Activity 2), both essential elements of the positive feedback loop that organizes the leading edge. Leading edge complexes also potentially link Rac to the inhibition of Rho activity (Activity 3) and inhibition of myosin activation (Activity 4), both of which would act to exclude myosin phosphorylation from the leading edge. For simplicity, this model focuses on activities that are addressed in this paper and omits other possible links involved in Rac/actin/PIP<sub>3</sub> positive feedback and from Rac to Rho and myosin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040038.g008"/></fig><table-wrap id="pbio-0040038-t001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>WAVE Complex Homologs and Nomenclature in Various Species</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040038.t001"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="other"><p>Citation: Weiner OD, Rentel MC, Ott A, Brown GE, Jedrychowski M, et al.
