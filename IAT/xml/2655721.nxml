Inflammatory response is a key process of host defense against invading pathogens. We report here that intranasal instillation of a <italic>B. anthracis</italic> strain bearing inactive LT stimulates cytokine production and polymorphonuclear (PMN) neutrophils recruitment in lungs. These responses are repressed by a prior instillation of an LT preparation. In contrast, instillation of a <italic>B. anthracis</italic> strain expressing active LT represses lung inflammation. The inhibitory effects of LT on cytokine production are also observed <italic>in vitro</italic> using mouse and human pulmonary epithelial cells. These effects are associated with an alteration of ERK and p38-MAPK phosphorylation, but not JNK phosphorylation. We demonstrate that although NF-&#x003ba;B is essential for IL-8 expression, LT downregulates this expression without interfering with NF-&#x003ba;B activation in epithelial cells. Histone modifications are known to induce chromatin remodelling, thereby enhancing NF-&#x003ba;B binding on promoters of a subset of genes involved in immune response. We show that LT selectively prevents histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser 10 and recruitment of the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B at the IL-8 and KC promoters. Our results suggest that <italic>B. anthracis</italic> represses the immune response, in part by altering chromatin accessibility of IL-8 promoter to NF-&#x003ba;B in epithelial cells. This epigenetic reprogramming, in addition to previously reported effects of LT, may represent an efficient strategy used by <italic>B. anthracis</italic> for invading the host.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p><italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, the etiological agent of anthrax, can infect mammals either accidentally or as a potential consequence of a terrorism threat.

Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms of host defense against <italic>B. anthracis</italic>. We examined the effects of various <italic>B. anthracis</italic> strains on lung inflammation in a mouse model of pulmonary anthrax and on human lung epithelial cells, the first barrier of lung against invading pathogens.

We next examined the mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effect of lethal toxin. We showed that <italic>B. anthracis</italic> injects lethal toxin into epithelial cells, blocks the molecules associated on the chromosome, and thus represses production of mediators involved in inflammation. As the latter is a key process in host defense, its alteration by lethal toxin predisposes the host to infection by <italic>B. anthracis</italic>.

Germination leads to bacterial multiplication and dissemination through the whole organism. Despite a therapeutic intervention, all forms of infection may progress to fatal systemic anthrax, which is characterized by shock-like symptoms, sepsis, and respiratory failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Turnbull1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, investigation of the immune response triggered by <italic>B. anthracis</italic> may help to better understand the pathophysiology of anthrax and to develop efficient therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this disease.</p><p>The innate immune response, including the inflammatory reaction that is the first line of host defense against invading pathogens, is characterized by upregulation of various inflammatory genes due to the activation of transcription factors. IL-8 (Interleukine-8, CXCL8) is a human chemokine that induces the recruitment of polymorphonuclear (PMN) neutrophils from the blood to the injured tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Baggiolini1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This allows PMN to eradicate the invading pathogen within the site of infection. In healthy tissues, IL-8 is barely detectable, but is rapidly induced by nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and activator protein 1 (AP-1)-dependent inflammatory stimuli such as TNF&#x003b1;, bacteria or virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, significant advances in the understanding of signaling pathways, which regulate IL-8 transcription as well as mRNA stabilization in response to external stimuli, have been made <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. It is now clearly established that induction of inflammatory genes is associated with local changes in histone modification that plays a major role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The core histones including H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 are the basic components of the nucleosomes that organize the cellular DNA in chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Strahl1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Thomson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Covalent modifications of the histones play a major role in gene regulation by affecting chromatin compaction and thereby DNA accessibility. These modifications can result in either transcriptional repression (like for H3me3K9 and H3me1K27) or activation (H3me3K4, H3pS10 and acetylation at various positions) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Clayton1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Volmat1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The exact mechanisms by which <italic>B. anthracis</italic> induces anthrax disease are not fully understood; however, it is clearly established that this bacterium spreads rapidly into the host at the early stages of infection with low or no detectable immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Lincoln1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Baldari1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000359-Fukao1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Remarkably, LT repressed IL-8 expression without interfering with NF-&#x003ba;B activation, an essential transcription factor for IL-8 expression. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in this inhibition revealed that LT blocked histone (H3) phosphorylation at serine 10, a modification normally induced by activation of the MAPK pathway and that is also involved in chromatin accessibility for NF-&#x003ba;B.

All strains used in this study were in bacilli form.

Our results showed that NF-&#x003ba;B activation in Beas-2B cells occurred <italic>via</italic> a MAPK-independent process. This led us to suggest that MAPK act down-stream of NF-&#x003ba;B activation to modulate IL-8 expression.

This process seems also to play a role in the modulation of KC promoter activity, the mouse functional orthologue of human IL-8 promoter. This epigenetic modulation, which is in part under the control of MAPKs, may occur only in the chromatin context whose remodeling favors the recruitment of transcription machinery components including NF-&#x003ba;B. This may explain why MAPK inhibition failed to interfere with the activation of the transfected IL-8 promoter reporter construct, which is not in the context of chromatin and therefore cannot be modulated <italic>via</italic> a MAPK-dependent epigenetic remodeling.
