However, no <italic>in vitro</italic> telomeric DNA binding is associated with Arabidopsis POT1 paralogs. To further investigate POT1&#x02013;DNA interaction in plants, we cloned <italic>POT1</italic> genes from 11 plant species representing major branches of plant kingdom. Telomeric DNA binding was associated with POT1 proteins from the green alga <italic>Ostreococcus lucimarinus</italic> and two flowering plants, maize and Asparagus. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that several residues critical for telomeric DNA recognition in vertebrates are functionally conserved in plant POT1 proteins. However, the plant proteins varied in their minimal DNA-binding sites and nucleotide recognition properties. Green alga POT1 exhibited a strong preference for the canonical plant telomere repeat sequence TTTAGGG with no detectable binding to hexanucleotide telomere repeat TTAGGG found in vertebrates and some plants, including Asparagus. In contrast, POT1 proteins from maize and Asparagus bound TTAGGG repeats with only slightly reduced affinity relative to the TTTAGGG sequence. We conclude that the nucleic acid binding site in plant POT1 proteins is evolving rapidly, and that the recent acquisition of TTAGGG telomere repeats in Asparagus appears to have co-evolved with changes in POT1 DNA sequence recognition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres are the ancient nucleoprotein structures that define the physical ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, protecting them from deleterious activities, such as recombination and nucleolytic attack, and providing a means to replenish telomeric DNA lost during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Defects in telomere structure or length maintenance result in cell proliferation and genome maintenance abnormalities, senescence or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Telomere structure and composition is conserved across different eukaryotic lineages. Telomeric DNA typically consists of tandem arrays of short G-rich repeats that can reach thousands of nucleotides in length. The extreme 3&#x02032;-ends of the chromosomes terminate in a single-stranded protrusion termed the G-overhang. Several evolutionarily conserved proteins bind directly to the double-stranded region of the telomeric DNA or to the single-strand G-overhang to form the first layer of telomere-associated protein factors. Together with bridging proteins, these DNA-binding factors constitute a telomere-specific protein complex termed shelterin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>The green plant lineage represents a monophyletic group of photosynthetic organisms that evolved near the base of eukaryotic life and shared the last common ancestor with fungi and animals &#x0223c;1.5 billion years ago (bya) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Despite such long divergence time, many aspects of telomere biology are well conserved between plants and animals. The telomere repeat sequence in the vast majority of plants is TTTAGGG, one nucleotide longer than the 6-base sequence TTAGGG found in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Interestingly, a few outliers exist in the plant kingdom, that harbor atypical or unknown telomere sequence. For example, while many green algae exhibit the canonical plant TTTAGGG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) (E. Shakirov and D. Shippen, unpublished results), telomeres in the model fresh water alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii </italic>are composed of the eight nucleotide repeat TTTTAGGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Onions (<italic>Allium cepa</italic>) and related species lack simple telomere repeats and instead appear to harbor terminally located satellite DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Most intriguing is the situation in two phylogenetically unrelated groups of flowering plants (angiosperms), in which canonical TTTAGGG repeats have been replaced by the vertebrate-type hexanucleotide TTAGGG sequence. One of these plant groups is comprised of a handful of obscure Solanaceae (tomato family) species native to South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The second group consists of a large number of families in the Asparagales order, and represents one of the most successful lineages of extant flowering plants, with 22 000&#x02013;25 000 currently known species, or nearly 10% of all angiosperms, including Irises, Hyacinths, Agaves and Amaryllis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The switch in telomeric DNA sequence from TTTAGGG to TTAGGG is thought to have occurred approximately 90 million years ago (mya) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and likely corresponds to a single nucleotide deletion in the template region of the telomerase RNA subunit. This sequence change may have posed a challenge for the plant shelterin complex to maintain chromosome end protection, although the successful diversification of Asparagales argues that these plants accommodated the mutation in telomeric DNA sequence in a short evolutionary time frame. Such compensatory changes likely involved co-evolution of telomere-binding proteins to allow binding to the new telomere repeat sequence, but the molecular mechanisms of these changes are currently unknown.</p><p>In vertebrates and fission yeast, POT1 (Protection Of Telomeres) binds single-strand G-rich telomeric DNA with high affinity and plays a pivotal role in mediating telomere length regulation as well as chromosome end protection and cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). POT1 proteins are defined by the presence of two N-terminal oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding folds (OB-folds), which are responsible for the specific interaction with single-stranded telomeric DNA. OB1 and OB2 contacts with telomeric DNA are primarily mediated by aromatic amino acids, which form stacking interactions with DNA nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Most POT1 proteins studied to date exhibit a minimum binding site (MBS) of 10&#x02013;12 nucleotides, roughly corresponding to two telomeric repeats, though the most preferred repeat permutation in each case appears to be species-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). Interestingly, only a subset of MBS nucleotides is specifically recognized by POT1 proteins, with nucleotides crucial for protein binding scattered throughout the MBS. For many POT1 proteins, the most 3&#x02032;-terminal MBS nucleotide is buried deep inside the OB-folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), suggesting a mechanism for how POT1 can protect the G-overhang from nucleases or telomerase action. In addition, while some POT1 proteins clearly prefer 3&#x02032;-terminal telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), others can associate with telomeric sequences in the middle or on the 5&#x02032;-terminus of oligonucleotide substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), suggesting that <italic>in vivo</italic> they can also bind to the displaced G-rich strand in the context of the T-loop. While specific interaction with telomeric DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> is an essential feature of all POT1 proteins studied to date, human POT1 is delivered to the telomere via protein&#x02013;protein interactions with its binding partner, TPP1/ACD. The interaction with TPP1 is achieved through a structurally undefined C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The POT1-TPP1 heterodimer is required for proper shelterin assembly and to regulate telomerase access and processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#x02013;23</xref>).</p><p>POT1-like proteins have also been identified in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27 B28">24&#x02013;28</xref>). Similar to the situation in most other eukaryotes, only a single <italic>POT1</italic> gene has been detected in most plants surveyed (Shakirov <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation). However, Arabidopsis is an exception as it encodes three highly divergent POT1-like proteins (29; Nelson <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation). All three Arabidopsis POT1 proteins are involved in telomere biology, but their functions differ. AtPOT1a is a positive regulator of telomerase activity that physically interacts with the telomerase RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), while AtPOT1b and AtPOT1c negatively regulate telomerase activity and participate in chromosome end protection (29; Nelson <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation). Strikingly, although AtPOT1 proteins have an architecture similar to yeast and vertebrate POT1 with two N-terminal OB-folds and a C-terminal domain, no <italic>in vitro</italic> telomeric DNA binding has been demonstrated for POT1 proteins from Arabidopsis or two other closely related plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Thus, it is unclear whether telomeric DNA binding is a conserved function of POT1 proteins from the plant kingdom.</p><p>Plant systematics has witnessed a remarkable influx of new data revealing evolutionary relationship of various lineages of the green plants. We took advantage of this detailed phylogenetic map to clone <italic>POT1</italic> genes from eleven representative members of major plant evolutionary branches. Here we report the initial characterization of the DNA-binding activities of three plant POT1 proteins and provide evidence for significant biochemical differences in POT1 proteins across the plant kingdom. We also demonstrate that POT1 proteins from angiosperms have strong affinity for both TTAGGG and TTTAGGG telomeric repeats, providing a possible explanation for how Asparagales adapted to the recent switch in its telomeric DNA repeat sequence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Asparagus telomere length analysis</title><p>DNA from Asparagus (<italic>Asparagus officinalis</italic>) shoots was extracted as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).

Screens were scanned by a Pharos FX Plus Molecular Imager and signal intensity was quantified by Quantity One v.4.6.5 software.

These include POT1 sequences from the green alga <italic>Ostreococcus lucimarinus,</italic> a spikemoss (<italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic>), a pine, three monocotyledonous (barley, maize and Asparagus) and four dicotyledonous (potato, sunflower, poplar and cotton) flowering plants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp785/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). Among the plant species analyzed in our study, three genomes have been sequenced: <italic>O. lucimarinus, S. moellendorffii</italic> and <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> (poplar). Ostreococcus <italic>POT1</italic> is a single-exon gene. <italic>POT1</italic> genes in both Selaginella and poplar, as well as the two previously characterized <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana POT1</italic> genes, harbor 10 exons with conserved intron positions (data not shown). This evolutionarily conserved gene structure supports the conclusion that the plant <italic>POT1</italic> genes are indeed orthologs. Among all plant species analyzed in this study, only maize appears to encode more than one POT1 protein. The two maize <italic>POT1</italic> genes were most likely retained after whole-genome duplication in the ancestor of maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). <italic>ZmPOT1a</italic> and <italic>ZmPOT1b</italic> encode 54.5 and 54.6 kDa proteins, respectively, with 75% overall amino acid similarity to each other. Like the POT1 proteins from the Brassicaceae plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), all eleven of the new POT1 proteins display significant sequence conservation and are predicted to harbor two N-terminal DNA-binding OB-folds with secondary structures similar to the human and fission yeast POT1 proteins (J. Croy and D. Wuttke, personal communication).</p><p>To assess the DNA-binding properties of the new POT1 proteins, we attempted to obtain soluble recombinant proteins using standard expression protocols in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. However, as was previously shown for POT1 proteins from Arabidopsis and related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), we were unable to generate a sufficient amount of soluble protein from any clone for DNA-binding studies. Therefore, we turned to an <italic>in vitro</italic> rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) expression system, previously shown to produce soluble vertebrate and plant POT1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). While such approach will not allow us to define DNA-binding constants, we could perform qualitative binding experiments that in previous studies with the mammalian POT1 proteins have provided important comparative insights into POT1 interaction with telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). RRL-expressed plant POT1 proteins were obtained in a soluble form (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp785/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>) and were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Analysis of DNA-binding capacity of recombinant plant POT1 proteins. EMSA was performed with a cocktail of seven <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 2PLANT oligonucleotides. POT1 proteins from the corresponding plant species are shown above each lane.

Therefore, we used a cocktail of <sup>32</sup>P 5&#x02032;-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to two repeats of the seven possible permutations of the plant telomere repeat (2PLANT cocktail probe) for EMSA. Under standard gel-shift conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), stable telomeric DNA binding was observed for two full-length plant POT1 proteins: OlPOT1 from the green alga <italic>O. lucimarinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, lane 2) and AoPOT1 from <italic>A. officinalis</italic> (garden asparagus) (see below). In addition, a band with intensity slightly above background was observed in the well for the maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) ZmPOT1b protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, lane 7). The intensity of this band increased when a specific oligonucleotide was used instead of the oligonucleotide cocktail (data not shown).</p><p>Telomeric DNA binding by mammalian and yeast POT1 proteins is enhanced with constructs containing only the N-terminal OB-folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), possibly due to modulation of DNA binding by the protein C-terminus. The OB-fold domains of all 11 plant POT1 proteins were expressed in RRL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp785/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link> and data not shown) and tested in EMSA. Deletion of the C-terminus improved the binding of OlPOT1_N (amino acids 1&#x02013;363) to the plant telomeric DNA cocktail, resulting in the formation of a single well-defined protein-DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, lane 12). In addition, a truncated version of maize POT1b, ZmPOT1b_N (amino acids 1&#x02013;326) also formed single weak protein-DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, lane 13). However, the second maize POT1 protein, ZmPOT1a, failed to bind telomeric DNA as either a full-length protein or an OB-fold truncation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, lanes 6 and 14). With the exception of AoPOT1_N (see below), we detected no telomeric DNA binding by any other OB-fold truncated plant POT1 protein (data not shown). We also asked whether plant POT1 proteins could bind an oligonucleotide corresponding to the C-rich strand of telomeric DNA, as is the case for one of the POT1-like proteins from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). No C-strand binding was observed for any of the plant POT1 proteins (data not shown). Nevertheless, our data imply that the ability of POT1 to bind G-rich telomeric DNA has not been completely lost throughout plant kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA-binding properties of OlPOT1_N from green alga</title><p><italic>Ostreococcus lucimarinus</italic> is a species of Prasinophytes, a clade of green algae that belongs to the oldest diverging (over 1 bya) branch of the photosynthetic eukaryotic lineage, and is a sister clade to all land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Consequently, analysis of the DNA-binding characteristics of OlPOT1_N may provide insight into the mechanisms of telomeric DNA recognition by the ancestral plant POT1 protein and how these properties have evolved in land plants.</p><p>To determine which of the seven permutations of the plant telomeric repeat OlPOT1_N binds best, we performed competition experiments with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 2PLANT cocktail probe and a 5-fold excess of individual cold 2PLANT oligonucleotides. A representative gel and corresponding quantification are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp785/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3A</ext-link>. The intensity of the shifted band (fraction bound) in the absence of competitors was measured and set as 1.0, and the remaining signal intensity after the addition of competitors was expressed as a fraction of 1. We found that all individual 2PLANT oligonucleotides competed efficiently for binding (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp785/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3A</ext-link>).</p><p>Next we determined the minimum DNA sequence required for OlPOT1_N binding. EMSA was performed using TAGGGTTTAGGGTT and a series of single nucleotide truncations from either the 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-end of this substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Deletion of the first two nucleotides from the 5&#x02032;-end (oligonucleotide 12) did not decrease binding. However, removal of three nucleotides decreased binding by over 30% (oligonucleotide 11&#x02032;) and deletion of four abolished nearly all binding (oligonucleotide 10&#x02033;). In both cases, a smear trailing down to free probe was observed, suggesting partial dissociation of the complex during electrophoresis. Only one nucleotide could be removed from the 3&#x02032;-end without detectable loss of DNA binding (oligonucleotide 11). Deletion of two nucleotides (oligonucleotide 10) decreased binding to only 15% of the full-length oligonucleotide. Therefore, the minimum tight-binding sequence (core MBS) for OlPOT1_N appears to be GGTTTAGGGT (oligonucleotide 10&#x02032;). Addition of one G residue at the oligonucleotide 5&#x02032;-end improved binding almost 2-fold (oligonucleotide 11). Thus, as little as 10 nucleotides are necessary for OlPOT1_N binding and may comprise its MBS, while an 11-nt GGGTTTAGGGT oligonucleotide represents the best tight-binding substrate. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Characterization of DNA-binding activity of recombinant POT1_N protein from <italic>Ostreococcus lucimarinus</italic>.

Although the major POT1 functions appear to be conserved in most branches of eukaryotic life, previous data in plants indicated that Arabidopsis POT1 proteins evolved unusual functions in regulating telomerase, a property not dependent on physical contact with telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). This study addresses this phenomenon further and provides a reconciling view that in some plant species POT1 may indeed have functions similar to those described for non-plant POT1 proteins.</p><sec><title>DNA-binding properties of plant POT1 proteins</title><p>A well-established phylogenetic hierarchy for the major groups within the green plant lineage allows us an opportunity to examine changes in telomere-related genes in an evolutionary context. Here we compare the DNA-binding properties of three plant POT1 proteins: OlPOT1_N, from the earliest branching lineage analyzed in our study, and AoPOT1 and ZmPOT1b_N from angiosperms. Our biochemical analysis reveals fundamental differences in the nucleic acid binding activity of POT1 proteins across the plant kingdom (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp785/DC1">Supplemental Table S1</ext-link>). Several of the DNA-binding properties of OlPOT1 are reminiscent of non-plant POT1 proteins and contrast sharply with AoPOT1 and ZmPOT1b. Specifically, the minimum tight-binding sequence of OlPOT1_N consists of 10 nucleotides, a number similar to MBS of POT1 proteins from yeast and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In contrast, POT1 proteins from angiosperms require fewer nucleotides for efficient binding, with Asparagus POT1 (8&#x02013;9 nucleotides) being on the lower end of the spectrum and ZmPOT1b_N displaying a short MBS of only 7 nucleotides. Interestingly, two polypeptides harboring a single OB-fold, <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pot1pN and <italic>C. elegans</italic> CeOB2, recognize a shorter, 6-nucleotide MBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Thus, ZmPOT1b_N has the smallest MBS among all currently characterized POT1 proteins bearing at least two OB-folds.</p><p>Second, plant POT1 proteins show significant variation in the way they interact with cognate DNA. For other POT1 proteins, only a subset of MBS nucleotides is specifically recognized and makes important contributions to binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). A similar situation is observed for ZmPOT1b_N, where four out of seven nucleotides in the MBS are required for binding. Asparagus POT1 follows the same trend, with six of the nine MBS nucleotides needed for binding, although all these crucial AoPOT1 MBS nucleotides are localized at the 3&#x02032;-end of the oligonucleotide. In contrast, all 10 MBS nucleotides are required for OlPOT1 binding, a phenomenon not previously observed for other POT1 proteins. These data suggest that the mechanism responsible for specific recognition of single-stranded telomeric DNA may significantly differ between POT1 proteins from green algae and land plants. Overall, we conclude that the telomeric DNA-binding properties of plant POT1 proteins are evolving rapidly.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence for co-evolution of telomeric DNA and POT1 proteins in plants</title><p>The biochemical similarities and differences between ZmPOT1b_N and AoPOT1 may provide clues to the apparent co-evolution of Asparagus POT1 and the telomere repeat sequence in this species. ZmPOT1b_N requires only 7 nt (one full TTTAGGG repeat) for efficient binding, while AoPOT1 requires a very similar, but longer nine-nucleotide substrate GGGTTAGGG. Since the three 5&#x02032;-terminal Gs do not appear to make significant contributions to AoPOT1 binding, our data suggest that these additional nucleotides in Asparagus POT1 MBS may stabilize this protein&#x02019;s interaction with shorter human-type telomere repeats. Notably, the remaining six nucleotides in AoPOT1 MBS, TTAGGG, are identical to the 3&#x02032;-end nucleotides present in ZmPOT1b_N MBS. Complementary substitutions in most of these nucleotides completely abolish protein binding, suggesting that TTAGGG sequence is crucial for specific interaction with POT1 proteins. These data may also explain the requirement of AoPOT1 and, to a lesser extent, ZmPOT1b_N for the presence of telomeric repeats on the 3&#x02032;-end of DNA oligonucleotides. Such 3&#x02032;-end positioning is likely necessary to improve or stabilize Asparagus POT1 interaction with the G-overhang, which, in turn, may result in better regulation of G-overhang length or interaction with telomerase.</p><p>What is the molecular basis for the stable association of POT1 proteins from angiosperms with hexanucleotide telomere repeats? Since both ZmPOT1b_N and AoPOT1 are capable of specifically binding to TTAGGG repeats, this biochemical feature must have evolved in the common ancestor of maize and Asparagus. We note that AoPOT1 and ZmPOT1b have a similar tolerance to nucleotide substitutions in certain MBS positions. Specifically, two different nucleotides, T (the extra T nucleotide present only in the plant <underline>T</underline>TTAGGG repeat, but not in the hexanucleotide TTAGGG sequence) and G (which replaces this T in the context of AoPOT1 MBS GG<underline>G</underline>TTAGGG) are equally tolerated by ZmPOT1b and AoPOT1 in the seventh MBS position (counting from the 3&#x02032;-end of each oligonucleotide). This property may have originally evolved as a response to the known ability of many plant telomerases to naturally generate mutant telomere repeats containing one less or one more T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). These so-called T-slippage events represent the most commonly detected type of telomerase error in plants <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The ability to tolerate T-slippage could have potentially allowed the ancestral POT1 protein to remain bound to the mutant human-type TTAGGG sequences. Another possibility is that decreased affinity to the cognate telomere repeats may help to dislodge POT1 from the G-overhang by other DNA-binding proteins, such as RPA or the CST complex during telomere replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>Recognition of non-cognate telomere repeats is not unique to higher plant POT1 proteins. <italic>Oxytricha nova</italic> telomere end-binding protein (OnTEBP) stably associates with non-cognate telomeric sequences by facilitating significant conformational changes in DNA oligonucleotides via a phenomenon termed nucleotide shuffling, during which DNA sequence register shifts and entire nucleotides are excluded from the protein-DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Chicken and human POT1 proteins are also capable of interacting with non-cognate DNA oligonucleotides in competition assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Similarly, in direct EMSA assays, <italic>S. pombe</italic> POT1 specifically binds DNA sequences resembling telomere repeats present in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophyla</italic>, <italic>O. nova</italic> and even <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that relaxed DNA sequence specificity may be a common characteristic of POT1 proteins. This property could be especially beneficial in organisms such as Paramecium, where telomerase synthesizes an unusually high number of mutant telomere repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Likewise, in Asparagus plant lineage relaxed POT1 telomeric DNA sequence specificity would be beneficial in an evolutionary context and may have contributed to the survival of this entire plant order.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary changes in plant POT1 functions</title><p>Interestingly, we failed to detect <italic>in vitro</italic> telomeric DNA binding for eight POT1 proteins from the evolutionarily diverse group of plant organisms analyzed in this study and for six previously characterized POT1 proteins from the Brassicaceae family of plants, which includes Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). We can not rule out the possibility that some RRL-expressed plant POT1 proteins lack proper post-translational modifications or other requisites for efficient binding to telomeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, we note that RRL-expressed POT1 proteins from yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and three different plants (this study) can efficiently bind telomeric DNA under the same conditions. Moreover, several lines of evidence suggest that telomeric DNA binding may not be the major <italic>in vivo</italic> function of POT1 proteins in Arabidopsis and, perhaps, in other plants. In striking contrast to yeast and mammalian POT1 proteins, Arabidopsis POT1a acts as a positive regulator of telomerase activity and is only enriched at the telomeres in S-phase, when telomerase is thought to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Moreover, Arabidopsis POT1b appears to be a negative regulator of telomerase activity (E. Shakirov, A. Nelson and D. Shippen, in preparation). Recent data indicate that AtPOT1a and AtPOT1b associate directly with Arabidopsis telomerase RNA in regions outside the telomere template domain (C. Cifuentes-Rojas <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation). While RNA binding is associated with other OB-fold containing proteins, for example, translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), POT1 proteins have not been previously reported to bind RNA. Thus, the interaction of Arabidopsis POT1a and POT1b with telomerase RNA appears to represent a major evolutionary shift in plant POT1 functions from DNA to RNA binding.</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and maize are currently the only plants known to harbor more than one <italic>POT1</italic> orthologue. In both cases, <italic>POT1</italic> genes were likely duplicated around 30 mya, when the lineages leading to Arabidopsis and maize experienced independent whole-genome duplication events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Despite a similar evolutionary timeframe, the fate of these duplicated <italic>POT1</italic> genes appears to be distinct. First, like the two mouse POT1 proteins, which evolved partially non-overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), the maize POT1 paralogs share &#x0223c;75% amino acid similarity. In contrast, Arabidopsis POT1a and POT1b display much lower sequence conservation, retaining only &#x0223c;50% amino acid similarity overall. Second, while both Arabidopsis POT1 proteins bind telomerase RNA instead of telomeric DNA, only one of the maize POT1 proteins, ZmPOT1a, lost the ability to bind telomeric DNA, raising the interesting possibility that ZmPOT1a evolved to bind the maize telomerase RNA. Although further analysis of the telomere complex in maize will be required to test this model, the comparative biochemical analysis of plant POT1 proteins described here underscores the remarkably rapid evolution of the OB-fold nucleic acid binding interface.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>EU880295, EU880297, EU880298, EU880301, EU880303&#x02013;EU880306, EU883536, FJ516399.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp785/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> [<award-id>GM065383</award-id> to D.E.S.].
