Immature DCs (iDCs) are situated in the periphery where they capture pathogen. Subsequently, they migrate as mature DCs (mDCs) to draining lymph nodes to activate T cells. CCR7 and CCL21 contribute to the migratory capacity of the DC, but it is not completely understood what molecular requirements are involved. Here we demonstrate that monocyte-derived DCs dramatically change ST8Sia IV expression during maturation, leading to the generation of polysialic acid (polySia). PolySia expression is highly upregulated after 2 days Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) triggering. Surprisingly, only immunogenic and not tolerogenic mDCs upregulated polySia expression. Furthermore, we show that polySia expression on DCs is required for CCL21-directed migration, whereby polySia directly captures CCL21. Corresponding to polySia, the expression level of CCR7 is maximal two days after TLR4 triggering. In contrast, although TLR agonists other than LPS induce upregulation of CCR7, they achieve only a moderate polySia expression. In situ we could detect polySia-expressing APCs in the T cell zone of the lymph node and in the deep dermis. Together our results indicate that prolonged TLR4 engagement is required for the generation of polySia-expressing DCs that facilitate CCL21 capture and subsequent CCL21-directed migration.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transition of immature DCs (iDCs) to mature DCs (mDCs) is well known to endow dendritic cells (DCs) with the capacity to couple innate to adaptive immune responses. Resting iDCs reside in the periphery, where they sense for pathogen by TLRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Banchereau1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon pathogen recognition, a signaling cascade initiates the DC maturation process, characterized by the upregulation of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules. In order to initiate the adaptive immune response, DCs travel through the lymphatics to the draining lymph node. In the lymph node, they arrive as fully matured DCs, able to promote the activation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells through antigen presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Randolph1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the phenotypic and functional changes associated with maturation are of critical importance for a proper immune response.</p><p>Little is known about posttranslational protein modifications that could contribute to the functional switch of iDCs to mDCs. Several processes, such as T cell activation and differentiation &#x0005b;3;4&#x0005d; as well as DC maturation &#x0005b;5;6&#x0005d; have been reported to be accompanied by programmed remodeling of their cell surface glycosylation. Glycosylation is a highly regulated process that takes place in the Golgi apparatus by the step-wise addition of carbohydrates by glycosyltransferases to maturing glycoproteins and glycolipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Lowe1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Sialyltransferases comprise a large family of glycosyltransferases that are responsible for the capping of glycans with terminal sialic acids. DC maturation results in dramatic changes in the gene expression profile of sialyltransferases, and amongst them, ST8Sia IV appears to show the largest differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Bax1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. ST8Sia IV is an &#x003b1;-N-acetylneuraminate &#x003b1;2,8-sialyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to a sialylated glycan to generate polysialic acid (polySia) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Eckhardt1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>PolySia is a linear homopolymer of &#x003b1;2,8-linked sialic acids, ranging up to 300 residues &#x0005b;9;10&#x0005d;. Although polySia expression was originally thought to be exclusive expressed on NCAM on neuronal cells, it has recently been found on several other glycoproteins, such as the &#x003b1;-subunit of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Zuber1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, CD36 in human milk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Yabe1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and neuropilin-2 on DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Curreli1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although the molecular mechanism by which PSGL-1 captures CCL21 and contributes to chemotaxis is still unclear, it was suggested that the negative charge contributed by the sulfate groups on PSGL-1 may play a role, in analogy with the capacity of highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans to capture CCL21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Hirose1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these findings we hypothesized that the upregulated expression of the highly negatively charged polySia induced during maturation could play a role in chemokine capture in order to facilitate DC migration to the lymph node.</p><p>In this study we have investigated the kinetics of polySia expression during DC maturation and on several DC subsets. We demonstrate that polySia on O-linked glycans on monocyte-derived DCs is required for CCL21-directed migration through binding of CCL21 to sialic acids on the DC surface.

We recently observed that maturation also results in a dramatic reprogramming of the glycosylation machinery, especially with regard to sialylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Bax1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. DC maturation after triggering of TLR4 with LPS resulted in the upregulation of &#x003b1;2,3- and &#x003b1;2,8-linked sialyltransferase transcripts, whereas ST6Gal I transcripts, encoding for an &#x003b1;2,6-sialyltransferase, were down regulated, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, ST8Sia IV transcripts levels were much higher than the remaining sialyltransferase transcripts. ST8Sia IV is required for the biosynthesis of the unusual glycan structure polySia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Eckhardt1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Ong1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to monocytes, macrophages and iDC, the high expression levels of ST8Sia IV transcripts appeared to be exclusive for mDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In order to determine the kinetics of ST8Sia IV upregulation during LPS-induced DC maturation, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of ST8Sia IV mRNA was performed at different time points after LPS treatment. Already 1 day after LPS treatment ST8Sia IV transcripts were upregulated, which are further enhanced on day 2, whereas the strongest upregulation was observed 3 days after LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast to ST8Sia IV mRNA expression, no polySia expression was found on the cell membrane of iDC and mDC matured for 1 day with LPS.

To determine whether polySia on mDCs is attached to O- or N-linked glycans, we used the glycosylation inhibitors kifunensine and benzyl-&#x003b1;-GalNAc. The Golgi mannosidase-inhibitor kifunensine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-Elbein1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> inhibits the maturation of N-glycans rendering structures consisting of high-mannose.

Efficiency of interference with glycosylation was confirmed using the high-mannose-specific lectin Con A and the GalNAc-specific lectin HPA. Highly increased polySia expression levels were observed on kifunensine (N-linked glycosylation) treated mDCs, while benzyl-&#x003b1;-GalNAc (O-linked glycosylation) efficiently blocked the maturation-induced polySia upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The apparently contradictory increase in polySia expression induced by kifunensine could be explained by a better availability of substrates for O-linked glycan synthesis upon N-glycan biosynthesis blockade. Together, these data indicate that polySia on mDC is O-linked to glycoproteins. Treatment of mDCs with neuraminidase (NA), removing &#x003b1;2,3-, &#x003b1; 2,6-, and &#x003b1;2,8-linked sialic acid, or Endo-neuraminidase (Endo-N) specific for polySia, resulted in 50&#x00025; lower polySia expression, demonstrating the specificity of the moAb 735 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g001">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>CCL21 binding to sialic acids is required for CCL21-directed migration of mDCs</title><p>It has been reported that some cytokines have carbohydrate-binding properties.

As a control, polyacrylamide probes carrying the neutral monosaccharide galactose were used.

To investigate this, the spontaneous and the CCL21 directed migratory response of DCs with or without polySia expression was measured in a transwell chemotaxis assay. The migration of mDCs triggered for 1 day with LPS, (expressing low polySia levels) were compared to the migration of mDCs treated for 2 days with LPS (expressing high polySia levels). The migratory response of mDCs treated for 2 days with LPS was clearly higher than that of the mDCs with low polySia content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). To demonstrate polySia requirement for CCL21-induced DC migration, mDCs triggered for 2 days with LPS were treated with NA or Endo-N to remove sialic acids. The reduction in CCL21-induced migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) paralleled the reduction in polySia expresssion achieved by these treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), demonstrating the involvement of these structures in the capture of CCL21 to facilitate migration. To exclude that NA or Endo-N treatment interferes with CCR7 function, we added soluble galactose or polySia to CCL21-supplemented medium. The migration of mDC triggered for 2 days with LPS to CCL21-supplemented medium was inhibited with soluble polySia compared to the addition of soluble galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In conclusion, we demonstrate that CCL21 directly binds to sialic acids, probably facilitated by the negative charge of sialic acids. PolySia expression on mDCs could thus create a negatively charged capture mechanism to efficiently promote CCL21-directed migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>PolySia is primarily upregulated on DCs matured for 2 days with TLR4 ligands and not present on tolerogenic DCs</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, different functional DC phenotypes can be distinguished.

These polySia-expressing cells in the T cell zone of the lymph node were APCs, expressing HLA-DR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In skin, polySia-expressing APCs were located only in the dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006987-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Potentially, the polySia-expressing APCs in the deep dermis may traffic during inflammation in a CCL21-directed manner to the lymph node, where also polySia-expressing HLA-DR<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells could be found, followed by presentation of their antigen to T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006987-MartInFontecha1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0006987-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006987.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>PolySia<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> antigen presenting cells are present in human tissue.</title><p>(A) Tissue biopsies of human lymph node were stained with moAb 735 (red).

In conclusion, we demonstrate that the expression of polySia on the cell surface of fully mature DCs following TLR4 triggering for 2 days captures CCL21 to optimally direct DC migration towards the lymph nodes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the VU university medical center (VUmc) Amsterdam and the Commissie Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (CWO) by written consent.
