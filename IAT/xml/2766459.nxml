It can also be produced by some tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. TNF occurs as a 26-kDa transmembrane precursor form and as a 17-kDa soluble mature form, which appears mainly as a homotrimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Mature TNF displays a high degree of homology in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] and therefore its biological activity has limited species specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p>TNF was firstly reported as a macrophage-derived serum factor that caused hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Today, TNF is well-known as having a wide range of biological activities both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; for example, it affects the proliferation of normal cells, takes part in homeostasis regulation, inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and antiviral responses, and plays an important role in septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. TNF also exerts some cytotoxic and cytostatic effect on numerous tumor cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and exhibits anti-tumor activity in some tumor models <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Systemic treatment with TNF, however, is associated with severe side-effects, and this limits the clinical use of the cytokine in the therapy of melanomas mainly to the isolated limb perfusion regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The exact mechanism mediating the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumor effect of TNF has not been yet fully clarified. There are at least three possible ways in which TNF can exert anti-tumor activity: by direct cytostatic or cytotoxic action on tumor cells, by its effect as a regulatory mediator of the host-mediated immunological response in neoplasia, and by augmenting hemorrhagic necrosis within a tumor by affecting its vasculature. Furthermore, cell sensitivity to the growth-inhibiting effect of TNF is influenced by other cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p>In order to analyze the mechanism of TNF action in melanoma, we decided to analyze the effect of TNF on Bomirski (Ab) amelanotic melanoma in the hamster. It is a transplantable, highly stable tumor with a behavior resembling the clinical situation. Ab melanoma is a relatively immunogenic, quickly growing tumor with a mean survival time of tumor-bearing animals of about 25 days. The primary tumor metastasizes mostly to the kidneys and lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Ab melanoma is also sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of natural killer (NK) cells at the metastasis formation stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the tumor&#x02019;s presence alone can increase the cytotoxic activity of macrophages and NO release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, tumor growth can also induce immunosuppression in tumor-bearing animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, in the Ab melanoma model one may possibly analyze all the aspects of TNF's effect on tumor growth and metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>Recombinant rat TNF with a specific activity of 1.1&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> U/mg of protein was prepared in our laboratory.

However, apart from amelanoma cells in those cultures, there were also mononuclear cells infiltrating the tumor, such as lymphocytes and macrophages.

As there was no decrease in the viability of tumor cells in the presence of macrophages alone as measured by the MTT assay (data not shown), this suggests that macrophages alone have a cytostatic effect on Ab melanoma cells, probably through secreted TNF, and thus diminish the cytotoxic effects of TNF added to the cell culture.

The most known is mouse B16 melanoma, a melanin-producing tumor which is highly sensitive to TNF and its hypopigmenting activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This paper analyzes the mechanism of TNF action in Bomirski (Ab) amelanotic melanoma and its usefulness in studies of TNF as an anti-tumor agent. Ab melanoma is a stable and widely studied tumor in our laboratory. Some of its useful characteristics are: a high rate of tumor growth, a high frequency and stability of metastasis spread, and also some level of immunogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>By using recombinant rat TNF in a hamster model we took advantage of the limited species specificity of TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This was confirmed in our laboratory by demonstrating a cytotoxic effect of rat TNF on the human U937 and HeLa cell lines, mouse A9 cell line, and later on hamster Ab melanoma cells ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], data not shown). TNF was applied intratumorally to subcutaneously implanted Ab melanoma in 3&#x02013;10 doses from the moment the tumor had become palpable. We chose this mode of application because of its lower toxicity at high doses of TNF. Intratumoral application of TNF is used in clinical applications, for example in the local treatment of liver metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], with a significant anti-tumor effect and mild and transient toxic effects. Additionally, in some experimental models, TNF applied intratumorally or intravenously affected tumor growth similarly, even with a stronger dependence of its anti-tumor effect of intravenous application on the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The chosen mode of TNF injection also let us better evaluate the mechanism of TNF effect on the growth and metastasis of Ab melanoma at the early stage of its growth, before the development of strong tumor vasculature (primary tumor up to 2&#x02013;3 mm in diameter).</p><p>Having obtained evidence that TNF has a cytotoxic effect not only on the TNF-sensitive A9 cell line, but also on Ab melanoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, we found that the intratumoral application of an immune modulator such as TNF to hamsters bearing Ab melanoma resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth. However, there was only one case of complete regression caused by treatment with very high doses of TNF, and the survival time of the Ab melanoma-bearing hamsters did not differ from that of the control animals. TNF mostly induced only a partial regression of tumors. The therapeutic effect of TNF was, therefore, weaker than in similar mouse B16 melanoma, where a partial regression of tumor was achieved by a single TNF injection. The anti-tumor effect of TNF was also much weaker than in the case of mouse MethA sarcoma, where a single intratumoral injection of TNF caused a complete regression of tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and in the case of mouse sarcoma 180, where a few consecutive injections also led to complete cure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In the former case, tumor cells were mostly insensitive to TNF and there was a strong effect of TNF on tumor vasculature, and in the latter case TNF was toxic to aneuploid tumor cells without a visible effect on tumor vessels. What was characteristic for both tumors was their visible infiltration with immunomodulatory cells. In yet another case of mouse sarcoma BP, where there was no such infiltration and TNF exerted an influence mostly on tumor vasculature, there was no distinct size reduction of the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In experiments on Ab melanoma, with inhibition of tumor growth by TNF, there were also distinctive changes in the pattern of the tumor metastasis. Such changes were associated by other authors with changes induced by TNF in mouse B16 melanoma in the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 on endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The fact that in the Ab melanoma model TNF treatment significantly decreased the incidence of kidney metastases in a dose-dependent way but increased the frequency of metastasis to the peritoneal cavity and the lungs shows that this model can be useful in the analysis of the mechanism of action by which TNF modulates tumor metastasis.</p><p>Since some differences were manifested in the mechanism of anti-tumor activity of TNF against different melanomas, some analysis of the mode of TNF action against Bomirski melanoma was performed. After a 3-day treatment of the tumor with TNF there were visible changes in tumor tissues similar to those in the model of MethA sarcoma, with areas of fibrosis and accumulations of tumor cells with nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis, but there was no hyperemia of the vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Unlike in the model of MethA sarcoma, TNF had a direct toxic effect on the tumor cells. It is documented that TNF has a direct toxic effect on several neoplastic cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. This effect can be cytostatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] or cytotoxic through necrosis or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. For the Ab melanoma tumor cells, the effect of TNF was cytotoxic, caused by an increase in apoptotic death, as documented by DNA analysis and flow cytometry. However, the decrease in viability of the tumor cells during cytotoxic tests was not higher than 50% even with the high doses of TNF. This may suggest that a cytostatic effect of TNF is not to be excluded. Such a complex activity of TNF can be seen, for example, in the case of MCF-7 human breast tumor, where TNF acts first as a cytostatic agent on cultured tumor cells and then, after a long period of cytostasis, as a strong cytotoxic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. However, for Ab tumor cells such a cytotoxic effect could be seen much earlier, after only 10 h of incubation with TNF. This could, therefore, suggest heterogeneity of the Ab tumor cell population in view of its sensitivity to TNF, similar to cases of human renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or human colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This can be supported by our experiments with the Ab melanoma cell lines derived from primary cell cultures that showed a low sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of TNF (data not shown).</p><p>Besides the direct effect on tumor cells, TNF also influenced the immune system of Ab melanoma hosts. Its response to TNF was clearly indicated by an increased concentration of cytokines with IL-6 activity in blood serum, as in the cases of mouse B16 melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As indicated in some earlier publications, at this early stage of tumor growth, unlike later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], there was no stimulating effect of tumor presence alone on the cytokine level. In this study we found that after 19&#x02013;20 days of tumor growth there was an increase in IL-6 activity (50% of animals) and in the level of TNF (90%) in the sera of untreated tumor-bearing hamsters, and this correlated with the progression of cachexia. A low concentration of TNF in blood serum at the early stage of tumor development after TNF treatment, therefore, indicated a low toxicity of such an application of TNF. With no distinct toxic effect of TNF, there was also no detectable increase in the natural cytotoxic activity of the immunomodulatory cells participating in tumor control, such as NK cells. This contradicts the fact that TNF stimulates <italic>in vitro</italic> the cytotoxicity of NK cells towards many tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and augments <italic>in vivo</italic> the activity of peritoneal NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. However, TNF can also indirectly suppress the activity of NK cells by, among others, stimulation of macrophages to produce prostaglandins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and by stimulating the expression of MHC I on tumor cells, which results in a decrease in sensitivity to the anti-tumor activity of NK lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In the case of mouse sarcoma 180 there was a similar lack of activation of NK lymphocytes by intratumorally applied TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and in the case of mouse fibrosarcoma CFS1, TNF treatment even caused a decrease in the activity of spleen NK lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Along with NK cells, other immunomodulatory cells, such as macrophages, also participate in tumor control. Macrophages exert their cytotoxic activity on tumor cells mostly by TNF secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and NO<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sub>2</sub> production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In Ab melanoma there was no detectable increase in the natural cytotoxic activity of macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic> by intratumorally injected TNF at this early stage of tumor growth. But <italic>in vitro</italic>, in the primary tumor cell culture enriched with peritoneal macrophages, there was some, probably cytostatic, effect of macrophages alone on tumor cells that was not modulated by adding TNF into the medium. This in effect corroborates the data from the literature which showed that macrophages exerted a cytostatic effect on tumor cells by TNF-induced arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle, which can make them insensitive to TNF treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The absence of some increase in the activity of peritoneal macrophages and spleen NK lymphocytes in the Ab melanoma model does not exclude the possibility of some local direct or indirect effect of TNF injection on the activity of immunomodulatory cells in tumor tissues. For example, TNF can increase the expressions of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on tumor cells, thus increasing their vulnerability to lysis by macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. TNF can also upregulate ICAM-1 shedding from melanoma cells and thus inhibit, by soluble ICAM-1, adherence of NK lymphocytes to tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In the case of Ab melanoma it is also possible that TNF treatment affected T lymphocytes since there was a partial regression of tumor and even one complete regression as an outcome of TNF application. As indicated in the literature, tumor regression is entirely dependent on T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A suggested mechanism of this process is that TNF activates Th lymphocytes which in turn activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to destroy tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, some recent experiments on knockout mice have indicated TNF together with perforin and interferon &#x003b3; as a critical triad of effector molecules in anti-tumor activity of CTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p>TNF has been also demonstrated to exert some effect on tumor vessels. TNF is known to increase the permeability of tumor vessels; this effect is stronger when TNF is applied intratumorally and not intravenously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. TNF exerts its effect on tumor vessels by inducing apoptosis of endothelial cells in angiogenic tumor blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], by stimulating neutrophils to damage the endothelium by proteolytic enzymes and toxic oxygen intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], and also by inducting procoagulant activity of the endothelium, which results in tumor ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The effect of TNF on tumor blood vessels in Ab melanoma was not visible at the early stage of TNF application when only TNF was injected, but could be seen in combined therapy with TNP-470. TNP-470 is a hemisynthetic fumagillin analogue which not only inhibits angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], also in Ab melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], but has a cytostatic and cytotoxic effect on endothelial cells as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. TNF given in combination with TNP-470 caused an increase in extravasation of erythrocytes compared with the effect of fumagillin analogue used alone, and this suggests some effect of TNF on tumor blood vessels. This idea is also supported by the observation in this study that TNF treatment leads to a statistically significant acceleration of advanced hemorrhagic necrosis of Ab melanoma primary tumor.</p><p>At an early stage of tumor growth and with significant differences in tumor size development between TNF-treated and control animals, TNF application by intratumoral injections did not visibly affect the activity of immunomodulatory cells and the permeability of the tumor blood vessels. Therefore, developmental differences were mainly the result of the direct anti-tumor activity of TNF, as indicated <italic>in vivo</italic> by an increase in the amount of tumor cells with nuclear pyknosis and karry-orrhexis and its cytotoxic activity <italic>in vitro</italic> on the primary culture of tumor cells. However, the effects of TNF application visible at the later stage of tumor growth, as for example accelerated hemorrhagic necrosis, may suggest its influence on tumor vasculature and also, possibly, its immunomodulatory effect. Therefore, hamster Ab melanoma could be used as a model to analyze different aspects of the anti-tumor action of such a multifunctional cytokine as TNF alone and in a combined therapy. Additionally, this model can be used in studies on the influence of TNF on metastasis of tumor cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This research was supported by grants Nos. 6 P207 121 06 and 3 P04B 012 12 from the State Committee for Scientific Research, Poland.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abe</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sekiya</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamasita</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sendo</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Vascular hyperpermeability induced by tumor necrosis factor and its augmentation by IL-1 and IFN-&#x003b1; is inhibited by selective depletion of neutrophils with a monoclonal antibody</article-title><source>J.
