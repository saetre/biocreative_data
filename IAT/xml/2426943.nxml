This paper dissects the mechanisms of p190RhoGAP regulation and distinguishes the contributions of &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin and syndecan-4. Matrix-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP is stimulated solely by engagement of &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin and is independent of syndecan-4. Parallel engagement of syndecan-4 causes redistribution of the tyrosine-phosphorylated pool of p190RhoGAP between membrane and cytosolic fractions by a mechanism that requires direct activation of protein kinase C &#x003b1; by syndecan-4. Activation of both pathways is necessary for the efficient regulation of RhoA and, as a consequence, focal adhesion formation. Accordingly, we identify p190RhoGAP as the convergence point for adhesive signals mediated by &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin and syndecan-4.

Engagement of adhesion receptors by the ECM provides a means of localizing this suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raftopoulou and Hall, 2004</xref>). The two major families of ECM receptor use different modes of ligand binding: integrins bind directly to peptide sites within the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaout et al., 2005</xref>), whereas syndecans interact with heparin-binding motifs of ECM molecules through covalently linked glycosaminoglycan chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernfield et al., 1999</xref>). The two families of adhesion receptors transduce synergistic signals to promote adhesion contact formation, and there are many examples of biological processes that are regulated by cooperative signaling by different integrin&#x02013;syndecan pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morgan et al., 2007</xref>). The prototypic fibronectin receptors, &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin and syndecan-4, colocalize in focal complexes at the leading edge of cells spreading on fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woods et al., 2000</xref>), and several groups have demonstrated that simultaneous engagement of both receptors is necessary for the formation of vinculin-containing focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woods et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass et al., 2007a</xref>). Other groups have argued that integrin engagement is sufficient for focal adhesion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), and the disagreement is partly due to the difficulty of eliminating syndecan ligands, which include growth factors and chemokines as well as ECM, from an experimental system. However, a greater contribution to this controversy arises from the robustness of the eukaryotic cell, which appears capable of surviving and adhering even under suboptimal conditions. It is becoming clear that rather than forming an integral part of the adhesive machinery, syndecans fine-tune signals downstream of receptors such as integrins and enable cells to respond rapidly and precisely to extracellular stimuli. The refined role of syndecan-4 is most apparent in vivo, as disruption of the syndecan-4 gene is not lethal but does compromise wound healing. Expression of both &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin and syndecan-4 is up-regulated in fibroblasts and keratinocytes surrounding dermal wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavani et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallo et al., 1996</xref>), whereas disruption of syndecan-4 expression results in a delay in wound closure that is caused by a reduction in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Echtermeyer et al., 2001</xref>). The specific involvement of syndecans in biological functions that are characteristic of higher vertebrates, such as wound healing, is supported by phylogenetic studies describing the evolution of duplicate syndecans that are highly conserved in vertebrates but absent from invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chakravarti and Adams, 2006</xref>).</p><p>&#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin and syndecan-4 activate Rac1 and inhibit RhoA to regulate membrane protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>). Unlike Rac1, where &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin and syndecan-4 regulate localization and GTP-loading, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Del Pozo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>), the GTP loading of RhoA is directly influenced by both receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ren et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dovas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>) and could represent redundancy in activation of the RhoA signaling pathway. In the absence of evidence for direct receptor crosstalk, identification of the convergence point of integrin and syndecan signals has become a priority.</p><p>The ability of RhoA to associate with downstream effectors is held in balance by the opposing activities of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that stabilize the nucleotide-free form of RhoA and therefore encourage GTP loading, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that catalyze the low-level intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raftopoulou and Hall, 2004</xref>). ECM-dependent suppression of RhoA activity has been largely attributed to the action of p190RhoGAP-A (p190-A). Thus, a dominant-negative mutant of p190-A prevents the reduction in RhoA activity during adhesion to fibronectin and culminates in a delay in cell spreading and compromised migration toward fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arthur and Burridge, 2001</xref>). In response to fibronectin binding, p190-A is tyrosine phosphorylated by a cascade involving the kinases Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2000</xref>) and Arg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley et al., 2006</xref>). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p190-A enables association with the SH2 domains of p120RasGAP that is necessary for the suppression of RhoA during cell spreading on fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley et al., 2006</xref>). However, the connection from adhesion receptor to RhoA remains incomplete, as only a subset of integrins, which excludes &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins, activate Src by direct association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Salgado et al., 2005</xref>), and there is no evidence of a direct association between integrin and Arg. The only direct link from adhesion receptor to cytoplasmic kinase involves the activation of PKC&#x003b1; by direct association with the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koo et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the activation of PKC&#x003b1; by stimulation with phorbol ester causes the redistribution of p190-A to membrane ruffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brouns et al., 2000</xref>) and may form a second regulatory mechanism. The challenge now is to establish the direct connection between an ECM receptor and p190-A that will explain adhesion-dependent RhoA regulation.</p><p>In the present study, we define a novel connection from syndecan-4 to p190-A, via PKC&#x003b1;, that results in redistribution of the GAP and, ultimately, inhibition of RhoA. Not only does this discovery fill in the missing link between adhesion receptor and RhoA regulation, it also distinguishes the contributions of syndecan-4 and &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin, which regulate p190-A through PKC&#x003b1; and tyrosine phosphorylation, respectively. These experiments identify p190-A as the convergence point for signals from coupled ECM receptors that is responsible for precisely localized RhoA regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Syndecan-4 regulates membrane association of p190-A</title><p>Fibroblasts plated onto a recombinant 50-kD fragment of fibronectin (50K), which encompasses the binding sites for &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danen et al., 1995</xref>) but lacks a syndecan-4&#x02013;binding motif, spread but fail to form vinculin-containing focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woods et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass et al., 2007a</xref>) because of a failure to regulate Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>), RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dovas et al., 2006</xref>), and FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilcox-Adelman et al., 2002</xref>). The prespread fibroblasts respond rapidly to stimulation with a soluble syndecan-binding fragment of fibronectin, which comprises type III repeats 12&#x02013;15 (H/0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharma et al., 1999</xref>), by regulating GTPases and forming focal complexes within 10 min of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>). To delineate the relationship between these signals, engagement of integrin and syndecan-4 were separated temporally by treating fibroblasts with cycloheximide in order to prevent synthesis of syndecan-4 ligands and spreading the fibroblasts on 50K for 2 h before stimulating with H/0 over a time course. Potential changes in the levels of Triton X-100 (TrX)-soluble, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins upon H/0 stimulation were examined. An immediate reduction in a 190-kD band, which is larger than the FAK and Cas bands that make up the majority of cellular tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, was observed in the 0.5% (wt/vol) TrX-soluble protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and could be explained by either dephosphorylation or redistribution of a protein between soluble and insoluble fractions. Lysates prepared in 1% (wt/vol) TrX, 0.5% (wt/vol) deoxycholate, and 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS did not show the same change (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), which indicates that change in the abundance of the 190-kD band was caused by redistribution rather than a change in phosphorylation status. Having previously described the syndecan-4&#x02013;dependent regulation of RhoA over this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>), we hypothesized that the change might represent redistribution of p190-A, which is known to mediate the suppression of RhoA activity during the initial phase of cell spreading on fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ren et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2000</xref>). Redistribution of p190-A in response to H/0 stimulation was analyzed by rupturing spread cells using 0.5% (wt/vol) TrX and clarifying lysates by centrifugation. Quantitative Western analysis using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies that enable direct measurement of relative protein levels revealed significant (P &#x0003d; 0.0036) redistribution of p190-A into the TrX-soluble fraction at 30 min, which diminished after extended stimulation of syndecan-4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Preparation of lysates in 1% (wt/vol) TrX, 0.5% (wt/vol) deoxycholate, and 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS confirmed that the total cellular level of p190-A did not change over the course of the experiment, and that observed changes were caused by redistribution rather than protein expression (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). As a control, cells were stimulated with a mutant of H/0 in which the heparin-binding motifs were mutated (H/0-glycosaminoglycan [GAG]), and no effect was observed on the levels of soluble p190-A (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Engagement of syndecan-4 regulates membrane association of p190-A.</bold> Fibroblasts prespread on a recombinant integrin ligand (50K) were stimulated with heparin-binding fragments of fibronectin (H/0) before preparing lysates and measuring redistribution of proteins between soluble and membrane-bound fractions or RhoA activity by Western blotting.

To test whether the changes were a true representation of redistribution between cytosolic and membrane-bound fractions, cells were lysed mechanically. Fibroblasts scraped off 50K-coated dishes in PBS were lysed by sonication, and nuclei were removed by low-speed centrifugation before using high-speed centrifugation to separate lysates into microsomal and soluble fractions, which are characterized by the presence of transferrin receptor and the cytosolic chaperone TCP-1&#x003b1;, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). The pattern of soluble p190-A levels in these lysates mirrored that observed with TrX lysates and included a significant increase in cytosolic p190-A at 30 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Changes in p190-A levels in the membrane pellets were more obvious, as, even at its peak, the amount of p190-A in the membrane pellet was lower than in the cytosolic fraction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>), which indicates the presence of a large, nonmobile cytosolic pool. p190-A in the microsomal pellet peaked at 10 min and was followed by almost complete loss to the cytosol at 30 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The 10-min, membrane-bound peak was represented in the cytosolic analyses by a slight dip in soluble p190-A in sonication and TrX lysates, though it was less obvious, as it was partially masked by the nonmobile cytosolic pool.</p><p>In summary, the fractionation experiments reveal a biphasic redistribution of p190-A comprising membrane recruitment at 10 min followed by redistribution to the cytosol at 30 min, and can be compared with changes in RhoA activity in response to syndecan-4 engagement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Membrane association of p190-A correlated closely with the reduction in RhoA activity immediately after H/0-stimulation, and both maxima and minima of the p190-A localization curve corresponded to the points of fastest change in RhoA activity. This relationship means that, in theory, RhoA regulation could be explained entirely in terms of p190-A localization during the first 45 min of syndecan-4 engagement. If the influences of all other GAPs and GEFs were ignored, a simple mathematical model based on the redistribution of p190-A would predict RhoA kinetics that precisely match the experimental data. However, the reciprocal relationship breaks down over longer stimulation periods (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref> and see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>), as levels of membrane-bound p190-A and active RhoA were both rising by 60 min, which indicates the involvement of alternative factors such as a Rho-GEF in sustained RhoA activity.</p><p>The redistribution of p190-A could be visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. Low levels of p190-A localization were seen in the lamellae of unstimulated cells, but this increased within 10 min of H/0 stimulation and was lost by 30 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The redistribution was quantified by measuring the pixel intensity of p190-A staining within a 0.5-&#x003bc;m-thick border around the edge of lamella (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), yielding a pattern of redistribution that very closely resembled the biochemical data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). p190-A localization was unaffected by stimulation with the heparin-binding mutant H/0-GAG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). To control for nonspecific staining and reorganization of membrane compartments that might cause p190-A recruitment, cells were also stained with nonimmune IgG and for the lipid raft marker GM-1. Nonimmune staining did not change over the period of the experiment (unpublished data). Although there was partial overlap in p190-A and GM1 staining, the two did not colocalize extensively, and changes in GM-1 distribution, over time, followed a different pattern (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>); GM-1 was unaffected by H/0-GAG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). These differences suggest that the membrane association depends on modification of p190-A itself rather than membrane ruffling or the formation and dissolution of lipid rafts. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the engagement of syndecan-4 causes an initial recruitment of p190-A to the membrane at 10 min, followed by total displacement to the cytosol at 30 min before recovery by 90 min.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>p190-A is recruited to lamellae in response to engagement of syndecan-4.</bold> Fibroblasts prespread on a recombinant integrin ligand (50K) were stimulated with heparin-binding fragments of fibronectin (H/0) or a heparin-binding mutant (H/0-GAG) before fixation and staining for p190-A (green) and the lipid raft marker GM-1 (red).

Wild-type MEFs exhibited a dip in RhoA activity in response to H/0 stimulation that recovered by 90 min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). This cycle took slightly longer to complete in MEFs than in the primary fibroblasts used in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, which is consistent with the MEFs taking longer to form focal adhesions (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>). The ability of H/0 to regulate RhoA was lost in the p190-A &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) but was restored by reexpression of p190-A to endogenous levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). Disruption or reexpression of p190-A had no effect on the surface expression of either syndecan-4 or integrin subunits (Fig. S1, A&#x02013;C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711129/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711129/DC1</ext-link>). During the generation of the p190-A &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs, it was noted that the cells expressed a truncated version of p190-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brouns et al., 2000</xref>). The truncated protein lacked GAP activity but might retain some function or, more importantly, act as a dominant negative under certain circumstances. To ensure that the truncated protein was not responsible for the behavior of the p190-A &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs, H/0-dependent RhoA regulation was tested in MEFs transfected with an RNAi oligo that reduced p190-A expression to &#x0003c;20% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref>). The addition of H/0 transiently suppressed RhoA activity in MEFs transfected with a nontargeting control oligo (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>) but had little effect on MEFs in which p190-A expression had been reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Direct comparison of MEFs transfected with the two oligos revealed elevated RhoA activity in the cells with reduced GAP expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>), and neither knockout nor knockdown of p190-A had any effect on the expression of the related B isoform of p190RhoGAP, which confirms that p190-A is a major determinant of RhoA activity in fibroblasts.

Focal adhesion formation was quantified by measuring the total adhesion area per cell using automated digital particle analysis. Only MEFs expressing both syndecan-4 and p190-A formed vinculin clusters above background level in response to H/0 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Cell area was unaffected by expression of p190-A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), and although p190-A &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs were consistently smaller than wild-type MEFs, this appeared to be independent of p190-A, as reexpression failed to increase cell area and siRNA knockdown of p190-A had no effect on the cell area of wild-type MEFs. The kinetic correlation between RhoA activity and focal adhesion formation in response to H/0 was investigated by recording the dimensions of adhesion complexes over time. In primary fibroblasts stimulated with H/0, the total adhesion area increased rapidly as RhoA was inhibited (t<sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003d; 8.05 &#x000b1; 2.86 min), which represents the initial formation of focal complexes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4 D</xref> and S2 B). As RhoA was subsequently reactivated, the adhesions elongated until they resembled classical focal adhesions (t<sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003d; 32.4 &#x000b1; 8.8 min). A similar correlation between RhoA activity and focal adhesion formation was observed in H/0-stimulated MEFs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). The phases of adhesion complex development in response to H/0 were further delineated by inhibiting signaling downstream of RhoA using Y27632 or C3 toxin. In the presence of inhibitors, H/0 induced the formation of punctate focal complexes that did not elongate over longer time periods, as RhoA could not be reactivated (Fig. S3). The time courses of adhesion complex formation and the failure of p190-deficient MEFs to form focal adhesions indicate that the formation of focal complexes during the suppression of RhoA activity is a critical stage in focal adhesion formation, and are consistent with previous findings that focal complex formation precedes the activation of RhoA during spreading on fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nobes and Hall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ren et al., 1999</xref>). However, as pharmacological inhibition of Rho was itself insufficient to induce focal complex formation, it is clear that the induction of other ECM-dependent signals such as Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>) play an equally important role.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of p190-A is necessary for focal adhesion formation in response to syndecan-4 engagement.</bold> (A) Wild-type, syndecan-4&#x02013;null, siRNA-transfected, p190-A&#x02013;null, or p190-A reexpressing MEFs prespread on a recombinant integrin ligand (50K) were stimulated with heparin-binding fragments of fibronectin (H/0) for 60 min before fixing and staining for vinculin (green) and/or actin (red).

We were able to reproduce focal adhesion formation by spreading p190-A &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs on whole fibronectin, and the similarity to the syndecan-4 &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs, which also form focal adhesions under these conditions, provides indirect support for a functional relationship between the molecules (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711129/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711129/DC1</ext-link>). The ability of cells to compensate for the loss of syndecan-4 or p190-A under less stringent culture conditions implies a role for syndecan-4 in modulating the initial processes of ECM-dependent signaling. Both cell types overcome the short-term signaling deficiencies over longer time periods, which reflects the robust nature of eukaryotic cell signaling, but they respond to external stimuli less efficiently.

Upon H/0 stimulation, p190-A redistributed into the TrX-soluble fractions of prespread MEFs with similar kinetics to the primary fibroblasts described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). In contrast, syndecan-4&#x02013;null MEFs reexpressing a mutant syndecan-4 defective in PKC&#x003b1; binding (Y188L; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>) were incapable of redistributing p190-A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Inhibition of PKC activity using a pharmacological inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide 1 (BIM-1; 200 nM) or reduction of PKC&#x003b1; expression to &#x0003c;10% by RNAi also blocked syndecan-4&#x02013;dependent redistribution of p190-A, whereas transfection of MEFs with a nontargeting siRNA did not (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C&#x02013;F</xref>). The influence of the PKC&#x003b1;-binding motif of syndecan-4 on the phosphorylation status of p190-A was measured directly by isotope labeling. MEFs expressing wild type or Y188L&#x02013;syndecan-4 were metabolically labeled with [<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphate and spread on 50K before stimulation with H/0 for 10 min and immunoprecipitation of p190-A from cell lysates. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p190-A, measured by immunoblotting, was similar between wild-type and Y188L lines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>). However, total phosphorylation, measured by isotope labeling, was reduced in Y188L&#x02013;syndecan-4 MEFs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 H</xref>), which suggests that serine/threonine phosphorylation of p190-A is augmented by the direct activation of PKC&#x003b1; by syndecan-4. The residual phosphorylation of p190-A will be partly caused by tyrosine phosphorylation but might also include phosphorylation of other serine or threonine residues that is independent of syndecan-4. Finally, the effect of the PKC&#x003b1;-binding motif of syndecan-4 on RhoA regulation was assessed. H/0 stimulation triggered a wave of RhoA inhibition followed by reactivation in MEFs reexpressing wild-type syndecan-4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 I</xref>) but had no effect on MEFs expressing the Y188L mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 J</xref>), demonstrating that the PKC&#x003b1;-binding motif of syndecan-4 is indeed responsible for the suppression of RhoA activity. We have shown previously that focal adhesion formation is blocked by the inhibition of PKC&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>), and the fact that both suppression and reactivation of RhoA are compromised in Y188L&#x02013;syndecan-4 MEFs indicates that RhoA activity is indeed held in balance by the localization of p190-A under the influence of PKC&#x003b1;.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensors have revealed that both Rac1 and RhoA are active at the edge of a lamellipodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itoh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pertz et al., 2006</xref>) and must be regulated very rapidly. In vivo, a cell is constitutively associated with the ECM across its surface, which means that if engagement of a single receptor was sufficient for regulation of GTPase activity, it would be impossible to restrict GTPase regulation to the leading edge. However, localized signaling can be easily explained in the context of a pair of coupled ECM receptors. The &#x0201c;anchoring receptor&#x0201d; (e.g., integrin) links the cell to its environment, regulates long-term signaling events, and permits signaling by the &#x0201c;sensory receptor&#x0201d; (e.g., syndecan-4), which regulates GTPases rapidly upon de novo ECM engagement at the leading edge and causes a cell to migrate toward exposed matrix. Syndecan-4 is ideally suited to act as the ECM sensor. The large, flexible glycosaminoglycan chains, through which syndecans engage the full spectrum of ECM molecules, can project up to 500 nm from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weinbaum et al., 2007</xref>) compared with the 16-nm reach of integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takagi et al., 2001</xref>), and are capable of binding ligands that are dilute or distant from the cell membrane. A consequence of the synergy model is that cell migration depends on two key signaling axes: divergence of signals from adhesion receptors to both Rac1 and RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dovas et al., 2006</xref>) and convergence of signals from &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin and syndecan-4 on Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Del Pozo et al., 2004</xref>) and p190-A, as described here. It is worth noting that the peak in membrane-bound p190-A and the dip in RhoA activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>) coincide with the peak in H/0-induced Rac1 activity in the same cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2007b</xref>), and it is logical that regulation of the antagonistic actions of Rac1 and RhoA should stem from the same pair of receptors. The involvement of coupled ECM receptors not only explains how coordinated signaling can be achieved, but also why the molecular link from adhesion receptor to GTPase has proven so difficult to resolve.</p><p>This model of signal convergence can in theory be expanded to incorporate the influences of other transmembrane receptors. The antagonistic relationship between Rac1 and RhoA, which is also influenced by growth factor receptor signaling, involves indirect inhibition of low&#x02013;molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase by Rac1 and results in elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of p190-A (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>, center; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nimnual et al., 2003</xref>). The glycosaminoglycan chains of syndecans themselves contribute to growth factor signaling by capturing and presenting growth factors to specific receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernfield et al., 1999</xref>), whereas Rac1 activation and cell migration in response to FGF depend on an intact syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tkachenko et al., 2006</xref>) and may be representative of a broader cooperation between growth factor receptors and syndecan-4 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>, left). Links have also been drawn to p190-A from the cadherin family of cell&#x02013;cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wildenberg et al., 2006</xref>). Like the integrin pathway, engagement of cadherin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p190-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noren et al., 2003</xref>) and recruitment to the membrane by direct association between p190-A and p120-catenin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wildenberg et al., 2006</xref>). This concept is particularly important, as cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;matrix interactions have opposing influences on cell migration and proliferation that must be linked mechanistically.</p><p>The most explicit demonstrations of the central role of p190-A in cell signaling have been the correlation between increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p190-A and disassembly of actin stress fibers in v-Src&#x02013;transformed fibroblasts, and the ability to block v-Src transformation with a GAP-insensitive mutant of RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fincham et al., 1999</xref>). Although phosphorylation by Src has been shown to augment the in vitro GAP activity of p190-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2000</xref>), the activity of p190-A is largely dependent on localization. Phosphorylation of tyrosine-1105 of p190-A by Src, Fyn, or Arg causes association with the SH2 domains of p120RasGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roof et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley et al., 2006</xref>) and is necessary for the suppression of RhoA during spreading on fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike the Src pathway, neither phosphorylation by Arg nor association with p120RasGAP are thought to affect the GAP activity of p190-A in vitro, and this may represent differences in uncharacterized phosphorylation or scaffolding events downstream of either Src or Arg. It is clear that the interaction between p120RasGAP and tyrosine-phosphorylated p190-A is essential for the recruitment of p190-A to the cell periphery, possibly via the pleckstrin homology and phospholipid-binding domains of p120RasGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley et al., 2006</xref>). Evidence for compromised p190-A function upon membrane modification comes from disruption of the cholesterol-rich membrane microdomain component caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grande-Garcia et al., 2007</xref>). Caveolin-1&#x02013;null fibroblasts exhibited reduced RhoA activity and a loss of persistent migration that was a consequence of increased Src activity and mediated by p190-A. Likewise, knockdown of the caveolin-binding protein filamin prevented redistribution of p190-A between membrane fractions and, as a consequence, regulation of RhoA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mammoto et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, caveolin-1 activity also inhibited Rac1 by internalizing cholesterol-rich microdomains that were necessary for signaling downstream of Rac1, providing a further antagonistic link to both Rac1 and RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Pozo et al., 2005</xref>). Collectively, these reports indicate that membrane recruitment of p190-A is the critical determinant of RhoA activity. Our data expand this model by identifying syndecan-4 as a regulator of p190-A localization that exerts its effect through PKC&#x003b1;. By isolating the tyrosine kinase&#x02013;mediated redistribution of p190-A, which is downstream of integrins from the syndecan-4 signal, and finding that both events are necessary for the biphasic regulation of RhoA during cell spreading, we identify p190-A as a key nodal point in ECM-dependent signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against p190-A and phosphotyrosine (4G10; Millipore), vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich), HSP70 (Affinity BioReagents), PKC&#x003b1; (BD Biosciences), and transferrin receptor (Invitrogen); a rat monoclonal antibody against TCP-1&#x003b1; (Assay Designs); and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against p190-B (Cell Signaling Technology) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Images were compiled and analyzed using ImageJ software. The total area of adhesion complexes per cell was calculated by recording automatically the area of fluorescence intensity above an empirically determined threshold after rolling ball background subtraction. The same threshold was used for all conditions within a single experiment. The lengths of individual focal ahesions were measured manually. Estimates of the half-times of adhesion maturation were calculated by fitting a 3-parameter hyperbola to the measurements of focal area or length.
