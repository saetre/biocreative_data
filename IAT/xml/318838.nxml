Using the nitrocellulose filter assay, we have shown that isolated beta subunit, but not the alpha subunit, binds [14C]glycyl-tRNA with an affinity comparable to that of the native enzyme. Further, the data indicate that the beta subunit possesses one binding site for glycyl-tRNA while the native or reconstituted enzyme (alpha 2 beta 2) has two sites. Rabbit antibodies directed at the beta subunit or the holoenzyme inhibit efficiently the ability of the enzyme to aminoacylate tRNA while alpha-subunit antibodies have a smaller effect. Since none of the antisera have an appreciable effect on the ATP-PPi exchange activity of the enzyme under these conditions, the beta-subunit (and holoenzyme) antisera evidently interfere with productive tRNA binding. Taken together, the data indicate that the larger, beta subunit of glycyl-tRNA synthetase plays a major role in tRNA recognition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00328-0325.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4377"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00328-0326.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4378"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00328-0327.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4379"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00328-0328.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4380"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00328-0329.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4381"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00328-0330.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4382"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00328-0331.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4383"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00328-0332.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4384"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
