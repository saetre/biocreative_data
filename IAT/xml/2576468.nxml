All known mammalian ART4 orthologues are predicted to lack ART activity because of one or more changes in essential active site residues that make up the R-S-EXE motif. So far, no other function has been detected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we report the identification and characterisation of ART4 in chicken, which to our knowledge is the first true non-mammalian orthologue of a mammalian ART family member. The chicken <italic>ART4 </italic>gene has the same physical structure as its mammalian counterparts (three coding exons separated by two introns in phase 0 and phase 1, respectively) and maps to a region of conserved linkage synteny on chromosome 1. Its mRNA encodes a 289 amino acid protein with predicted N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal GPI-anchor sequences and 47% sequence identity to human ART4. However, in striking contrast to its mammalian orthologues, the chicken protein contains an intact R-S-EXE motif. Upon ectopic expression in C-33A cells, recombinant chicken ART4 localized at the cell surface as a GPI-anchored, highly glycosylated protein, which displayed arginine-specific ART activity (apparent K<sub>m </sub>of the recombinant protein for etheno-NAD<sup>+ </sup>1.0 &#x000b1; 0.18 &#x003bc;M).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The avian orthologue of the "acatalytic" mammalian ART4 is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase with enzymatic activity comparable to that of other, catalytically active and GPI-anchored members of the mammalian ART family.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>ART4 is structurally related to vertebrate ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs), which covalently modify extracellular substrates by transferring a single ADP-ribose residue from NAD<sup>+ </sup>to a specific amino acid in the target protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The mammalian ART family which comprises five members (ART1 &#x02013; ART5) has been extensively studied in mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In contrast to humans, which lack <italic>ART2 </italic>expression due to the presence of a non-functional <italic>ART2 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], two ART2 proteins are expressed in mice as a result of gene duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Among the five known ARTs, only ART1, ART2 and ART5 exhibit arginine-specific enzyme activity. ART3 and ART4 appear to have lost their catalytic activity, most likely due to the non-conservative substitution of residues in the R-S-EXE motif, which is typically present in the active centre of arginine-specific ARTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>So far, no evidence for a potential other function has emerged for either of the two "acatalytic" members of the mammalian ART family, except that human ART4 has previously been demonstrated to be identical with the polymorphic Dombrock blood group antigen expressed on erythrocytes as GPI (glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol)-anchored glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, we and others have shown that expression of the human <italic>ART4 </italic>gene can be induced by lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan in monocytes and alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Given the fact that the <italic>ART2 </italic>gene locus shows considerable genetic variation even among mammalian species (one active gene in rat, two active genes in mice versus one pseudogene in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]), we sought to employ bioinformatic means to search for other <italic>ART4 </italic>orthologues not only in mammals but also in lower vertebrates. A tBLASTn search, in which the amino acid sequence of human ART4 was compared to entries in NCBI's nucleotide sequence databases dynamically translated in all reading frames, resulted in the detection of a predicted gene transcript in chicken that potentially encoded a protein "similar to Dombrock blood group carrier molecule". Intriguingly, this protein contained an intact R-S-EXE motif, which raised the possibility that it represented an active ART enzyme. As none of the ARTs identified in chicken so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] was evolutionary related to mammalian ARTs, it was important to verify the orthologous relationship between the putative chicken and the human ART4 gene, before attempting to prove the enzymatic activity of its protein.</p><p>Here we report for the first time the existence of a GPI-anchored ART4 in chicken, which, to our knowledge, represents also the first real orthologue of a member of the mammalian ecto-ART family in a non-mammalian species. Moreover, in contrast to its mammalian ART4 orthologues, chicken ART4 displays an arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>[<sup>32</sup>P]-NAD<sup>+ </sup>(800 Ci/mmole) was obtained from PerkinElmer LAS GmbH (Rodgau-Jugesheim, Germany).

A search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) "nr" nucleotide database with the human or mouse ART4 protein sequence uncovered a putative chicken gene transcript of 870 nucleotides that translated into a 289 amino acid protein "similar to Dombrock blood group carrier molecule" ([GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM425453.1">XM425453.1</ext-link> GI:50729203, VRT 28-JUL-2004]).

As in mammalian <italic>ART4 </italic>genes, the second exon encoded the major part of the protein, but different from the situation in mammals, it also coded for an intact R-S-EXE motif indicative of a functional catalytic domain of an arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Incidentally, [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM425453.1">XM425453.1</ext-link>] was since removed from the "nr" database and on 06-Nov-2006 replaced by [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM425453.2">XM425453.2</ext-link> GI:118082577]. (The protein encoded by the latter transcript differs at its C-terminus from the earlier version, because the new gene prediction lacks the third exon. As a consequence, the open reading frame in ex2 ends shortly after the ex2-intron2 junction predicted in the first record. Thus, [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM425453.2">XM425453.2</ext-link>] could reflect a splice variant.) To substantiate the presence of an active <italic>ART4</italic>-related gene in chicken, RT-PCR was performed on total RNA from HD3 cells (a chicken erythroblast cell line) with primers, designed to amplify the complete coding and additional flanking sequences of the trancript shown in [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM425453.1">XM425453.1</ext-link>].

Obviously additional residues besides the intact R-S-EXE motif are involved in catalyzing the enzymatic reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue distribution of chicken <italic>ART4</italic></title><p>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of chicken tissues revealed that the highest amount of chicken <italic>ART4 </italic>mRNA was present in spleen, liver and bone marrow, while in thymus, bursa of Fabricius, and caecum it was hardly detected.

Chicken contain both soluble ARTs (ART6.1 and ART6.2) and GPI-anchored ARTs (cgART1 and cgART2). The nucleotide sequence of <italic>cgART2 </italic>was found to be identical with that of <italic>ART7 </italic>(<italic>ART7.2</italic>) and the cDNA of <italic>cgART1 </italic>encoded a polypeptide which represents an <italic>ART7 </italic>homologue (<italic>ART7.1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The GPI-anchored ARTs showed different enzymatic properties than soluble ARTs and the tissue distribution of cgART1 and cgART2 revealed distinct expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Besides ART6 and ART7 no other ARTs have been identified in chicken so far. Here we show that apart from ART6 and ART7 chicken also express a non chicken-specific ART.</p><p>We describe the cloning and characterization of the <italic>ART4 </italic>(or <italic>DO</italic>) gene from <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>. Several lines of evidence, such as conserved synteny, similar exon-intron structure, and conserved residues show that the gene cloned is the <italic>Gallus gallus </italic>orthologue of the human <italic>ART4 </italic>gene. The predicted chicken ART4 amino acid sequence only shares 47% and 45% identity (65% and 64% similarity) to human and mouse ART4 respectively and among mammals ART4 also appears to be quite divergent with an identity between human and mouse ART4 of 63% (75% similarity). Thus the coding sequence of <italic>ART4 </italic>appears to be evolving rapidly. Residues that are conserved during evolution in such a rapidly evolving gene or gene family are likely to be important for the function of the protein.</p><p>The amino acid sequence alignment of ART4 from chicken, men, and mice uncovered several stretches of residues that are highly conserved, most strikingly the S<sup>30</sup>FDDQY<sup>35 </sup>and K<sup>218</sup>EVLIPPYE<sup>226 </sup>residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Parts of these sequences namely the FDD and EVLIP motifs are also strictly conserved within other members of the ART family. The FDD sequence motif is located in the N-terminus of the ARTs whereas the EVLIP stretch resides in the 5<sup>th </sup>of the six conserved &#x003b2;-strands that make up part of the core features of the ART fold in the catalytic domain. Moreover a lysine residue (K) directly upstream of the catalytic E in the EXE motif is found in ART4 of men (KKE<sup>244</sup>), mice (RKE<sup>223</sup>), and chicken (EKE<sup>219</sup>) but not in the EXE motif of other mammalian ARTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Another common feature of the chicken and human <italic>ART4 </italic>gene is their genomic organization. Almost the complete mature protein is encoded by exon 2, one of the three exons that besides two introns make up the <italic>ART4 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Unlike human <italic>ART4 </italic>mRNA the 3' UTR of the chicken <italic>ART4 </italic>mRNA comprises 2145 bp. Due to this length the chicken <italic>ART4 </italic>gene overlaps with a hypothetical gene ([GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM416185">XM416185</ext-link>]) located on the opposite DNA strand.</p><p>The tissue distribution of chicken <italic>ART4 </italic>mRNA expression is in part similar to that of human <italic>ART4 </italic>mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Haematological tissues including human fetal liver and human and chicken bone marrow and spleen seem to be preferential sites of <italic>ART4 </italic>mRNA expression. Furthermore, the fact that HEL cells, a human erythroleukaemia cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and human erythrocytes carry the ART4 protein and that <italic>ART4 </italic>mRNA is present in chicken erythrocytes (data not shown) may point to a role of ART4 in haematopoiesis in higher vertebrates.</p><p>GPI-anchoring of the chicken ART4 to the membrane was shown by PI-PLC sensitivity. Treatment of chicken <italic>ART4 </italic>transfected C-33A cells with the enzyme led to the appearance of a 40 kDa protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) whose molecular weight was higher than that predicted for chicken ART4 (29 kDa) lacking the N- and C-terminal signal peptides. The decrease in molecular weight after the exposure to PNGase F strongly suggests that the chicken ART4 is glycosylated. In fact there are five predicted N-glycosylation sites in the amino acid sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><p>Determination of the apparent K<sub>m </sub>for etheno-NAD<sup>+ </sup>of recombinant chicken ART4 revealed a value of 1.0 &#x003bc;M. It is similar to the K<sub>m </sub>(3 &#x003bc;M) for etheno-NAD<sup>+ </sup>of ART2.2 expressed on DC27.10 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] but it differs from the K<sub>m </sub>values for recombinant ART7.2 (130 &#x003bc;M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] another ART found in chicken and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>toxin A (275 &#x003bc;M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, both human and chicken ART4 contain an RGD sequence motif. This sequence (Arg-Gly-Asp) found in various adhesive proteins (fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen, and Willebrand factor) serves as a cell attachment site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In chicken the motif (RGD<sup>50</sup>) is found in the N-terminal part of ART4 whereas in humans an RGD<sup>265 </sup>motif is located in the C-terminus that aligns to the chicken RGN<sup>240</sup>. In case ART4 should display adhesive properties it would be of interest in how far the cell recognition signal Arg-Gly-Asp is involved in it.</p><p>We show that chicken ART4 contains residues corresponding to the R-S-EXE active site motif of arginine-specific ARTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and that it displays arginine-specific enzyme activity while human ART4 shows nonconservative amino acid deviations in this motif. Furthermore, according to the CLUSTAL W amino acid sequence alignment human and mouse ART4 not only deviate in the glutamic acid (E) two residues upstream of the catalytic glutamic acid (E) of the R-S-EXE motif but also in the arginine (R) which is replaced by histidine (H) in mouse and tyrosine (Y) in men (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><p>Considering the importance of the R-S-EXE motif in the catalytic core of all arginine modifying ARTs we exchanged two amino acids of the human ART4 Y-S-KXE motif to obtain an intact R-S-EXE motif. Surprisingly C-33A cells expressing human ART4 with the R-S-EXE motif did not display any enzyme activity. Obviously the mere presence of the correct motif in ART4 is not sufficient to turn the protein into an active enzyme. Further mutational studies are necessary to identify additional amino acid residues essential for restoring a functional catalytic core.</p><p>It is conceivable that the common ancestor of birds and mammals possesses an enzymatically active ART4 and that the loss of enzyme activity of human ART4 may have arisen due to some evolutionary advantages.</p><p>Having cloned and characterized an enzymatically active <italic>ART4 </italic>orthologue we have provided important experimental tools to elucidate the functional role of ART4. Knowledge of such function in turn may help to explain the loss of ART4 enzyme activity in mammals during evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) catalyze the transfer of a single ADP-ribose moiety of NAD<sup>+ </sup>to a specific amino acid in a target protein. Mammalian ARTs consist of five members (ART1 &#x02013; 5) two of them ART3 and ART4 being enzymatically inactive, unlike the active members they do not contain the R-S-EXE motif in the catalytic domain typical of arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases. Here we identified the chicken ART4 as the first real orthologue of a member of the mammalian ARTs in a non-mammalian species. In contrast to the mammalian ART4 the chicken ART4 contains an intact R-S-EXE motif and exhibits the predicted enzyme activity. Thus, ART4 is the first ADP-ribosyltransferase which displays different biochemical properties in two higher vertebrate classes.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AG performed the sequence alignments, carried out the protein and enzymatic experiments, participated in the mRNA analyses and helped to draft the manuscript.
