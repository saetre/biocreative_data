The low ability for self-renewal of nucleus pulposus cells is one obstacle in developing new therapeutic options for intervertebral disc diseases, and utilizing cytokines is one of the strategies to regulate nucleus pulposus cell proliferation.

Conversely, TGF&#x003b2;1 stimulates proliferation in certain mesenchymal cells such as bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and cells with osteoblastic phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the exact mechanism of stimulation of cell proliferation by TGF&#x003b2;1 has not been elucidated.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that endogenous c-Myc mRNA and protein decrease rapidly when TGF&#x003b2;1 inhibits cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. c-Myc is a helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper oncoprotein that plays an important role in cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It has been also shown that elevated c-Myc activity is able to abrogate the cell cycle suppressing effect of TGF&#x003b2;1; the mouse keratinocyte cell line (BALB/MK) constitutively expresses endogenous <italic>c-myc</italic>, and showed resistance to the arrest of growth by TGF&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>c-myc</italic>-transfected Fisher rat 3T3 fibroblasts showed upregulation in colony formation in soft agar with TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. At the same time, these investigators suggested that TGF&#x003b2; is a bifunctional regulator of cellular growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Considering these findings, we hypothesized that the cells that show mitogenic response to TGF&#x003b2;1 have a unique mechanism dependent on endogenous c-Myc. We determined the mitogenic effect of TGF&#x003b2;1 on cultured rat nucleus pulposus cells and whether the small-molecule c-Myc inhibitor, 10058-F4, obstructed cell proliferation caused by exogenous TGF&#x003b2;1. This inhibitor is a recently identified compound that inhibits the association between c-Myc and Myc-associated factor X (Max). Because c-Myc/Max heterodimers are necessary for binding E-box DNA in the target gene, the interruption of their association inhibits the transcriptional function of c-Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Secondly, to suppress expression of c-Myc in protein level, we tested an inhibitor of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, PD98059 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This was investigated since, it has been reported that mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) subtype ERK1/2 mediates TGF&#x003b2;1 signaling in rat articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and stabilizes c-Myc protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>To understand the molecular mechanism of cell cycle regulation by TGF&#x003b2;1, we utilized western blot analysis. The cell cycle is known to be controlled by positive and negative regulators. The positive regulators are cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Cell cycle progression through G<sub>1 </sub>into S phase requires cyclin D-CDK4/6 and cyclin E-CDK2, which phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. CDK inhibitors (CKIs) are the negative regulators and are grouped into two families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The INK4 family (p15, p16, p18, p19 and p20) only bind and inactivate cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex, while the Cip/Kip family (p21, p27, and p57) show broader substrate specificity inactivating both cyclin D-CDK4/6 and cyclin E-CDK2 kinase complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We examined the expression of p15<sup>INK4</sup>, p21<sup>WAF1/Cip1 </sup>and p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, which are known to prevent cell cycle progression under the growth inhibitory effect of TGF&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was therefore to reveal the role of c-Myc in mitogenic response to TGF&#x003b2;1 in nucleus pulposus cells. The study was designed to (1) analyze the effect of TGF&#x003b2;1 on cell proliferation and the cell cycle progression in nucleus pulposus cells, (2) determine if c-Myc transcription inhibitor obstructed the effect of TGF&#x003b2;1, and (3) determine the role of ERK1/2 in stabilizing the expression of c-Myc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Recombinant human TGF&#x003b2;1 was obtained from PeproTech Pharmacological (London, UK).

Pharmacological MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 was from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY, USA). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against rat phospho-MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204), p44/42 MAPkinase (ERK1/2), and p27 Kip1 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).

A total of 14 female Sprague-Dawley rats (12 months old; CLEA Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) were utilized for the entire study and the cells from at least 3 animals were applied to each experiment. Cryopreserved primary passage rat epidermal keratinocytes were obtained from Cell Applications Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) and maintained in growth medium (Cell Applications Inc.). Cells from rat intervertebral disc tissues were isolated and processed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Briefly, the nucleus pulposus was harvested from coccygeal discs of rats and suspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; DS Pharma Biomedical, Osaka, Japan) with 0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Gibco Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) added to achieve final concentrations of 0.01% trypsin and 0.1 mM EDTA and allowed to digest at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 min. Chondrocytes from articular cartilage were prepared following the method of Tukazaki <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Cartilage slices from knee joints of rats were digested with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA (Gibco Invitrogen) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min, followed by 0.3 mg/mL collagenase P (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h. The isolated nucleus pulposus cells and articular chondrocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12, 1:1 Mixture (DMEM/F-12) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco Invitrogen), 100 U/mL penicillin (Gibco Invitrogen) and 100 &#x003bc;g/mL streptomycin (Gibco Invitrogen), at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>humidified atmosphere. The medium was replaced twice a week and the cells were trypsinized and subcultured before the cultured cells reached confluency. The nucleus pulposus has been reported to consist of at least two major cell populations, notochordal cells and chondrocyte-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Because cells obtained from the rat disc tissues were variable in morphology until the second passage, we expanded the culture to the third or fourth passage to prepare enough number of the morphologically uniformed cells from each animal. Conversely, because articular chondrocytes were morphologically uniform since primary culture, the second passage was used for the experiments. With regard to keratinocytes, they will not proliferate if keratinization is triggered by passage. Therefore, the primary culture was applied for the experiment in the medium specified by the supplier. Nucleus pulposus and articular chondrocytes were subjected to the experiments using Opti Minimum Essential Medium (Opti-MEM, Gibco Invitrogen). Serum deprivation was performed with 24 h incubation with medium containing 2% FBS followed by 2 h incubation with medium containing 0.5% FBS; 0.5% FBS was fed to maintain cell adhesion throughout every experimental period. All experiments were performed at least three times to confirm consistency.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)</title><p>Cells cultured in serum-deprived medium were treated with and without 5 ng/mL TGF&#x003b2;1 for 24 h.

The medium was replaced with OptiMEM containing 0.5% FBS and recombinant human TGF&#x003b2;1 in final concentrations of 0 (control), 5, or 20 ng/mL. For experiments using pathway specific inhibitors, appropriate concentrations of 10058-F4 or PD98059 were added to the medium as concentrated stock solutions dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Wako). The solvent alone was added at 0.08% to serve as the vehicle control. During the 6 days of culture, the culture media were replaced on day 3 with the appropriate medium.

These reports correspond with our observations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PD98059 downregulates ERK1 phosphorylation and c-Myc expression</title><p>We show that pretreatment with PD98059 significantly blocked the mitogenic and cell cycle promotive effects of TGF&#x003b2;1 (MTT assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and cell cycle distribution (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>)) associated with suppression of c-Myc expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7d</xref>). In the preliminarily experiments we also examined a protein kinase C inhibitor peptide (19&#x02013;36) obtained from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany), because inhibition of protein kinase C had been reported to cause abolition of TGF&#x003b2;1 induced cell growth in rat articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but it did not exert the abolition in nucleus pulposus cells (data not shown). By contrast, PD98059 showed a significant inhibitory effect. PD98059 is an inhibitor for MAP kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MKK), also called MAP/ERK kinases (MEK), the upstream activator of ERK1/2. In the time course study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>), the second panel shows only phospho-ERK2 protein bands with the complete absence of phospho-ERK1 for 24 h. The inhibitory effect of PD98059 on MEK2 is known to be less potent than MEK1. The concentration of PD98059 required to give 50% inhibition (IC50) of MEK1 is 4 &#x003bc;M and of MEK2 is 50 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Because we used a maximum dose of 30 &#x003bc;M of PD98059, MEK1 was considered to be strongly inhibited. These results suggest that phosphorylated ERK1 is necessary to maintain c-Myc expression and promote cell cycle progression under TGF&#x003b2;1 stimulation. Our results agree with earlier reports showing that ERK1/2 plays a crucial mediating role in mitogenic signaling of TGF&#x003b2;1 in mouse BM-MSCs cultured in chondrogenic condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and in rat articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Possibility of c-Myc stability supported by phospho-ERK1/2</title><p>We showed the persistent expression of c-Myc in nucleus pulposus cells, which are not tumor cells or immortalized cells. As described above, c-Myc appears to be supported by phospho-ERK1/2. Lefevre <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] showed that treatment with Raf-1 kinase inhibitor or ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 decreased c-Myc production in cultured ocular choroidal melanoma which had a high and constant level of c-Myc. Also, the contribution of Ras/Raf/ERK prevented the rapid degradation of c-Myc by phosphorylation of the serine 62 residue in the N-terminal of c-Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. They also found that the suppression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3&#x003b2;) activity, which phosphorylates threonine 58, a phosphorylation site adjacent to serine 62, enhances c-Myc stability. Although we did not analyze the phosphorylation of c-Myc, these proposed kinetics should be investigated to explain the enhanced stability of c-Myc in nucleus pulposus cells.</p><p>Recent investigations have revealed that Myc stability is required in self-renewal and maintenance of murine ES cell pluripotency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. These authors evaluated Myc protein levels in ES cells and concluded that elevated Myc activity is able to block the differentiation of multiple cell lineages and that this blocking of differentiation promotes self-renewal. Similarly, c-Myc has been reported to inhibit the terminal stages of adipocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>We used cells derived from rat nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc to examine how they respond to TGF&#x003b2;-1 stimulation. Cells constituting the nucleus pulposus are known to be sparse and have a low ability for self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Although efforts to regenerate disc tissue using cell therapy have accelerated their profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], the precise phenotype of nucleus pulposus cells and their response to various cytokines are still under investigation. In this study, we suggested a specific regulatory pathway of TGF&#x003b2;1 in which c-Myc and phospho-ERK1/2 play important roles. However, we used the third or fourth passaged culture, which did not contain large notochordal cells. Therefore, some phenotypic change (that is dedifferentiation) may have been induced, as is known to occur for articular chondrocytes. Inevitably, the correlation between differentiation level in the cells and responsiveness to TGF&#x003b2;1 remains to be elucidated. Moreover, in view of the therapeutic use of TGF&#x003b2;1 for nucleus pulposus regeneration, the limitation in the use of the rat model needs to be carefully considered. This is because the presence of notochordal cells in the rat coccygeal disc is different from the human situation, in which notochordal cells have been known to disappear after birth. Therefore, future studies using different animal models are necessary to confirm whether the implication of c-Myc and ERK1/2 can generally be attributed to nucleus pulposus cells or it depends on the species of the donor.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Because our results indicate that both c-Myc and phospho-ERK1/2 are required for proliferation and cell cycle progression, we conclude that the synergistic effect between c-Myc and phospho-ERK1/2 plays a key role in nucleus pulposus cell growth under TGF&#x003b2;1 stimulation. Therefore, treatment with TGF&#x003b2;1 should yield different effects depending on the status of these mediators in the target cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AC: articular chondrocytes; BM-MSCs: bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CDK: cyclin dependent kinase; CKIs: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; DPBS: Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; ERK1/2: extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GSK-3&#x003b2;: glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2;; KT: keratinocytes; MAPK: mitogen activated protein kinase; Max: Myc-associated factor X; MEK: MAP/ERK kinase; MEM: minimum essential medium; MKK: MAP kinase kinase; NP: nucleus pulposus; PVDF: polyvinylidene difluoride; RT-PCR: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; TBST: Tris-buffered saline/Tween; TGF&#x003b2;1: transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1; SDS-PAGE: sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SEM: standard error of the mean.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TN and DS conceived of the study and performed the experimental work.
