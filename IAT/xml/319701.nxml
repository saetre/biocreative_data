In this model the fibroblast-induced epithelial cell differentiation from secretory crypt cells to absorptive enterocytes is mediated via transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), the major inhibitory regulator of epithelial cell proliferation known to induce differentiation in intestinal epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to identify novel genes whose products would play a role in this TGF-&#x003b2;-induced differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Differential display analysis resulted in the identification of a novel TGF-&#x003b2; upregulated mRNA species, the Sin3-associated protein 30-like, SAP30L. The mRNA is expressed in several human tissues and codes for a nuclear protein of 183 amino acids 70% identical with Sin3 associated protein 30 (SAP30). The predicted nuclear localization signal of SAP30L is sufficient for nuclear transport of the protein although mutating it does not completely remove SAP30L from the nuclei. In the nuclei SAP30L concentrates in small bodies which were shown by immunohistochemistry to colocalize with PML bodies only partially.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>By reason of its nuclear localization and close homology to SAP30 we believe that SAP30L might have a role in recruiting the Sin3-histone deacetylase complex to specific corepressor complexes in response to TGF-&#x003b2;, leading to the silencing of proliferation-driving genes in the differentiating intestinal epithelial cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The intestinal epithelium is a constantly renewing population of cells, which arise from the proliferating stem cells in the crypts of Lieberkuhn. In the intestinal mucosa the secretory crypt cells differentiate to absorptive enterocytes while migrating along the villus side to the villus tip. One of the most important modulators of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation is transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), which affects the cell cycle machinery leading to terminal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This acquisition of differentiated phenotype in epithelial cells requires finely tuned gene expression where the genes that drive proliferation are silenced while genes whose products are essential for a differentiated cell are activated.</p><p>We have previously shown by differential display PCR (DD-PCR) technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] that in a cell culture model, where differentiation of crypt-like T84 cells to enterocyte-like cells is induced by TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] the changes in gene expression parallel those seen in differentiating intestinal epithelial cells <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, a novel gene, apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor (AATF) (accession number HSA249940), whose expression was downregulated by TGF-&#x003b2;, was cloned from the undifferentiated crypt-like cells of the same cell culture system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. AATF is involved in epithelial cell proliferation, since it represses the growth suppression function of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] by inhibiting the recruitment of the histone deacetylase HDAC1 to the Rb/E2F complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The acetylation status of the histone proteins mainly responsible for the packing of chromatin plays a key role in transcriptional regulation. Acetylation of lysine residues in the histone tails is associated with a more open chromatin state and thus increased DNA accessibility to transcription factors [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]], while deacetylation or histone hypoacetylation is associated with tightly packed chromatin and transcriptional silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Both transcriptional coactivators and corepressors regulate gene expression by influencing the histone acetylation status. Histone deacetylation is indeed a basic and well-conserved mechanism for gene silencing and it involves many corepressor proteins that vary depending on the repressor complex. The corepressor may well establish the target specificity of a given deacetylase complex as in the case of the Rb protein. It recruits a histone deacetylase complex to E2F transcription factors, leading to the repression of transcription of E2F-dependent target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In this paper we now for the first time describe the initial characterization of another unknown transcript identified by DD-PCR in differentiating intestinal T84 epithelial cells. The newly identified gene codes for a protein markedly similar to the histone deacetylase-associated corepressor Sin3-associated protein 30 (SAP30), and therefore this novel Sin3-associated protein 30-like, SAP30L, could well have a role in silencing the genes crucial for proliferation in intestinal crypt epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>DD-PCR showed that TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced consistent and reproducible upregulation of a transcript denoted SAP30L (see later) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) using the arbitrary 5' primer AP-3 and the 3' anchoring primer T12MG. Quantitative RT-PCR using LightCycler technology verified this induction by TGF-&#x003b2; in three independent experiments. The differentiated TGF-&#x003b2;-treated cells expressed this transcript 2.0 times more than the unstimulated T84 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The expression of SAP30L in control and TGF-&#x003b2;-treated differentiated T84 epithelial cells.

The gene has four exons and the expected size of the transcribed mRNA is 1281 base pairs. Indeed, northern hybridization to a multi-tissue northern blot showed that a SAP30L-specific probe recognized an mRNA of approximately 1.3 kB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The mRNA was expressed in all tissues examined, with somewhat weaker expression in the liver and lung and particularly abundant expression in the testis. Interestingly, there was also a transcript of size 6.5 kB which was abundantly expressed in brain and lung but not at all in liver and stomach. As the genomic sequence did not predict an mRNA of this size, its identity remains to be established.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>SAP30L mRNA expression in human tissues.

When the clone was sequenced and compared to the sequence of an Image clone FLJ11526, the two sequences were found to be identical. Both clones code for a protein of 183 amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), which was named Sin3-associated protein 30 like, SAP30L. Prosite scan identified two putative N-glycosylation sites (NASF, amino acids 44&#x02013;47 and NKSR, amino acids 168&#x02013;171), one N-myristoylation site (GQSCCL, amino acids 26&#x02013;31) and several phosphorylation sites for different kinases. The PsortII program predicted the SAP30L protein to be nuclear, the putative nuclear localization signal being KRKRK, ranging from amino acid 87 to 91 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A database search for homologous proteins showed that SAP30L has orthologues in several species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The corresponding mouse protein is 97% identical with the human SAP30L. The <italic>Xenopus </italic>protein is 85% identical along the first 150 amino acids after which they begin to diversify considerably while the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>orthologue is fairly identical along the whole protein, the identity being 52%. Interestingly, there was a human protein called SAP30, which was 70% identical with SAP30L. Amino acid comparison of SAP30L with SAP30 showed SAP30 to have in its N-terminus a 38-amino-acid stretch that was absent in SAP30L. The corresponding SAP30 protein was also found in mouse but not in other species.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The amino acid sequence of SAP30L.

The transfection of the EGFP fusion protein, which had only the putative nuclear localization and six flanking amino acids on either side (pEGFP-NLS), also resulted in the nuclear localization of the protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>), thus providing evidence for the functionality of the signal. Mutation in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) (KRKRK &#x02192; KSNRK) disturbed this nuclear localization to some extent, causing the protein to be visible also in the cytosol although it did not completely inhibit the protein's nuclear transport (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). Immunocytochemical staining of these transfected cells with anti-promyelotocytic leukaemia (PML) antibody showed these nuclear structures to be other than PML bodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Transfection of the different EGFP fusion constructs to IMR-90 fibroblasts.

The novel mRNA is approximately 1.3 kB long and was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined. The protein, called SAP30L, is 183 amino acids in length and located in the nucleus, where it concentrates in small dense structures other than PML bodies.</p><p>SAP30L protein is 70% identical to a protein called SAP30, the most prominent difference being the lack of 38 amino acids in the N terminus of SAP30L. At the genomic level, although their DNA sequences differ, their exon-intron organization is exactly the same, which suggests a common evolutionary origin for these genes. It would appear that SAP30L is evolutionarily older than SAP30, since only mammals have the protein with the extra 38 N-terminal amino acids. The size of for example the <italic>Drosophila </italic>orthologue corresponds better with the size of SAP30L than with SAP30.</p><p>Based on the extremely high degree of identity in the primary structure of SAP30L and SAP30 it is probable that they also share functional similarity. SAP30 is a 30 kD nuclear protein associated with the Sin3 corepressor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which contains at least mSin3, HDAC1 and 2, SAP18, RbAp46 and RbAp48 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The Sin3 complex facilitates transcriptional repression by being recruited to specific sites by different DNA-binding transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] such as Mad, Ikaros, p53 and nuclear hormone receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. SAP30 is involved in the interaction at least in the case of nuclear hormone receptors, where it is thought to act as a specificity factor stabilizing or facilitating the interaction between the DNA-binding N-CoR and Sin3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. SAP30 binds to N-CoR by its 129 N-terminal amino acids and to Sin3 with amino acids 129&#x02013;220 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since the C-terminal part of SAP30L and SAP30 are markedly similar but SAP30L lacks 38 amino acids in the N-terminus when compared to SAP30, SAP30L is likely to bind Sin3A but not N-CoR. Further evidence for the binding of SAP30L to mSin3a comes from a recent study by Fleischer and associates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] where they identified a novel 28 kD protein which binds to mSin3a. The identified protein is very probably SAP30L. In the Sin3 repressor complex SAP30L might work similarly to SAP30 eg to recruit Sin3a to other repressor complexes than N-CoR.</p><p>The recruitment of the Sin3-HDAC repressor complex to E2-dependent promoters leads to exit from the cell cycle, thus allowing differentiation to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; promotes exit from cell cycle in many ways, for example by directly inhibiting the expression of c-myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which is mediated by proteins E2F4/5, Smads and p107 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. P107 is a pocket protein able to bind to HDACs. It is interesting to speculate that SAP30L could be upregulated by TGF-&#x003b2; in order to fulfil its role in the stabilization of the Sin3 repressor complex in E2F-dependent promoter sites to repress transcription of proliferation-associated genes such as c-myc and may thus have a crucial role in differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we report here the identification of a novel transcript, SAP30L, which encodes a protein that very likely has a role in a histone deacetylase complex. Since the protein is 70% identical with a previously known protein SAP30 it might function similarly to SAP30, e.g. in recruiting Sin3A to a specific repressor complex other than N-CoR, leading to the silencing of proliferation-driving gene(s) and ultimately to the differentiation of the intestinal epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and cultures</title><p>Human intestinal epithelial T84 cells (CCL 248) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).
