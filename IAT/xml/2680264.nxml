This is initiated when a termination codon in mRNA enters the ribosomal A site and is recognized by a class 1 release factor (RF). In bacteria, translation termination requires the active contribution of two protein release factors, RF1 and RF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Scolnick <italic>et al</italic>., 1968</xref>); these factors recognize, respectively, and with different affinity UAA/UAG or UAA/UGA termination codons at the decoding centre of the ribosomal A site. A conserved tripeptide motif GGQ in RF1 or RF2 interacts with the peptidyl transfer centre (PTC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Frolova <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) and activates the hydrolysis of the ester bond between the polypeptide chain and the tRNA at the PTC, thereby releasing the newly synthesized polypeptide chain.</p><p>Specific recognition of termination codons by RF1 and RF2 involves specific tripeptide motifs, PxT for RF1 or SPF for RF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ito <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), which are present in a central domain of the proteins. The tripeptide motifs were first suggested to be responsible for recognizing the last two nucleotides of the three stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ito <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), but recent structural studies indicate that they interact with the first two nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Laurberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and explain in part the remarkable accuracy with which the first stop codon nucleotide, an invariant uridine, is recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Freistroffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Discrimination against purines in the first stop codon position implicates residues near the tip of a helical finger (&#x003b1;-helix 5) present in the central domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Laurberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Two residues near the PxT motif, Q185 and T198 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RF1, discriminate against pyrimidines in the third stop codon position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Laurberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Interactions of RF1 or RF2 with a third factor, RF3-GTP or GDP, at the GTP-associated centre of the 50S ribosomal subunit, are also required for the final detachment of the class 1 RFs from the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Freistroffer <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Zavialov <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gao <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A more detailed understanding of the role of the GGQ motif conserved in class I RFs has been provided by crystal structures of RF1 and RF2 in complex with the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Petry <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Laurberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), and by molecular dynamics simulations of peptide release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Trobro and Aqvist, 2007</xref>). The GGQ motif, together with A76 of the P-site tRNA, is instrumental in co-ordinating the water molecule that initiates a nucleophilic attack on the peptidyl-tRNA ester bond. Following the detachment of the RF from the ribosome the subsequent action of the ribosomal releasing factor RRF and the elongation factor EF-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Karimi <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gao <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) leads to the de-assembling of the ribosomal subunits, which can then be recycled and reassembled in a new translation initiation event.</p><p>Pausing of a bacterial ribosome due to limitations in tRNA can lead to cleavage of mRNA at a site within or immediately adjacent to the A-site codon; the ribosome participates in this cleavage in an, as yet, undefined way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hayes and Sauer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Sunohara <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Breaks at UAG and UGA stop codons induced by ribosome stalling due to the reduced activity of RF1 have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Breaks in the mRNA at UAG termination codons at the A site can also be induced by the RelE toxin encoded by the bacterial toxin&#x02013;antitoxin (TA) system <italic>relBE</italic>. The cleavage occurs preferentially between the second and third nucleotides of UAG termination codons in the ribosomal A site implying the concerted action of the RelE toxin and the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). The RelE toxin is activated under amino acid or carbon source limitation by a mechanism which involves the enhanced decay of the RelB antitoxin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gerdes <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this, RF1, which preferentially recognizes this termination codon at the A site, can protect against the RelE cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Cleavage of mRNA in all the above cases leads to the stalling of the ribosome at the end of the non-stop mRNA, and can eventually inhibit protein synthesis as in the case with RelE. Stalled ribosomes are released by the intervention of transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), which provides a new stop codon and tags potentially harmful truncated peptides for rapid degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Moore and Sauer, 2007</xref>); this, in turn, feeds amino acid pools [see Discussions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gerdes <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Condon (2006)</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>kis&#x02013;kid</italic> antitoxin&#x02013;toxin system of plasmid R1 codes for an unstable antitoxin Kis and a stable toxin Kid. Kid, like RelE, is also a specific endoribonuclease and an inhibitor of translation, but unlike RelE, Kid can cleave RNA in the absence of ribosomes and does so at the core sequence UA(A/C) preferentially but not exclusively in single-stranded regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Munoz-Gomez <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Cleavage occurs by a mechanism similar to the RNase A and RNase T1, involving the Uracyl 2&#x02032;-OH group and producing two fragments, with a 2&#x02032;:3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate group at the uracyl and a free 5&#x02032;-OH group at the adenosine respectively. Cleavage of RNA in the absence of ribosomes can also introduce non-stop mRNA in the translation machinery, a proposal that is consistent with the increased sensitivity to the Kid toxin observed in tmRNA-deficient strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Munoz-Gomez, 2004</xref>).</p><p>While searching for <italic>E. coli</italic> mutations affecting the toxic activity of the Kid protein, we developed a genetic screen that was based on the selection of bacteria that could survive in the presence of a mutant <italic>parD</italic> locus encoding a functional Kid toxin and a truncated and inactive antitoxin resulting from an amber termination mutation in the <italic>kis</italic> antitoxin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bravo <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>). As a consequence, the isolation of suppressors leading to the efficient bypass of the amber mutation in <italic>kis</italic> was one anticipated response. Unexpectedly, however, these mutations were found to be novel and to be exclusively targeted to the <italic>prfA</italic> gene encoding the RF1 protein. Our work reported here shows that these mutations reveal novel functional connections between the activity of bacterial toxins and translation termination factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of novel <italic>prfA</italic> mutants in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>Our work was initially focused on a search for <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants resistant to the cytotoxic activity of Kid. For this purpose, we used a double selection approach inspired by the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bernard and Couturier (1992)</xref>, which led to the isolation of mutations in the <italic>gyrA</italic> gene encoding the A subunit of DNA gyrase, the bacterial target of the CcdB toxin. Two compatible plasmids were employed, pKK1120 and pAB1120, that confer resistance to tetracycline and kanamycin, respectively, and which both contain the mutant <italic>parD</italic> operon <italic>kis74</italic> (amber), <italic>kid</italic>+ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In the absence of suppression of the <italic>kis74</italic> mutation, an inactive form of the Kis antitoxin is produced, thus leading to a Kid-dependent inhibition of colony formation. In a first round of selection, <italic>E. coli</italic> cells treated with the mutagen 2-aminopurine were transformed with the pKK1120 plasmid and cultured in medium containing tetracycline. To enrich for potential Kid-resistant mutants, a second round of selection was carried out by transforming the cells with the pAB1120 plasmid and plating on medium supplemented with kanamycin. To discard possible mutations affecting either the <italic>kid</italic> gene itself or its regulatory elements present in the plasmid, the toxicity of the resident plasmids was assessed by extracting the plasmid DNA and retransforming fresh wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Mutants that exhibited growth despite containing a toxic plasmid were kept for further characterization.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Plasmids used and constructed in this work.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Plasmid</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Relevant features</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pAB1120</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">R1, <italic>copB</italic><sup>-</sup>, <italic>parD</italic>[<italic>kis74</italic>, <italic>kid</italic>(<italic>wt</italic>)], <italic>kan</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bravo <italic>et al.</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pKK1120</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pACYC184-derivative plasmid, parD [<italic>kis74</italic>, <italic>kid</italic>(<italic>wt</italic>)], <italic>tet</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">This work</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pBAD18</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pBR322-derivative expression vector, <italic>amp</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Guzman <italic>et al</italic>.

To refine the genetic mapping of the mutations, the mutant strains were used as recipients in P1 transduction experiments performed using different donor strains bearing Tn<italic>10</italic> transposon insertions at regular intervals between minutes 22 and 32 on the chromosome. For one of the mutants we observed that the pAB1120-resistance phenotype was lost at high frequency upon transduction from a donor containing the Tn<italic>10</italic> at position 26.61 min. In order to isolate the mutant gene, fragments of the chromosome of the mutant strain (hereafter the KR19 strain), generated by partial Sau3A restriction digestion, were cloned into a low-copy-number mini-F, pMLM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lemonnier <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were transformed with this library, pooled and subsequently transformed with the pAB1120 plasmid. Mini-F plasmids carrying fragments that conferred resistance to pAB1120 were isolated and their chromosomal insert sequenced. All the sequenced fragments consisted in a chromosomal region enclosing the <italic>prfA</italic> gene encoding polypeptide release factor RF1. The localization of this gene at 27.2 min in the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome was consistent with the results of the Hfr mapping. Subsequently, the sequencing of the <italic>prfA</italic> region of KR19 and of several independent mutants isolated by this approach revealed that in all cases mutations in the <italic>prfA</italic> gene could be detected. Four independent mutants, hereafter called KR2, KR4, KR17 and KR19, were kept for subsequent studies. Sequencing analysis revealed that the mutations consisted of single-base G-C or A-T transitions, as expected from a 2-aminopurine mutagenic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Ronen, 1980</xref>). Strains KR2 and KR19 were found to bear the same mutation, <italic>prfA301</italic>, which led to a Gly to Ser amino acid change at position 301 of RF1. Strain KR4 carried the mutation <italic>prfA303</italic>, in which an Arg has changed to Ser at position 303 of RF1. Finally, KR17 strain carried the mutation <italic>prfA121</italic>, a Gly to Ser change at position 121 of RF1.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>prfA</italic> mutants are unable to complement a <italic>prfA(ts)</italic> mutation unless they are overexpressed</title><p>To assess whether the isolated <italic>prfA</italic> mutants were affected in their translation termination activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed a complementation assay using a conditional temperature-sensitive <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant, MRA8 <italic>prfA1(ts)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Ryden and Isaksson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>).

In the assay system, the RF2 frameshift window is fused to the <italic>malE</italic> gene, expressed from a plasmid. Termination and +1 frameshifting lead to proteins of 43.9 and 52.0 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>), that are separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and detected by Western blotting, binding of anti-MalE antibody and interaction with <sup>125</sup>I-labelled Protein A.

Termination rate at UAGA and UAGU stop signals is expressed relative to +1 frameshifting in a frameshift window derived from the RF2 frameshift site. The quantity of RF1 in mutant strains, measured by reaction with anti-RF1 antibodies, is expressed as a percentage of that found in the parental strain MC1061.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Two mechanisms might explain this result: the mutations may affect the folding or stability of RF1, resulting in a strongly reduced amount of RF1 in the cell. Alternatively, the activity of the protein may be reduced compared with that of the normal factor. To resolve this question, the amount of RF1 present in the <italic>prfA</italic> mutant strains was compared with the parental strain by quantitative Western blotting using anti-RF1 antibodies. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, row 4) showed that the reduction in the amount of RF1 in the mutant strains was quite modest (15&#x02013;20%), insufficient to explain the 10-fold drop in termination rate in the cells; the major part in this drop must therefore be due to reduced activity of the mutant factors.</p><p>The small decrease in the amount of RF1 found in the mutant strains suggested that the mutant factors were not strikingly less stable than the wild-type factor. This conclusion might however be invalid if an autocontrol mechanism were present in cells, with the consequence that a lowered peptide release activity were to lead to a higher rate of synthesis of the RF. Such an autocontrol mechanism does exist in the case of RF2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> and in about 70% of microorganisms for which genome sequences are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baranov <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), based on the competition between termination and frameshifting that we have used to assay termination efficiency. The <italic>prfA</italic> gene is expressed from the promoter of the upstream gene, <italic>hemA</italic>. It has been suggested that <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> may possess a mechanism for the autocontrol of RF1 synthesis, dependent upon readthrough of the weak UAGC tetranucleotide stop signal of the <italic>hemA</italic> gene, coupled with a suboptimal ribosome binding site for <italic>prfA</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Elliott, 1989</xref>). The hypothesis suggests that RF1 synthesis may result to a significant extent from ribosomes that read through the <italic>hemA</italic> stop signal, translate the intergenic region, terminate just short of the <italic>prfA</italic> initiation codon and resume translation without dissociating from mRNA. To test this hypothesis, we constructed translational fusions with <italic>lacZ</italic> extending from the promoter region of <italic>hemA</italic> to codon 13 of <italic>prfA</italic>, analogous to those described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dahlgren and Ryden-Aulin (2004)</xref>, and studied the effect on &#x003b2;-galactosidase synthesis of mutating the <italic>hemA</italic> stop signal or introducing mutations in RF1. The results showed that even in the case of the RF1 mutants described in this article, little RF1 is in fact synthesized in <italic>E. coli</italic> by the proposed readthrough mechanism (L. Mora, unpubl. data). These results further confirm that the detected levels of the RF1 mutants reflect a minor effect on stability and therefore that the isolated mutations do not affect substantially the stability of RF1.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>prfA</italic> mutation leads to hypersensitivity to Kid and RelE toxins</title><p>Since RF1 was shown to protect from RNA cleavage by the RelE toxin <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), we hypothesized that the mutant RF1 strains should be particularly responsive to the activity of RelE <italic>in vivo</italic>. For this analysis we selected the <italic>prfA</italic> mutant KR19 as this mutant showed the lowest overall termination efficiency in the assays (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We produced the RelE protein in this mutated <italic>prfA</italic> strain and compared the levels of cytotoxicity with those achieved in a wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> background. To gain insight into the mechanism of RF1-dependent protection, we performed a parallel control experiment in which the Kid toxin was produced in place of RelE. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref> shows the cytotoxic effects of both Kid and RelE proteins over the wild type, MC1061, and the mutant strain KR19 bearing the plasmids pNDM220 (vector), pELI06 (<italic>kid</italic>) or pELI07 (<italic>relE</italic>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4A and D</xref> shows that the growth of the strains in the absence of induction of the toxins is unaffected. The partial induction of toxins Kid or RelE with a less-than-saturating concentration of IPTG (100 &#x003bc;M) inhibited cell growth in <italic>prfA</italic> mutant strains but not in the wild-type strain MC1061 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>, rows 4 and 6 compared with rows 3 and 5). This suggested that KR19 was hypersensitive to both toxins.

Protection by the RF1wt protein in this assay was less efficient, which is likely a reflection of the more specific interaction of a toxin with its cognate antitoxin (data not shown).

This phenomenon, detected both in growth and in protein synthesis assays, and the suppression of this sensitivity by the overproduction of prfAwt <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed an unexpected confluence in the pathway of action of these two toxins. Previous reports showed that the RelE toxin acts as an endoribonuclease in concerted action with the ribosome to cleave at the UAG termination codon at the A site of the ribosome, thus leading to translation inhibition. Consistent with this it was found that RF1 prevents RNA cleavage by this toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). RelE seems to have a shape similar to the C-terminal region of translation elongation factor EF-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Takagi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), which could explain its access to the UAG codon in the A site of the ribosome. The protection conferred by RF1 against the action of RelE likely reflects a competition for the same substrate. The mutations could affect this competition ultimately favouring the action of the toxin. A similar explanation could account for the extra-sensitivity of the <italic>prfA</italic> mutant to paromomycin and other aminoglycosides, which interact with the 30S subunit of the ribosome at a region overlapping with the site of interaction of RF1. Paromomycin binding to 30S ribosomes directly displaces A1492 and A1493 from 16S rRNA helix 44 to a bulged-out state characteristic of ribosomes containing cognate tRNA in the A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Ogle <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). The modes of binding of kanamycin and gentamicin to the ribosome are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Francois <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The extrahelical position of A1493 sterically impedes RF1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Laurberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), explaining the competitive inhibition of termination by paromomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Youngman <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). These aminoglycosides therefore introduce perturbations into the same region of the decoding site as the RF1 mutations we describe here, suggesting that the increased sensitivity of the mutant strains to the antibiotics is due to an accumulation of factors interfering with stop codon recognition by RFs.</p><p>Unlike RelE, the Kid and ChpAK (MazF) toxins are able to cleave RNA in the absence of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Munoz-Gomez <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2005</xref>) following a mechanism similar to the one described for RNase A and RNase T1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Christensen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kamphuis <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Since the structure of the Kid protein is clearly different from that of RelE, similarities in their mechanisms to access the A site of the ribosome seem unlikely. It is noteworthy however that the Kid toxin can cleave the minimal substrate UpA which is part of the termination codon UAG/A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kamphuis <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). It remains to be seen if the hypersensitivity to Kid observed in the <italic>prfA</italic> mutants could be due to interactions between Kid and RF1, which remain to be elucidated. Alternatively, in view of the fact that reduced activity of the RF1 can induce ribosome stalling at the stop codon and subsequent mRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), the increased toxicity of the <italic>prfA</italic> mutants to the Kid toxin could also be due to an enhancement of this stalling. Whatever the mechanism, it seems clear that the increased sensitivity of the <italic>prfA</italic> mutants to aminoglycosides and to the Kid and RelE toxins is an specific effect of these mutations rather than the unspecific consequence of a general stress on translation induced by them. This result provided the first evidence for the involvement of RF1 in the pathway of Kid toxicity.</p><p>The new <italic>prfA</italic> mutants contributed to showing that a post-transcriptional mechanism is not involved in maintaining the levels of the RF1 in the cells. The mutants could be used to further explore the contribution of new residues close to the RF decoding region in the recognition of the termination codons and/or in the transmission of the signal that activates the transpeptidase of RF1 at the PTC distal site. In addition, the experiments reported provide the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for a functional interaction between the RelE toxin and the RF1 protein. Furthermore, evidence is provided for a role of translation termination factors in the cytotoxicity pathway of the Kid toxin. The results in turn reveal an unexpected functional confluence between two distinct families of bacterial toxins, namely the RelE and Kid families. Similarities and differences in these pathways remain to be fully established. The hypersensitivity of the <italic>prfA</italic> mutants to the RelE and Kid toxins also opens the possibility of exploring their effects on other toxins belonging to the <italic>kis&#x02013;kid/ccd</italic> and the <italic>relBE/parDE</italic> superfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gerdes <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). These include toxins targeting DNA gyrase such as CcdB and ParE in addition to toxins which acts on RNA as Kid and RelE. In theory it can be anticipated that the <italic>prfA</italic> mutants should also be extra-sensitive to the RNase-type toxins of the family but not to the toxins targeting the DNA Gyrase. Finally, the results and methods reported here provide a rationale for the design of screening approaches to isolate inhibitors of RF1 activity. Such compounds would likely potentiate the antibacterial activity of TA systems. Most interestingly, some antibiotics have been reported to specifically activate TA systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Sat <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). In this respect as well, compound drugs inhibiting RF1 activity would be particularly appealing as they would provide a back-up induction of TA toxicity in antibiotic-resistant strains. Novel therapeutic alternatives against drug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed and the work reported here certainly opens new avenues towards that goal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacteria strains</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 strains used in this work are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="tbl4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Strains used in this work.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genotype</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BL21 (DE3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F<sup>-</sup><italic>ompT hsdS</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> (rB<sup>-</sup> mB<sup>-</sup>) <italic>gal dcm</italic>&#x003bb;DE3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Novagen</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MC1061</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F<sup>-</sup><italic>araD139 galE15 galK16 rpsL hsdR2</italic> (rK&#x02212; mK+) <italic>mcrA mcrB1</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>E. coli</italic> Genetic Stock Center</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KR19 (KR2)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MC1061 <italic>prfA301</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">This work</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KR4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MC1061 <italic>prfA303</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">This work</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KR17</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MC1061 <italic>prfA121</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">This work</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MRA8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>prfA1(ts)</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.
