Several studies have helped identify major RAS effector molecules which include the Raf kinases, class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Ral-GEFs), Rac exchange factor Tiam1, and phospholipase C&#x003b5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Repasky1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Balmanno1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The RAF kinases, members of the three-component MAP Kinase cascade, once activated by GTP-bound RAS, phosphorylate and activate dual-specificity kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which in-turn activate MAP Kinases ERK1 and ERK2. Active ERK1/2 then translocates to the nucleus to exert their biological effects. PIK3CA, a PI3K family member stimulated through RAS activation, phosphorylates its lipid substrate phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate (PIP3). This phosphorylated lipid PIP3 is an important cellular second messenger that promotes the activation of AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) leading to cell survival.</p><p>Besides mutations in RAS, activating somatic mutations in its effectors PIK3CA and BRAF, occur in various human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Bader1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Dhomen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. While PIK3CA mutations are more prevalent in colon and breast cancer, BRAF mutation occurs at a high frequency in melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Bader1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Dhomen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, loss-of-function of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, which leads to activation of PI3-kinase, is widespread in cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Rossi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Functional studies that dissect PIK3CA and BRAF somatic mutations have established the oncogenic nature of these RAS effector genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Samuels1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Zhao1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, these studies show that each effector arm on its own when activated is sufficient to promote tumor formation, especially, in tumor types where they are commonly mutated. Interestingly, BRAF mutations are mutually exclusive with NRAS mutations in melanoma and KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Dhomen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Ollikainen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Velho1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

The patterns of mutational co-occurrence, suggests that each RAS-effector is differentially employed in promoting tumor initiation in a tumor tissue specific manner. A recent study using an engineered mouse model showed the importance of intact signaling via the PI3K RAS-effector arm for initiation of lung tumors in a RAS-mutant mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Gupta1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, in engineered human skin graft mouse models, the PI3K effector arm was found to be equivalent to RAS in inducing melanocytic neoplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Chudnovsky1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Another study, using engineered cell lines that express various RAS-mutants that can preferentially engage either RAF, PI3K or RalGEF showed that while all three were important for tumor initiation, the PI3K pathway was essential for tumor maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Lim1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Pharmacological inhibitors that target RAS effectors, RAF and PI3Ks, are in various stages of clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Schreck1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Haluska1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

The colon cancer cell line HCT116, in addition to KRAS mutation, also harbors an activating mutation in the RAS effector PIK3CA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005717.s003">Table S1</xref>). In order to understand the relevance of oncogenic RAS and its dependence on its major downstream effectors, RAF and PI3K, we used a previously described doxycycline (dox)-inducible shRNA system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Gray1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> to study the effects of RAS knockdown on cellular proliferation and tumor growth. We generated pools of cells expressing shRNAs that target RAS in a dox-inducible fashion. Upon dox treatment RAS, KRAS in HCT116 and NRAS in IPC298, was effectively silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with the loss of signaling from RAS, the levels of phospho ERK decreased in both the RAS mutant lines, relative to the total ERK in these lines. In addition to loss of phosphoERK levels, RAS knock-down in both IPC298 and HCT116 cells led to a decrease in the phospho AKT levels. Phospho AKT levels were reduced in KRAS knock-down HCT116 cells despite the presence of PIK3CA mutation in this line. In both lines the control luciferase shRNA-expressing cells upon dox induction did not show any changes in either the phospho or the total ERK levels. Similarly, the phospho and total AKT levels were not modulated significantly in these cells following dox addition. To determine the requirement of RAS in these RAS-mutant cancer lines for cellular proliferation, we studied these lines for growth following induction of shRNAs that target NRAS or KRAS. We found that, consistent with the loss of downstream signaling following abrogation of KRAS in HCT116 and NRAS in IPC298, cell proliferation was reduced by 40&#x00025; and 60&#x00025; respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We found a similar trend in proliferation with a second shRNA that targeted KRAS or NRAS in these lines (data not shown). Compared to the RAS knock-down lines, the luciferase control lines showed no effect on proliferation following dox induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition to the effect seen on proliferation, RAS knock down led to a 5-6-fold decrease in anchorage-independent growth in both the HCT116 and IPC298 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). These results demonstrate that both lines were dependent on RAS, KRAS in HCT116 and NRAS in IPC298, for their proliferation and anchorage-independent growth.

We sought to examine the contribution of these two arms in tumor growth and progression. In addition to elucidating the role of these two RAS-effector arms in cancer, this knowledge should provide insight into targeting RAS-driven tumors. We therefore generated pools of either HCT116 or IPC298 cells harboring inducible shRNAs that target, BRAF, CRAF, MEK1, MEK2 and PIK3CA either singly or in various combinations within the same line. We then tested these lines for <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth.</p><p>HCT116-BRAF knockdown line, upon dox treatment showed reduction in BRAF protein levels and a concomitant decrease in phospho ERK levels relative to the total ERK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, HCT116-PIK3CA knockdown lines when treated with dox showed a reduction in the levels of PIK3CA and a decrease in phospho AKT compared to the control un-induced cells. In proliferation studies, both the dox treated PIK3CA knockdown and BRAF knockdown HCT116 lines showed a 20&#x02013;25&#x00025; reduction in proliferation compared to non-dox treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

These results are consistent with the fact that the mutant PIK3CA in HCT116 did not functionally substitute for KRAS in experiments where KRAS was silenced, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g001">Figure 1B and 1F</xref>). In contrast to knock-down of PIK3CA in HCT116, nude mice bearing subcutaneous tumors resulting from injected HCT116 BRAF-inducible shRNAs cells, when treated with dox showed a delay in tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The delay was not statistically significant, in part due to the outlier tumor volumes observed towards the end of this study. However, this could also be in part due to the fact that the oncogenic RAS could engage other RAF family members like CRAF and continue to promote tumor growth and survival. To fully evaluate the contributions of the RAF arm that could result from engagement of other RAFs, we generated HCT116 inducible shRNA knock-down lines where we conditionally silenced CRAF or both CRAF and BRAF together. As expected, knock-down of BRAF and CRAF together decreased pMEK level completely, while knock-down of CRAF alone showed some residual pMEK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with this finding, the BRAF/CRAF double knock-down line showed a decrease in pERK levels while the CRAF knock-down alone did not substantially affect pERK levels <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, knock-down of either CRAF or BRAF and CRAF together decreased pAKT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In proliferation studies, CRAF knock-down lines showed a &#x0223c;25&#x00025; decrease in proliferation, while the combined CRAF and BRAF knock down had &#x0223c;40&#x00025; reduction in proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

Although not as significant as the dual RAF knock-down, CRAF knock-down alone significantly delayed tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). These results suggest that KRAS in HCT116 cells engages both CRAF and BRAF for promoting tumor growth with CRAF being the dominant effector arm.</p><fig id="pone-0005717-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005717.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Effect of BRAF and PIK3CA knock-down on KRAS<sup>G13D</sup> mutant HCT116 cell growth.</title><p>(A) Western blot analysis of PIK3CA or BRAF knock-down in HCT116 at 72 h post dox induction of relevant shRNAs.

We tested these lines <italic>in vitro</italic> for their ability to proliferate in the presence or absence of dox and found that the MEK1, MEK2 and MEK1&#x0002b;2 double lines showed &#x0223c;15&#x00025;, &#x0223c;20&#x00025; and &#x0223c;30&#x00025; reduction in proliferation respectively, compared to untreated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests that loss of each isoform of MEK has an effect on its own, while the combined knock-down has the most effect on proliferation. We tested the MEK-knock-down HCT116 lines <italic>in vivo</italic> for tumor growth in nude mice and found that silencing both MEK1 and MEK2 together led to a significant delay in tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g003">Figure 3G</xref>), compared to targeting them individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). To confirm this further we tested a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK on HCT116 cells and found that it is effective in delaying tumor growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005717.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These results suggest that in the KRAS mutant HCT116 colon cancer cells, the RAF/MEK/ERK effector arm is necessary for cellular proliferation and tumor growth, despite the presence of activating mutation in PIK3CA.</p><p>We extended these studies to the NRAS mutant melanoma IPC298 cells. Given that BRAF is more commonly mutated in melanomas, we hypothesized that targeting the BRAF effector arm alone would be sufficient to affect cell proliferation and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth. To test this, we generated a stable pool of IPC298 cells harboring an inducible BRAF shRNA. Upon BRAF shRNA induction, we observed a significant decrease in the BRAF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> the BRAF-shRNA expressing IPC298 cells showed a &#x0223c;20&#x00025; decrease in proliferation upon dox treatment relative to the uninduced control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic>, we found that BRAF silencing did not show a statistically significant delay in IPC298 tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This is contrary to our initial hypothesis about BRAF playing a dominant role in tumor cell signaling in melanomas bearing an NRAS mutation. The lack of efficacy in IPC298 cells following BRAF knock-down could be the result of mutant RAS engaging other RAF family member like CRAF. To address this, we generated and tested IPC298 pools that inducibly expressed shRNAs targeting CRAF alone or BRAF and CRAF in combination. Upon induction of corresponding shRNA in these cells, CRAF or BRAF and CRAF proteins were completely depleted leading to a decrease in pMEK and pERK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). As with BRAF, knock-down of CRAF also decreased <italic>in vitro</italic> cell proliferation by &#x0223c;20&#x00025;. We found double knock-down of both BRAF and CRAF to be far more effective leading to a &#x0223c;50&#x00025; reduction in cell proliferation compared to the uninduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Similar to the effects observed with BRAF knock-down, silencing CRAF alone did not show a statistically significant delay in IPC298 tumor growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, mice bearing IPC298 co-expressing BRAF and CRAF shRNA showed complete inhibition of tumor growth following dox induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). These data indicate that the NRAS mutant IPC298 melanoma line engages both the BRAF and CRAF effector arms for survival and proliferation and that targeting both BRAF and CRAF is important for efficacy. Further, both pERK and pAKT levels are decreased only when both BRAF and CRAF are knocked down together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that signaling from both the RAF and PI3K effectors need to be inhibited for efficacy.</p><fig id="pone-0005717-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005717.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>BRAF/CRAF double-knock-down delays growth of NRAS<sup>Q61L</sup>-mutant IPC298 melanoma cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</title><p>(A&#x02013;B) Western blot analysis showing BRAF, CRAF, BRAF&#x0002b;CRAF, MEK1, MEK2, and double MEK1/2 knock-down in IPC298 at 72 h after dox induction of shRNAs.

We generated and tested IPC298 pools that inducibly expressed shRNAs that target RAF-effectors MEK1 or MEK2 or both MEK1 and MEK2 together in the same cells. The targeted knock-down of MEK1 or MEK2 alone or a combined MEK1 and MEK2 knock-down reduced the levels of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The pERK levels were also decreased in these cells compared to control untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In all the MEK-shRNA containing IPC298 lines, <italic>in vitro</italic> we did not observe a significant difference in proliferation between the control and dox-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, silencing MEK1 or MEK 2 alone or in combination, did not show a significant delay in tumor growth relative to the control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). This result was unexpected given that CRAF and BRAF targeting was effective, suggesting potential differential survival and proliferation signaling outputs resulting from inhibition of different nodes along the RAS/RAF pathway. Consistent with this, we find pAKT levels to be unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) in the MEK1/2 double knock-down line, although pERK was decreased. This is in contrast to decreases in both the pAKT and pERK levels observed with the BRAF/CRAF double knock-down lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Further, this is a likely reason for the lack of efficacy observed in the combined MEK1/2 knock-down as compared to BRAF/CRAF double knock-down. Although the exact cross talk and feedback mechanism leading to the differential modulation of pAKT and pERK in response to knock-down of the various RAF and RAF-effectors is not obvious, this data indicates the requirement for targeting signaling from both ERK and AKT effectors in NRAS mutant lines.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Combined targeting of RAF and PI3K, RAS-effector arms effectively reduces tumor growth in NRAS mutant tumors</title><p>Given the observed requirement for decrease in both pERK and pAKT downstream of mutant NRAS and the intense efforts to develop inhibitors targeting BRAF, MEK1/2 and PI3K in progress, we sought to understand if combined knock-down of RAF or MEK with PI3K would be an effective strategy for treatment of NRAS mutant melanomas.</p><p>Induction of shRNA targeting PIK3CA alone reduced the levels of PIK3CA, leading to a reduction in the pAKT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

These cells were characterized for effective knock-down of BRAF, MEKs and PIK3CA. As expected, upon dox treatment the cells showed reduced BRAF, PIK3CA or MEK1 and 2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with this, pERK and pAKT levels were diminished, relative to the total amount of ERK and AKT respectively. It is interesting to note that while BRAF or PIK3CA knock-down alone did not affect pERK levels significantly, the combined knock-down of BRAF and PIK3CA led to significant decrease in pERK and pAKT. We studied these cells in proliferation assays and found that there was a &#x0223c;25&#x02013;30&#x00025; decrease in proliferation when both BRAF and PIK3CA or the RAF-effectors MEK1, 2 and PIK3CA together were knocked down in the IPC298 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

examined the effect of targeting these genes on cell cycle progression. In all these knock-down cells, targeting the expression of these proteins led to an accumulation in G1 or S-phase, leading to delay in G2/M progression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005717-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g008">Figure 8</xref>). These results suggest that targeting RAS and its downstream effector RAFs and the RAF-effectors MEK1&#x0002b;2 are mechanistically equivalent in KRAS mutant HCT116 cells. This is consistent with the fact that targeting RAS, BRAF, CRAF, BRAF&#x0002b;CRAF or MEK1&#x0002b;2 in HCT116 resulted in decreased proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and delayed tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth data, knock-down of BRAF, MEK1/2, and PIK3CA in IPC298 cells did not delay cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005717-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, knock-down of BRAF&#x0002b;CRAF, BRAF&#x0002b;PIK3CA, and MEK1/2&#x0002b;PIK3CA in IPC298 cells led to accumulation of cells in S or G1-phase consistent with the adverse effect on tumor growth observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To further dissect the mechanisms by which RAS targeting affects cell proliferation and delays tumor growth we tested the cells following RAS-targeting for apoptosis by annexin-V staining. As shown in Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005717-g002">Figure 2</xref>, at the time-point observed, no increase in annexin-V staining was detected following RAS-knock-down in RAS-mutated IPC298 and HCT116 cells. However, BRAF knock-down in HCT116 showed a slight increase in annexin-V staining compared to the un-induced line, whereas all the other knock-down lines did not show an in increase in annexin-V staining following dox treatment. These data indicate that inhibition of cell proliferation and tumor growth upon RAS or a downstream RAS-effector knock-down is mainly due to delayed cell cycle progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding the relative importance of oncogenic RAS effectors in tumor formation is fundamental to targeting RAS driven tumors using combinations of pharmacological inhibitors that are either available or in development. In this study we have addressed the relative importance of the RAS-effectors, RAF and PI3K, in a RAS mutant context in human tumor lines both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> using a regulatable RNA interference system. We show that HCT116 colon tumor cells bearing an oncogenic KRAS<sup>G13D</sup> mutation, IPC298 melanoma cells carrying an activated allele of NRAS<sup>Q61L</sup> and SK-MEL-30 carrying a mutant NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup> allele are dependent on the RAS pathway for their growth and proliferation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Knock-down of these RAS alleles <italic>in vivo</italic> leads to a significant delay in tumor growth and is consistent with the cell cycle arrest observed in the knock-down line <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is in agreement with a previous study in nude mice that demonstrated the requirement of mutant RAS for tumor formation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Lim1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Shirasawa1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. To address the relevance of the effector arms of RAS in tumor maintenance and growth, we targeted the major RAS effectors RAF and PI3K using an inducible shRNA system. In HCT116, a colon cancer line, that carries a mutant KRAS allele, we find that interfering with the RAF effector axis at the level of RAF (BRAF and CRAF) and MEK (MEK1 and MEK2) was effective in delaying tumor growth. In contrast, there was no effect on tumor growth and maintenance when PIK3CA alone was knocked down, despite the fact that PIK3CA is mutated in this line. It is possible that in HCT116 cells, RAS could engage other PI3K family members to promote tumor growth. This is unlikely as pAKT levels are reduced following PIK3CA knock-down indicating that PIK3CA is the major PI3K isoform engaged by RAS in these cells. Further, this data suggest that the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade is predominantly engaged by KRAS in these cancer cells for growth and proliferation. In HCT116 cells, knock-in mutations that revert the mutant PIK3CA to WT affects it ability to proliferate, migrate and metastasize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Samuels1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> data an HCT116 PIK3CA wild type line generated by knocking-in a copy of the WT PIK3CA in place of the mutant PIK3CA, did not block the knock-in revertant line's ability to form sub-cutaneous tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Samuels1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, recently a study of colon cancer patients showed that PIK3CA mutations did not confer any significant effect on mortality among patients with KRAS-mutated tumors and is consistent with our findings on tumors growth in HCT116 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Ogino1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. These data taken together with our findings suggest that, in the colon cancer line, KRAS predominantly engages the RAF-MEK-ERK effector arm. This is in contrast to studies in other tumor types where the PIK3CA pathway is shown to be sufficient for tumor initiation and maintenance.</p><p>Our data shows that effective targeting of mutant NRAS driven tumor requires sustained reduction in pAKT and pERK. This can be achieved either by combined targeting of BRAF and CRAF, PIK3CA and BRAF or PIK3CA and MEK1&#x0002b;2. However, inhibition of MEK1&#x0002b;2 alone in the NRAS mutant line was not equivalent to inhibiting BRAF and CRAF together, as assessed by pERK and pAKT, suggesting the presence of differential signaling and feedback effects that arise from perturbing different nodes along the RAS/RAF signaling cascade. This is consistent with previously reported feedback and cross talk between the RAF and PI3K pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Menges1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. These results have implications for therapeutic targeting of NRAS mutant melanomas where a dual BRAF/CRAF inhibitor or a BRAF and a PIK3CA inhibitor or a MEK and a PIK3CA inhibitor in combination is likely to show efficacy in the clinic. It is interesting to note that several studies also suggest the relevance of combined inhibition of CRAF and BRAF in a BRAF mutant context for efficacy and may prove to be relevant strategy for treatment of both NRAS and BRAF mutant melanomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Montagut1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005717-Smalley2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our data suggests that the pathways engaged by mutant RAS that promote tumor formation show differences that are possibly inherent to each tissue or tumor type. Further investigation of the RAS-effector arms engaged within each tumor type may reveal differences that correlate with known tumor subtypes or form the basis for a better molecular classification of tumor subtypes. In the clinical context, understanding the specific effector arms engaged by RAS in driving tumorigenesis is critical to successfully treating these cancers. Developing gene signatures that allow identification and classification of tumors into RAS effector classes, based on effectors engaged by RAS, should allow for rational patient therapies that utilize appropriate pharmacological inhibitors either alone or in combination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and antibodies</title><p>Colon cancer cell line HCT116 was purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA).
