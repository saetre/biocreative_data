This is especially true for the development of the highly ordered, laminar retina. The vertebrate retina develops from a pseudostratified multipotent neuroepithelium from which all seven cell classes differentiate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The neurons of the differentiated retina are organized into three layers that form synapses in two plexiform strata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The inner most layer, the ganglion cell layer, consists primarily of ganglion cells while the middle inner nuclear layer is comprised of amacrine, bipolar, horizontal and M&#x000fc;ller glial cells. The outer nuclear layer contains rod and cone photoreceptors and is adjacent to the retinal pigmented epithelium.</p><p>During retinal development, cell cycle regulation and neurogenesis are tightly linked by developmental time and through reciprocal influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The first cells to exit the cell cycle are ganglion cells, followed by distinct but temporally overlapping waves of differentiating inner and outer nuclear layer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Both intrinsic and extrinsic cellular mechanisms have been shown to be important for regulating cell cycle exit and neurogenesis in the nervous system, but the relative importance of each is not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For example, the transcription factor Ath5 is expressed in a wave-like fashion across the neuroepithelium, immediately proceeding cell cycle exit and differentiation of ganglion cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Ath5 expression has been shown to be regulated by intrinsic mechanisms as well as through extrinsic cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Loss- and gain-of-function studies have shown that Ath5 is necessary for ganglion cell genesis, but not sufficient to force progenitor cells out of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These observations suggest that additional pathways are required for promoting cell cycle exit and neurogenesis. In addition, other investigators have shown that mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle have direct influence on neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. For example, selectively lengthening G1-phase of the cell cycle in cortical progenitor cells promotes cell cycle exit and neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, Calegari et al., 2005 have shown that neuroepithelial cells committed to divide neurogenically, where at least one daughter cell withdraws from the mitotic cycle, have longer cell cycle periods than progenitors that will remain symmetrically proliferative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These data depict the complex interactions that regulate the cell cycle and neurogenesis, as well as exemplify the direct effects that the cell cycle has on neurogenesis.</p><p>Here we report the phenotypic analysis of the <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutation which exhibits defects in cell cycle regulation and neurogenesis in the developing retina. Histological and cell marker analyses reveal that although the retina is small and differentiation is delayed, all cell types are generated. In mutant retinal cells, expression of the proneural factor Ath5 and the early post-mitotic neuronal marker HuC initiate on time; however, the cell cycle period is extended and the proportion of progenitors that exit the cell cycle is reduced. Interestingly, genetic mosaic studies show that <italic>disarrayed </italic>is cell-non-autonomous for defects in cell cycle withdrawal. Our data suggest that the <italic>disarrayed </italic>gene product has an essential role in regulation of the cell cycle in retinal neuroepithelia. In addition, analysis of this mutant offers insights into extrinsic influences and the relationships between cell cycle regulation and neurogenesis during retinal development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutation delays retinal histogenesis, but is not essential for cell-type fate determination</title><p>The <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutant was identified as a recessive lethal mutation from an ENU mutagenesis screen for retinal development phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Mendelian inheritance in multiple genetic backgrounds strongly suggest the <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutation is caused by alterations to a single locus. Mutant embryos can be identified at 42 hours post fertilization (hpf) by small eyes and forebrain when compared to wild-type siblings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Other aspects of development appear normal including body size and shape, otic vesicles, heart formation, pigmentation, and touch responses; however, a swim bladder does not form and mutant larvae die between 8 to 12 days post fertilization (dpf).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Delayed retinal lamination in <italic>disarrayed </italic>eyes</bold>.

For example, by 48 hpf, wild-type embryos have established the inner plexiform layer while synapse formation in the inner plexiform layer of <italic>disarrayed </italic>embryos was just initiating in the ventral-most region of the retina (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,C</xref>). As development continued, mutant eyes showed morphological differentiation for all the retinal cells types and formed the inner and outer plexiform layers by 96 hpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;G</xref>). Although photoreceptors were generated and positioned in the correct location, differentiation was discontinuous and outer segment formation appeared abnormal and stunted. Lens growth and other aspects of ocular anterior segment morphogenesis were normal in mutants.</p><p>To confirm cellular differentiation and correct laminar positioning, markers for specific retinal cell-types were analyzed. Antibodies that recognize ganglion cells, amacrine cells, and cone photoreceptors, retinal cells from all three layers, showed differentiation and appropriate laminar positioning in <italic>disarrayed </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>). Analysis of markers for other cell-types also showed appropriate cell-type patterning. These studies included mRNA in situ hybridizations for <italic>vsx-2 </italic>(bipolar cells), <italic>c-ret </italic>(amacrine and horizontal cells) and <italic>rhodopsin</italic>, <italic>ultra violet</italic>, <italic>blue</italic>, <italic>red</italic>, and <italic>green </italic>opsins (rod and cone photoreceptors) (data not shown). Furthermore, immunoreactivity for SV2, a synaptic vesicle marker, showed accumulation in the inner plexiform layer of both wild-type and <italic>disarrayed </italic>retinas. However, the outer plexiform layer in mutants showed significantly reduced staining. This reduction of SV2-immunoreactivity in the outer plexiform layer is consistent with the observed photoreceptor dysmorphogenesis. Overall, histological and marker analyses demonstrated that although significantly delayed, cell-type determination, laminar patterning, and synaptogenesis occur in the <italic>disarrayed </italic>retina.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Retinal cell-type marker analysis in <italic>disarrayed </italic>eyes</bold>.

To assess the proliferative state of mutant cells, the S-phase marker 5-bromo-2'- deoxyuridine (BrdU) was utilized. BrdU was injected into wild-type or mutant embryos, 1 hour prior to fixation, at three developmental time points: 48, 72 and 96 hpf. This method labels all cells that are in S-phase and therefore will mark proliferative progenitor cells. In wild-type embryos, retinal neuroepithelial cells begin exiting the cell cycle at 28 hpf and by 96 hpf the majority of mitotic cells are restricted to the marginal zone, an area that remains proliferative for the life of the fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In contrast to wild-type retina, <italic>disarrayed </italic>retina showed BrdU-positive cells in the central region at 48 hpf. Proliferative cells in mutant eyes were not restricted to the marginal zone until 96 hpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Even at this relatively late time point, the proliferative marginal zone was expanded (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Avi</xref>). To quantify these findings, we scored the percent of total retinal cells that were BrdU-positive at each developmental time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This analysis revealed that at each age assessed, significantly more mutant cells were actively in S-phase as compared to wild-type retinas.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Proliferation defects in <italic>disarrayed </italic>retinas</bold>.

In zebrafish and other vertebrates, expression of the proneural gene <italic>ath5 </italic>marks cells competent to exit the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Expression of <italic>ath5 </italic>mRNA in zebrafish begins at approximately 25 hpf in the ventral nasal quadrant and spreads in a wave-like manner throughout the retina, preceding cell cycle exit and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In situ hybridization revealed that <italic>ath5 </italic>expression initiates on time in <italic>disarrayed </italic>retina (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4Ai, ii</xref>). However, the restriction of <italic>ath5 </italic>mRNA to the peripheral retina is delayed in mutants. Wild-type embryos begin to show marginal zone restriction of gene expression by 60 hpf, whereas the mutants do not show restriction until 72 hpf (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4Av, viii</xref>). To ensure that cells that are expressing neurogenic markers have indeed exited the cell cycle we utilized the Tg(<italic>atoh7</italic>:gfp) reporter line. These transgenic fish express GFP under regulator elements of the <italic>ath5 </italic>(<italic>atoh7</italic>) promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In wild-type zebrafish retinal cells, <italic>ath5</italic>:GFP is expressed just preceding a symmetric neurogenic cell division in which both daughter cells leave the mitotic cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Like, wild-type retinal progenitor cells, we observed that <italic>ath5</italic>:GFP progenitor cells in <italic>disarrayed </italic>retina were also BrdU-negative (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). However, the proportion of <italic>ath5</italic>:GFP cells in <italic>disarrayed </italic>retina was reduced. Together these data suggest that <italic>disarrayed </italic>neuroepithelial cells are competent to withdraw from the mitotic cell cycle, but are delayed in the process of neurogenesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Initiation of retinal neurogenesis in <italic>disarrayed </italic>eyes</bold>.

Specifically, the <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutation may cause lengthening of the cell cycle period or changes in specific phases of the cell cycle. Alternatively, or additionally, <italic>disarrayed </italic>may affect the rate of neurogenesis (the proportion of cells withdrawing from the cell cycle), without changing cell cycle phase kinetics. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first estimated cell cycle period length and phase kinetics using the Cumulative BrdU Labeling and Labeled Mitoses techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These methods provide estimates of the relative change in cell cycle kinetics between defined populations of cells, but alone cannot be used to accurately determine average phase-lengths in heterogeneous cell populations as each method biases estimates for the longest cell cycles in the population. We found that the maximum cell cycle period in <italic>disarrayed </italic>retinal progenitor cells was 2.27 fold longer compared to wild-type cells at 26 hpf. S-phase was 2.18 fold longer, while G2+M phases were increased by 1.42 times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In addition, M-phase was assessed in <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutants by chromatin condensation and phosphoHistone-3 (pH3) immunoreactivity. Like wild-type retinal cells, M-phase always occurred at the apical surface suggesting that cell polarity was not disrupted (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Extended cell cycle and reduced rate of retinal neurogenesis in <italic>disarrayed</italic></bold>.

Consistent with reduced proliferation in <italic>disarrayed </italic>retinal progenitors, mutant nuclei were larger than the nuclei of wild-type siblings when compared at 48 hpf. However, at 24 hfp we found no change in the average size of the nuclei, suggesting that the proliferation defects in <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutants occur after this time in development. Interestingly, the timing of the cell cycle defect in <italic>disarrayed </italic>cells correlates with normal time of expansion of the retinal progenitor pool. In wild-type cells the increased rate of the cell cycle period begins at 24 hpf, following an extended pause in proliferation to accommodate optic cup morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Overall, these analyses demonstrate that following optic cup morphogenesis, but before the initiation of neurogenesis, the cell cycle of <italic>disarrayed </italic>retinal progenitors dramatically slows as compared to wild-type cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Interkinetic nuclear migration is coordinated with the cell cycle in <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutants</title><p>In addition, we assessed interkinetic nuclear migration, the oscillation of the nucleus within neuroepithelial cells that correlates with cell cycle progression. This behavior was investigated by time-lapse microscopy of Histone2B:GFP (H2B:GFP) labeled nuclei from either wild-type or <italic>disarrayed </italic>retina beginning at 26 hpf. Our analysis indicated that interkinetic nuclear migration occurred normally as nuclei moved in both the apical and basal directions and mitosis always occurred at the apical surface. However, interkinetic nuclear migration was slowed proportionately to the altered cell cycle of mutant cells (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). In fact, we were not able to measure a full cell cycle for <italic>disarrayed </italic>progenitor cells during an average time-lapse experiment, indicating that in the shortest mutant cell cycles periods are &#x0003e;16 hours. In contrast, we routinely observe multiple rounds of cell divisions in wild-type cells during a 16 hour time-lapse experiment and found that the shortest cell cycles in wild-type progenitors were 4 hours. No elevation in cell death was noted at these early time points, in contrast to increased cell death found at later times as noted below.</p><p>To further quantitate the defects in interkinetic nuclear migration, we determined the average apical-to-basal and basal-to-apical velocities of individual nuclei. To do this we imaged nuclear migration every 3 minutes over one hour intervals between 24&#x02013;28 hpf. For both directions of movement, we found nuclear migration was slower in mutants as compared to wild-type cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Moreover, mutant nuclei were significantly more likely to remain stationary during the one hour of imaging.

We analyzed the rate of cell cycle exit from 28&#x02013;34 hpf, during the initial wave of neurogenesis and a time prior to the overt small eye phenotype in <italic>disarrayed </italic>embryos. This early time frame was chosen to avoid secondary phenotypes caused by a potential reduction of post-mitotic cell types, which can exert influence on retinal progenitor cell fates. Total cell counts of central retinal sections at 34 hpf indicated that <italic>disarrayed </italic>eyes had nearly half (216 +/- 5.5 vs. 388 +/- 9.0) the total amount of cells that were present in wild-type sibling retinas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). This significant reduction in the number of cells found in the <italic>disarrayed </italic>retina is most likely a direct result of the dramatic slowing of the cell cycle period. We tested this idea with long-pulse BrdU labeling to measure the proportion of cells which had exited the cell cycle during the initial phase of neurogenesis. At 34 hpf, ~40% of the wild-type retinal cells had exited the cell cycle. In contrast, only ~28% of the mutant cells had become post-mitotic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Together, these experiments indicate that the <italic>disarrayed </italic>phenotype is a result of both a lengthening of the cell cycle period and a reduction in the rate of neurogenesis.</p><p>Changes in the cell cycle often result in activation of apoptosis and increased cell death. Although time-lapse analysis did not show significant increases at early times of retinogenesis, later time points were not analyzed in those studies. We therefore, used an acradine orange labeling assay to more thoroughly evaluate retinal cell death throughout development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Overall death in the developing zebrafish retina is normally very low (1&#x02013;2 %) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Mutant embryos, however, showed an increase in cell death beginning at 42 hpf and peaking at 60 hpf. Cell death in mutant eyes returned to wild-type levels by 72 hpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Elevated cell death in the developing brain, particularly in the tectum, was also observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> inset). However, no other obvious regions of increased cell death were observed in <italic>disarrayed </italic>embryos, suggesting that cell death is specific to regions of the developing nervous system. The increased cell death between 42&#x02013;65 hpf may reflect activation of apoptosis due to cell cycle deregulation. Increased cell death certainly contributes to the obvious small eye phenotype at late stages of development.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Elevated cell death in <italic>disarrayed </italic>retinas</bold>.

Genetically mosaic retinas for both wild-type and <italic>disarrayed </italic>embryos were generated by transplantation of lineage labeled blastula stage cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The degree of mosaicism was controlled by varying the quantity of blastula cells transplanted. A range of 5&#x02013;50 cells were transplanted into the eye-fated region of the blastula stage host embryos resulting in isolated clones in the retina. All genetic combinations of donor and hosts were generated and chimeric embryos were analyzed at 72 hpf. The genotype of donor cells was determined by phenotyping the donor embryos at 48 hpf. Wild-type cells transplanted into wild-type host embryos gave rise to mosaic clones in which lamination and morphology were normal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>disarrayed </italic>cells transplanted into <italic>disarrayed </italic>host embryos typically showed smaller clones of cells and were delayed in retinal differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Importantly, when <italic>disarrayed </italic>cells were transplanted into wild-type host embryos, normal morphological differentiation was observed (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). There were no changes in cell-type composition based on morphological differentiation between mutant cells and wild-type cells in wild-type host retinas (data not shown). Furthermore, when genetically wild-type cells developed in <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutant retinas, small clone sizes and delayed differentiation were most often observed (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>, dorsal half). However, when large mosaic patches were generated in <italic>disarrayed </italic>hosts, the wild-type donor cells developed normally (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>, ventral half). Together, these data demonstrate that <italic>disarrayed </italic>functions cell-non-autonomously for morphological differentiation in the retina. The clone size dependence for morphological rescue suggests that <italic>disarrayed </italic>affects a local-acting soluble factor. From the genetic mosaic experiments, however, we could not address the source of the affected factor as it may be provided by the RPE, the lens, periocular mesenchyme, or within the retina itself.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Genetic mosaic analysis of <italic>disarrayed </italic>retinal cells</bold>.

Mosaic retinas were generated as described above with the addition of a one hour pulse of BrdU at 60 hpf. This age was chosen because by 60 hpf in wild-type eyes, proliferative retinal cells are largely restricted to the marginal zone, while proliferative cells in <italic>disarrayed </italic>eyes are still found throughout the retina. Because we observed normal morphological differentiation of large wild-type clones that had been transplanted into the <italic>disarrayed </italic>hosts as described above, we only analyzed small, isolated clones of less than 20 cells in the retina for BrdU-labeling. All genetic mosaic combinations were generated. BrdU-labeling of donor cells in wild-type into wild-type chimeras showed 14.0% of the cells remained proliferative (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8Ai, B</xref>).

Through forward genetics, genes essential for these processes can be identified. We have isolated and characterized a recessive zebrafish mutation, <italic>disarrayed</italic>, which exhibits cell-non-autonomous defects in cell cycle regulation and neurogenesis.</p><p>In retinal development, the cell cycle is related to neurogenesis at several levels. Cell lineage studies and birth-dating analyses have shown that cell cycle exit and cell fate determination are tightly linked. The first cells to exit the cell cycle are ganglion cells which are followed by distinct but temporally overlapping waves of inner and outer nuclear layer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. From these observations, the competency model of retinal development has emerged. This model suggests that retinal progenitor cells irreversibly move through competency states where their developmental potential is restricted to produce only the cell type appropriate for that stage in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In vitro cell assays, cell transplantation experiments, and cell ablation studies indicate that competency is intrinsically determined, but is also influenced by changing signals from local microenvironments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Mechanistically, proteins that regulate the cell cycle can also influence cell-type fate and differentiation pathways, and visa-versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. For example the transcription factor Prox-1 is required for retinal progenitor cell proliferation, horizontal cell fate specification, and bipolar cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Over the course of neurogenesis, the cell cycle period increases among progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This is true within the retina as well as elsewhere in the developing nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The increase in cycle period also correlates with an increase in the proportion of progenitor cells leaving the mitotic cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This observation has led to experiments to test whether the length of the cell cycle influences the probability of whether a neuronal progenitor cell leaves the mitotic cycle. In the cortex, several experiments have been conducted to lengthen the cell cycle and test this hypothesis. In general, all manipulations which lengthened the cell cycle period resulted in increased neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This is in striking contrast to <italic>disarrayed</italic>, in which the cell cycle of retinal progenitors is extended and the rate of cell cycle exit is significantly <underline>reduced</underline>, despite the fact that neurogenesis is initiated normally. This observation raises the question whether the duration of the cell cycle in retinal progenitors has the same influence on neurogenesis as it does in cortical progenitors. In a recent study investigating the influence of Hedgehog signaling on the cell cycle of <italic>Xenopus </italic>retinal progenitors, Locker et al. found that activation of this pathway quickens the cell cycle and promotes neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. These researchers also showed that autonomously blocking Hedgehog signaling, via cyclopamine, lengthened the retinal progenitor cell cycle and reduced neurogenesis. Overall, these data suggest that differences exist between retinal and cortical progenitor cells in the role of the cell cycle during neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although we do not know the gene affected by the <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutation, its unique phenotype has shed light on mechanisms of retinal development.

Embryos were imaged from 24&#x02013;28 hpf as previously described. Optical z-sections were collected at 1 &#x003bc;m steps every 3 minutes for one hour. Metamorph Imaging software was used to measure the distance traveled by individual nuclei. The change in apicobasal distance was then divided by the time that each nucleus was imaged yielding an average velocity measurement of &#x003bc;m/hr. All nuclei that could be tracked within a retinal clone were analyzed. Nuclei from three wild-type and two <italic>disarrayed </italic>retinas were scored.</p></sec><sec><title>Determining the initiation of neurogenesis</title><p>The transgenic line Tg(elav3:eGFP), provided by Ajay Chitnis (NIH), expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the <italic>huc </italic>promoter was breed into the <italic>disarrayed </italic>mutant line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To determine when <italic>huc</italic>:GFP expression is initiated, embryos were treated with PTU and monitored under a fluorescence dissecting scope every 15 minutes beginning at 28 hpf. When GFP was visible in the developing retina the embryos were isolated into dishes and phenotyped at 48 hpf.</p></sec><sec><title>Whole mount in situ hybridization</title><p>Anti-sense cRNA probes were generated for <italic>ath5 </italic>mRNA and whole mount in situ hybridization was conducted as previously described with the addition of a final spin column cRNA probe purification using the ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Column (GE Healthcare) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The hybridized probe was visualized using alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibodies and NBT/X-phosphate substrate (Roche). For post-hybridization sectioning, embryos were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde/PBS and infiltrated with 15 % sucrose, 30 % sucrose and then 100 % TBS. Embryos were oriented in a freezing mold and 15 &#x003bc;m sections were cut on a cryostat and mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic mosaics</title><sec><title>Autonomy of delay in histogenesis</title><p>Mosaic retinas were produced by blastomere transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and were analyzed for cell autonomy according to established criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Clutches of embryos from <italic>disarrayed </italic>heterozygous matings were dechorionated and injected at the 1-to 4-cell stage with a lineage tracing label (1:9 mix of Texas-Red to biotin-conjugated 10 kDa dextran at a total concentration of 5% w/v (Molecular Probes). At the 1000-cell stage, 5&#x02013;50 donor cells were transplanted to the animal pole of the dechorionated wild-type hosts, the region fated for eye and forebrain (Kimmel et al., 1995). Donor-host pairs were kept together to ensure correct identification of donor cells. Host embryos were screened at 24 hpf by fluorescence to ensure the incorporation of donor cells within the retina and donor embryos were phenotyped at 48 hpf. For assessing cell morphology autonomy, host embryos were fixed at 72 hpf with 4% paraformaldehyde. Donor cells in host embryos were detected by whole mount immunohistochemistry using streptavidin-HRP and DAB precipitation and then processed for plastic sectioning as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Autonomy of cell cycle exit</title><p>For assessing the autonomy of cell cycle exit delay, mosaic transplantation was performed as described above with the addition of a BrdU injected into the yolk sac of 60 hpf into host embryos. The embryos were then fixed one hour after BrdU injection and processed for BrdU incorporation as described above. Cell cycle exit was quantified by counting the number of BrdU positive cells within each small clone (2&#x02013;20 cells) (wt in wt n = 13, <italic>dry </italic>in wt n = 8, wt in <italic>dry </italic>n = 14). It was necessary to perform an independent experiment to increase the number of mutant into mutant clones because mosaics between heterozygous crosses result in only one in sixteen transplants to be mutant into mutant. To do this, a plasmid encoding soluble green florescent protein (GFP) was used to label small clones of retinal cells. A BrdU injection was preformed on mutant embryos at 60 hpf and these were fixed one hour later and processed as described above (<italic>dry </italic>in <italic>dry </italic>n = 10).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p><italic>dry</italic>, <italic>disarrayed</italic>; hpf, hours post fertilization; dpf, days post fertilization; GFP, green fluorescent protein; <italic>ath5</italic>, <italic>atonal homologue 5 </italic>(also referred to as <italic>atoh7</italic>); pH3, phosphoHistone3; BrdU, 5-bromo-2'- deoxyuridine.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LB carried out all experimentation and drafted the manuscript.
