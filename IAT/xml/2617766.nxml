The very low density of some particles has been attributed to an association of the virus with apolipoprotein B (apoB) positive and triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRL) likely resulting in hybrid lipoproteins known as lipo-viro-particles (LVP) containing the viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, capsid and viral RNA. The specific infectivity of these particles has been shown to be higher than the infectivity of particles of higher density. The nature of the association of HCV particles with lipoproteins remains elusive and the role of apolipoproteins in the synthesis and assembly of the viral particles is unknown. The human intestinal Caco-2 cell line differentiates <italic>in vitro</italic> into polarized and apoB secreting cells during asymmetric culture on porous filters. By using this cell culture system, cells stably expressing E1 and E2 secreted the glycoproteins into the basal culture medium after one week of differentiation concomitantly with TRL secretion. Secreted glycoproteins were only detected in apoB containing density fractions. The E1&#x02013;E2 and apoB containing particles were unique complexes bearing the envelope glycoproteins at their surface since apoB could be co-immunoprecipitated with E2-specific antibodies. Envelope protein secretion was reduced by inhibiting the lipidation of apoB with an inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. HCV glycoproteins were similarly secreted in association with TRL from the human liver cell line HepG2 but not by Huh-7 and Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells that proved deficient for lipoprotein assembly. These data indicate that HCV envelope glycoproteins have the intrinsic capacity to utilize apoB synthesis and lipoprotein assembly machinery even in the absence of the other HCV proteins. A model for LVP assembly is proposed.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects an estimated 3&#x00025; of the world population and frequently causes chronic infection often leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer. The virus was first isolated in 1989 by molecular biology techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Choo1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and classified in the Hepacivirus genus within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, which includes the flaviviruses (e.g. yellow fever virus and Dengue virus), the pestiviruses (e.g., bovine viral diarrhoea virus), and GB viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Robertson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the high frequency of chronic infections and the very narrow host range limited to humans and chimpanzees sets HCV apart from the other flaviviruses. Since its discovery, many aspects of the HCV replication cycle as well as the pathophysiology of chronic hepatitis C have been described (for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Appel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Moradpour1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>). Surprisingly, despite the possibility to propagate the virus <italic>in vitro</italic>, the precise nature of the HCV particle is still poorly understood in contrast to the flaviviruses that have been studied in great details <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Rey1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Mukhopadhyay1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Unique to HCV is the exceptional low density of the virus particles resulting from the association of the virus with lipoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Thomssen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Thomssen2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Low density complexes of HCV and lipoproteins are preferably observed in the blood of chronically infected patients while most of the viral particles produced <italic>in vitro</italic> have a density similar to that of flaviviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Andre1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Lindenbach1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The density of the blood circulating forms of HCV is very heterogeneous ranging from 1.25 to less than 1.06 g/mL. Particles with high density could correspond to naked capsids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Maillard1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Particles in plasma density fraction around 1.15 g/mL may represent conventional viruses similar to those produced in Huh-7 cells that are derived from the highly replication competent JFH1 strain (HCVcc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Lindenbach2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Zhong1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Viral particles in density fractions below 1.06 g/mL are associated with apolipoprotein B (apoB) bearing triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRL), namely the low, intermediate and very low density lipoproteins (LDL, IDL and VLDL, respectively) and chylomicrons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Thomssen2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Andre1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Diaz1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Pumeechockchai1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This uncommon association of a virus with lipoproteins is of particular interest since viral particles of low density have a higher specific infectivity than high density particles, <italic>in vivo</italic> for chimpanzees and <italic>in vitro</italic> in the Huh-7 cell culture system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Lindenbach1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Bradley1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Hijikata1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. A transmission case of hepatitis C suggests that low density viral particles are also infectious in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Diaz2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. It is not clear however, whether every circulating HCV particles are associated with apoB, the triglyceride content of the particle being the parameter changing the density, or whether only the low density particles are apoB positive and triglyceride rich viral complexes.</p><p>Because of their association with TRL, the low density particles have been assigned the name of lipo-viro-particles (LVP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Andre1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The proportion of LVP amongst the circulating viral particles varies from patient to patient, but on average almost half of HCV RNA is detected in the circulating plasma fractions with density lower than 1.06 g/mL. LVPs are recognized by host antibodies and these immunoglobulin positive particles can be purified by protein A precipitation. Electron microscopy studies identified purified LVPs as globular particles that are heterogeneous in size with an average diameter of 100 nm. These contain higher amounts of triglycerides than lipoproteins isolated from the same density fractions and they contain apolipoproteins (B, CII, CIII, and E, but not the HDL-associated apoA) as well as the viral RNA, core protein and envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Andre1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Nielsen2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Treatment of LVP with detergent does not destroy the association of HCV RNA with apoB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Nielsen2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, the two apoB isoforms, apoB 100 and apoB 48, are present in LVP with comparatively more apoB 48 in LVP than in the plasma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Diaz1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. While apoB 100 is produced by the liver, apoB 48 is only synthesized by enterocytes and is essential for the formation of chylomicrons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Hussain1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This is in keeping with the existence of an intestinal site of HCV assembly and maturation that is supported by the detection of viral non structural proteins in enterocytes of chronically infected patients and the change in neutral lipid composition of LVP content early after a fat rich meal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Diaz1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Deforges1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The nature of LVP however remains poorly defined and the process leading to the coassembly of lipoproteins and virus hybrid complexes is not understood. It has been suggested that LVP formation occurs at the ER membrane where TRL synthesis takes place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Andre2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> since HCV RNA can already be immunoprecipitated by anti-apoB antibodies in chronically infected liver macerates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Nielsen3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In support to this hypothesis, it was recently shown that <italic>in vitro</italic> production of HCV in the Huh-7 cell line depends on the assembly of VLDL and on the expression of apoE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Chang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Huang1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been documented that HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by retention signals in their transmembrane domains (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Dubuisson1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Lavie1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>). Concerning LVP, E1 and E2 appear to be exposed on the surface of purified LVP since they can be recognized by anti-envelope antibodies under non denaturating conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Diaz1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The envelope glycoproteins may thus play a pivotal role in the formation of LVP. To better understand the interaction between envelope glycoproteins and TRL and the assembly of LVP, E1 and E2 proteins were stably expressed in cell lines secreting apoB positive lipoproteins. It is shown here that the viral glycoproteins are secreted from these cells only when the TRL synthesis and secretion pathway is functional. Moreover, the resulting hybrid TRL particles bear E1 and E2 glycoproteins at their surface. These findings reveal that HCV envelope glycoproteins have the intrinsic capacity to assemble into TRL.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Establishment and characterization of Caco-2 cells expressing HCV envelope glycoproteins</title><p>The human intestinal cell line Caco-2 does not synthesize apoB and MTP when cultured under standard conditions and therefore does not secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins.

This secretion is strictly dependent on an efficient apoB positive lipoprotein secretion pathway because, first, apoB negative epithelial Hela cells do not secrete HCV envelope proteins, second, Caco-2 cells only secrete the viral glycoproteins after having acquired the apoB synthesis and secretion capacity and, finally, inhibition of a normal lipidation of apoB with an MTP inhibitor reduced the amount of the secreted viral glycoproteins. The E1 and E2 envelope proteins thus contain the signals mandatory to interfere with a functional apoB pathway in liver and intestinal cells. It is worth noting that both systems seem to be interdependent. Indeed, the amount of cellular viral glycoproteins increases accordingly to apoB and conversely the presence of E1 and E2 likely delays the secretion of apoB. A metabolic syndrome frequently associated with hepatitis C includes insulin-resistance, liver steatosis and hypo-beta-lipoproteinemia. Decreased serum apoB concentrations have been attributed to inhibition of MTP activity by HCV core protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Perlemuter1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Mirandola1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and by the facilitated degradation of apoB by the non structural protein NS5A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Domitrovich1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> which both could reduce the production of TRL. Here we found that expression of E1 and E2 delays apoB secretion by Caco-2 cells providing another mechanism for reduced apoB serum concentration.</p><p>Transduction of the gene coding for E1 and E2 without any additional viral genes is sufficient to induce the assembly and the secretion of low density hybrid particles resembling TRL and bearing the viral glycoproteins on their surface. The current VLDL or chylomicron assembly model is envisioned as a two steps process which requires at least apoB and MTP (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Fisher1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Shelness1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004233-g010">Figure 10</xref>). During the first step, apoB is synthesized and translocated into the rough ER lumen forming a lipid binding cavity that is completed with MTP. MTP thus allows the recruitment of phospholipids and triglycerides (step 2). The ongoing translation of apoB concomitant with MTP mediated lipid transfer from the ER lipid droplets forms a neutral lipid core and conversion to a spherical emulsion particle (step 3). After release from the ribosome, the apoB precursors (precursor 1) move to a distal compartment in the secretory pathway (step 4) where they meet with apoB-free luminal lipid droplets or second precursor, formed by MTP in the smooth ER (step 5&#x02013;6). The first and second precursors fuse to form mature TRL, a process that may be facilitated by apoE, another major component of TRL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Mensenkamp1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Mensenkamp2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In that model, it seems unlikely that a transfer of the viral glycoproteins from the ER membrane where they reside to the apoB precursor may occur. Indeed such a leap would need energy and/or complex tertiary or quaternary rearrangement of the glycoproteins induced by an hypothetical binding to the nascent precursor and allowing the transmembrane domain to detach from the ER membrane. The formation of the apoB free precursor is less well understood (step 5&#x02013;6). If it also depends on MTP, the mechanism leading to a luminal lipid droplet limited by a monolayer of phospholipids is not known. It is tempting to hypothesize that E1 and E2 may slide from the ER membrane to the budding apoB free precursor without any energetically costly conformational changes. In Caco-2 and HepG2 cells, the envelope proteins associated with the second precursor would then fuse with the apoB precursors to form mature hybrid particles. On the contrary, in Huh-7, the fusion likely does not occur and envelope proteins are secreted associated with lipids, and likely with the second precursors, a process that seems to depend on MTP since the secretion of both glycoproteins could be reduced by an MTP inhibitor but less efficiently than in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells. E1 and E2 might therefore be envisioned as markers of the second precursor supporting the two precursor model of lipoprotein synthesis.</p><fig id="pone-0004233-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004233.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Model of TRL assembly and formation of HCV envelope glycoprotein hybrid TRL (adapted from Shelness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Shelness1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>).</title><p>During its translation at the rough ER, the nascent apoB peptide is translocated within the ER lumen (step 1) where a lipid cavity is formed. This lipid cavity is closed by MTP allowing the recruitment of a small amount of phospholipids and triglycerides (TG) (step 2). Continued apoB translation and MTP-mediated TG transfer form a neutral lipid core and conversion to a spheric particle (step 3) that is then released into the ER lumen after translation completion. This first precursor then moves to a distal compartment of the secretory pathway (step 4). In the smooth ER, a second precursor is formed from the ER membrane and MTP-mediated TG enrichment (step 5) and then traffics to the secretory pathway (step 6) where the two precursors meet and fuse to form mature TRL (fusion step). Several factors are required for the formation of the second precursor and the fusion between the two precursors (see text). HCV envelope glycoproteins are retained in the ER membrane after their maturation and clivages by ER peptidases. We hypothesise that E1E2 dimers might diffuse from the ER membrane constituted of two phospholipid monolayers to the budding second precursor. Transition from a two leaflets membrane to the phospholipid monolayer membrane of the precursor might induce conformation changes favouring the formation of E1E2 trimers triggered by the trimerisation of E1 as recently proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Bartosch1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Conversely, the formation of infectious virions may benefit from the budding of the hybrid precursor. Recently, it was proposed that HCV core localizes on the monolayer membrane of cytosolic lipid droplets and then recruits replication complexes associated with the ER membrane forming a membranous local environment critical for producing infectious viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Miyanari1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004233-Shavinskaya1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. It is thus tempting to speculate that, in this local environment, assembling capsids might profit of the budding hybrid second precursor driven by the envelope glycoproteins and MTP to translocate within the precursor lipid core to form an uncompleted viral particle. That particle could secondly fuse in competent cells with the first precursor in the presence of apoE forming the lipo-viro-particles. Translocation of the nucleocapsid limited by the core hydrophobic domains into the lipid core may be energetically favored by the phospholipid monolayer surrounding the hybrid precursor.It is likely that many defective particles circulate in the blood of chronically infected patients since particles containing only E1 and E2 can be produced in large amount as observed in this system.
