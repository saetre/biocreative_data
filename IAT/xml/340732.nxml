Both heat shock loci consist of an unique region that is flanked by an internally repetitive element. Different members of these elements are highly conserved, repeat unit length, however, and primary sequence diverged totally. Whereas the overall gene structure in both species is substantially related, sequence conservation is only observed at very few sites in the unique region. These represent primarily sequences that are identified as regulatory elements for faithful transcription and processing. The number and size of transcripts obtained from heat shock locus 48B in third instar larvae closely resembles the pattern of heat shock locus 93D. Thus their quite alike structure and transcription pattern suggest strongly a conserved hitherto unknown function.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0131-a" xlink:role="3320"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0133-a" xlink:role="3322"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0135-a" xlink:role="3324"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0136-a" xlink:role="3325"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3317"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3318"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3319"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3320"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3321"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3322"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3323"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3324"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3325"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3326"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3327"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3328"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3329"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3330"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3331"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3332"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3333"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
