The transcriptional regulation of these bidirectional gene pairs remains largely unclear, but a few studies have suggested that the two closely adjacent genes in divergent orientation can be co-regulated by a single transcription factor binding to a specific regulatory fragment. Here we report an evolutionarily conserved bidirectional gene pair, known as the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>gene pair, whose transcription relies on the synergic cooperation of two transcription factors binding to an intergenic bidirectional minimal promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>While <italic>PREPL </italic>is present primarily in brain and heart, <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>is ubiquitously and abundantly expressed in almost all tissues. Genomic analyses revealed that these two non-homologous genes are adjacent in a head-to-head configuration on human chromosome 2p21 and separated by only 405 bp. Within this short intergenic region, a 243-bp GC-rich segment was demonstrated to function as a bidirectional minimal promoter to initiate the transcription of both flanking genes. Two key transcription factors, NRF-2 and YY-1, were further identified to coordinately participate in driving both gene expressions in an additive manner. The functional cooperation between these two transcription factors, along with their genomic binding sites and some cis-acting repressive elements, are essential for the transcriptional activation and tissue distribution of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>bidirectional gene pair.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides new insights into the complex transcriptional mechanism of a mammalian head-to-head gene pair which requires cooperative binding of multiple transcription factors to a bidirectional minimal promoter of the shared intergenic region.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In prokaryotic genomes, genes within operons usually have much shorter intergenic distances than genes at the borders of transcription units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The distinct organization of operonic genes in near proximity is thought to facilitate gene co-expression and co-regulation. Recent evidence suggests that some eukaryotic genes also tend to be in close physical vicinity. For example, in the genomes of yeast, worm, and fly, a number of functionally related genes were shown to be located one near another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In mammals, as genes are more dispersed throughout the genomes, the presence of two genes in immediate proximity of each other has long been regarded as a rare exception. Surprisingly, after the human and mouse genomes were decoded, there are more than 10% of the genes found to be arranged as bidirectional (head-to-head) gene pairs with two genes separated only by a less than 1 kb of genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Whilst some of these neighboring genes have evolved from a common ancestral gene by duplication, many are totally unrelated to each other and encode proteins involved in diverse biochemical pathways in different compartments of cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>To date, the transcriptional regulation of mammalian head-to-head gene pairs remains largely unknown, but a few studies have suggested that the two closely adjacent genes in divergent orientation can be co-regulated by a single transcription factor binding to a specific promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Known examples include the human Parkinson's disease-related <italic>PACRG-PARK2 </italic>gene pair, the highly homologous mouse surfeit <italic>Surf1-Surf2 </italic>gene pair, and the non-homologous mouse <italic>Sars2-Mrps12 </italic>gene pair, in which the expression of two genes is delicately regulated by a transcription factor: in these cases N-myc, YY-1, and NF-Y, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In this report, we provide evidence for the existence of an evolutionarily conserved head-to-head gene pair, known as the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>gene pair, whose expression actually depends on the synergic cooperation of two transcription factors binding to a critical bidirectional regulatory element within a short intergenic region.</p><p><italic>PREPL </italic>(<underline>pr</underline>olyl <underline>e</underline>ndo<underline>p</underline>eptidase-<underline>l</underline>ike), formerly named as <italic>KIAA0436 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], is a member of the prolyloligopeptidase family of serine proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions revealed that this protease is similar to oligopeptidase B which utilizes a serine hydroxyl group to cleave target proteins. However, unlike oligopeptidase B which preferentially cleaves after an arginine or lysine residue, PREPL cannot cleave after any basic residue of the substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This suggests that the function of PREPL may be different from that of oligopeptidase B and other known prolyloligopeptidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Clinical studies have demonstrated that chromosomal deletions involving the <italic>PREPL </italic>gene often lead to autosomal recessive syndromes such as hypotonia, facial dysmorphism, neonatal seizures and developmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The severity of these syndromes is closely related to the size of chromosomal deletion and the number of genes involved. For instance, patients with a relative mild HCS (hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome) are missing both alleles of <italic>SLC3A1 </italic>(solute carrier family 3, member 1) and <italic>PREPL </italic>on chromosome 2p21. In a more severe, atypical HCS phenotype, an additional gene <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>(chromosome 2 open reading frame 34) is deleted, whereas in the most severe 2p21 deletion syndrome the open reading frame of <italic>PPM1B </italic>(protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1B) is seriously disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, among these four cluster genes that are associated with autosomal recessive disorders, only <italic>PREPL </italic>and <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>were found to lie immediately adjacent to each other in a head-to-head configuration in many species including human, mouse, rat, dog and chicken. The evolutionarily conserved close proximity and divergent orientation indicate that the two genes are likely co-regulated by some shared intergenic regulatory elements.</p><p>Herein, we determined that <italic>PREPL </italic>and <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>are separated by only a 405-bp intergenic DNA region in the human genome. Within this small intergenic region, a 243-bp GC-rich segment was shown to function as a bidirectional minimal promoter to initiate transcription of both flanking genes. By performing a series of promoter analyses, including chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, two transcription factors, NRF-2 and YY-1, were indentified to be involved in the regulation of the bidirectional minimal promoter. The functional cooperation between these two key transcription factors, along with their genomic binding sites and some cis-acting repressive elements, is essential for the transcriptional regulation and tissue distribution of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>head-to-head gene pair.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tissue expression patterns of human PREPL and C2ORF34 genes</title><p>In order to determine the presence and expression patterns of the <italic>PREPL </italic>and <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>genes, we performed Northern blot analysis on polyA+ RNA isolated from 12 different human tissues.

We first utilized exon-specific primers to amplify genomic DNA fragments encompassing the first exons of both genes. The PCR products were then purified and sequenced to confirm that these two genes are indeed arranged in a head-to-head configuration on human chromosome 2p21 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). By performing 5'-RACE with fetal brain-derived cDNA as a template, both genes were identified to contain multiple TSSs including two for <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and three for <italic>PREPL </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). It should be noted that, during the course of 5'-RACE analysis, we unexpectedly detected a <italic>PREPL </italic>splice variant which uses an alternative, 184-bp untranslated exon 1 (denoted as exon 1a, see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). With this newly found 5'-untranslated exon, the shortest intergenic distance between the closest TSSs for <italic>PREPL </italic>and <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>was calculated to be 405 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In order to facilitate our subsequent analyses of the promoter activity of this 405-bp intergenic region, here we denoted the positions of nucleotides with respect to -1, the first intergenic nucleotide in front of the <italic>PREPL </italic>transcriptional start site, and -405, the intergenic nucleotide right before the transcriptional start site of <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>(see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Determination of the size and sequence of the intergenic region between human <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and <italic>PREPL </italic>genes</bold>.

Here, a 1053-bp fragment (from position -718 to +335) consisting of the entire 405-bp intergenic region and ~300 bp beyond its two boundaries is cloned as the full-length promoter construct. Progressive deletions from this full-length promoter construct were produced and inserted into the promoterless vector in either the sense (relative to <italic>PREPL</italic>) or antisense (relative to <italic>C2ORF34</italic>) direction.

The results revealed that not only the gene order but also the compact head-to-head arrangement are evolutionarily conserved (data not shown). Even the size and nucleotide sequence of their intergenic spacing were found to be conserved, with a fragment of about 300 bp spanning from part of the exon 1 of <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>to the first two-thirds of the intergenic region, showing an average GC content greater than 70% (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). By aligning the human, mouse and rat sequences of this well-conserved, GC-rich region, several consensus transcription factor binding sites were identified. On the basis of these findings, we then attempted to analyze the possible role of these sites in governing the expression of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>bidirectional gene pair.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional characterization of the asymmetric bidirectional promoter activity of the intergenic region</title><p>In order to identify the key elements responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>gene pair, a series of DNA fragments containing all or part of the 405-bp intergenic region were cloned into the promoterless pGL3-basic vector followed by luciferase activity assays. Due to the fact that the regulatory elements are often situated within 300-bp upstream or downstream of the TSSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], here we cloned a 1,053-bp fragment, from position -718 to +335 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), consisting of the entire intergenic region and approximately 300 bp beyond its two boundaries, as the full-length promoter construct. By measuring the luciferase activity in human U87MG cells where both <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and <italic>PREPL </italic>were adequately expressed, this full-length -718/+335 construct was shown to possess a promoter activity stronger than the control SV40 in driving reporter gene expression in the sense (relative to <italic>PREPL</italic>) orientation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Several progressive deletions from the 5'-end of the full-length -718/+335 construct were then generated in an attempt to determine the minimal promoter region necessary to drive <italic>PREPL </italic>gene transcription. As summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, results from luciferase activity measurements pinpointed a 220-bp segment, from -445 to -226 spanning the first 40 bp of <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>exon 1 to the 180-bp 5'-end of the intergenic region, that is critical for the transcription of the <italic>PREPL </italic>gene. Similar progressive deletions from the full-length +335/-718 insert were also constructed to clarify the promoter activity in the antisense (relative to <italic>C2ORF34</italic>) direction. The luciferase assays demonstrated that a 218-bp segment, from -203 to -419 spanning the 5'-end 203-bp of the intergenic region and the first 14 bp of <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>exon 1, is responsible for driving transcription of the <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Based on the above results, we then cloned a 243-bp fragment (from position -445 to -203, see the first "&#x02190; &#x02192;" bar in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) covering both the identified -445/-226 promoter region for <italic>PREPL </italic>and the -203/-419 promoter region for <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>in two opposite orientations and measured its potential bidirectional promoter activity. To our surprise, while no obvious difference was observed between the assays driven by the 243-bp (-445/-203) fragment alone or by the full-length (-718/+335) construct toward the <italic>PREPL </italic>direction, the same 243-bp fragment but in opposite orientation (-203/-445) was able to significantly increase the luciferase activity in the <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>direction by at least 12-fold as compared to the -203/-718 or the control +335/-718 full-length insert (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Furthermore, removal of the sequence of the 243-bp fragment either from the 5'- or 3'-end (see the last three "&#x02190; &#x02192;" bars in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) all resulted in a decrease of the luciferase activities in both directions. Together these findings suggest that the 243-bp fragment is likely to function as a bidirectional minimal promoter, and that the region from position -446 to -718 may serve as a repressive element to suppress the transcription activity of the <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>gene.</p><p>To further confirm the functional significance of the identified 243-bp regulatory element, we determined the effect of its promoter strength on the expressions of the two flanking genes. The results, similar to those obtained by the aforementioned Northern blot analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), revealed that the levels of <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>transcripts remained constant in various cell lines whereas <italic>PREPL </italic>was found to be expressed in brain H4 and U87MG cells but much less in lung WI38 and IMR90 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In accordance with this, although no notable difference was observed in the relative luciferase activity driven by the 243-bp (-445/-203) fragment toward the <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>direction, the relative luciferase activity of the same fragment toward the opposite <italic>PREPL </italic>direction was shown to be more elevated in brain than in lung cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results indicate that the 243-bp minimal promoter element is likely responsible for directing differential expression of the <italic>PREPL </italic>gene, if not also for the neighboring <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of promoter strength of the 243-bp regulatory element on the expressions of <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and <italic>PREPL </italic>genes</bold>.

By using Methprimer software <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.urogene.org/methprimer"/> and a modified criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], which defined the size of a CpG island as larger than 200 bp and the ratio of observed versus expected CpGs as greater than 0.7, we identified a GC-rich fragment spanning from part of the exon 1 of <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>to the first two-thirds of the 405-bp intergenic region (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). To elucidate whether the differential expression of <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and <italic>PREPL </italic>is contributed by DNA methylation, we measured the methylation status of each individual CpG site. The assay results displayed no notable differences in the CpG methylation patterns of various normal tissues (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). This indicates that the tissue-specific pattern of both <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and <italic>PREPL </italic>genes may not be controlled directly by DNA methylation, but rather be regulated by some transcriptional factors binding to the identified 243-bp bidirectional minimal promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of transcription factor binding sites in the bidirectional minimal promoter</title><p>Sequence comparison revealed that the 243-bp bidirectional minimal promoter is evolutionarily conserved among distant organisms. As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, although neither TATA-box nor CCAAT element were found in this intergenic region, several potential transcription factor binding sites were recognized <italic>in silico </italic>by MatInspector <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomatix.de/products/MatInspector"/> and MOTIF <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://motif.genome.jp"/> softwares. These potential binding sites include two for TFAP-4 (denoted as TFAP-4(A), at nt -407 to -400; and TFAP-4(B), at nt -264 to -255), one for MZF-1 (at nt -398 to -391), one for USF (at nt -362 to -353), two for NRF-2 (denoted as NRF-2(A) at nt -307 to -298; and NRF-2(B) at nt -299 to -290) and one for YY-1 (at nt -232 to -215). Among these putative binding sequences, some core binding sites and their flanking segments such as those for USF, NRF-2, and YY-1 were found to be evolutionarily more conserved than other transcription factor binding sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In particular, as the USF-binding sequence is known to be one of the most frequently predicted motifs in many gene promoters, here we chose to first examine the possible role of NRF-2 and YY-1 in the activation of <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and <italic>PREPL </italic>transcriptions. The luciferase assays performed in U87MG cells showed that point mutations at the NRF-2(A) site (termed as -203/-445<sup>mu_NRF-2(A) </sup>and -445/-203<sup>mu_NRF-2(A)</sup>) had no major effect on the promoter activity in either direction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, mutations occurring at the NRF-2(B) binding site (denoted as -203/-445<sup>mu_NRF-2(B) </sup>and -445/-203<sup>mu_NRF-2(B)</sup>) caused a significant reduction of the luciferase activity as compared to that of the control 243-bp bidirectional minimal promoter (~74% decrease in the <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>direction and ~58% decrease in the <italic>PREPL </italic>direction, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results indicate that the second NRF-2 binding sequence (from position -299 to -290) is essential for the activation of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>bidirectional gene pair. Moreover, mutant constructs at the YY-1 site (named as -203/-445<sup>mu_YY-1 </sup>and -445/-203<sup>mu_YY-1</sup>) displayed a drastically reduced promoter activity toward the <italic>PREPL </italic>direction (~86% decrease relative to that of the control 243-bp segment) but a less severe reduction in the <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>direction (with only a ~37% decrease relative to that of the minimal promoter). This implies that the YY-1 site is more important than the NRF-2(B) site for <italic>PREPL </italic>expression. The same data also conclude that the NRF-2(B) binding site is functionally more critical than the YY-1 site in driving <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>transcription, as evident from mutations at the NRF-2(B) site resulting in a much decreased reporter gene activity toward the <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>direction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). More significantly, double mutations at the NRF-2(B) and the YY-1 binding sites (denoted as -445/-203<sup>mu_NRF-2(B)/YY-1 </sup>and -203/-445<sup>mu_NRF-2(B)/YY-1</sup>) further decreased the promoter activity to the basal level in both directions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Similar results were also observed in other cell lines including brain H4, GBM8401, and GBM8901 cell lines (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Together these findings provide the first strong evidence that, in addition to their individual effects on the full activity of the bidirectional minimal promoter region, the NRF-2 and YY-1 transcription factors may coordinately participate in driving both gene expressions in an additive manner.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Multiple sequence alignment of the bidirectional minimal promoter region of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>gene pair</bold>.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, by incubating cell nuclear protein extracts with the -311/-282 probe that contained two NRF-2 binding sites, three major shifted bands were detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lane 2). These band-shifts were sequence-specific as addition of an excess of unlabeled wild-type probe could compete out the binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, while competitors containing mutated NRF-2(B) site failed to affect the binding of nuclear proteins to hot probe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lanes 5 and 6), a strong competitive effect was obtained with the use of a 10-fold excess of cold probe with mutation at the NRF-2(A) site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lane 8). These results again indicate that NRF-2(B), the second NRF-2 binding sequence from position -299 to -290, is more important than NRF-2(A) in regulating the transcription of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>bidirectional gene pair. To more clarify the specific binding of NRF-2 and YY-1 to the bidirectional promoter, the nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies against NRF-2, YY-1, and NF-1 to examine the inhibition and/or supershift of the protein/DNA complex. As revealed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, by incubating nuclear protein extracts either with the same -311/-282 probe or with the -290/-204 probe which contained the sole YY-1 binding site, several retarded bands were detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, lanes 1 and 7). Such a binding activity with the -311/-282 probe or -290/-204 probe could be significantly competed with 1- or 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (self-competition; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;3 and 8&#x02013;9).

In both cases no supershift was observed with the negative control anti-NF-1 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, lanes 6 and 12).

As a negative control, another immunoprecipitation from the same stock was carried out using anti-IgG antibody. The regions surrounding the functional NRF-2 and YY-1 binding sites were analyzed in parallel on immunoprecipitated chromatin. For PCR amplifications, a 1/10 dilution of input chromatin was selected as a standard to indicate the efficiency of the PCR reactions. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, while nothing was detected with the use of the control anti-IgG antibody, fragments from the bidirectional minimal promoter of the intergenic region were able to be immunoprecipitated by both anti-NRF-2 and anti-YY-1 antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, lanes 4 and 8, respectively) in higher amounts than the 1/10 input chromatin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, lanes 2 and 6).

They are commonly present in prokaryotes and low eukaryotes but are considered to be rare in higher organisms. Recent genome sequencing efforts, however, have revealed that a large number of mammalian genes are in fact closely arranged as divergent (head-to-head) gene pairs and separated only by a less than 1 kb of intergenic spacer [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; and our unpublished observations]. No definite explanation can yet be given for the biological and evolutionary advantages of this distinct type of divergent gene pairs. But theoretically, only when two genes are divergently organized in close proximity (now referred more as "bidirectional gene pairs") can be co-expressed and co-regulated by a shared intergenic bidirectional promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This statement is supported by a recent study of whole-genome microarray data showing that, in a given cell, approximately 68% of divergent genes are transcribed, compared with 44% of all human genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It seems likely that the presence of bidirectional promoters in mammalian genomes is to facilitate functional co-regulation of two adjacent genes, thus making bidirectional gene pairs more favored by natural selection than any other gene organization. By analyzing and comparing the intergenic sequences of bidirectional gene pairs in different species, it has been shown that the majority of intergenic regions lack TATA and CCAAT boxes but are rich in GC content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Those findings are consistent with our characterization of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>bidirectional gene pair, in that neither a TATA box nor a CCAAT element could be found within the identified 405-bp intergenic region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). A CpG-rich island was indeed recognized, but its methylation status does not seem to play an important role in regulating the expression levels of the two downstream genes (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). It was also reported that the intergenic regions found in mammalian genomes often display a mirror sequence composition, such that the Gs and Ts dominate on one side of the midpoint whilst Cs and As dominate on the other side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In the case of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>bidirectional gene pair presented in this work, however, no such a composition was observed.</p><p>It is of interest to note that the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>gene pair has several features in common with some other human bidirectional gene pairs such as the Parkinson's disease-related <italic>PACRG-PARK2 </italic>gene pair at 6q25.2&#x02013;27, and the brain-disease related <italic>PDCD10-SERPINI1 </italic>gene pair at 3q26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In all three cases, the paired genes are non-homologous to each other. <italic>PREPL</italic>, like <italic>PARK2 </italic>and <italic>SERPINI1</italic>, has its tissue specificity and is present mainly in brain and/or heart; where as <italic>C2ORF34</italic>, like <italic>PACRG </italic>and <italic>PDCD10</italic>, is expressed like a housekeeping gene in all tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). More significantly, the genetic variations found in these genes are often correlated with brain or genetic abnormalities. This implies that brain, being the most complex and metabolically active organ in the body, may utilize various bidirectional promoters to direct gene expressions and cellular functions in a more efficient and comprehensive manner.</p><p><italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and <italic>PREPL </italic>are known to lie immediately adjacent to each other not only in humans but also in many other species. Their evolutionarily conserved gene configuration and close proximity indicate that both genes need to be tightly paired and may thus be co-regulated by some common transcriptional regulatory elements. By generating a series of partial deletion constructs using firefly luciferase as the reporter gene, we first identified a 273-bp GC-rich segment, from position -446 to -718, which may serve as a repressive element to suppress in particular the transcriptional activity of the <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>gene. This repressive effect is most likely due to some yet unidentified transcriptional repressor, or may be caused by subsequent disturbance of the chromatin structure within this GC-rich DNA region. Results from luciferase activity assays further suggest that the essential promoter activity is carried within a 243-bp (from position -445 to -203) genomic region, and that two transcription factors, NRF-2 and YY-1, can bind onto this critical bidirectional minimal promoter to regulate the expression of both <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and <italic>PREPL </italic>genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). It should be noted that the nucleotide sequence of the -718/-446 segment revealed no ATG motifs that may interfere with the downstream luciferase gene expression at the level of translation. Nonetheless, we need to point out that although highly unlikely, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that RNA splice sites may have bypassed the ATG of the luciferase reporter in our analysis.</p><p>NRF-2, also termed as GA-binding protein or GABP, has long been known to act as a key nuclear activator in the regulation of many mitochondrial-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Similar to a previous study on the promoter region of the outer mitochondrial membrane translocase <italic>TOMM20 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], in our identified 405-bp intergenic fragment only one of the two putative NRF-2 binding sites was found responsible for driving the bidirectional promoter activity. More significantly, NRF-2 itself is also arranged as a bidirectional gene pair with its adjacent <italic>ATP5J </italic>(an ATP synthase coupling factor) gene on human chromosome 21. By binding to its 5'-intergenic region shared with the <italic>ATP5J </italic>gene, NRF-2 is able to auto-regulate its own gene transcription and subsequently affect the expression levels of downstream mitochondrial-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In the case of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>gene pair, because NRF-2 is shown to be more important in driving <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>expression and because patients with the 2p21 deletion syndromes (in particular those occurring at <italic>C2ORF34</italic>) often exhibit a unique mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], we speculate that the ubiquitously expressed <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>gene may possess some cellular functions related to mitochondrial metabolisms and be ultimately regulated by NRF-2 along with the collaboration of YY-1 transcription factor.</p><p>Previously, YY-1 had been reported to serve as a necessary and sufficient activator for the expression of some bidirectional gene pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. As for the evolutionarily conserved <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>gene pair, mutations occurring at the YY-1 binding site were shown to cause significantly decreased promoter activity toward the <italic>PREPL </italic>direction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This suggests that YY-1 is functionally more important than NRF-2 in driving <italic>PREPL </italic>transcription. Moreover, because the dual activator/repressor role of YY-1 is often related to its cellular concentration as well as its ability to interact with other cofactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], here we propose that YY-1 can directly bind to the bidirectional minimal promoter of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>gene pair and, depending on the intracellular concentrations of YY-1 and its interacting cofactors such as NRF-2, serve as both a positive regulator and a negative regulator in determining the tissue distribution pattern of the <italic>PREPL </italic>gene. Finally, double mutations at both the NRF-2 and YY-1 binding sites completely abolished the activity of the bidirectional minimal promoter in both directions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This implies that, in addition to their individual effect on the full activity of the bidirectional minimal promoter region, NRF-2 and YY-1 coordinately participate in driving both <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and <italic>PREPL </italic>gene expressions in an additive manner. The functional cooperation between these two transcription factors, along with their binding efficacy to the asymmetric bidirectional minimal promoter and some cis-acting repressive elements, is essential for the transcriptional activation and tissue distribution of the <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>head-to-head gene pair.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Unlike previous reports suggesting that two adjacent genes in a head-to-head configuration can be co-regulated by a single transcription factor binding to a specific promoter segment, here we demonstrated that the expression of the disease-related <italic>PREPL-C2ORF34 </italic>bidirectional gene pair is in fact dependent on the synergic cooperation of two transcription factors interacting with a 405-bp intergenic DNA region. Although <italic>PREPL </italic>is present primarily in brain and heart, <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>is ubiquitously and abundantly expressed in almost all tissues examined. Their distinct expression patterns may not be directly regulated by DNA methylation but rather be controlled by the coordinated binding of NRF-2 and YY-1 onto a 243-bp asymmetric bidirectional minimal promoter. An additional GC-rich region, from nt -446 to nt -718, is likely to serve as a repressive element suppressing the transcription activity of the <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>gene. Finally, various analyses including luciferase activity experiments, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and <italic>in vivo </italic>chromatin immunoprecipitation verified the direct binding of NRF-2 and YY-1 onto the shared intergenic region, thus confirming that these two transcription factors function coordinately with the bidirectional minimal promoter to regulate the transcriptions of both <italic>PREPL </italic>and <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>All culture media were purchased from Gibco Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

All nucleotide sequences, in particular those for <italic>C2ORF34 </italic>and <italic>PREPL</italic>, were downloaded from the NCBI databases and aligned using Vector NTI software (InforMax, Bethesda, MD, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Bisulfite sequencing analysis of DNA methylation</title><p>Genomic DNAs used for bisulfate analysis were purchased from Biochain (Biochain Institute, Hayward, CA, USA) including samples of normal brain (Lot #A712158: male, 27-year old), normal colon (Lot #A80504: male, 23-year old) and normal testis (Lot #A905081: male, 26-year old) tissues. The CpG methylation status was analyzed using the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA) according the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 1 &#x003bc;g of each genomic DNA was treated with the CT Conversion reagent supplied within this kit under the following conditions: 98&#x000b0;C for 10 min, 64&#x000b0;C for 4 h, and then at 4&#x000b0;C until use. All bisulfite-converted DNA samples were purified by the Zymo-Spin IC column with 600 &#x003bc;l M-Binding buffer, 100 &#x003bc;l M-Wash buffer, 200 &#x003bc;l M-Desulphonation buffer, 200 &#x003bc;l M-Wash buffer, and then eluted with 10 &#x003bc;l M-Elution buffer. The samples were then PCR-amplified using the forward primer (5'-CCACATAATTCCTCCTCTT-3') and reverse primer (5'-TCCACATCTCTCTCATCCTCTTTTC-3') under following condition: 1 cycle of 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min; 30 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 50&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, and 72&#x000b0;C for 40 sec; and 1 cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The amplified products were cloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) followed by transformation into competent Top10 <italic>E. coli </italic>cells. Four individual clones for each tissue sample were randomly selected and subjected to sequencing by the core facility of the National Health Research Institutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of reporter gene plasmids</title><p>All restriction enzymes were purchased from Takara.

Cells were then co-transfected, in triplicate, with 3 &#x003bc;l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Gibco Invitrogen) and a mixture of 525 ng of DNA consisting of 500 ng of the tested pGL3 promoter constructs and 25 ng of the pRL-TK <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) in a serum-free medium. The pGL3-promoter plasmid containing the SV40 promoter was used as the positive control. After a 2-h transfection at 37&#x000b0;C, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS and cells were incubated for another 24 h. After incubation, cells were harvested and lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Cellular debris was removed after centrifugation at 10,000 &#x000d7; g for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The chemiluminescence of the two different luciferases was measured using a SIRIUS luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The transfection efficiency and cell viability were normalized with the pRL-TK plasmid containing the <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase gene under the control of the TK promoter.

For each assay, 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells from each cell line were incubated with 1% formaldehyde fixation solution for 10 min at room temperature and then quenched with glycine. The nuclei were fully resuspended in 1 mL lysis buffer with 5 &#x003bc;l protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 &#x003bc;l PMSF. The lysates were sonicated 3 times (15 min max power, 30 sec on and 30 sec off) at 4&#x000b0;C using Bioruptor (Diagenode SA, Li&#x000e8;ge, Belgium). Following sonication, the chromatin fragments of 200~1,000 bp with a major size of 500 bp were yielded. The sonicated chromatin was pre-cleaned with protein G agarose beads with gentle agitation at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h followed by centrifugation at 5,000 &#x000d7; g for 1 min. One-tenth volume of the sample was diluted in a ChIP dilution buffer (1.67 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 167 mM NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 1.2 mM EDTA) and stored at 4&#x000b0;C as the input fraction; the remaining solutions were divided into several aliquots and incubated with 5 &#x003bc;g each of specific antibodies including anti-NRF-2 (sc-28311 X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-YY-1 (sc-1703 X; Santa Cruze), anti-histone 3 (Upstate), and control rabbit anti-IgG (Upstate) antibodies. The protein-DNA-antibody complexes were incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for overnight with gentle rotation and then immunoprecipitated by protein G agarose slurry for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The chromatin immune complexes were washed sequentially with 1 mL of low-salt buffer, high-salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and TE buffer before being eluted twice with 100 &#x003bc;l of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO3). The cross-linked antibody-TF-DNA complexes were reversed by the addition of 8 &#x003bc;l of 5 M NaCl and heated at 65&#x000b0;C overnight. After removal of RNA and protein by the treatments with RNase A and proteinase K, the remnant DNA and input control were purified using the EZ ChIP kit. The precipitated DNAs were subjected to PCR in attempt to amplify the NRF-2 and YY-1 binding elements under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 68&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, and 72&#x000b0;C for 20 sec; and 1 cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 5 min with the forward primer (5'-CGCGCTCTCCCCGAATT-3') and reverse primer (5'-TTGGGTTCCTGGGTTCTTTAGTC-3').
