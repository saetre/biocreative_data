UBQ is a 76 amino-acid protein that is covalently linked to lysine residues of target proteins in a multi-step process. The process of UBQ conjugation involves three basic classes of enzymes. UBQ-activating enzymes (E1s) activate the C terminus of UBQ, resulting in the formation of an ATP-dependent thio-ester that is linked to the E1's active site - cysteine residue. Afterwards, UBQ is transferred to the active site - cysteine residue - of an E2 conjugating enzyme. The third class of enzymes, the UBQ-protein ligases (E3s) catalyze the final reaction (the UBQ-conjugation process), in which the UBQ is attached to the lysine residue of the protein substrate (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). As a result of the ubiquitylation (ubiquitination) process, the target protein can be modified by a single UBQ (mono-ubiquitylation) or several UBQs (poly-ubiquitylation), which determines the tagging outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Deconjugation of UBQ- and/or UBL-modified protein substrates is essential to recycle both the substrate proteins and the UBQ or UBL modifiers; thus, this process influences protein-protein interactions, signaling processes and the pool of free UBQ/UBL within the cell. The deconjugation process is managed by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs). The DUBs are in a heterogeneous group of cysteine or metalloproteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which can cleave the scissile peptide bond between the last residue of UBQ (Gly 76) and target proteins. Since their discovery in 1990s, DUBs have been emerging as key regulators in many basic cellular processes. For example, they modulate the ubiquitin-proteasome system (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). Recently, numerous studies have shown that DUBs are linked to diseases such as cancer. CYDL is a tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; UCHL1 and USP24 are involved in Parkinson's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; ATXN3 influences ataxias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Most extensively, DUBs have been studied in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The classical DUBs can be divided into five subclasses based on their UBQ-protease domains. These are (i) UBQ-specific proteases (USPs), (ii) otubain proteases (OTUs), (iii) UBQ C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), (iv) Machado-Joseph disease proteases (MJDs) and (v) JAMM motif proteases (JAMMs). Nijman <italic>et al. </italic>have identified 95 DUBs, out of which the overwhelming majority (58) belongs to the USP class. Whereas the DUBs in the JAMM family are metalloproteases, the other four groups belong to the cysteine protease class. Additionally, two more subclasses of DUBs have been suggested based on evidence from sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The so-called PPPDE group involves papain-like proteases and the WLMs (Wss1p-like proteases) are metalloproteases. Both are hypothesized to play a role in removal of UBQ or UBL from substrate proteins. Experimentally, DUBs can be identified with several approaches such as using hemagglutinin-tagged (HA) UBQ-derived probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] or biotin-labeled UBQ aldehyde probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] for labeling. These methods had been used to identify several members of the USP, UCH and OTU families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Alternatively, extension of families of known or suspected representatives of DUB classes is possible with the <italic>in silico </italic>collection of families of significantly similar sequences within the homology concept.</p><p>It must be noted that the understanding of the DUBs' functions remains very limited despite considerable research efforts. Apparently, the problems are associated with the large number of various DUBs (some of which might compensate for others in parallel pathways) and with their position in the subcellular gene networks where a single DUB can affect several pathways via its protein substrates. One possibility to get new insight into the problem is to involve new model organisms into the analysis and to rely on their specific methodological advantages. The zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) system with its morpholino (MO) technology is superbly suited for easily studying the loss-of-function phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, important information necessary to elucidate the genes' function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In this work, we use the zebrafish model to identify the MO knockdown phenotypes of potential DUB genes that we have identified with <italic>in silico </italic>methods from the genome sequence. The respective experiments have been carried out for 85 putative DUBs. 57 out of the 85 genes were found to be required for normal development and their morphants have exhibited complex phenotypes always with inclusion of notochord deformations. In order to narrow down the functions in development for some of the genes, we chose a neuronal marker, <italic>huC</italic>, for grouping the DUBs into subgroups that provide hints for specific pathway involvement. This first loss-of-function study of DUB genes in zebrafish provides a valuable resource for further DUB studies in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Zebrafish has more than 90 putative DUBs encoded in its genome</title><p>DUB-subclass-specific Hidden Markov model and BLAST/PSI-BLAST searches (as described in the Methods section) have been applied for identifying DUBs in the proteome of zebrafish. It should be noted that the first genome-wide search has been started in February 2008 and was regularly repeated (last time, in April 2009). Depending on the zebrafish proteome and the non-redundant protein database, the numbers of hits were slightly different and not all putative DUB sequences were known at the planning stage of experimental work. Therefore, we conclude that our current list of potential DUBs in zebrafish might not be completely exhaustive; yet, it appears comprehensive at the time of writing. For the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) class containing a UCH (PF0043) domain, we determined 51 proteins. 15 zebrafish proteins resembling OTU-like cysteine proteases (OTUs) have an OTU (PF02338) domain. Another three proteins have the features of Machado-Joseph disease proteases (MJDs) with Josephine domain (PF02099). There are four zebrafish ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase proteins (UCHs) sharing a Peptidase_C12 (PF1088) domain. The DUB metalloproteases are represented by 14 proteins carrying a Mov34/MPN/PAD-1 family (PF01398) domain (JAMMs). Another four proteins belong to the PPPDE class (PF05903). In total, this results in 91 candidate targets. In Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, the names and accession numbers of all 91 hits are shown.</p><p>The sequence domain architectures of all 91 DUB hits are also shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. The combination of UBQ-protease domains with domains and motifs from the ubiquitylation pathway (such as ubiquitin-associated UBA, ubiquitin UBQ and ubiquitin-interacting motif, UIM) is not a real surprise, whereas the association with nucleic-acid binding domains (Myb_DNA_binding, PRO8 and Tudor) and protein-binding domains (SWIRM and MATH) would make sense in the context of the involvement of DUB proteins in the regulation of gene expression. The PRPF8 (pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8) protein, a member of the JAMM protein family, is known to be one of the largest and most highly conserved nuclear protein that occupies a central position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Another member of the JAMM protein family, MYSM1, is a histone H2A deubiquitinase that regulates transcription by coordinating histone acetylation and deubiquitylation, and destabilizing the association of linker histone H1 with nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We searched the scientific literature extensively for evidence for DUB functions and the summary of known DUBs is shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>.</p><p>We think that both the human and zebrafish DUB lists are not complete at present and revisions of the genome build or the proteome lists will lead to some correction. As a general trend, the total numbers as well as the numbers of DUBs in the subclasses are quite comparable between both organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. For the overwhelming majority (about four fifths), there are also clear orthologues in fish and humans (these genes carry the names of their human counterparts in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>); yet, there are also a few cases of missing equivalents in either organism or organism-specific duplications and it is not clear at present whether genome revisions will resolve these discrepancies. So far, it appears too early to draw biological conclusions out of differences in the DUB lists.</p></sec><sec><title>57 DUB genes are required for zebrafish early development</title><p>At the time of starting the MO experiments, our list comprised 85 gene entries. For most of them, we found records in GenBank and/or the Ensembl genome database (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) suitable for straightforward MO design. It is a common and general practice to design the MOs that target the ATG translation sites. Translation-blocking MO interferes with the protein translation process of the target gene. However, ATG translation start site information was missing for 11 sequences and we used a workaround as described in the Methods section. For these genes, we designed MOs targeting splicing of exon-intron junction that is on or in the vicinity of conserved domains (marked in bold italics in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p><p>Among all 85 MOs tested, 26 MOs (31%) led to no detectable morphological phenotypes, while two MOs (2%) resulted in cell death in early developmental stages (cell arrest after 30% epiboly). The remaining 57 MOs (67%) gave different observable phenotypes, including abnormal development in head, brain, eyes, body axis, notochord, precardial region, yolk and tail. Most of the MOs did not specially affect one region but several. The notochord was always affected in the MO knockdown experiments. The results are summarized in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>. In this table, brief phenotypic descriptions and images of the morphants are shown.</p></sec><sec><title>Classifying DUB genes into five subgroups according to their huC expression level and pattern</title><p>As we mentioned above, most of the DUB genes gave pleiotropic phenotypes. It appears difficult to classify the diverse phenotypes based on their varied morphology. Therefore, we applied additional <italic>in situ </italic>staining of the neuronal <italic>huC </italic>marker. We chose <italic>huC </italic>as the primary marker because of its strong and easily recognizable staining patterns in zebrafish early development. In addition, neuronal development is always a hot topic and research-focusing point. In the screen, its distinctive distribution patterns allowed classifying 83 out of 85 DUB genes into five groups (except for <italic>zranb1a </italic>and <italic>usp46 </italic>(2%) that resulted in cell death). The largest group includes 47 members (group V, 55%), which shows no change in <italic>huC </italic>expression level or patterning. Within this group, all the members exhibit the same neuronal pattern as the control. Neurons are formed in a well-organized manner (data not shown). Group I is the only group that has an increased <italic>huC </italic>expression (increase in both expression level and number of neurons) and/or enlarged patterning and is composed of three members (4%). Overgrown hindbrain neurons were found among them (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A-D</xref>). Groups II to IV are characterized by a decrease in <italic>huC </italic>expression with different patterns. Group II shows decreased <italic>huC </italic>expression without changed patterning and comprises 16 members (19%). Group III exhibits decreased <italic>huC </italic>expression with slightly destructive patterning effect and has 13 members (15%). They have abnormal shape of hindbrain neurons, such as curved neuron pattern and uneven cranial ganglia length. Finally, group IV features a decrease of <italic>huC </italic>expression together with severely destructed patterning and it is made up of 4 members (5%). All the members in this group cannot form organized neuronal patterns. Besides, individual small clusters of neurons were observed. Moreover, all the cranial ganglia structures were lost in this group. Selected results among them are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Since groups I and IV showed distinct <italic>huC in situ </italic>results, we next focused on these two groups for general signaling and developmental studies.

Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) is important to the dorsoventral patterning of the mesoderm. The failure of its expression in dorsal blastomeres causes the ventralization of the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. <italic>eve1 </italic>is a zebrafish homeobox gene similar to <italic>even-skipped </italic>in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

In zebrafish, it plays a main role in determining the ventral cell fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Briefly, the BMP signaling pathway starts from the BMP receptors activation. The receptors are mediated by BMPs and will active the Smad proteins (R-Smad) through phosphorylation. The Smad protein will then bind to a common mediator Smad (Co-Smad) to form complexes, which will finally be translocated into the nucleus and act as transcriptional regulators. Mutations of ventral <italic>bmp </italic>gene will result in the dorsalization of the embryo. <italic>swirl </italic>(<italic>swr</italic>) and <italic>snailhouse </italic>(<italic>snh</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] are two well known mutants that have mutations in <italic>bmp2b </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and <italic>bmp7 </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], respectively. To gain further insights into where group IV DUBs function in the BMP pathway, we preformed co-injection of group IV MOs and selected mRNA of BMP signaling genes. Single mRNA injections of <italic>bmp4 </italic>and <italic>smad1 </italic>resulted in ventralized phenotypes as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. When embryos were injected with <italic>bmp4 </italic>mRNA and group IV MO, we observed ventralized phenotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E-G</xref>). The results seemed to disagree with our hypothesis, since Bmp4 is at the uppermost position in the BMP pathway. However, because DUBs are enzymes, their functions might be compensated or replaced by others. Thus, we preformed co-injection of <italic>bmp4 </italic>mRNA with different combination of group IV DUB MOs. Based on the single MO injection result, we chose the most effective <italic>usp25 </italic>MO as a basic component and all the MO concentrations were halved as single injection. Except for the mild effect of <italic>usp15+usp25 </italic>double knockdown, both <italic>otud4+usp25 </italic>and <italic>usp5+usp25 </italic>MOs significantly enhanced the dorsalized phenotypes in embryos co-injected with <italic>bmp4 </italic>mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E-G</xref>). For co-injection of <italic>smad1 </italic>mRNA and group IV MOs, ventralized phenotypes were found (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H-J</xref>). Specific injection amounts were tabulated in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. In the table, we introduced the Dorsal-Ventral (DV) value, which was calculated by the frequencies of phenotypes times a fixed value (5 for C5, 4 for C4, -4 for V4 and -3 for V3 phenotypes, etc.). The final DV value indicated the average result of the co-injection experiments. To summarize, the combination MOs could not rescue ventralized phenotypes caused by <italic>smad1 </italic>mRNA injection (negative DV value), while maintained their dorsalized phenotypes when co-injected with the <italic>bmp4 </italic>mRNA (positive DV value except the mild effect of <italic>usp15</italic>+<italic>usp25</italic>). These data suggested that the group IV DUBs act downstream of Bmp4 and upstream of Smad1 in dorsoventral patterning. The substrate of the particular E3 ligase in the BMP pathway can be deubiquitylated more efficiently by two DUBs. Collectively, all the group IV DUB genes are involved in the BMP pathway and can affect the early dorsoventral patterning in the zebrafish. The proposed working model is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A-G</xref>. We classified the phenotypes based on Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> and further confirmed by <italic>in situ </italic>staining using different molecular

To our knowledge, "loss-of-function" studies of DUBs in any kinds of organism have been carried out only for very few genes due to the considerable cost associated with raising genetic knockout- and/or knockdown-modulated animals. Zebrafish is a model organism that is well suited to fill this gap. It is well known for its fast life cycle and the transparency of its embryos. Recently, the techniques of using MO knockdown and mRNA overexpression by microinjection further advance the versatility of using zebrafish as a model system.

From the results, we infer that DUB genes play different roles in the early zebrafish developmental processes, ranging from the dorsoventral patterning during the gastrulation to the fine-tuning of neurons and fin phenotypes. Most of the DUB genes appear multi-functional: they affect not only one and single developmental process. Taking <italic>Cyld </italic>as an example, there are published papers using the <italic>Cyld </italic>knockout mice for the studies. They have different effects on spermatogenesis and osteoclastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Deubiquitylation is an important process for cells to maintain the cellular level of UBQ. Different cellular processes require ubiquitylation. E3 ligase is an enzyme that is involved in the last step of ubiquitylation. E3 ligases like BIR repeat-containing Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (BRUCE) and Mind bomb (Mib) perform different functions. BRUCE can regulate the apoptosis and cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], while Mib can facilitate the internalization of cell surface Delta in signal-sending cell and promote Notch activation in signal-receiving cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The number of UBQ E3 ligases is far greater than that of DUB enzymes, which implies that, as a trend, one DUB enzyme could deubiquitylate the substrates of several E3 ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This fact may explain why our DUB-morphants did not show any unique and specific phenotypes. The resulting normal phenotype in some morphants may be due to the non-specific or/and low dosage of the MOs. Besides, we could not exclude the possibility that some other DUBs could compensate the deubiquitylation process of the knockdown DUB gene. Thus, those 26 DUB genes that did not give phenotypes could be regarded as the "non-essential" DUB genes, while those 59 (including two that are required for survival) DUB genes caused abnormal phenotypes are critical for development.</p></sec><sec><title>Notch signaling and the group I DUB genes</title><p>In the vertebrate neuronal development, formation of excess number of neurons during the neurogenesis will decay through apoptosis to ensure the formation of correct neurons' connection and pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Neuronal death is a normal process happens during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, it is abnormal that there are an increased number of neurons in the developmental process. The selection of the neuronal cell death and/or survival is mainly based on various neurotrophic factors and their related signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Notch signaling is well known for its control of cell fate and regulation of pattern formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Notch is a transmembrane receptor that is involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which was first identified in the mutant fly with "notches" in the wing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Reports had shown that Notch signaling restricts neural differentiation by inhibiting the expression of proneural genes and its deficiency results in neurogenic phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Our <italic>huC in situ </italic>screen identified three group I DUB genes, whose morphants exhibit an increase of neurons, indicating a premature differentiation - a possible consequence of a failure in the Notch-dependent lateral inhibition. Within these morphants, we further confirmed that the expression level of one of the Notch signaling downstream target gene, <italic>her4</italic>, was decreased. These results suggested that group I DUB genes affected Notch signaling directly or indirectly.</p></sec><sec><title>BMP signaling and the group IV DUB genes</title><p>In the <italic>huC </italic>screen, there were four DUB genes whose morphants had severely destructive neuronal patterning. One of the reasons to cause this could be the early defect in dorsoventral patterning. We tested different dorsal and ventral molecular markers at different time points and the results suggested that these morphants are dorsalized. One of the well known pathways involved in the dorsoventral patterning is the BMP pathway, which is required to specify the ventral cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We further underwent the co-injections experiments of mRNA of BMP signaling genes and the DUB MOs to further determine whether these DUBs are involved in the BMP pathway. When we co-injected <italic>smad1 </italic>mRNA and group IV DUB MOs into embryos, the dorsalized phenotypes caused by MO injection alone was rescued, indicating that group IV DUB genes are involved in the BMP pathway. Surprisingly, <italic>bmp4 </italic>mRNA injection with single group IV MO also resulted in ventralized phenotypes, which suggested that their functions might be compensated by others. Thus, we decided to make a combination of MOs among the group IV DUBs. After double knockdown with <italic>bmp4 </italic>overexpression, results showed that there was a shift from V3-V4 phenotypes to dorsalized phenotypes. It is notable that all the experiments could not completely transform the overexpression (ventralized) or knockdown (dorsalized) effects. This observation suggests that group IV DUBs may not simply be involved in the BMP pathway, but also involved in other dorsoventral pathways such as Nodal, Fgf, and Wnt. Reports have shown that these pathways can interact with each others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. We tested different signaling genes mRNA expressions by the real-time PCR. Consistently, results showed that the group IV MO could affect the signaling genes expression slightly but significantly in Nodal, Fgf and Wnt pathways. Details were shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>. It is not surprising that DUBs are involved and function differently in more than one pathway. Many cellular processes involve ubiquitylation, which suggests that one DUB may deubiquitylate more than one substrate. Here, we only showed the knockdown of group IV DUB genes will change the mRNA expression of different signaling genes; however, we did not know exactly how they are regulated and what is the mechanistic details between group IV DUB genes and them. Further biochemical studies have to be conducted in order to fully understand the nature of the DUBs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>From the <italic>in silico </italic>screen, we have identified 91 zebrafish DUB candidate genes belonging to six families. Out of the 85 targets that were subjected to a MO knockdown test: two were found to cause cell death and 57 resulted in pleiotropic developmental phenotypes; the remaining 26 did not show a detectable phenotype. Based on the expression level and pattern changes of <italic>huC</italic>, the 57 cases are classified into five groups. Further functional analyses of group I DUB genes suggest that three DUB genes (<italic>uchl3, otud7b </italic>and <italic>bap1</italic>) are the candidate genes to be functionally associated with the Notch pathway. Group IV DUB genes (<italic>otud4, usp5, usp15 </italic>and <italic>usp25</italic>) appear to be involved in the BMP pathway. Besides, our results suggest that substrates of the E3 ligase in BMP pathway are deubiquitylated more efficiently by two DUBs. To conclude, this paper provides a basic frame for the functional studies of DUB genes and acts as a screening step for researchers to pick up their specific DUB genes for follow-up studies based on the phenotypes. We understand that the screen might not be fully complete and that further research and in-depth studies are required. By releasing the genetic and functional information at this stage, the research efficiency with respect to zebrafish DUB genes will be accelerated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Fish strains and maintenance</title><p>The wild-type strain used in the screen was AB line.

The accessions of these five entries are: (i) UBQ-specific proteases (USPs) with the UBQ C-terminal hydrolase domain (UCH, PF0043), (ii) otubain proteases (OTUs) with the OTU-like cysteine protease domain (OTU, PF02338), (iii) UBQ C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) with the UBQ C-terminal hydrolase family 1 domain (Peptidase_C12, PF1088), (iv) Machado-Joseph disease proteases (MJDs) with the Josephine domain (PF02099) and (v) JAMM motif metalloproteases (JAMMs) with the Mov34/MPN/PAD-1 family domain (PF01398).</p><p>Subsequently, the hits were blasted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] against the zebrafish subset of the non-redundant protein sequence database for finding additional hits among sequences that were not included into the zebrafish genome build. Finally, blast searches against the human subset of the nrdb identified the closest human homologous proteins. Similar procedures were carried out for the PPPDE group and the WLMs (Wss1p-like proteases) group, where we relied on the published alignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and on the PFAM entries PF08325 (WLM) and PF05903 (PPPDE). It should be noted that, depending on the zebrafish genome release and on the inclusion/removal of sequences into/from the non-redundant protein database, the <italic>in silico </italic>search results varied to some degree over time; the results presented here are an integration of the repeated searches.</p></sec><sec><title>Morpholino (MO) sequence site selection and design</title><p>For each putative DUB gene found in the genome-wide <italic>in silico </italic>search, an individual morpholino was designed.

For proteins with obviously missing or incorrect N-termini, we inspected the respective genomic data and tried to find a TIS in agreement with sequences from other organisms. If this was not possible (and for sequences whose MOs for the TIS did not match the minimal MO quality criteria (see below)), we searched for exon/intron boundaries as a possible morpholino sequence site with the goal that the MO targeting site was located on or 5' to the UBQ protease domains.</p><p>Once the initiation site was selected, all potential upstream sequences for MO target oligos were processed with AMOD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Antisense MOs were selected based on the guidelines from Gene Tools (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). Basically, the MOs should have a GC content about 40-60%, less than 37% G content, and without any consecutive tri- or tetra-G nucleotide sequences. In addition, the selected MOs should minimize self or pair sequence homology. Furthermore, MOs that target 5'-UTR were generated for some selected DUB genes to test their specificity. Designed MOs are tabulated (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Morpholino specificity</title><p>Since the screen is a high-throughput knockdown analysis by using MO. Mistakes or non-specific knockdown might happen. However, we have tried our best to confirm the phenotypes by injecting the MOs and examined the phenotypes by at least two researchers. Besides, for those group I genes, we have designed a second MO that targets 5'-UTR region to further verify the knockdown phenotypes. In addition, we also used splicing MOs, which theoretically lead to un-spliced fragments encoding a stop codon within, and 5mis-match MOs of group IV DUBs to confirm that our knockdown results were specific and efficient.
