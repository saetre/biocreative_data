Their long-term actions are accomplished by promoting the expression of specific genes whereas faster responses are achieved by direct phosphorylation of downstream effectors located throughout the cell. In this study we determined that hERK1 translocates to the mitochondria of HeLa cells upon a proliferative stimulus. In the mitochondrial environment, hERK1 physically associates with (i) at least 5 mitochondrial proteins with functions related to transport (i.e. VDAC1), signalling, and metabolism; (ii) histones H2A and H4; and (iii) other cytosolic proteins. This work indicates for the first time the presence of diverse ERK-complexes in mitochondria and thus provides a new perspective for assessing the functions of ERK1 in the regulation of cellular signalling and trafficking in HeLa cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>ERK1 and ERK2 are members of the MAPK family of signalling proteins and play key roles in the transduction of extracellular stimuli into cellular responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Robinson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Roux1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Induction of this signalling cascade leads to the phosphorylation of several target proteins that regulate cellular fate and other physiological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Yoon1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The ultimate effects of ERK1/2 activation are determined by the phosphorylation of its downstream effectors located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, as well as in other cellular compartments. Indeed, the ubiquitous nature of ERK1/2 action is reflected in an ever-expanding list of ERK1/2 substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Robinson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Poderoso1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The long-term actions of ERK1/2 are accomplished by promoting the expression of genes under the control of specific transcription factors, including Elk-1, Myc, Myb and the cAMP-response element. Activation of gene expression is preceded by the translocation of activated ERK1/2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Chen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Lenormand1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. ERK1 and 2 are coexpressed in most tissues, are very similar in sequence and have been generally thought to be interchangeable. While recent evidence suggests that the ERK kinases are not functionally redundant and may have very different roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Lloyd1">&#x0005b;see 8 for review&#x0005d;</xref>, further studies are needed to assess the interplay between the two proteins and its effects on signalling dynamics. Increasing evidence suggests the existence of non-genomic effects of ERK. Shaul and Seger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Shaul1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> showed that an alternative splice variant of ERK1 can participate in Golgi fragmentation during mitosis, while Klemke <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Klemke1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that ERK phosphorylates myosin light chain kinase, a critical step in the regulation of myosin light chain function in contractility and cell migration. Poderoso <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Poderoso1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> observed that ERK1/2 activation by cAMP results in maximal steroidogenic rate.</p><p>ERK is present in mitochondria. Alonso <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Alonso1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> reported the existence of ERK1/2 in the outer membrane and intermembrane space of brain mitochondria. The translocation of ERK1/2 to brain mitochondria follows a developmental pattern, peaking at stages E19-P2 and decreasing from P3 to adulthood. Baines <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Baines1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> have shown the presence of ERK in murine heart mitochondria and a PKC&#x003b5;-ERK module appears to play a role in PKC&#x003b5;-mediated cardioprotection. Poderoso <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Poderoso1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> reported the presence of ERK1/2 in the mitochondria of Leydig-transformed MA-10 cell line, and concluded that mitochondrial ERK activation was obligatory for PKA mediated steroidogenesis. Finally, Galli <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Galli1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> observed that ERK as well as p38, JNK and their respective MAPKKs are present in the mitochondria of a tumoral cell line, and furthermore that the traffic of these MAPKs in and out of the organelle is regulated by hydrogen peroxide. Although definite functional consequences of ERK localization in mitochondria have not been reported previously, one must consider that phospho-ERK1/2 may regulate mitochondrial activities related to cellular survival and metabolism. In the complex molecular infrastructure that underlies the mechanisms of activation and transduction, ERK orchestrates a series of signalling events that result in the recruitment of many downstream factors, including kinases, transcription factors, and other proteins. ERK present in mitochondria would be expected to form protein complexes involved in regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. Thus, identification of interaction partners of ERK in the organelle may provide important insights into the molecular basis of its putative role as a mitochondrial regulator.</p><p>Protein dimerization is common to numerous mechanisms for the transduction of extracellular signals. Phosphorylation of ERK2 facilitates its dimerization <italic>in vitro</italic>. By equilibrium sedimentation, Khokhlatchev <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Khokhlatchev1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> determined that phosphorylated ERK2 sediments primarily as an 84 kDa species, whereas unphosphorylated ERK2 migrates as a mixture of a lesser fraction of 84 kDa and a predominant fraction of a 42 kDa species. A model of dimerized kinase deduced from the crystal structure of phosphorylated ERK2, proposes the physical basis for dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Canagarajah1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation leads to conformational changes in the two flexible regions of the protein molecule, the activation loop and the C-terminal extension, thereby generating the molecular interfaces for homodimerization. The two ERK2 molecules bind via a hydrophobic zipper complemented by two ion pairs, one on each side of the zipper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Cobb1">&#x0005b;for reviews&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-English1">&#x0005b;see 15 and 16&#x0005d;</xref>. ERK2 also dimerizes when transfected or microinjected into cells, but the process requires its phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Khokhlatchev1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether dimerization is necessary for nuclear localization remains controversial; some authors have observed an enhanced nuclear translocation upon phosphorylation of the kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Khokhlatchev1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Lidke <italic>et al.</italic> (unpublished data of our laboratory) have determined that ERK mutants unable to dimerize retain the ability to translocate to the nucleus, albeit at a slower rate. Casar <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Casar1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> have recently demonstrated that scaffold proteins and ERK dimers are essential for the activation of cytoplasmic but not of nuclear substrates. Dimerization is critical for connecting the scaffolded ERK complex to cognate cytoplasmic substrates. In contrast, nuclear substrates associate with ERK monomers. Philipova and Whitaker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Philipova1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> showed that ERK1 is capable of dimerizing both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Dimerization <italic>in vitro</italic> of the human recombinant protein requires both ERK1 phosphorylation and the intervention of cellular cofactors. Exposure of the resultant high molecular weight complex to &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (&#x003b2;-ME) leads to dissociation. In view of the ambiguous structural and cell biological evidence for the existence and significance of dimerization, further investigation of the role of dimerization in the regulation of ERK trafficking under different cellular conditions is required.</p><p>The genome of animal mitochondria (mtDNA) encodes a small number of proteins, all of which are required for electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, and the RNAs required for the translation machinery, i.e., two rRNAs and 22 tRNAs. The majority of the organelle proteins, including a large number of subunits of the electron transport complexes and the totality of the ribosomal proteins, are specified by nuclear genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Attardi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the contributions of both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are required for maintaining functional oxidative phosphorylation, an appropriate balance of ribosomes and mRNAs, as well as intrinsic mitochondrial functions such as the synthesis of heme, purines and Fe-S clusters. From this perspective, the regulation of mtDNA transcription is an issue of major importance.</p><p>In the present study, we adopted a functional proteomic approach to gain insights into ERK-dependent signalling in mitochondria of HeLa cells. While both ERK1 and 2 are found in mitochondria, we focused our attention in this initial study on ERK1. We determined that ERK1 forms signalling complexes in the organelle and identified the components of these complexes. These proteins participate in multiple physiological pathways such as lipid metabolism, oxidative balance and anion transport. In addition, ERK interacts with histones and these nuclear proteins are present in the OMM of HeLa cells. We also evaluated the nature of ERK dimerization, and the role of the mitochondrion in this process. Finally, we assessed the potential role of ERK in the modulation of HeLa mitochondrial gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Purity and integrity of the mitochondrial fraction</title><p>The procedures for the isolation of mitochondria from HeLa cells and the evaluation of purity are provided in the supporting online material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s002">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s011">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>).

HeLa cells were transfected with hERK1-GFP and further stained with a specific mitochondrial marker, MitoTracker RED CMXRos, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Approximately 15&#x00025; of the hERK1-GFP molecules localized in mitochondria, 30&#x00025; in the nuclear compartment and the rest were distributed in cytosol in 24 h serum starved HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007541-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, A&#x02013;C). Mitochondrial hERK1-GFP content was greatly reduced in the organelles of not serum deprived cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s003">Fig. S2</xref>). Stimulation with fetal calf serum (FCS) led to a redistribution of hERK1-GFP among the different subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007541-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, A&#x02013;F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s014">Movie S1</xref>). The predominant effect was a net import of ERK into the nucleus with the corresponding depletion of the cytosolic pool. An additional early event was the entry of ERK into mitochondria, followed by an exit synchronized with the translocation to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007541-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, A&#x02013;F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s014">Movie S1</xref>). The interdependence of nuclear and mitochondrial ERK was revealed by analysis of the slopes of the redistribution curves during 7&#x02013;20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007541-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The rate of ERK entry into the nuclear compartment (0.5&#x00025; of initial value/min) was approximately equal to the sum of ERK depletion from the mitochondria and cytosol (&#x02212;0.5 and &#x02212;0.1&#x00025;/min, respectively). No hERK1 redistribution was observed in the absence of FCS stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s004">Fig. S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s015">Movie S2</xref>).

Using this approach we have demonstrated the physical associations of hERK1 with structural, signalling, transport and metabolic proteins in the mitochondria of HeLa cells. Most of the proteins found to be physically associated with ERK were not previously known as interaction partners of this kinase.</p><p>We found that ERK interacts with histones, and confirmed the presence of these nuclear proteins in the proximity of the OMM in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s008">Fig. S7</xref>). We performed a variety of contamination controls to establish the integrity and purity of the mitochondrial fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s002">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s011">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>). Nonetheless, further research is required to ascertain the physiological relevance of ERK-histone complexes in, on and near mitochondria. Perhaps the best-characterized direct link between signal transduction and chromatin modification is seen in mammalian cells upon mitogen stimulation. H3 and other chromatin-associated proteins, such as HMG14, are rapidly and transiently phosphorylated in response to stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Roth1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation occurs at serine 10 of the H3 N-terminal tail, and the time course of H3 phosphorylation closely corresponds to the transient expression of activated immediate-early genes, suggesting that this histone modification is linked to transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Roth1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 37&#x0005d;</xref>. In the same sense, phosphorylation of a yeast histone H2A at the C-terminal serine 129 is of central importance in double-strand break repair. Phosphorylation destabilizes chromatin structures and thereby facilitates access of repair proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Fink1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings support the notion that histones H2A and H4 are bound to hERK1 in mitochondria of HeLa. In the single previous study of histones in mitochondria, Okamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Okamura1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> reported that H1.2 is located in mitochondria of SCCTF cells along with BAK. Furthermore, Konishi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Konishi1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> suggested that H1.2 translocation from nuclei to cytosol transduced the apoptogenic signals arising from DNA damage to mitochondria, by causing cytochrome c release, presumably by interaction with BAK. Our group have suggested that mitochondria are common sites for phosphorylation of kinases and other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Poderoso1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Galli1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, Poderoso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Poderoso1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> have demonstrated that there was an interaction between mitochondrial StAR and ERK1/2, and as a result of this binding ERK1/2 phosphorylated StAR at Ser 232. Ser 2 in H2A, and Ser 2 and Ser 48 in H4 are embedded in an ERK phosphorylation motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Pearson1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and both histones also display putative ERK docking domains in their amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s007">Fig. S6</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Zhou1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Pearson1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is plausible that ERK may phosphorylate these histones. An interesting possibility is that phosphorylated H2A and H4 serve as &#x0201c;sensors&#x0201d; of available ATP and of normal electron transfer chain function and coupling to oxidative phosphorylation, thereby constituting informative molecules for activation of the cell cycle under proliferative conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007541-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).

Activation or inhibition of FAS and HAD may result in the modulation of AcCoA mitochondrial concentration, which is a potent regulator of mitochondrial oxidations. Further, we propose that ERK may have a modulatory role on antioxidant enzymes such as Prx3, as well as on ATPase, resulting in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and thereby of superoxide anion and mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007541.s009">Fig. S8</xref>).</p><p>Galli <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007541-Galli1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> showed that ERK1/2 exposure to low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration favoured the interaction with MEK, while higher doses impeded this binding capacity.
