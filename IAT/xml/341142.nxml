Previously published molecular studies have confirmed the structural homology between v-src and two of the Drosophila sequences. We have sequenced a portion of the third v-src-related Drosophila gene and found that it also shares structural homology with vertebrate and Drosophila src-family genes. RNA sequences from each of the src genes are present in pre-blastoderm embryos indicating that they are of maternal origin. As embryogenesis proceeds, the levels of each of the src RNA sequences decline. The pre-blastoderm src gene transcripts contain poly(A) and are present on polyribosomes suggesting that they are functional mRNAs. Since the Drosophila src transcripts were maternally inherited, we also investigated their distribution in adult females. The majority of the src transcripts in adult females were contained in ovaries. Only low levels of the transcripts were detected in males. These results strongly suggest that an abundant supply of src protein is required during early embryogenesis, perhaps at the time of cellularization of the blastoderm nuclei.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0338-a" xlink:role="2157"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0345-a" xlink:role="2164"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0334.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2153"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0335.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2154"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0336.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2155"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0337.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2156"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0338.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2157"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0339.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2158"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0340.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2159"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0341.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2160"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0342.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2161"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0343.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2162"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0344.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2163"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0345.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2164"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0346.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2165"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0347.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2166"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0348.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2167"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0349.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2168"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0350.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2169"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0351.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2170"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
