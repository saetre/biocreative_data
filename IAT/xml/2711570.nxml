Tissue stem cells usually operate at a steady state, producing one daughter stem cell and one differentiated cell through each division. The division of stem cells is largely controlled by their inductive microenvironment, termed the stem cell niche, which is formed by stable supporting cells often called niche cells (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>). The concept of a stem cell niche was first proposed for the human hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trentin, 1970</xref>). A major challenge in stem cell biology is to define the properties of niche cells and mechanisms through which they regulate the behavior of stem cells.</p><p>The organization of niche cells and their essential function in regulating stem cell self-renewal were first defined in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Spradling, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cox et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie and Spradling, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King and Lin, 1999</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary and testis are essentially tubular structures, with the apical end consisting of somatic niche cells that are in contact with germline stem cells (GSCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin, 2004</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin, 2002</xref>). Each <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ovary consists of 16&#x02013;18 tubular structures called ovarioles. In each ovariole, 8&#x02013;10 terminal filament (TF) cells form a stack at the very anterior end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;D</xref>). Adjacent to them are five to six cap cells that cover the anterior side of two to three GSCs. Oogenesis is initiated when a GSC divides asymmetrically to produce a daughter GSC and a differentiating daughter cell termed the cystoblast. The cystoblast then undergoes four rounds of synchronous divisions with incomplete cytokinesis to produce a germline cyst that contains 16 cells interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges called ring canals (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng and Lin, 2001</xref>). As a 16-cell cyst moves to the middle region of the germarium, two to three somatic stem cells (SSCs) at the periphery of this region divide to produce a monolayer of follicle cells that encapsulate the cyst to form an egg chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Margolis and Spradling, 1995</xref>). The egg chamber then buds off of the germarium and continues to grow and mature. In the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> testis, the 10&#x02013;12 anterior somatic niche cells form a group called the hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). The hub is surrounded and contacted by six to nine GSCs, each of which is flanked by a pair of SSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2004</xref>). A GSC and its two flanking SSCs undergo asymmetrical division in synchrony. After each division, the daughter GSC and SSCs remain in contact with the hub, whereas their sibling cells differentiate into a gonialblast and two somatic cyst cells, respectively. The gonialblast, sandwiched by the two somatic cyst cells, enters four rounds of mitotic divisions to form a 16-cell germline cyst. Subsequent meiotic divisions result in 64 interconnected spermatids.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Yb is localized in discrete spots (Yb bodies) in somatic cells of ovaries and testes.</bold> (A&#x02013;I) Immunofluorescence images of Yb in wild-type and transgenic ovaries (A and C&#x02013;G) and wild-type testes (H and I), with a null <italic>Yb<sup>72</sup></italic> mutant ovary (B) shown as a negative control.

NC, nurse cell.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200903034_RGB_Fig1"/></fig><p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> germ cells contain several specialized cytoplasmic structures, including the spectrosome, fusome, Balbiani body, sponge body, nuage, and U body. The spectrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin and Spradling, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng and Lin, 1997</xref>) is a cytoplasmic organelle rich in membrane skeletal proteins and vesicular materials. In female GSCs, it anchors one pole of the GSC spindle to a niche cell such that the daughter GSC remains associated with the niche cell. The other daughter cell receives a smaller portion of the spectrosome and differentiates to the cystoblast. During the subsequent four cystoblast divisions, the spectrosome grows into an intercellular structure called the fusome that connects the resulting 16 cells in a germline cyst through ring canals. In addition, the fusome is involved in specifying 1 of the 16 cells in the cyst as an oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng and Lin, 1997</xref>).</p><p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> germline cysts also contain Balbiani bodies that are aggregates of mitochondria, ER, Golgi, and other cytoplasmic organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>). Balbiani bodies have been described for many organisms, with a proposed role in the development of germ plasm. In addition to Balbiani bodies, nurse cells and oocytes contain sponge bodies that are associated with RNA and frequently with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilsch-Br&#x000e4;uninger et al., 1997</xref>). Sponge bodies consist of ER-like cisternae, but they are not specialized Golgi complexes. Instead, they are linked to the assembly and transport of maternal products within the oocyte during <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> oogenesis. At present, it is not known whether Balbiani and sponge bodies are related organelles. Interestingly, the sponge body appears to have overlapping functions with the yeast P body, a cytoplasmic structure which is responsible for programmed mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>). This is because Me31B, the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologue of a key component of the P body in yeast called Dhh1p (an activator of decapping; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Coller et al., 2001</xref>), is localized to the sponge body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>). A recently identified U body is also localized in the cytoplasm of the nurse cells and oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu and Gall, 2007</xref>). U bodies contain major U small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs) and associate with P bodies, suggesting that U bodies may be involved in the assembly and storage of snRNPs and regulation of the snRNP&#x02019;s metabolism.</p><p>Another germline-specific organelle is the nuage, a perinuclear structure which is rich in RNA and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahowald, 1971</xref>). The nuage is made up of electron-dense granules. It contains the putative DEAD box RNA helicase Vasa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hay et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lasko and Ashburner, 1990</xref>) and the RNA-binding protein Aubergine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris and Macdonald, 2001</xref>) as well as Maelstrom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Findley et al., 2003</xref>) and Tudor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bardsley et al., 1993</xref>). Because Vasa and Tudor are also essential components of polar granules, which are germ plasm&#x02013;specific organelles in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryo, and because polar granules display nuagelike texture under an electron microscope, the nuage is considered a possible precursor of polar granules and has been suggested to function as an intermediate of cytoplasmic RNP particle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Findley et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast to these specialized structures in the germline, no comparable cytoplasmic structure has been described in somatic cells of the ovary or testis.</p><p><italic>Yb</italic> was the first gene identified to regulate two different types of stem cells in an organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King and Lin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">King et al., 2001</xref>). It encodes a novel protein that is specifically required in ovarian somatic niche cells for the self-renewal of both GSCs and SSCs, which produce germline and follicle cells, respectively. Loss of <italic>Yb</italic> function eliminates GSCs and reduces SSC division, whereas overexpression of <italic>Yb</italic> increases GSC number and causes SSC overproliferation. <italic>Yb</italic> appears to achieve this dual regulatory function via the <italic>piwi</italic>- and <italic>hh</italic>-mediated signaling pathways that emanate from the same niche cells to control GSC and SSC division, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">King et al., 2001</xref>). In addition to its stem cell function, <italic>Yb</italic> is required for follicle cell differentiation by interacting with the <italic>Notch</italic> group of neurogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al. 1995</xref>). The <italic>Notch</italic> group genes function in both prefollicular and follicle cells in the germarium as well as in follicle cells in postgermarial egg chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruohola, et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Yb</italic> is also expected to be expressed in all of these somatic cells for its function in follicle cell differentiation. Because <italic>Yb</italic>-null mutant males are fertile, <italic>Yb</italic> is not required in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King and Lin, 1999</xref>). However, it remains to be determined whether Yb is involved in spermatogenesis.</p><p>The biochemical mechanism by which Yb achieves its regulation of GSC and SSC divisions is also unknown. <italic>Yb</italic> encodes a novel protein with localized regions bearing similarity to DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicases and a Tudor domain. DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicases are involved in many biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rocak and Linder, 2004</xref>), whereas the Tudor domain is a protein&#x02013;protein interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Selenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sprangers et al., 2003</xref>). To explore the biochemical function of the Yb protein, in this study, we report the determination of its expression and subcellular localization pattern. This has led to the discovery of a novel cytoplasmic structure in the somatic cells of the ovary and testis. Furthermore, we describe discrete functional domains of Yb that are responsible for regulating GSC self-renewal, SSC division, and localization to the Yb body. Finally, we report the novel function of Yb in regulating male GSC self-renewal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Yb protein is localized to discrete spherical structures in ovarian somatic cells</title><p>To explore the molecular function of the Yb protein, we examined its expression and localization pattern. Previous RNA in situ hybridization experiments indicated that the <italic>Yb</italic> mRNA is most abundant in TF cells and cap cells of the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King and Lin, 1999</xref>). To detect the Yb protein, we produced affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies against two different Yb peptides (see Materials and methods). Immunofluorescence localization of Yb using these antibodies reveals labeling of discrete spots in all somatic cells in the ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and E&#x02013;G</xref>). These bright spots are present in high density in the cap cell region and are less dense in the follicle cell layer. However, they are absent from many TF cells. In addition to the spots, a low level of diffuse labeling is detectable in the cytoplasm of both somatic and germline cells.</p><p>We verified that the bright, discrete spots but not the diffuse staining represent the Yb protein by the following three additional and independent criteria. First, in the <italic>Yb<sup>72</sup></italic> mutant ovary, in which the Yb protein is truncated upstream of the antibody epitope regions, no discrete Yb spot is detectable, yet the low level of diffuse staining still persists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The much smaller spots seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> (which is shown at a three times higher magnification than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) are spectrin-rich spheres that have been reported for <italic>Yb</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King and Lin, 1999</xref>). Second, when an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-Flag&#x02013;tagged <italic>Yb</italic> transgene that fully rescues the defects of <italic>Yb</italic> mutants (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) was stained using three different monoclonal anti-Flag antibodies and a polyclonal Flag antibody, the same staining pattern was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The Flag-positive spots are again not detectable in the sibling flies that do not carry the <italic>His<sub>6</sub>-Flag-Yb</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Third, we constructed a new N-terminal 5&#x000d7; Flag&#x02013;tagged <italic>Yb</italic> transgene that also fully rescues the <italic>Yb</italic> mutant (see Materials and methods). In this transgene, each Flag is separated by 3 aa residues. When ovaries from flies carrying this transgene were costained by a polyclonal Flag antibody and an anti-Yb antibody, the two antibodies labeled the same discrete spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Once again, these spots were no longer detectable by anti-Flag antibody in the sibling flies that lack the transgene (unpublished data).</p><p>Inspection of the discrete Yb antibody&#x02013;reactive spots at high magnification revealed that they have a distinctive shape and are present singly or in pairs in each cell. The high density of the spots in the cap cell region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A, C, E, and G</xref>) is the result of the small size and squamous shape of these cells, whereas the one to two spots/cell distribution is clearly seen in the larger follicle cells that envelop individual egg chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). This distribution is clearly seen even in a low magnification image focused on the follicle cells at the surface of an egg chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). It is also evident in a sagittal section image of an ovariole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1 G</xref>), in which the Yb spots highlight the somatic cells in germaria and egg chambers.</p></sec><sec><title>Yb protein is also localized to discrete spheres in somatic cells of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> testes</title><p>Although <italic>Yb</italic> mutant males are normal and fertile, previous RNA hybridization and Northern blot analyses indicate that <italic>Yb</italic> is expressed in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King and Lin, 1999</xref>). To examine the expression of the Yb protein in the testis, we conducted similar immunofluorescence microscopy to the wild-type <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> testis. Like in the ovary, the Yb protein is localized in discrete spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, H and I</xref>). Moreover, these spots are highly concentrated in hub cells (the cap cell equivalents in the testis) and present in somatic cyst cells (the follicle cell equivalents in the testis), but they are not detectable in the germline. This testicular expression pattern of Yb, which is parallel to its ovarian expression pattern, indicates that the Yb protein might perform the same function in females and males, even though such function may be redundant in males.</p></sec><sec><title>The Yb-containing sphere is specifically present in gonadal somatic cells in embryos</title><p>To examine whether the Yb-containing spheres also exist during early gonadogenesis, we examined the Yb expression in embryos by double staining wild-type embryos for Yb and Vasa, a germ cell marker. The Yb protein is clearly localized as conspicuous spheres only in the gonadal somatic cells, but Yb expression is not detected in primordial germ cells or any extragonadal somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 J</xref>). Both the size and morphology of the Yb spheres in the embryonic gonadal somatic cells are very similar to those in the adult ovaries and testes, suggesting that, in the embryo, the Yb-containing sphere is specifically present in the gonadal somatic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The Yb-containing sphere does not colocalize with known cytoplasmic organelles in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic></title><p>To examine whether the Yb-containing spheres present any known cytoplasmic organelles, we conducted immunocolocalization experiments of Yb and markers of the known cytoplasmic organelles in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reproductive system.

However, the shape and the location of the Yb body are very different from nuages and sponge bodies. Because nuages and sponge bodies have been implicated in RNA-related processes, we suspected that Yb bodies may have similar functions. To examine whether the Yb body contains RNA, we costained the whole-mount wild-type ovaries with SYTO RNASelect fluorescent cell stain to visualize RNA and the anti-Yb antibody to identify the Yb body (see Materials and methods). Indeed, Yb bodies in both ovaries and testes are often closely apposed to a spherical structure highly enriched in RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, K and L</xref>). The size and the association of this RNA-rich structure correspond to the less electron-dense structure that is associated with the Yb body in cap cells and SSCs. The close association of the Yb body with the RNA-rich structure suggests that these two structures might be involved in RNA-related processes.</p><p>To quantify the Yb protein distribution between the Yb body and the rest of the cytoplasm, we counted the number of gold particles in the Yb body versus the rest of the cytoplasm.

First, the same construct inserted at other genomic sites such as <italic>P[myc-piwi]G47</italic> also expresses the functional <italic>myc-piwi</italic> at normal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cox et al., 2000</xref>).

Second, wild-type flies homozygous for both <italic>G38</italic> and <italic>P[myc-piwi]G47</italic> insertions are normal and fertile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Because both <italic>G38</italic> and <italic>P[myc-piwi]G47</italic> express functional <italic>myc-piwi</italic>, this indicates that even six copies of functional <italic>piwi</italic> genes (four transgenic and two endogenous) in flies do not affect male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cox et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Megosh et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the loss of fertility in these flies is caused by the disruption of a gene by the P element at the insertion site rather than by the increased dosage of <italic>piwi</italic>.

Indeed, the Yb body is frequently located near the germline-contacting side of the cytoplasm. It is possible that the Yb body represents a somatic counterpart to the germline-specific organelles such as nuage, sponge bodies, or Balbiani bodies. The Yb body may be involved in regulating the expression of the signaling machinery at the mRNA level. It will be interesting to identify additional protein and, possibly, RNA components of the Yb bodies and to determine whether the composition of the Yb body varies in different types of cells and tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of Yb in regulating male GSC self-renewal</title><p>The failure of the male GSC maintenance in the <italic>Yb;G38</italic> double mutant but not their corresponding single mutants indicates that Yb and a second gene affected by the <italic>G38</italic> mutation positively regulate the self-renewal of these GSCs in a compensatory manner. This finding provides an opportunity to explore Yb-mediated niche signaling mechanism in regulating male GSC self-renewal by cloning and systematically characterizing the gene disrupted by the <italic>G38</italic> mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional domains of the Yb protein</title><p>Sequence homology searches revealed two conserved protein domains in Yb, a putative DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicase domain and a Tudor domain. These two domains are essential for Yb function because the pAS6 mutation in the Walker B motif of the helicase domain and the <italic>Yb<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation that mutates an extremely well conserved Arg residue in the Tudor domain to a Gln residue both result in loss of GSC maintenance and failure of the protein localization to the Yb body. The precise function of these domains cannot be predicted from sequence alone. DEAH box RNA helicases domains are found in many proteins and are involved in numerous processes. It has been proposed recently that most of these helicases release proteins from RNA rather than unwinding RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fairman et al., 2004</xref>). However, the helicase homologous domain of the Yb protein contains no obvious DEAD box motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King and Lin, 1999</xref>); thus, Yb is unlikely to be an RNA helicase but might still be involved in other RNA-related function. The Tudor domain is currently of unknown function but is present in several RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ponting, 1997</xref>). However, based on the structure of the Tudor domain in the SMN protein, it is more likely to mediate protein&#x02013;protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Selenko et al., 2001</xref>). The Tudor domain of the SMN protein binds to methylated RG tails of SMN proteins with particularly high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sprangers et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, it is rare to see proteins with a combination of a DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicase domain and a Tudor domain. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, two novel and uncharacterized genes, CG31755 and CG11133, encode proteins with this domain combination and share moderate sequence similarity with Yb over most of their lengths. Our search has also revealed CG11133-like genes in <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> but no Yb homologue outside of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, although the Homeless protein displays little sequence homology to the Yb protein, they share the same domain combination. A short part of the Tudor domain is conserved between Yb and Homeless, but the conserved sequence does include the Arg residue critical for function. Thus, even though Homeless is known to be involved in RNA localization and possibly translational regulation in the oocyte, considerable effort is needed to elucidate the biochemical activities of Yb.</p><p>Although sequence homology analysis has not revealed obvious biochemical activities for Yb, our deletional analysis has defined distinct regions of Yb that are responsible for its three different molecular functions: (1) activation of HH expression in somatic niche cells, (2) activation of PIWI expression in somatic niche cells, and (3) Yb body localization and/or organization. This analysis suggests that Yb is a functionally tripartite protein with the N-terminal half required for <italic>hh</italic> expression in cap cells, the C-terminal half required for Yb localization to Yb bodies, and the entire protein needed for <italic>piwi</italic> expression in somatic niche cells. The Yb body localization function requires the Tudor domain but not the helicase homology domain, yet the PIWI expression function requires both domains, including a conserved ATP/GTP-binding site in the helicase domain. Future studies, including the identification of protein interactors specific to different domains of Yb, should help decipher the biochemical functions of these domains as well as reveal other components of the Yb body.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and culture</title><p>All strains were grown at 25&#x000b0;C on yeast-containing molasses/agar medium.
