However, strategies for reverse genetics in zebrafish are mostly limited to the use of antisense oligonucleotides, and therefore the development of other targeting methods is highly desirable. Here, we report an approach to gene targeting in this system in which single-stranded oligonucleotides and zebrafish Rad52 protein are employed. It has been proposed that a single-stranded oligonucleotide containing a mutation can be incorporated into the genome by annealing to the single-stranded region of the lagging strand of the replication fork. Rad52 is expected to accelerate the annealing step. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments using purified truncated Rad52 proteins and replication protein A (RPA) showed that annealing of oligonucleotides is accelerated by Rad52 in the presence of RPA. We developed a simple and sensitive PCR-based method to detect point mutations in the genome. In exploratory experiments, we found that microinjection of single-stranded oligonucleotide targeted to a specific gene together with truncated Rad52 into zebrafish embryos resulted in a low level of recombinant copies in 3 of the 80 embryos tested under these conditions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The concept that single-stranded oligonucleotides can be used to introduce mutations into genomes was first explored by Sherman's laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). A different study showed that M13 single-stranded DNA can also be a substrate for homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Within the past decade, the potential of both unmodified and modified oligonucleotides for gene targeting has been extensively studied with the goal of using this approach for directed mutagenesis and gene therapy of genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Despite their apparent similarities, the methods described seem to involve at least two different recombination pathways. Recombination mediated by unmodified single-stranded oligonucleotides 40&#x02013;70 residues in length exhibited strand specificity determined by the direction of replication through the site, in that the efficiency of single-stranded oligonucleotides that correspond to Okazaki fragments was 2- to 50-fold higher than those representing the complementary strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). High recombination efficiencies (up to 6%) were achieved by overexpressing the &#x003b2; protein of bacteriophage &#x003bb;, a single-strand DNA-annealing protein, while introducing targeting single-stranded oligonucleotides into bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). On the other hand, studies of modified oligonucleotides (both chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides and single-stranded oligonucleotides with phosphorothioate or 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl RNA modifications at the ends) have shown that recombination efficiency correlates with the level of transcription, and is at least 5- to 50-fold higher when the oligonucleotides anneal to the non-template strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The efficiency could be also enhanced by genetic re-engineering of RAD51 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). One study has been published so far that reports recombination of single-stranded corrective DNA of 236 nt with a vector containing a mutated EGFP gene after coinjection with RecA protein into zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>Zebrafish has many advantages as a vertebrate model organism. Its transparent body makes it easier to observe the morphology of organs and cells, and of reporter gene expression. Forward genetic screens using chemical mutagens have been successful in discovering many developmental mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), but strategies for reverse genetics have mostly been limited to the use of antisense oligonucleotides that are effective for a limited period of time only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Recently, methods have been developed for effectively selecting random mutations in a gene of interest by resequencing or enzyme digestion assays (TILLING) after chemical mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). As ES cell-based gene targeting technology is not likely to be available in zebrafish for some years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), other methods that allow introduction of targeted modifications into a gene of interest are highly desirable.</p><p>Early zebrafish embryos undergo cell division every 15 min, and hence DNA replication proceeds rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Further, microinjection of DNA, mRNA or proteins can easily introduce desired reagents into the embryo. These properties of zebrafish make it attractive to pursue the potential of unmodified single-stranded oligonucleotides as site-specific mutagens in this organism. Here, we report the characterization of components of the recombination machinery in zebrafish that are involved in targeted mutagenesis, and we provide preliminary evidence for the ability of an unmodified single-stranded oligonucleotide to introduce a site-specific base substitution into the zebrafish genome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Zebrafish Rad52 expression constructs</title><p>The nuclear localization signal from the zebrafish Rad52 C-terminus was generated by annealing of two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides, BamHI&#x02013;Rad52NLS&#x02013;BclI: 5&#x02032;-gatccAGACACGGCCAGATGATGAAGAAACGAAGATTGGACACGT-3&#x02032; and BclI&#x02013;SLN25daR&#x02013;BamHI: 5&#x02032;-gaTCACGTGTCCAATCTTCGTTTCTTCATCATCTGGCCGTGTCTg-3&#x02032;.

RPA is known to associate with single-stranded DNA in the replication fork and prevent annealing. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments therefore tested whether Rad52 could displace zebrafish RPA from the DNA and facilitate annealing. Having found that this did happen <italic>in vitro</italic>, we tested the ability of single-stranded oligonucleotide co-injected with Rad52 to introduce a targeted mutation into a gene within the zebrafish genome <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec><title>Cloning of zebrafish Rad52</title><p>The coding region of Rad52 was PCR-amplified from a cDNA library of 24 h stage zebrafish embryos. We could not amplify the Rad52 coding region with primers designed from GeneScan prediction data (Sanger Center genome database), but we were able to find end sequences of zebrafish Rad52 in the genome database by using very short amino acid sequences from chicken (19-CFGQY-23, numbering is based on zebrafish sequence) and medaka (427-MKKRRLDT*-434) as BLAST queries. There is an in-frame stop codon (TAG) upstream of the ATG initiation codon in the sequence we derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but we cannot exclude the possible existence of additional upstream exons. We found two splice variants, a short isoform with an internal deletion within the Rad51-binding domain, and a longer isoform that is similar to Rad52 of other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Zebrafish Rad52 showed high sequence homology to other species in the N-terminal half that has DNA-binding and self-association domains, as documented before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The sequence of the C-terminal half is rather diverged except in the RPA-binding region, a small stretch in the Rad51-binding domain, and a nuclear localization signal.

Although intact Rad52 could be isolated from this preparation, we reasoned that the region relevant for our purpose was probably represented by the N-terminal DNA-binding domain, and possibly by the RPA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Therefore, several Rad52 constructs truncated at the C-terminus were made, each containing a nuclear localization signal (see Materials and Methods). The deletion constructs ending in 327G, 342T, 355W, 362I and 376P showed multiple proteolytic fragments, whereas 204Q, 205T, 206N, 317Q and 369S were isolated mostly intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and data not shown). Rad52 1&#x02013;204Q NLS and Rad52 1&#x02013;317Q NLS were chosen for further analysis, although some tests were also done with full-length Rad52.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression and purification of RPA proteins</title><p>We could not obtain soluble RPA proteins by expressing them individually as GST-fusion proteins (data not shown). Previous studies with yeast and human RPA showed that these proteins could be expressed in soluble form when all three subunits were expressed simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Therefore, we generated a triple expression construct in which GST-RPA14, RPA32 and RPA70 were expressed from a tricistronic mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Using this construct, a fraction of GST-RPA14 and RPA32 were expressed in soluble form, but RPA70 was insoluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, we tried to refold the RPA proteins. Inclusion bodies were purified and solubilized in a high-pH buffer supplemented with <italic>N</italic>-laurylsarcosine and DTT. After dialysis, most of the protein remained soluble. It has been reported that RPA70, 32 and 14 form a tight heterotrimeric complex, which presumably accounts for the fact that RPA32 and 70 were co-purified with GST-RPA14 on glutathione beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). This heterotrimeric complex of zebrafish RPA proteins could bind strongly to poly(dT)<sub>50</sub> and poly(dC)<sub>50</sub>, but weakly to poly(dA)<sub>50</sub> and poly(dG)<sub>50</sub>, as previously reported in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Rad52 facilitates annealing of oligonucleotides in the presence of RPA</title><p>Annealing of the two complementary oligonucleotides studied occurred slowly at 22&#x000b0;C when no protein was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, control). This annealing was significantly accelerated by both truncated Rad52 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), as expected from the fact that these deletion proteins retain the N-terminal DNA-binding domain. It has been reported that incubation of both strands with yeast RPA inhibits annealing of complementary oligonucleotides, and that Rad52 can displace RPA and mediate annealing if both proteins are from the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Zebrafish RPA likewise inhibited annealing of oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right). Addition of Rad52 1&#x02013;317Q NLS to RPA-bound oligonucleotides resulted in annealing of the oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, middle), as expected because this Rad52 derivative retains the RPA-binding domain.

Similar results were obtained when full-length zebrafish Rad52 or &#x003b2; protein of bacteriophage &#x003bb; were used (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Microinjection of unmodified single-stranded oligonucleotide and Rad52 1&#x02013;317Q NLS can induce a targeted mutation into the zebrafish genome</title><p>Having tested the reagents <italic>in vitro</italic>, we investigated whether single-stranded oligonucleotides and Rad52 proteins can be used for site-specific base substitution of the zebrafish genome. We chose the <italic>bruno-like</italic> gene (<italic>brul</italic>) as a target. This gene is expressed maternally and the mRNA is localized to the vegetal pole of early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). The genomic sequence of the <italic>brul</italic> gene was obtained from the Sanger Center genome database, and the sequence around the targeted site was verified by resequencing. The targeting oligonucleotides are homologous to the exon sequence except for a single-nucleotide substitution, which was chosen so that it will introduce an in-frame stop codon into the <italic>brul</italic> ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>During the process of Okazaki fragment maturation in mammals, the first &#x0223c;30 nt are synthesized by DNA polymerase &#x003b1; that has no proof-reading activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), and are subsequently displaced by DNA polymerase &#x003b4; from the upstream direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). This is in contrast to the situation in yeast where only 2&#x02013;3 nt are displaced by DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). As DNA replication in zebrafish is likely to follow the mammalian pattern, we designed targeting oligonucleotides that have a longer distance between the mutation site and the 5&#x02032; end, in addition to targeting oligonucleotides that have the mutation site at their center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As we do not know the direction of DNA replication at the site, we designed both sense and antisense oligonucleotides.</p><p>We developed a PCR-based mutation detection system in which one of two PCR primers matches only the mutant template, but is mismatched to the wild-type template at its 3&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Previously, this strategy has been hampered by the emergence of false-positive bands caused by mispriming and/or &#x02018;mis-elongation&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). We tested different conditions for amplification using a dilution series of mutant plasmid DNA in the presence of a level of genomic DNA that was higher than that encountered in the actual experiments. The conditions chosen (see Materials and Methods) allow us to detect one mutant copy in 1000 or 10&#x02009;000 wild-type copies of the template using 38 or 42 cycles of amplification, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>); faint false positive bands appeared with 46 cycles (data not shown). This sensitivity matches the recently developed LigAmp method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). The method can be used reliably for large numbers of samples as long as the conditions are carefully controlled.</p><p>Exploratory <italic>in vivo</italic> targeting experiments were carried out using the reagents and conditions generated through our <italic>in vitro</italic> tests. In these experiments, we calibrated the assay by diluting mutant plasmid DNA into genomic DNA extracted from embryos at the same stage as the injected embryos, and we applied the same level of total DNA (equivalent to 1/20th of one embryo) on each lane. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of the assay was again &#x0223c;1 mutant copy in 1000 wild-type copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, Controls). To test for targeted recombination, the oligonucleotide/Rad52 mixture was injected into one-cell stage embryos (see Materials and Methods, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> legend), and the embryos were allowed to develop to the shield-to-80% epiboly stage. Injection of Rad52 did not affect embryonic development, but the oligonucleotides are toxic. The concentration used was chosen to give a 50% survival by mid-gastrulation; embryos that survived to this stage continued normal development for several days, but we did not attempt to raise them to adulthood. Genomic DNA was extracted from individual-injected embryos and tested in the PCR-based mutation detection assay. We tested 80 embryos for each condition, i.e. for each of the oligonucleotides shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> at two protein concentrations (see Materials and Methods). When using pBrul target As-10 oligonucleotide and Rad52 1&#x02013;317Q NLS protein at a level of 660 fmol/nl, we found three apparent recombinants among 80 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). No recombinants were detected using an 8-fold lower level of Rad52 1&#x02013;317Q NLS protein, or with any of the other oligonucleotides tested. In the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, the intensities of the bands suggest that 2&#x02013;3 mutant copies are present for 1000 wild-type copies in sample 62 and &#x0223c;1 per 1000 in samples 64 and 66. These results were reproduced in an independent PCR experiment with the same template DNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Pioneering work in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) prompted us to pursue the possibility that unmodified single-stranded oligonucleotides and annealing enzymes might be capable of mediating site-directed base substitution in the zebrafish genome. In this paper, we report the biochemical basis for this approach. It is known that when both strands of two complementary oligonucleotides are bound by RPA, Rad52 can displace the RPA and mediate annealing. For this activity, species-specific interactions between RPA and Rad52 are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). It was not known whether annealing of oligonucleotides can be accelerated by Rad52 when only one strand is bound by RPA, and whether species-specific interactions of RPA and Rad52 are involved. These questions are relevant to events that should happen at the replication fork in unmodified single-stranded oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. Crystal structures of both Rad52 and RPA suggest that the phosphate backbone of single-stranded DNA is bound by both proteins while the bases remain exposed to the solvent, making them accessible from the outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). But it is still difficult to predict the outcome of an annealing event, because annealing of the oligonucleotides would require gross conformational changes of both proteins if they remain bound through the process. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results showed that annealing of oligonucleotides was accelerated by truncated Rad52 and by &#x003b2; protein when only one strand was bound by RPA, and that species-specific interactions between RPA and Rad52 do not appear to be necessary. This suggests that truncated Rad52 proteins that retain only the annealing domain and even &#x003b2; protein of bacteriophage &#x003bb; might be utilized in unmodified single-stranded oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis in animal cells.</p><p>In our exploratory <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, we found a low frequency of recombinants when we microinjected pBrul target As-10 oligonucleotide with Rad52 1-317Q NLS protein. It is reasonable that we found recombinants by using an oligonucleotide whose 5&#x02032; homology region is longer than 30, but which still carries a sufficient region of homology 3&#x02032; of the targeted site. Further, the highest concentration of protein that was tested appeared to be the most effective. We found apparent recombinants in 3 of the 80 embryos tested with this particular combination of protein concentration and targeting oligonucleotide. The intensity of the PCR product suggests that only a small number of targeted copies existed in the genomes of these embryos, presumably because recombination took place in one of several hundred cells at the blastula stage. But optimal design principles of targeting oligonucleotides and the optimal domain architecture of Rad52 proteins remain to be determined in future studies. Various ways of delivery, such as expression of annealing enzymes from transgenes, may also be tested. We believe that, if this method is to be practical for mutagenesis, the overall frequency needs to be increased greatly.</p><p>Finally, we developed a simple and sensitive PCR-based mutation detection system. As this system does not require any special equipment or reagents other than commercially available hot start polymerases, it can be used as a cost-effective point mutation detection system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Sergey Gaidamakov of the LMG, NICHD, NIH for help in ion exchange chromatography.
