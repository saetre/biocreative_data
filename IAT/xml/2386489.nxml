Furthermore, <italic>A. nidulans </italic>has been a classical model organism for studies of development biology and gene regulation, and thus it has become one of the best-characterized filamentous fungi. It was the first <italic>Aspergillus </italic>species to have its genome sequenced, and automated gene prediction tools predicted 9,451 open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome, of which less than 10% were assigned a function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this work, we have manually assigned functions to 472 orphan genes in the metabolism of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, by using a pathway-driven approach and by employing comparative genomics tools based on sequence similarity. The central metabolism of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, as well as biosynthetic pathways of relevant secondary metabolites, was reconstructed based on detailed metabolic reconstructions available for <italic>A. niger </italic>and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and information on the genetics, biochemistry and physiology of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. Thereby, it was possible to identify metabolic functions without a gene associated, and to look for candidate ORFs in the genome of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>by comparing its sequence to sequences of well-characterized genes in other species encoding the function of interest. A classification system, based on defined criteria, was developed for evaluating and selecting the ORFs among the candidates, in an objective and systematic manner. The functional assignments served as a basis to develop a mathematical model, linking 666 genes (both previously and newly annotated) to metabolic roles. The model was used to simulate metabolic behavior and additionally to integrate, analyze and interpret large-scale gene expression data concerning a study on glucose repression, thereby providing a means of upgrading the information content of experimental data and getting further insight into this phenomenon in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrate how pathway modeling of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>can be used as an approach to improve the functional annotation of the genome of this organism.

This genus encompasses a large diversity of species of great medical and economical relevance. In the medical and agricultural fields, <italic>A. flavus </italic>and <italic>A. parasiticus </italic>represent major producers of mycotoxins (e.g. aflatoxins) that can contaminate important food and feed crops, while <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>may cause serious diseases in immuno-compromised animals and humans (e.g. invasive pulmonary aspergillosis). From a biotechnological viewpoint, <italic>Aspergillus </italic>species represent important industrial producers of diverse products, such as industrial enzymes (e.g. amylases by <italic>A. niger </italic>and <italic>A. oryzae</italic>), bulk chemicals (e.g. citric acid by <italic>A. niger</italic>), and pharmaceuticals (e.g. lovastatin, a cholesterol lowering-agent, by <italic>A. terreus</italic>).</p><p>Whereas the first efforts made in fungal genome research have focused on yeasts, there has been an increasing focus on filamentous fungi due to their medical, agricultural and biotechnological importance. There are quite large differences between yeast and most filamentous fungal genomes, with the latter exhibiting larger genomes owing to larger centromers and lower gene density per nucleotide length as well as the presence of far more genes. Furthermore, many of the filamentous fungal genes have a more complex structure due to the presence of multiple introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>A. nidulans </italic>has become one of the model organisms of choice for filamentous fungal genome research as it is a representative of the important group of aspergilli, but also because this fungus has served as a model organism for studies of cell development and gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is one of the most extensively studied organisms in the fields of genetics and biochemistry, and this is obviously of great value in the identification of the function of orphan filamentous fungal genes and characterization of the biological roles of their products.</p><p>Genome-sequencing projects of several <italic>Aspergillus </italic>species have recently been completed (<italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, <italic>A. niger</italic>, <italic>A. oryzae</italic>, <italic>A. parasiticus</italic>) or are nearing completion (<italic>A. flavus</italic>, <italic>A. terreus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In particular, the genomic sequence of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>(strain FGSC A4) was released by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, with a13-fold coverage, in Spring 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The size of its genome is approximately 31 Mb, and it is organized in 8 chromosomes. 9,541 open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted using automated gene prediction tools (FGENESH, FGENESH+, and GENEWISE), and PFAM (protein family) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] matches were identified by Hmmer analysis. However, due to the highly conservative criteria adopted in the gene naming process, and also due to the relative low number of genes characterized before whole genome sequencing, more than 90% of all ORFs identified are called hypothetical or predicted proteins.</p><p>In order to improve the predictions and improve the annotation, automatically assigned genes should be subjected to manual curation. Herein, integration of different types of data and combination of diverse genomic tools play a major role. Functional assignments of genes based on genomic data may be complemented with information providing biochemical and physiological evidence. Of special importance in functional genomics are high-throughput data generated by post-genomic techniques (e.g. transcriptome data using hybridization arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]), which provide genome-wide screens of gene function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition to similarity-based tools (e.g. BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], FASTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]), a number of methods are available for comparative genomics that combine various types of genomic evidence, such as protein fusion events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], gene clustering on the chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], occurrence profiles or signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], shared regulatory sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], which enable the so-called "gene context analysis" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Metabolic reconstructions can give a valuable contribution to functional genomics, by uncovering missing metabolic functions (i.e., functions not assigned to genes) and hence putting forward the identification of the corresponding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The underlying idea is that larger functional systems (e.g. metabolic pathways) require the presence of their components or elementary functional units (e.g. enzymatic steps) in order to be operative. Hence, in this approach, efforts are directed towards discovering (uncharacterized) genes within the sequenced genome that have a defined role in the metabolism, in opposition to strategies that aim at predicting the functions of a given set of genes known to be present. Comparative genome analysis may then be accomplished with well-characterized genes of related organisms, by employing diverse tools of comparative genomics (based on sequence similarity and gene context), and a prioritized list of potential candidate genes for the function of interest generated. The functional assignment of genes may be verified eventually by using experimental techniques. This approach has been previously described by Osterman and Overbeek [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and a computational method has been developed for automated large-scale predictions of protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This framework has been applied to prokaryotes (<italic>Thiobacillus ferrooxidans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) and eukaryotes (human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]), and here we used it for the annotation of metabolic genes within the genome of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>.</p><p>In particular, we focused on the functional annotation of the genes involved in the central metabolism of this fungus, as well as on the biosynthetic pathways of relevant secondary metabolites. For the purpose, we reconstructed the central metabolic network of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, based on detailed metabolic reconstructions of other eukaryotes, namely <italic>A. niger </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and <italic>Mus musculus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In what concerns the secondary metabolism, pathways for the biosynthesis of penicillin in <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and aflatoxins in different species of <italic>Aspergillus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] were used as templates. Pathway prediction was also supported by available information on the biochemistry and physiology of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. Our analysis assigned functions to 472 orphan ORFs in the metabolism of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, by employing similarity-based tools of comparative genomic analysis (BLAST) and using public (non-redundant) databases of genes and proteins of established function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These functions represented either missing enzymatic activities, for which no ORFs had been previously identified, or previously assigned functions, for which additional isogenes were discovered. The functional assignments made for the individual ORFs were integrated into a mathematical model that can be used to simulate metabolic behavior, thereby enabling a comprehensive and integrative analysis of metabolic functions in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. Furthermore, the information contained in the metabolic reconstruction can be exploited for the analysis of large-scale transcription data. To illustrate this, the reconstructed metabolic network of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>was used in connection with an algorithm developed by Patil and Nielsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] for the large-scale analysis of gene expression profiles, in particular for studying transcriptional responses to specific genetic changes in <italic>A. nidulans </italic>(deletion of the regulatory gene <italic>creA</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In a previous study, the metabolic network reconstructed in this work was employed in the study of the effects of changes in the environmental conditions (carbon source) on the transcriptome profiles of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Metabolic reconstruction and identification of candidate ORFs</title><p>The pathways predicted to take part in the central metabolism of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, as well as those involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites of interest, are listed in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. Our analysis assigned metabolic roles to 472 ORFs within the genome of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>that had not been annotated earlier (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In total, 666 ORFs were associated to functions in the metabolic reconstruction, including 194 previously annotated ORFs in the <italic>Aspergillus nidulans </italic>Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the correlation between the ORFs and metabolic functions is rather complex, because about 92 ORFs were found to be constituents of enzyme complexes, more than 100 ORFs were considered to be multifunctional, and approximately 190 ORFs to encode various isoenzymes. The reconstructed metabolic network included 676 unique biochemical reactions (551 cytosolic, 103 mitochondrial, 5 glyoxysomal, and 17 extracellular) and 113 unique transport processes. The analysis did not include transporters, and hence the transport reactions considered were based on those existing in related organisms, based on previous annotations for <italic>A. nidulans </italic>or concerned diffusional processes.

In addition, the model included 732 metabolites that could be balanced, i.e. metabolites whose net rate of their formation could be balanced with their net rate of consumption. Out of the 1213 reactions, there were 794 unique reactions (681 unique biochemical conversions and 113 unique transport processes), i.e. 419 of the reactions in the metabolic network were redundant.

Besides catabolic and biosynthetic pathways, the model also included polymerization reactions and a reaction describing the formation of biomass, which was considered as a drain of building blocks or macromolecules in appropriate ratios to produce 1 mmol of monomers in the macromolecule or 1 g dry-weight (DW), respectively. These ratios were calculated based on the composition of the macromolecules in terms of building blocks (taken from <italic>A. oryzae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) and on the composition of biomass in terms of macromolecules (taken from <italic>A. nidulans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] for lipids and <italic>A. oryzae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] for the remaining macromolecules).

ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], only 194 of the metabolic ORFs included in the metabolic model developed for <italic>A. nidulans </italic>had been assigned a function in the metabolism before this study, and hence there was a large potential for functional annotation of metabolic genes. This potential was demonstrated by the functional assignment of 472 orphan ORFs. Yet, a number of issues arose in the course of the annotation of the metabolic genes in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>.</p><p>One of these issues was related to limitations inherent to a pathway-driven gene finding approach. In particular, the use of metabolic networks from selected organisms as references does not allow the identification of metabolic functions that are not present in these templates. In this way, additional or alternative reactions or pathways to these templates that may make part of the metabolic network of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>will not be predicted to exist, and subsequently the corresponding genes will not be identified using this methodology. In order to minimize this, the metabolic networks used as reactions databases in this work concerned organisms closely related to <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, and thus the major part of the metabolic reactions present in this fungus were likely to be covered.</p><p>Another issue is that our identification of candidate ORFs encoding a given function relied on comparative analysis, based on sequence similarity between the proteins in <italic>A. nidulans </italic>and other organisms. However, there probably exist enzymes in <italic>A. nidulans </italic>that are encoded by genes with low similarity to those encoding the same function in other organisms. Hence, queries based on BLAST searches will not result in identification of such genes. This problem was partially overcome by using, as queries, proteins of phylogenetically related organisms, for which many genes are likely to be conserved.</p><p>As alternatives to analytical tools relying on sequence similarity, there are tools based on genome context. However, gene clustering on the chromosome and analysis of shared regulatory sites as well as motif profiling are mainly relevant for comparative genomics in prokaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The selection of ORFs among the candidates encoding each function involved the specification of certain criteria and the development of a classification system. Hereby the reliability of the assignment of specific metabolic functions to candidate ORFs could be evaluated objectively and systematically, and furthermore it was possible to classify each annotation into categories according to the criteria defined. These criteria were essentially based on the E-values of BLAST searches and on the consistency between the function of interest and the function of the BLAST hits. All ORFs that were classified into at least one of the categories defined (A/A*, F, Y/Y* and O/O*, see Material and Methods &#x02013; Evaluation of functional assignments) were considered in the metabolic model, whereas the ORFs that did not fall into any of the categories were not incorporated in the model. The categories A*, Y*, and O* were included to take into account also those ORFs for which the results from the comparative analysis were not conclusive, but did not contradict the function in question (e.g. aldose reductase <italic>versus </italic>xylose reductase; mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase <italic>versus </italic>cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase). In this way, we aimed at identifying all ORFs that were associated to a given function (which might also represent isoenzymes or subunits of enzyme complexes), even though, by not being so stringent, we may have run into the problem of also finding false positives. Furthermore, assignment of ORFs to these categories may be valuable in future annotation studies.</p><p>The choice of the cut-off E-value in the BLAST searches is obviously determining the quality of our annotation. A number of factors influence the E-values in BLAST searches, such as the length of the queries and the size of the databases. Hence, the candidate ORFs were ranked according to the score to length ratio, as it hereby was possible to compensate for the fact that smaller proteins lead to higher E-values (smaller scores) in BLAST searches, because the probability of finding them by chance in the database is higher. Moreover, in order to have an idea on the order of magnitude of reasonable E-values for the different BLAST searches, previously annotated ORFs were used as positive controls. However, universal criteria may not apply, since the proteins' sequences may have diverse properties in the different parts of the metabolism (size, content, etc). Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was performed, in which different cut-off values in the E-values were considered in the BLAST searches. The stringency of this criterion determined the number of metabolic functions assigned to ORFs, as well as the number of ORFs considered for each function (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). A cut-off of 1E-50 in the E-values was found to be reasonable and hence this value was chosen for all BLAST searches in the selection of candidate ORFs and development of the metabolic model.</p><p>On the other hand, the differences in the order of magnitude of the E-values in the different BLASTP searches carried out can explain the fact that some ORFs were not classified into the category O (i.e., have an homolog, different from the query sequence, in the NCBI protein database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). It would be expected that all candidate ORFs would fall into this category, since these were found using as queries, protein sequences retrieved from this database. However, by setting the same cut-off in the E-values for all BLASTP searches, we may have been too stringent in some cases, namely when searching homologs for the candidate ORFs in the protein database at NCBI, which is a very large database and hence the probability of finding the query sequence by chance is high, resulting in high E-values.</p><p>As mentioned above, all BLAST hits for a given function whose E-values were below the cut-off and that were classified into at least one of the categories described were considered to encode that function. However, in some cases, the discrimination between ORFs encoding isoenzymes and subunits of enzyme complexes was difficult, particularly for those cases in which there was no information available for <italic>A. nidulans </italic>or this could not be directly extrapolated from other organisms. For example, even though in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>there are two genes (YDR341C and YHR091C) encoding the enzyme arginyl tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.19), only a single ORF (AN6368.2) was identified in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, through BLASTP searches. Similarly, a single ORF was found in <italic>A. nidulans </italic>(AN5610.2) for L-aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.31), which is a complex enzyme in yeast containing two subunits (a large and a small subunit), encoded by two different genes (YBR115C and YGL154C, respectively).</p><p>This study therefore shows clearly that the outcome of comparative genomics is highly dependent on the criteria chosen, and also highlights the importance of the application of a systematic evaluation to the obtained annotations.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of expression data using the metabolic network topology</title><p>Transcriptomics has become a cornerstone of functional genomics over the last decade and the analysis and interpretation of microarray data has proven to be a new challenge. Even for well-studied model organisms, the analysis and interpretation of transcriptome data is often hampered by the numerous genes that have no function assigned. This becomes even more evident when transcriptomics moves on to genomes whose annotation barely relies on automated gene prediction. In these cases, basically any additional information can be very helpful for the analysis and interpretation of data. As shown previously by our group, the metabolic network reconstructed in this work can be valuable for upgrading the information content in transcriptome data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], i.e. to provide a link between gene expression profiles and integrated metabolic functions. The importance of the reconstructed metabolic network in the analysis of transcriptome data of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>was again illustrated in this work with a study concerning transcriptional responses to changes in the growth medium composition (glucose and ethanol) of a wild type strain and a mutant strain with deletion of the regulatory protein CreA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The initial transcription data set used comprised 3,278 ORFs, of which 571 ORFs had an assigned function in the metabolic network. Although the selected expression data subset (consisting of 571 ORFs) did not cover the whole metabolic network reconstructed for <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, the reporter metabolites identified after applying the method from Patil and Nielsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], still provided valuable information on the underlying metabolic changes, which reflects the robustness of the method.</p><p>For both categories (differential expression according to growth medium or genotype), the highest ranked reporter metabolites were involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids (arginine and threonine, respectively) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>), which was not expected, since it was anticipated that the different environmental/genetic conditions would mainly affect the carbon metabolism. In particular for the transcriptional responses due to changes in the carbon source, the involvement of the amino acid metabolism was further reflected in many of the other reporter metabolites (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, this approach may play an important role in functional genomics, by giving insight into the perturbations that lead to specific transcriptional responses (for example, in the analysis of strains that are mutated in genes with unknown function). In fact, from the list of reporter metabolites presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, it is possible to deduce that major changes occurred in the metabolism of carbon compounds in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, in particular in the metabolism of ethanol (from reporter metabolites, such as ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetate, acetyl-CoA, etc.). However, tracing back the underlying perturbations from the topology of the network and observed transcriptional responses is still a challenging task, even for well-studied organisms.</p><p>Furthermore, the reconstructed metabolic network for <italic>A. nidulans </italic>allows the utilization of tools that have been developed by the yeast community for the analysis of -omics data. This represents an advantage, because one can rely on the linkage of the expression data to a specific reaction rather than to a specific gene. After identification of the reporter metabolites and the reactions in which they participate, the reconstructed metabolic network of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>can be used to identify ORFs in yeast that are involved in the same reactions and use these for further analysis. As an example, the "GO term finder" available at <italic>Saccharomyces </italic>Genome Database was used to identify specific parts of the metabolism related to the reporter metabolites. The results (reporter metabolites) obtained based on the differential expression according to the medium revealed many GO categories that could be directly linked to the change of the carbon source from glucose to ethanol, and therefore again showed that by using this approach one can obtain a birds-eye view on the major metabolic changes. The results based on the changes in the genotype of the strains, i.e. deletion of the carbon repression mediator CreA, showed that the highest ranked reporter metabolite, as well as other lower ranking ones, was involved in the amino acid biosynthesis, which was also confirmed by the GO term analysis. This linkage between glucose repression and amino acid biosynthesis was further substantiated by the finding that a defined set of genes that is regulated via CreA also has binding sites for CpcA (homologue of GNC4 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) that is a major regulator of the amino acid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This shows that apparently the CreA protein is not only involved in the mediation of carbon repression, but plays an even more global role in the metabolism of the cell. The emergence of polyols in the list of reporter metabolites confirms previously reported results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and the expression data therefore allow tracking down the origin of these changes in the metabolism.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work, we illustrated the use of a pathway-driven approach to improve the functional annotation of the genome of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>.

For the reconstruction of the metabolism of carbon compounds in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, a detailed metabolic reconstruction for <italic>A. niger </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] was used as reaction database, whereas the metabolisms of amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids were predicted based on reactions identified in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], for which a more comprehensive reconstructed metabolic network was available. As the energy metabolism of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>is simpler than for many other eukaryotic cells, the energy metabolism of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>was reconstructed using as references the corresponding pathways from both yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The biosynthetic routes of secondary metabolites, namely penicillin and aflatoxins, were based on detailed studies of these pathways in <italic>P. chrysogenum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and in different species of <italic>Aspergillus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], respectively. Evidence for the presence of these pathways in <italic>A. nidulans </italic>was in part supported by available genomic data, such as previously annotated ORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], sequenced and cloned genes (with or without an ORF associated) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and Tentative Consensus sequences (TCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The metabolic pathways in <italic>A. nidulans </italic>were also predicted based on biochemical evidence given by reports on isolation and characterization of enzymes in this fungus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, the inclusion of some reactions in the metabolic reconstruction of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>was supported solely by physiological evidence (e.g. the ability to grow on a certain sugar as the sole carbon and energy sources require a transporter and a complete pathway for metabolism of this sugar).</p><p>The directionality and reversibility of the reactions included in the metabolic network of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>were based on those in the metabolic networks of other organisms that served as templates for the reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of candidate ORFs</title><p>Once the metabolic network of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>was reconstructed and the missing functional roles identified, the genome of <italic>A. nidulans </italic>was surveyed for the genes encoding the corresponding enzymes, by employing comparative genomics tools based on sequence similarity. This approach was also applied for the identification of ORFs encoding metabolic functions that had been previously assigned to genes in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, aiming at identifying isogenes. The sequences of a set of proteins with the designated enzymatic activity in other organisms (queries) were compared with the set of all predicted proteins in <italic>A. nidulans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The protein sequences used as queries were obtained from the (non-redundant) NCBI protein database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (searched by the corresponding enzyme commission numbers whenever possible), and represented well-characterized enzymes in other organisms, preferentially in organisms taxonomically related to <italic>A. nidulans </italic>(e.g. fungi or eukaryota). BLASTP (blosum62) was used for comparative analysis and assigning metabolic functions to ORFs in the genome of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. The selection of the best candidate ORFs for a given function relied on the cut-off in the expectation values (E-values) considered, as well as on the score-to-sequence length ratio. Protein sequences or translated nucleotide sequences were used in the comparisons, rather than nucleotide sequences, due to the presence of introns, which characterizes eukaryota, and thus filamentous fungi. For the cases in which no hits were generated in this way, the translated nucleotide sequences of genes encoding the specific enzymes (obtained from the (non-redundant) NCBI nucleotides database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]) were used as queries, and BLASTX was employed for generating putative assignments.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of functional assignments</title><p>Once candidate ORFs were identified for the metabolic functions, the reliability of the functional assignments was assessed and the ORFs were classified into different categories, according to several criteria, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>, and described in the following.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Classification of candidate ORFs into categories, according to several criteria.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><bold>Functional annotation (A)</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><italic>Comparison of the previous functional annotations for the candidate ORFs [5] with the function of interest</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;<bold>A</bold></td><td align="left">function assigned to the candidate ORF consistent with function of interest</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;<bold>A*</bold></td><td align="left">function assigned to the candidate ORF not contradicting function of interest (e.g. aldose reductase <italic>versus </italic>xylose reductase;
