One of the pathological hallmarks of the Alzheimer's brain is the presence of aggregated amyloid beta (A&#x003b2;) peptide in extracellular proteinaceous deposits in the parenchyma (senile plaques), and cerebral blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A&#x003b2; species with different amino- and carboxyl-termini are constitutively produced from the amyloid &#x003b2; precursor protein (APP) through sequential proteolysis by &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In most cases, a 40 amino acid form of A&#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;40) is the major secreted product of these cleavages. The 42 amino acid form of A&#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;42), although secreted at much lower levels than A&#x003b2;40, has been implicated as the initiating molecule in the pathogenesis of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>A&#x003b2;42 is more amyloidogenic than A&#x003b2;40, and is deposited earlier and more consistently than A&#x003b2;40 in the AD brain parenchyma. Significantly, mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2), and APP genes linked to early onset genetic forms of AD perturb A&#x003b2; peptide levels or in rare cases directly alter the A&#x003b2; sequence in a way that increase the propensity of the mutant A&#x003b2; to aggregate and form fibrils. The vast majority of these AD-linked mutations selectively increase the relative levels of A&#x003b2;42 peptides (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). Small shifts in A&#x003b2;42 production have a tremendous impact on the development of AD. In humans, AD-causing mutations in APP and PS elevate plasma A&#x003b2;42 levels by 30%&#x02013;100%, and are associated with the onset of dementia in the 3rd to 5th decade of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Studies of these same mutations in transgenic mice also demonstrate that small increases in A&#x003b2;42 levels markedly accelerate A&#x003b2; deposition in the brain and associated pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. More recent studies in transgenic mice and Drosophila selectively expressing A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 in the secretory pathway, demonstrates that A&#x003b2;42 but not A&#x003b2;40 is sufficient to drive A&#x003b2; deposition, and, at least in Drosophila, neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Although numerous lines of evidence support a role for A&#x003b2;42 in the underlying pathogenesis of AD, no therapies in clinical use target this molecule. The only currently approved treatments for AD are the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepizil, rivastigmine, galantamine) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, memantine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These pharmacologic therapies are thought to improve cognition by targeting specific symptoms of the disease, such as reduced cholinergic neurotransmission and increased glutamatergic activity leading to excess activation of NMDA receptors, respectively, without significantly modifying the underlying disease pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Despite only modest symptomatic benefit, cholinesterase inhibitors have been widely adopted for clinical use in the early stages of AD, whereas memantine has shown benefit in the moderate to severe stages of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Given the growing AD epidemic there is an urgent need to discover alternative, more effective, therapies that not only target the disease symptoms but can also slow or halt the underlying neurodegenerative process. Several novel therapies based on the current understanding of AD pathogenesis are being clinically evaluated, including the use of anti-inflammatories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Over the past 20 years, a substantial number of epidemiological reports have shown that long-term use of non-aspirin, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with protection from the development of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This data has been used to support the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory drugs may be effective in slowing the progression of disease, since a robust CNS inflammatory response is another prevalent feature of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Indeed, the epidemiologic data has been used as the primary rationale for previous and ongoing trials of select NSAIDs in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Results from these trials have been mixed. Clinical data from one double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed that indomethacin may improve cognition in dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], but the results from this study were confounded by the lack of power and high drop-out rate due to adverse effects of the drug. A prospective, 25-week, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of diclofenac in combination with misoprostol in patients with mild to moderate AD in a prospective, 25-week trial, did not demonstrate a significant effect of NSAID treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A more recent randomized, placebo-controlled 1-year clinical trial of naproxen or rofecoxib failed to detect any effect on cognitive impairment by naproxen or rofecoxib administration in mild to moderate AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Finally, because of concerns over side-effects, a large prevention study (the ADAPT trial) of naproxen and celecoxib was recently halted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>There are a number of possible reasons for the varying results from these trials, and one potential explanation comes from studies which suggest that the general anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs may play a secondary role in modulating the development of A&#x003b2; pathology while other pathways are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. First, chronic administration of only certain NSAIDs in mice has been reported to reduce A&#x003b2; deposition. Ibuprofen treatment was shown to significantly reduce amyloid pathology, neuritic dystrophy, plaque-associated gliosis and IL-1 expression in Tg2576 transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. After 6 months of treatment, amyloid plaque numbers and A&#x003b2; levels in brain were reduced almost 50% and 40%, respectively. In the same study, naproxen treatment was not effective. This result suggests that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition, the main target of NSAIDs, <italic>per se</italic>, is not driving reductions in A&#x003b2; deposition. Furthermore, two nitric oxide-releasing derivates of flurbiprofen (HCT 1026 and NCX2216) and indomethacin have also been shown to reduce amyloid pathology following long-term administration to A&#x003b2;-depositing mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, nimesulide and celecoxib have been reported to have no effect on A&#x003b2; plaque pathology, further suggesting that COX 1 or 2 inhibition is not sufficient to decrease A&#x003b2; deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These results provide additional evidence that only certain NSAIDs are able to suppress A&#x003b2; aggregation in the brain and that these compounds may be targeting a unique pathway.</p><p>One possible explanation for these observations is the discovery that certain NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, and the enantiomer of flurbiprofen are capable of lowering the production of A&#x003b2;42 selectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In contrast, certain COX-2 inhibitors selectively raise A&#x003b2;42 or have no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The ability of these compounds to modulate A&#x003b2;42 levels is independent of COX and other previously identified targets of these drugs, such as NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Although the mechanism of A&#x003b2; modulation has not been definitively established, experimental evidence suggests that these compounds target the &#x003b3;-secretase complex which is composed of PS1 or PS2, substrate (i.e. carboxyl-terminal fragments of APP), and three essential accessory proteins: nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The identification of compounds that selectively lower A&#x003b2;42 provides a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that decreasing levels of this peptide will have a positive impact on A&#x003b2; plaque pathology and cognition. Unfortunately, the potential toxicity related to inhibition of COX as well as diverse secondary targets of this class of drugs, complicates efforts to experimentally test this hypothesis. Extensive screening of NSAIDs, derivatives and related compounds led to the identification of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen as a promising selective A&#x003b2;42-lowering agent that may circumvent some of these complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p><italic>R</italic>-Flurbiprofen is a purified enantiomer of the classical racemic NSAID, flurbiprofen, which displays minimal COX activity and does not undergo stereoinversion in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Like the racemate, <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen retains the ability to lower A&#x003b2;42 in cell culture and in the brain of young non-depositing Tg2576 APP mice following 3-days of oral dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Based on <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen's selective lowering of A&#x003b2;42, reduced COX activity and safety profile in humans we have previously suggested that this drug was a good candidate for clinical testing in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a 1 year randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 study of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen (MPC-7869, Myriad Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in 207 subjects with mild to moderate AD (MMSE 15&#x02013;26) was completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In mild AD subjects (MMSE of 20&#x02013;26) receiving the highest dose of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen (800 mg twice daily), statistically significant benefit was observed in measures of activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL; and global function (CDR-sb), with positive trends in cognition (ADAS-cog). No benefit was observed in moderate AD patients. In addition, <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen was generally well-tolerated in this patient population. Phase 3 studies are currently ongoing to further assess efficacy, safety, and the potential for this compound to be a disease modifying agent.</p><p>In this study we report the effect of chronic <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen treatment on cognition and A&#x003b2; loads in a transgenic model of AD, Tg2576 APP mice. Tg2576 mice were generated as follows: male Tg2576 (C57BL/6.SJL, APP+/-) were crossed with C57BL/6.SJL F1 females (APP-/-). These crosses generated the F2 Tg2576 APP +/- mice (mixed C57BL/6.SJL background), which were used in all experiments. In two separate behavioural trials, long-term treatment initiated in young Tg2576 mice with 10 mg/kg/day <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen improved spatial learning as assessed by the Morris water maze (WM). A modest reduction in biochemical A&#x003b2; loads was also observed, though this did not reach statistical significance in either study. A 2-week treatment of older Tg2576 with the same dose of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen decreased A&#x003b2; plaque levels (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) but did not result in any significant alteration in spatial learning.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Chronic administration and brain levels of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen in Tg2576 mice</title><p>Acute 3-day oral dosing of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen in Tg2576 mice is well-tolerated at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day. Maximal brain A&#x003b2;42 lowering was observed with doses of 25&#x02013;50 mg/kg/day, but doses of 10 mg/kg/day also lowered A&#x003b2;42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In these initial short-term dosing studies no mortality or morbidity was observed. However, initial pilot long-term studies using dosing regimens designed to deliver either 25 and 50 mg/kg day (see Methods) resulted in 85% and 100% mortality, respectively, within 2 weeks. A 10 mg/kg/day dose did not result in increased mortality after 14 days, and was therefore chosen for long-term studies.

The improved spatial learning ability of the <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen-treated mice was indicated by an increased spatial bias during the third probe trial and the increased preference for using a place strategy on the strategy preference test. These results are consistent with an improvement in hippocampal/medial temporal lobe-dependent memory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A short 2-week administration of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen in 19-month-old Tg2576 mice with AD-like A&#x003b2; loads had no effect on cognitive performance. Unfortunately, long-term treatment of aged Tg2576 mice with the same dose of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen results in enhanced morbidity and mortality (not shown), making it difficult to perform an experiment in which older mice are treated for the same period of time.</p><p>Both long- and short-term treatment of Tg2576 mice with <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen resulted in a decrease in the swim speed of the mice. It is possible that the decrease in swim speed in the <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen-treated mice observed in this study reflects a general effect of returning motor activity to normal levels in Tg2576 mice. Decreases in swim speed reported in this study are unlikely to account for the effects of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen on our measures of hippocampal-dependent memory as <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen was an effective modulator of swim speed with both the Preventative and Therapeutic treatment regimens but only the Preventative treatment regimen increased spatial learning ability in the Tg2576 mice.</p><p><italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen has been demonstrated to lower steady-state A&#x003b2;42 levels after 3 days of oral administration in Tg2576 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In this study, however, the results indicate that a preventative treatment strategy of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen administration does not significantly alter soluble, RIPA extracted-A&#x003b2;40 or 42 but does reduce insoluble, formic acid-soluble A&#x003b2; levels 24&#x02013;34%, although the decrease is not statistically significant (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Interestingly, the preventative treatment had no effect on plaque burden (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These results contrast with the therapeutic, or short-term, treatment in 18-month-old mice where formic-acid soluble A&#x003b2;42 levels and the A&#x003b2; plaque burden was significantly decreased. The reduction in A&#x003b2;42 levels and plaque burden did not improve spatial learning in the 18-month-old mice. Clearly, these results indicate that the length of time <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen is administered and the age at which treatment is started are critical factors in producing beneficial effects on cognition. The relationship between cognitive improvement and A&#x003b2; is controversial. Improvement in spatial memory in Tg2576 mice has been shown to occur using a preventative regime of ginko biloba or alpha lipoic acid without a corresponding change in A&#x003b2; levels or deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In addition, several studies now show that cognitive impairment in Tg2576 mice and other APP mice does not correlate well with A&#x003b2; deposition and may be attributable to small soluble assemblies of A&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Moreover, cognitive improvement can be seen following anti-A&#x003b2; immunotherapy, even when there is no significant alteration in A&#x003b2; deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. It is possible that delaying interventions until pathology is well-developed may prevent functionally significant changes in learning and memory due to irreversible changes in synaptic transmission.</p><p>The reason that the two-week therapeutic-regimen in older Tg2576 (19&#x02013;20 month) did not lead to significant behavioral improvement is not readily apparent. However, since it appears that chronic treatment with <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen is necessary in Tg2576 mice for spatial learning augmentation, it seems unlikely that the drug is working through the same mechanism as the anti-A&#x003b2; antibodies, which have been reported to work rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, our more recent experience with behavioral testing of APP mice suggests that negative results be interpreted cautiously, since assessment of the cognitive phenotype in APP mice can be variable even among cohorts of mice bred and housed in the same environment (unpublished observations). Moreover, it is possible that behavioral testing and analysis of Tg2576 mice itself alters A&#x003b2; burden since it has been shown that enrichment paradigms, such as access to running wheels, appear to be capable of altering A&#x003b2; deposition and cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In future studies it will be important to control for possible effects of behavioral training on A&#x003b2; deposition by including cohorts of treated and untreated mice that are not subject to behavioral testing.</p><p>In humans, <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen appears to be safe and is well-tolerated, with relatively few side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and undergoes minimal racemization to the <italic>S</italic>-enantiomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast, following oral administration to mice ~20&#x02013;40% of the <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen is converted to the S-enantiomer (see Results; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]). This conversion is likely to account for toxicity observed upon chronic dosing regimens more likely to alter A&#x003b2;42 production. Overall, our data demonstrate a clear cognitive benefit of long-term administration, but are inconclusive with respect to the relationship between effects on A&#x003b2; deposition and behavioural improvements. Previous studies have shown that chronic treatment with nitric oxide-releasing flurbiprofen derivatives do lower A&#x003b2; accumulation in APP mice, but it is not clear if this effect is due to the prodrug (which is not likely to affect A&#x003b2;42 production) or flurbiprofen released following metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In this study we see trends towards reduced A&#x003b2; deposition in the prevention studies and small but significant decrease in A&#x003b2; deposition in the therapeutic study.</p><p>A&#x003b2;42-lowering NSAIDs have been shown to affect multiple pathways and targets that could alter the AD phenotype, any of which could contribute to their ability to protect against the development of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. For instance, certain NSAIDs reduce production of the more amyloidogenic A&#x003b2; peptide by altering &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage of APP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. While other NSAIDs have also been shown to directly inhibit A&#x003b2; aggregation <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. They may also decrease BACE expression through activation of PPAR&#x003b3; leading to decreased levels of A&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In addition, more classic anti-inflammatory activities against cyclooxygenase as well as additional non-intended target activities against lipoxygenase and NFk-&#x003b2; could mediate beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen is not a classic NSAID in humans because it does not significantly inhibit cycloxygenase enzymes; however, it is similar in structure and could bind to other known targets of NSAIDs as well as unknown targets. Given the data presented here which suggests that <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen improves cognitive performance in APP mice it will be important in future studies to further delineate the underling mechanisms that contribute to efficacy of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen as a potential AD therapeutic.</p><p>Taken together, the results from this study show that chronic treatment with <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen beginning at an early stage of cognitive dysfunction maybe necessary to improve learning impairments, at least in the Tg2576 APP mouse model. An important caveat is that these results were obtained using a sub-optimal dose of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen, which was necessitated by the toxicity of the compound at higher doses in these mice, most likely caused by bioinversion to <italic>S</italic>-flurbiprofen and the subsequent COX-mediated gastrointestinal toxicity that is not seen in humans. Thus, extrapolating this dosing paradigm and results to human AD patients is difficult at best. The ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen in mild AD patients should provide the most conclusive test to date of the efficacy of this drug, and the general strategy of selectively lowering A&#x003b2;42, in modifying the underlying disease progression and associated cognitive decline in AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal husbandry and testing procedures performed were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with NIH guidelines.

The water maze was chosen as the testing paradigm as spatial learning in the water maze has been extensively used to measure hippocampal function and age-associated cognitive impairment in rodents (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]).</p><p>The water maze consists of a circular tank (4-ft dia) with a removable escape platform centered in one of the four maze quadrants. During testing, the tank is filled with 25&#x000b0;C water clouded by non-toxic white paint. For training trials, the top of the escape platform is submerged .05 cm below the water surface. Black curtains with white patterns surround the maze. Data are analyzed using a video tracking system and software developed by Richard Baker, HVS Image Analyzing (Hampton, U.K.).</p><p>Cue training occurs prior to hidden platform trials to test for sensorimotor and motivational factors that may influence spatial learning. There is one day of cue training, containing 6 trials. A visible black platform that extends 2 cm from the water surface is moved to different locations in the pool between trials and the subject's entry point into the tank randomized. Each mouse is given 30 sec to reach the platform and remains on the platform briefly. Trials are separated by a 5&#x02013;10 minute intertrial interval. Mice that performed +/- three times the standard deviation from the mean were excluded from further study. This accounted for approximately 20% of the initial number of mice. In addition, mice that exhibited stereotypic behaviour such as compulsive circling were also excluded from behavioral analysis (&#x0003c; 1%).</p><p>For hidden platform training trials, there are 4 trials a day for 10 days. The animal is placed in the water at the pool's perimeter and allowed 60 seconds to locate the stationary escape platform. These trials generate the search error score that reflects the animal's distance from the platform throughout their search. The search error reflects the cumulative proximity of the mouse from the escape platform during the training trial. The position of entry for the animal is varied at each trial. There is a 5&#x02013;10 minute inter-trial interval. The first trial of training days 4, 7, and 10 consists of a 30 sec probe trial that serves to assess the development of a spatially localized search for the escape platform. During such trials, the escape platform is unavailable for escape.</p><p>Strategy preference was assessed 24 hours after the last day of place training. A visible platform was placed in the quadrant opposite the training quadrant where the hidden platform was previously located. The mice were given two 60-second strategy probe trials. Start locations were on either side of the tank, equidistant from the visible cue platform and the prior hidden platform location. A "place strategy" was recorded if the mouse crossed the annulus of the prior hidden platform location before escaping to the visible platform. The annulus was defined as a 5 cm perimeter around the prior hidden escape platform location.

To measure A&#x003b2;42 levels-peptides were captured with mAb 2.1.3 (specific for the c-terminus of A&#x003b2;42) and detected with HRP-conjugated mAb Ab9 (specific for human A&#x003b2;1&#x02013;16); To measure A&#x003b2;40 levels peptides were captured with mAb Ab9 and detected with HRP-conjugated mAb 13.1.1 (specific for the c-terminus of A&#x003b2;40)</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistology</title><p>Hemibrains of mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.6) and then stained for A&#x003b2; plaques as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Paraffin sections (5 &#x003bc;m) were pretreated with 80% FA for 5 minutes, boiled in water using a rice steam cooker, washed, and immersed in 0.3% H2O2 for 30 minutes to block intrinsic peroxidase activity. They were then incubated with 2% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 hour, with 33.1.1 (A&#x003b2;1&#x02013;16 mAb) at 1 &#x003bc;g/ml dilution overnight, and then with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary mAb (1:500 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 hour. Sections were washed in PBS, and immunoreactivity was visualized by 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) according to the manufacturer's specifications (ABC system; Vector Laboratories). Adjacent sections were stained with 4% thioflavin-S for 10 minutes. Fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained for activated microglia using anti-Iba1 (1:3000; Wako Chemicals) and for activated astrocytes using anti-GFAP (1:1000, Chemicon).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitation of amyloid plaque burden</title><p>Computer-assisted quantification of A&#x003b2; plaques was performed in a blinded fashion as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Serial coronal sections were stained with 33.1.1 and plaques were quantified (calculated as proportional area of plaque burden) in the neocortex of the same plane of section for each mouse (~10 sections per mouse) using MetaMorph 6.1 software (Universal Imaging Corp, Downington, PA).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Experiments 1 and 2 were replicate experiments investigating the long-term treatment effects of <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen on spatial memory. The results from the two studies paralleled each other, but the N was relatively small in experiment 2 compared to experiment 1 (experiment 1, control N = 12, <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen = 9; experiment 2, control = 6, <italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen = 6). There were no differences between the 12-month-old control mice from experiments 1 and 2 (N = 18) when compared to the 19-month-old control mice from experiment 3 (N = 12) on visible platform latency [F(1,28) = .15, ns], hidden platform search error [F(1,28) = .003, ns] or the percent time in training quadrant [F(1,28) = .05, ns]. Therefore, for subsequent analysis of the behavioral data, the control groups from all three experiments were collapsed into one group for statistical power and clarity of presentation. The final groups were: vehicle control (N = 30), the collapsed group of experiments 1 and 2 (16-week-<italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen treatment, preventative regimen, N = 15) and experiment 3 (2-week-<italic>R</italic>-flurbiprofen treated, therapeutic regimen, N = 15). Repeated measures ANOVAs (&#x000d7; Group) were then used to examine visible platform latency, hidden platform search error and probe trial data. Significant interactions were examined <italic>post hoc </italic>by one-way ANOVAs and Fisher's PLSDs. Chi-square analysis was done on the number of subjects categorized as "place" or "cue" learners during the strategy preference test. For presentation purposes, this data was converted to the percent of subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD); Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Index (ADCS-ADL); Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog); amyloid beta peptide (A&#x003b2;); Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP); Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB); cyclooxygenase (COX); diaminobenzidine (DAB); enyzme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); horseradish peroxidise (HRP); phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE); Morris water maze (WM); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); RIPA (radioimmuno precipitation assay); sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TK participated in watermaze studies, performed A&#x003b2; ELISA measurements and analysis, participated in the conception, design and execution of the study and helped to draft the manuscript.
