The conserved catalytic and regulatory B subunits associate in a constitutive heterodimer that represents the functional core of all three replicative polymerases. Here, we combine X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (EM) to describe subunit interaction and 3D architecture of heterodimeric yeast Pol &#x003b1;. The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the catalytic subunit bound to the B subunit illustrates a conserved mechanism of accessory factor recruitment by replicative polymerases. The EM reconstructions of Pol &#x003b1; reveal a bilobal shape with separate catalytic and regulatory modules. Docking of the B&#x02013;CTD complex in the EM reconstruction shows that the B subunit is tethered to the polymerase domain through a structured but flexible linker. Our combined findings provide a structural template for the common functional architecture of the three major replicative DNA polymerases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA polymerase &#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Three polymerases&#x02014;Pol &#x003b1;, Pol &#x003b4; and Pol &#x0025b;&#x02014;cooperate to synthesise the bulk of novel DNA during replication in the eukaryotic cell. According to current models, the primase subunit of the Pol &#x003b1;/primase complex initiates synthesis by oligomerising short RNA primers on both leading and lagging strands. These primers are initially extended by Pol &#x003b1; and subsequently transferred to Pol &#x003b4; and Pol &#x0025b; for processive synthesis on the lagging and leading strand, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Stillman, 2008</xref>). Pol &#x003b1;, Pol &#x003b4; and Pol &#x0025b; are large, multi-subunit enzymes and their size has so far complicated their structural analysis: the lack of high-resolution information severely restricts our mechanistic understanding of their central role in eukaryotic replication.</p><p>All three polymerases share unifying features of their subunit organisation that reveal their evolutionary relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The catalytic subunits of Pol &#x003b1;, Pol &#x003b4; and Pol &#x0025b; are phylogenetically related and conserved from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Makiniemi <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Stillman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Weill and Reynaud, 2008</xref>). Of their different cohorts of accessory subunits, only the so-called B subunit is present in all three polymerase assemblies and&#x02014;similarly to the catalytic subunit&#x02014;is clearly conserved in eukaryotic organisms. Interestingly, an orthologue of the B subunit has also been found in archaeal organisms as the single accessory polypeptide of a replicative polymerase.</p><p>Reflecting their high degree of conservation, the catalytic and B subunits are the only indispensable polymerase components. The sequence conservation of the catalytic subunit extends past the polymerase fold to a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain (CTD) that is necessary for DNA replication and cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Navas <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">D'Urso and Nurse, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kesti <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Feng and D'Urso, 2001</xref>). A large body of experimental evidence has highlighted the functional importance of the CTD interaction with the B subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Morrison <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Giot <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dua <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mizuno <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Sanchez Garcia <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Thus, a heterodimer of the catalytic and B subunits represents the conserved functional core of the three replicative polymerases.</p><p>Here, we provide a comprehensive structural description of heterodimeric yeast Pol &#x003b1; by a combination of X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy approaches. We reconstitute biochemically and determine the X-ray crystal structure of a complex between the CTD of Pol &#x003b1; and its B subunit. Furthermore, we show by EM analysis that Pol &#x003b1; forms an elongated shape with distinct lobes occupied by the catalytic and B subunits. Docking of the CTD&#x02013;B complex within the 3D reconstruction of Pol &#x003b1; allows the accurate determination of the spacial relationship between catalytic and B subunits. Our combined findings provide a structural foundation on which to build our growing mechanistic understanding of the DNA polymerases that replicate the genome of eukaryotic organisms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Architecture of the CTD&#x02013;B subunit complex</title><p>We have biochemically reconstituted, crystallised and determined the 2.5 &#x000c5; X-ray crystal structure of a complex between amino acids 1263&#x02013;1468 (natural C-end; CTD) of Pol1, the catalytic subunit of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> DNA polymerase &#x003b1;, and amino acids 246&#x02013;705 (natural C-end) of Pol12, its B subunit (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> for complex purification; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for crystallographic analysis). The N-terminal region of the B subunit was excluded from our analysis as it is not evolutionarily conserved and superfluous for the interaction with Pol1.</p><p>The association of CTD with the B subunit results in a compact, slab-like structure of approximate triangular shape and overall dimensions: 80 &#x000c5; (height), 70 &#x000c5; (width) and 25 &#x000c5; (depth) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). The structure reveals that the CTD of yeast Pol &#x003b1; adopts an elongated, bilobal shape reminiscent of an asymmetrically proportioned saddle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2A</xref>). Each lobe contains a zinc-binding module: the lobe with the four N-terminal cysteine ligands (Zn-1) is larger and includes additional secondary structure elements as well as irregular coil structure; the lobe with the four C-terminal cysteine ligands is smaller and formed entirely by the zinc-binding module (Zn-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). The two lobes are connected by a three-helix bundle that represents the central portion or &#x02018;backbone' of the saddle-shaped CTD. The two zinc-binding motifs bear a clear structural relationship to each other; in both cases, metal-binding results from the &#x02018;handshake' interaction of two &#x003b2; ribbons, each providing a pair of cysteine ligands for the tetrahedral coordination of the zinc atom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). The mode of zinc binding observed in the yeast Pol &#x003b1; CTD resembles most closely the iron-binding motif found in rubredoxin (PDB id 1RDV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Misaki <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). A published structural analysis of a Zn-2 peptide of human Pol &#x003b1; differs markedly from the conformation of the Zn-2 region that we observe in the crystal of the CTD&#x02013;B subunit complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Evanics <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). The discrepancy might be because of the lack of structural context of the earlier study. The structure of the Pol &#x003b1; CTD does not match any fold in the protein databank and it clearly represents a specialised fold that evolved for the specific recognition of the B subunit.</p><p>The B subunit of replicative polymerases is organised as an evolutionarily conserved, folded C-terminal region fused to a relatively unstructured amino-terminal tail, which is phosphorylated in a cell-cycle-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Foiani <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kuroda and Ueda, 1999</xref>). Our crystallographic analysis reveals that the tertiary structure of the B subunit derives from the intimate association of an N-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide (OB) domain with a C-terminal phosphoesterase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). The structure of the B subunit confirms earlier bioinformatic predictions and more recent structural analysis, as a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase that has evolutionarily converted into a role as a catalytically inactive scaffold deputed to the assembly of multi-subunit complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aravind and Koonin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Koonin <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baranovskiy <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>High-resolution view of the CTD&#x02013;B interface</title><p>The structure of the complex reveals that the association of the B subunit with the CTD is not limited to the two conserved zinc-binding modules but involves the upper, flat side of the CTD saddle in its entirety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3A</xref>). Thus, an important functional role of the CTD is to provide a structural platform for extensive interactions with both OB and phosphoesterase domains of the B subunit. Interestingly, the modular composition of the B subunit is mirrored in its mode of association with the CTD, as the OB fold makes exclusive contact with the Zn-2 module, whereas the phosphoesterase domain interacts with the larger, N-terminal lobe of the CTD saddle. The presence of two juxtaposed but largely distinct CTD&#x02013;B interfaces might reflect independent events in the evolutionary process that led to a stable association between catalytic and B subunits of Pol &#x003b1;.</p><p>A defining feature of the CTD&#x02013;B subunit interaction is the very large size of its interface: burying 4500 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of total surface area, it is at the upper end of the known size distribution for heterodimeric interfaces and clearly defines the CTD&#x02013;B subunit interaction as a constitutive association. The structure shows that the majority of the interactions with the B subunit are mediated by helix &#x003b1;2 and Zn-2 module of the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3A</xref>). These are cradled within a long, shallow groove formed by flexible loops emanating from the core secondary structure elements of the phosphoesterase and OB domains of the B subunit. The chemical nature of the interactions at the interface is varied and includes networks of direct and water-mediated buried polar contacts, as well as extensive contacts between hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The remarkable plasticity of the CTD&#x02013;B interface is underlined by the large proportion of polar contacts (16 hydrogen bonds out of 29) that are formed between CTD side chains and backbone atoms of the B subunit. As predicted by the crystallographic analysis, the Pol &#x003b1; CTD and B residues identified as important for the interaction display a higher degree of evolutionary conservation relative to the rest of their solvent-exposed regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Biological implications of the CTD&#x02013;B subunit structure</title><p>The organisation of the C-terminal region as a tandem repeat of zinc-binding modules is a shared feature of the catalytic subunit of Pol &#x003b1;, Pol &#x003b4; and Pol &#x0025b;. Thus, the crystal structure of the yeast Pol &#x003b1; CTD&#x02013;B complex represents a valid structural template for understanding the interaction between catalytic and B subunits in all three polymerases. The structure highlights helix &#x003b1;2 in the central region of the CTD as an essential structural element in the recognition of the B subunit. The importance of helix &#x003b1;2 is reflected in the conservation of residues that are critical for the interaction, such as R1335 and Y1342, in yeast Pol &#x003b4; and Pol &#x0025b; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). The structure of the yeast Pol &#x003b1; CTD&#x02013;B subunit complex further allows the rationalisation of a number of experimental observations concerning the role of the CTD and its interaction with the B subunit. In particular, the structure provides an explanation for the observations that, in addition to mutations affecting the conserved cysteine ligands, alterations in the sequence between the two zinc-binding modules or C-terminal to Zn-2 have a profound negative impact on CTD function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Budd and Campbell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Navas <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dua <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">1999</xref>). Thus, a 10aa-long deletion spanning residues 2143&#x02013;2152 in the CTD of Pol &#x0025b;, which does not support cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dua <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), map to helix &#x003b1;2 that is essential for interaction with the B subunit in our structure. Premature truncations at E2192 and Q2196 of Pol &#x0025b;, which confer cells a temperature-sensitive phenotype, compromise the stability of the CTD fold by removing a C-terminal segment spanning helices &#x003b1;3&#x02013;&#x003b1;6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Navas <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>3D reconstruction of heterodimeric yeast Pol <italic>&#x003b1;</italic></title><p>To gain a functional insight into the orientation of the CTD&#x02013;B complex relative to the catalytic domain of Pol &#x003b1;, we purified and analysed the heterodimeric yeast Pol &#x003b1; by EM. The EM images show a prevalence of bilobal molecules with densities of different shape and size at each end of their longitudinal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). These views represent different projections of Pol &#x003b1; after rotating along its longitudinal axis, combined with multiple tilt angles on the support film (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The 3D reconstruction based on 12 913 side-view images of the Pol &#x003b1; at 23 &#x000c5; resolution reveals clearly distinct structural modules: a smaller, flatter region corresponding to the CTD&#x02013;B complex and a larger, globular domain that agrees with the known structural features of related archaeal DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Firbank <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). The two lobes do not contact each other but are connected by a structured &#x02018;arm' that keeps the flat shape of the CTD&#x02013;B complex suspended over the &#x02018;palm' of the polymerase fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).</p><p>Inspection of the EM images further revealed the presence of limited conformational heterogeneity in the Pol &#x003b1;&#x02013;B complex. Refinement of the data set by maximum-likelihood methods yielded three solutions, one major class comprising 42&#x00025; of the molecules&#x02014;selected for representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>&#x02014;and two other classes representing 30 and 28&#x00025; of the data set. Comparison of the three solutions shows that the CTD&#x02013;B complex can sample a range of positions relative to the catalytic domain of Pol &#x003b1; that are related by a moderate degree of rocking motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). Detection of such movement suggests that conformational changes mediated by the &#x02018;arm' region connecting the CTD to the catalytic domain of Pol &#x003b1; could be part of the functional mechanism of the polymerase.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we have analysed the 3D architecture of heterodimeric yeast Pol &#x003b1; by X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy. Our findings provide the first accurate determination of the interaction mechanism and spatial relationship between catalytic and accessory B subunits. The conservation in sequence and architecture of the functional cores of Pol &#x003b1;, Pol &#x003b4; and Pol &#x0025b; implies that features of our 3D model of yeast Pol &#x003b1; will be of general applicability to the three major replicative polymerases.</p><p>Our structural analysis defines the C-terminal region of the replicative Pols &#x003b1;, &#x003b4; and &#x0025b; as an independently folded protein domain, separate from the polymerase fold, in agreement with the biological evidence that points to the existence of an independent role of the CTD in DNA replication, separate from the catalytic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kesti <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). The size and nature of the interface in the complex indicates that the CTD is a specific molecular tether for the constitutive engagement of the B subunit with the polymerase subunit.</p><p>The structure further reveals that the two zinc-binding modules, although structurally related, fulfil different roles in the interaction with the B subunit. Thus, Zn-2 is directly and extensively implicated in binding to the B subunit, whereas Zn-1 is only marginally involved in the interaction and protrudes instead into solvent from the side of the CTD, where it might be poised for interactions with the rest of the replication machinery. This structural evidence provides an explanation for the observation that Zn-2 of Pol &#x003b4; is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the B subunit in yeast two-hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Sanchez Garcia <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The relevance of the Pol &#x003b1; CTD structure might extend to other polymerases&#x02014;such as REV3, the catalytic subunit of the translesion polymerase &#x003b6; and archaeal DNA polymerases&#x02014;for which the existence of zinc-binding motifs at their C-terminus has been predicted, based on the presence of a conserved pattern of cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Cann <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Shen <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gan <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The clear sequence similarity between the heterodimeric cores of Pol &#x003b1; and Pol &#x003b4; implies that the functional insight derived from our analysis of Pol &#x003b1;'s 3D architecture is likely to be applicable to both lagging strand polymerases. In its role as a hub of protein&#x02013;protein interactions that mediate and regulate DNA synthesis, the B subunit participates in multiple simultaneous interactions with different polymerase subunits. Superposition of the available B subunit structures bound to Pol &#x003b1; CTD (this study) and Pol &#x003b4; p66 (PDB id 3E0J) shows how this can be achieved in the case of Pol &#x003b4; and provides a first glimpse of the multi-subunit polymerase architecture that contains the B subunit as its central scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>Placing the co-crystal structure of the archaeal DNA polymerase from <italic>Thermococcus gorgonarius</italic> (PDB id 2VWJ) within the EM structure of Pol &#x003b1; indicates that the nascent DNA helix emerging from the active site of Pol &#x003b1; would grow in the direction of the CTD&#x02013;B complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Firbank <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In our fitting of the CTD&#x02013;B complex, the active site of the phosphoesterase domain of the B subunit faces the DNA and is available to interact with it. Although the eukaryotic B subunit is known to be no longer catalytically active, our reconstruction suggests that it might still interact with the emerging double-stranded nucleic acid. This observation prompted us to measure and to detect a micromolar affinity of the CTD&#x02013;B complex for double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The interaction of the CTD&#x02013;B with DNA does not alter the enzymatic properties of the catalytic domain of Pol &#x003b1; (SK and LP, unpublished observation), but it might be important for the proper orientation of the B subunit relative to the DNA template. Our structural characterisation of the heterodimeric yeast Pol &#x003b1; as a catalytic engine tethered by a flexible &#x02018;arm' to its accessory subunit poised to interact with DNA downstream of the growing 3&#x02032;-end of the nascent strand is in agreement with a recent low-resolution 3D model of yeast Pol &#x0025b; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Asturias <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Finally, experimental evidence shows that the CTD&#x02013;B complex is necessary and sufficient for recruitment to Pol &#x003b1; of the heterodimeric primase, the specialised polymerase that initiates nucleic acid synthesis in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mizuno <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) (SK and LP, unpublished observation). We note that in the EM reconstruction the flanks of the CTD&#x02013;B complex are easily accessible for interactions with the primase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>). In the light of the elongated, bilobal shape of Pol &#x003b1;'s 3D architecture described here, association of the primase with the lobe occupied by the CTD&#x02013;B raises the question of how the catalytic activities of RNA primer synthesis and extension can be coordinated over the considerable distance separating the two catalytic subunits in the Pol &#x003b1;/primase complex. A conformational rearrangement bringing the two lobes of the complex in closer proximity would represent a plausible structural basis for the mechanism of transfer of the RNA primer between active sites. The observed flexibility in the linker that connects catalytic and B subunits of Pol &#x003b1; provides indirect evidence in favour of this hypothesis. Further structural investigation will be necessary to improve our understanding of the mechanism of initiation of DNA synthesis in eukaryotic cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Crystallisation and X-ray structure determination of the CTD&#x02013;B complex</title><p>Residues 1263&#x02013;1468 (C-terminus) of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> DNA polymerase &#x003b1; and 246&#x02013;705 (C-terminus) of the B subunit were cloned into an RSF1-Duet expression vector (Novagen), to produce the B subunit fused to an N-terminal six-histidine tag and Pol &#x003b1; CTD as an untagged protein.

The crystals belong to space group <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub> (<italic>a</italic>=85.9 &#x000c5;, <italic>b</italic>=143.0 &#x000c5;, <italic>c</italic>=175.6 &#x000c5; and &#x003b2;=102.2 deg), with four copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit (asu).</p><p>The crystal structure of the CTD&#x02013;B complex was determined using phase information derived from anomalous scattering data collected at the Se K-edge, obtained from selenomethionine-containing crystals at beamline ID29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. An initial, partial model for the CTD&#x02013;B complex was obtained using PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Zwart <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), completed manually in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) and refined in REFMAC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Murshudov <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>) using NCS restraints and one TLS parameter per protein chain in the asu, to <italic>R</italic>/<italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> values of 19.1/21.8 at 2.5 &#x000c5; resolution. The final crystallographic model contains 2464 residues, 8 zinc atoms, 65 sulphate ions and 571 waters. 97.3&#x00025; of all residues are in favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot, 99.8&#x00025; in allowed regions and 0.2&#x00025; in the outlier regions. The conformation of solvent-exposed regions of the B subunit spanning residues 306&#x02013;310 of chains A, C, E, G and residues 674&#x02013;688 of chain E, as well as residues 1411&#x02013;1420 of chains D, F and H of the CTD must be considered tentative as the electron density of these regions is weak. Residues 581&#x02013;605 in all chains of the B subunit are presumably disordered as no interpretable electron density was detected; they were therefore omitted from the final model.</p><p>The four copies of the CTD&#x02013;B complex in the asu are arranged as a pair of dimers. Within each dimer, the two copies of the CTD&#x02013;B complex are related by non-crystallographic two-fold symmetry originating from the same mode of interaction. In particular, the N-terminal tail of each CTD chain in the asu interacts with the second copy of the B subunit of the non-crystallographic dimer, by addition of a short parallel strand to one of the &#x003b2; sheets of its phosphoesterase domain. Although the path of the polypeptide chain is clearly visible in the density map, the quality of the density is not sufficient for unambiguous tracing of the chain, except for the interacting &#x003b2; strand that was modelled as a tri-alanine peptide. The repeated involvement of the same surface areas in the non-crystallographic packing between copies of the CTD&#x02013;B complex suggests that some features of the association might be physiologically relevant.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Electron microscopy and 3D reconstruction of heterodimeric Pol <italic>&#x003b1;</italic></title><p>Residues 349&#x02013;1468 (C-terminus) of the catalytic subunit and 246&#x02013;705 (C-terminus) of the B subunit of Pol &#x003b1; were cloned to produce recombinant versions of the two proteins, fused to N-terminal strepII- and six-histidine tags, respectively. The heterodimeric Pol &#x003b1; was overexpressed in Sf9 cells using the MultiBac system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Berger <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Cells were harvested 4 days post-infection and the complex was purified using streptactin and heparin sepharose chromatography and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in 100 mM Tris&#x000b7;Cl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl. A diluted solution of Pol &#x003b1; was adsorbed onto glow-discharged carbon-coated grids, stained with 2&#x00025; uranyl formate and visualised in a JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Micrographs were recorded at a magnification of 50 000 under low-dose conditions and digitised using a Minolta Dimage Scan Multi Pro scanner at a final pixel size of 3.8 &#x000c5;. The contrast transfer function of the microscope for each micrograph was estimated using CTFFIND3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003</xref>) and corrected using Bsoft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Heymann, 2001</xref>); 12 913 side-view images of the complex were manually extracted using XMIPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Sorzano <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and 2D reference-free classification of the data was performed using EMAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Ludtke <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) and 2D maximum-likelihood methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Scheres <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). These 2D averages were used to build an initial template using common lines, which was then refined using EMAN.</p><p>To investigate the presence of possible heterogeneity in Pol &#x003b1;, the average model obtained after refinement with EMAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Ludtke <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) was used as the initial template for 3D maximum-likelihood (ML3D) classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Scheres <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), to split the images into more homogeneous subsets of the data. It has been shown earlier that ML3D can resolve several protein conformations without earlier knowledge of the source of heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Scheres <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Three initial template volumes for ML3D classification were prepared by splitting the data into three random subsets. After convergence of the ML3D refinement, the images were sorted in three output volumes resembling the average structure, but showing some conformational differences. The three reconstructions contained, respectively, 42&#x00025; (conformation 1), 30&#x00025; (conformation 2) and 28&#x00025; (conformation 3) of the 12 913 initial particles. The resolution of each structure, calculated using an FSC cut-off of 0.5, was 22.9, 24.5 and 25.5 &#x000c5;, respectively. Conformation 1 was chosen for further analysis as it was derived from the largest portion of the data set and was obtained at the highest resolution. It was also used for representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref>. The final volumes and fitting were visualised using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Goddard <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Fitting of crystallographic models into the EM density was performed automatically using ADP_EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Garzon <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and testing both possible hands of the reconstruction. The CTD&#x02013;B complex was confronted with the complete EM map in an exhaustive 6D search. All top solutions placed the flat shape of the CTD&#x02013;B crystal structure within the smaller lobe of the EM reconstruction. The top solution (cross-correlation coefficient &#x0003e;0.77) located the CTD closer to the linker region of density in the reconstruction, in agreement with the requirement for continuity in the polypeptide chain of Pol &#x003b1;. The crystal structure of the <italic>T. gorgonarius</italic> polymerase bound to DNA (PDB id 2VWJ) was used as a template for the catalytic domain of Pol &#x003b1; and fitted similarly to the CTD&#x02013;B complex. The top solution placed its C-terminus in the proximity of the CTD region (cross-correlation coefficient &#x0003e;0.7).</p><p>The crystallographic coordinates and structure factors of the CTD&#x02013;B complex have been deposited in the Protein Databank under accession code 3FLO.
