Peripheral mechanisms include the onset of ectopic activity in the injured sensory neurons, cross talk between sensory and sympathetic neurons and interaction with peripheral immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], while central mechanisms include central sensitization through membrane depolarization and homo and heterosynaptic potentiation maintained by loss of inhibition and immune activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>At the heart of many of these processes lie the neurotrophins, which in addition to controlling the survival and differentiation of neurons, play a key role in maintaining and modulating the function of adult nociceptive neurons. NGF and BDNF are highly regulated in skin, peripheral and central neurons, and glia following nerve injury and tissue inflammation, and have been repeatedly implicated in the development and maintenance of chronic neuropathic pain states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Microarray analysis of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) mRNA following experimental nerve injury has revealed a striking upregulation of another gene regulated by neurotrophins, VGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. VGF polypeptide is found in a distinctive restricted cell distribution in the adult brain, peripheral nervous system, and neuroendocrine system, where it is sorted into secretory granules, processed into small peptides by endoproteolytic cleavage, and released upon depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. VGF is notable for its rapid and strong regulation by NGF and BDNF, which drive <italic>vgf </italic>gene transcription in vitro and in vivo, increasing VGF mRNA levels up to 50-fold in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. More recently, VGF regulation has been associated with synaptic strengthening and learning in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and to act downstream of BDNF to increase cell division in the hippocampus and counteract depression in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Despite the reported regulation of VGF mRNA by peripheral nerve injury, it is not known if VGF plays a role in neuropathic pain.</p><p>Here we report that VGF is upregulated in both DRG and dorsal horn neurons in a model of neuropathic pain and show that VGF peptide application to the na&#x000ef;ve spinal cord directly influences dorsal horn neuron excitability and induces typical neuropathic behavior.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Pattern of VGF mRNA and protein upregulation in DRG neurons following spared nerve injury</title><p>We used the hindlimb spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain to examine the dynamic regulation of VGF in primary sensory neurons in the rat L4/L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> shows that SNI triggers a sustained 3 fold upregulation of VGF mRNA that is maintained for at least 3 weeks. In situ hybridization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) shows that this upregulation is restricted to DRG neurons; no VGF mRNA expression is observed in glial or satellite cells. The number of neurons expressing VGF mRNA increases steadily post injury with a time course that parallels the qPCR data.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> shows the significant mean fold increase in mRNA in the ipsilateral L4/5 dorsal horn at 3 and 7 days post injury. In situ hybridization revealed that the pattern of mRNA upregulation is not uniform across the dorsal horn. It appears that mRNA increased in neurons in the superficial laminae and in deeper lamina IV-V, while neurons in inner lamina II-III remained relatively unaffected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) although this requires further quantitation.</p><p>A similar pattern of upregulation of VGF protein expression is observed in the dorsal horn (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;D</xref>). In the na&#x000ef;ve L4 spinal cord (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), both neurons and terminals are immunolabelled with VGF. Neuronal VGF is largely restricted to scattered neurons in laminae III-IV and the ventral horn and light terminal labeling is observed around the central canal and lamina I and II. These terminals partly arise from primary afferents as shown by the decrease following dorsal rhizotomy and partly from descending axons in the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) as shown by DLF lesions and co-labelling of back-labelled descending projection neurones and VGF in the brainstem (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Some VGF staining is likely also to arise from the terminals of spinal interneurons. The VGF primary afferent terminal labeling overlaps with CGRP+ve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) but not IB4+ve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>) primary afferents in the superficial dorsal horn.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Immunohistochemistry of VGF in the spinal cord of (A) na&#x000ef;ve and (B) nerve injured rats at 7 days and (C) 21 days post-SNI.

This increased terminal labeling is restricted to the somatotopic region of termination of the affected afferents in the L4 and L5 segments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). In addition, VGF protein is upregulated in intrinsic neurons in both superficial and deep laminae following nerve injury. The number of VGF-labelled cells in laminae II-V on the ipsilateral side was more than 3 times greater than the contralateral side at 7 days post injury (ipsi: 21.8 &#x000b1; 1.6, contra: 6.6 &#x000b1; 0.6 cells/section, n = 14 sections from 4 animals). Double labeling with specific neuronal, microglial and astrocytic markers confirmed that the VGF protein in post injury dorsal horn was restricted to neurons (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><p>Taken together these data show strong and selective upregulation of VGF mRNA and protein in dorsal horn neurons and terminals following nerve injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Spinal VGF application causes behavioral mechanical and cold hypersensitivity</title><p>Since VGF is highly regulated in the DRG and dorsal horn following peripheral nerve injury, we hypothesized that it may have a role in the behavioral hypersensitivity to touch and cold that is a characteristic of neuropathic pain.

The frequency of spontaneous excitatory post synaptic currents (sEPSC) was significantly altered by bath application of 50 nM TLQP-62 in the majority (82%, n = 11) of cells examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Neuronal activity was analysed every ten minutes before and for up to 100 minutes after application of TLQP-62 (50 nM). In the majority of neurons (77%, n = 14) spontaneous firing significantly increased and in a subpopulation of cells (n = 4) strikingly so (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A &#x00026; B</xref>). In a smaller population of cells (15%) the spontaneous firing was decreased and the remainder was unchanged.

Application of TLPQ-62 significantly increased the mean response to brushing and cooling the receptive field while leaving pinch responses unaffected. The most striking effect was to acetone application, which in this cell population had no effect at baseline.

The baseline distribution and cellular location of VGF peptide in neurons, but not glial cells is consistent with earlier studies describing the distribution of this peptide in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Identification of VGF receptors will allow further insight into its neuronal and glial targets.</p><p>The striking upregulation of VGF in sensory neurons following nerve injury is reminiscent of the selective and maintained activation of VGF in other brain regions in response to neurotropins and prolonged neuronal depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and is likely to result from injury induced spike activity and neurotrophin upregulation in the DRG and dorsal horn. Peripheral nerve damage triggers NGF release by macrophages, mast cells and Schwann cells, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and BDNF upregulation in trkA expressing DRG cells. Anti-NGF treatment leads to reduction of allodynia in peripheral nerve injury models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and many of the injury induced changes in dorsal horn neuronal excitability are mediated by release of BDNF from microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is possible that these effects are mediated via VGF or select VGF-derived peptides. The colocalization of VGF with peptidergic primary afferents, in agreement with previous reports in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggests depolarisation and neurotrophin mediated VGF release from a select group of nociceptors.</p><p>VGF application in naive animals had striking behavioural effects that mirror those of neuropathic pain; an allodynic response to cooling and mechanical stimulation are major features of this type of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Our results show that VGF acts, at least in part, by selective changes in the excitability of subpopulations of dorsal horn cells. While mixed responses are likely to reflect the presence of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the overall effect of VGF peptide was to increase global dorsal horn network activity, analogous to BDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This was supported by the in vivo receptive field analysis which showed that VGF peptide significantly increased spontaneous activity and evoked responses to cooling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion we identify a neuropeptide that has profound functional effects on dorsal horn neurons and sensory behavior. Taken together with its upregulation in primary sensory and dorsal horn neurons in response to peripheral nerve injury, these data suggest that VGF has a central mechanistic role in neuropathic hypersensitivity. Such a role can only be fully established following identification of a receptor and effective blockade of VGF function in sensory pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All animal procedures were carried out on Sprague Dawley rats and performed in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p><p><italic>Spared Nerve Injury (SNI) </italic>was carried out in adult rats under 2&#x02013;3% halothane/O<sub>2 </sub>anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

For VGF, the sections were blocked for 1 hr in TTBS (0.05 M Tris saline, pH7.4/0.3% Triton-X100) containing 3% normal rabbit serum (NRS) at room temperature and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 72 hr with goat &#x003b1;-VGF (G17, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:5000 in TTBS. Followed after three 10 min washes in 0.1 M phosphate buffer by a 90 min incubation at room temperature with biotinylated rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:200 in TTBS. A further three washes in 0.1 M phosphate buffer were followed by a 60 min incubation at room temperature with Avidin Biotin complex (2.5 &#x003bc;l A, 2.5 &#x003bc;l B per ml of TTBS). Signal was amplified using a tyramide amplification protocol. Controls were carried out without the primary antibody. In addition, 3 independent primary antibodies to VGF were used. VGF (R15) which recognises the C-terminus of VGF, VGF (D20) which recognises the N-terminal of VGF and VGF (G17) which also recognises the N-terminus. All three antibodies showed the same clear and consistent increase in staining in the DRG and dorsal horn following SNI despite being raised to three separate VGF epitopes. Ultimately, VGF (G17) was selected as the staining was the clearest.</p><p>Sections were double labeled for neuronal nuclei (mouse anti-NeuN antibody (Chemicon, CA) 1:5000), calcitonin gene regulated polypeptide (rabbit anti CGRP antibody (Chemicon, CA) 1:4000), ionized binding calcium adaptor molecule-1 (rabbit anti-iba-1 (Wako, Japan) 1:2000), isolectin B4 ((Sigma) 1:200), 5 HT (monoclonal rat anti-serotonin, (Chemicon, CA)1:75).</p><p><italic>Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) </italic>was performed using the SYBR green detection system with primer sets designed on Primer Express (Applied Biosystems, UK).

Threshold was defined as the VF filament causing paw 50% withdrawal. Cold responses were measured by placing a drop of acetone on the plantar of the paw and recording the number of seconds that the paw was withdrawn over the following 20 seconds. Rats were tested one day prior to intrathecal injections to establish baseline sensitivity and again immediately before anaesthetising for intrathecal injection with TLQP-62 (C-terminal 62 amino acid rat VGF-derived peptide) or vehicle. Mechanical and cold sensitivity were then tested 30 min after application and every 15 minutes for four hours Intrathecal (10 &#x003bc;l of drug or saline) injections were performed at the L4&#x02013;5 level in anesthetized rats (2&#x02013;3 % halothane/O<sub>2</sub>) using a 10 &#x003bc;l 26 G Hamilton syringe.

Single spikes with cutaneous receptive fields on the hindpaw were recorded throughout the depth of the dorsal horn and analysed using Chart software (AD Instruments, UK). Spontaneous activity was recorded for one minute followed by 3 brush stimuli and 3 pinch stimuli (1.5 sec duration each at 30 secs intervals). A single drop of acetone was the applied to the receptive field and responses recorded for 30 seconds. Following baseline recording, 20 ul of TLQP-62 (50 nM) in saline was applied directly onto the exposed spinal cord and stimuli were repeated at 5 and 10 minutes post drug application and every ten minutes thereafter for 60&#x02013;120 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Whole cell patch recording in spinal cord slices</title><p>Superficial dorsal horn neurons were patched at room temperature in 400 &#x003bc;m lumbar sagittal slices in 21 day old na&#x000ef;ve rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Pipette resistances ranged from 3&#x02013;5 M&#x003a9;, seal resistances were &#x0003e; 1 G&#x003a9; and electrodes were filled with (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>,1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 MgATP (pH 7.2, 300&#x02013;305 mosm). Superficial dorsal horn neurons were visualized with IR-DIC, and voltage clamp recordings of whole-cell currents were obtained using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments, CA). Spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic potentials (sEPSCs) were observed at a holding potential of -70 mV and baseline activity was established for at least 5 min before drug application. TLQP62 (50 nM in aCSF) was bath applied for up to 30 minutes and its effects on sEPSC amplitude and frequency analysed off-line.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>BDNF: brain derived neurotrophic factor; CGRP: calcitonin gene related peptide; DLF: dorsal lateral funiculus; DRG: dorsal root ganglia; NGF: nerve growth factor; sEPSC spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potential; SNI: spared nerve injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AM conceived and performed behavioural, histological and quantitiative PCR studies as well as interpreting data and aiding in the preparation of the manuscript.
