Melanoma accounts for 4% of all skin cancers, but for 79% of all skin cancer related deaths in the United States (Melanoma Research Foundation). Metastatic melanoma is highly resistant to both chemo- and radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Cutaneous melanoma arises from, melanocytes, presumably due to early childhood exposure of the skin to UV radiation. A predisposing factor for melanoma may be the melanocortin receptor. It has been found that individuals having a mutation that affects the function of the melanocortin receptor have an increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of O<sub>2 </sub>homeostasis in cells. It consists of a heterodimeric transcriptional complex of two proteins, HIF-1&#x003b2; and HIF-1&#x003b1;. HIF-1&#x003b2; is constitutively expressed whereas HIF-1&#x003b1; protein is stabilized only under hypoxic conditions, despite its continuous synthesis under normoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. When O<sub>2 </sub>tension is normal, HIF-1&#x027e8; is hydroxylated at specific proline residues by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase-domain (PHD). This hydroxylation is required for the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein to bind to HIF-1&#x003b1; leading to subsequent ubiquitination and proteasome-targeted degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. VHL binding is also enhanced by acetylation of lys<sup>532 </sup>catalyzed by the acetyltransferase, ADP-ribosylation factor domain protein 1 (ARD1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Under hypoxic conditions, proline hydroxylation decreases thereby stabilizing HIF-1&#x003b1;, which in turn moves to the nucleus and transactivates various genes containing hypoxia response elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>HIF-1&#x003b1; controls the expression of over 60 genes involved in many aspects of oncogenesis, including tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] anti-apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and genetic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. HIF&#x003b1; has also been implicated in the malignant progression of several cancers including mammary gland, prostate, brain, and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. HIF-1&#x003b1; is the regulatory subunit of HIF-1. It is regulated at the protein level by both oxygen- dependent and independent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. HIF-1&#x003b1; is highly expressed in early stage of mouse hepatocarcinogenesis independent of hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The hypoxia independent increase in HIF-1&#x003b1; is thought to be activated by growth signaling pathways. A majority of human melanomas have constitutively active MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) due to BRAF or N-Ras mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Activation of this pathway is correlated with the upregulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA in human melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However the biological significance of upregulated HIF-1&#x003b1; under normoxic conditions for initiation and progression of melanoma has not been elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we examined the normoxic expression and biological functions of HIF-1&#x003b1; in human melanoma. We found that both full length and a splice variant, HIF-1&#x003b1;785, are expressed in human melanoma cell lines while essentially undetectable in normal human melanocytes. Ectopic HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in a low expressing RGP cell line stimulated Matrigel invasion, while knockdown of HIF-1&#x003b1; in a high expressing MET cell line inhibited both soft agar colony formation and Matrigel invasion. Knockdown of MEK1/2 and loss of phosphorylated ERK1/2 did not decrease HIF-1&#x003b1; expression. U0126 MEK inhibitor at 10 &#x003bc;M eliminated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but did not decrease HIF-1&#x003b1; expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; in human melanoma cells</title><p>In addition to the well known pathway of HIF-1alpha protein stabilization under hpoxic conditions, it has been established that many oncoproteins and growth factor signaling pathways up-regulate HIF-1&#x003b1; expression under normoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, there are few investigations into the normoxic expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; in human melanoma and its role in the malignant progression of this disease. Here, we show that in human melanoma cells, the oxygen-labile HIF-1&#x003b1; protein as well as its mRNA is expressed endogenously under normoxic conditions. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> shows that HIF-1&#x003b1; protein is highly expressed in WM9 cells relative to normal human melanocyte (HEMn-LP), but radial growth phase (SbCl2), and vertical growth phase (WM1366) also express a higher amount of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein relative to human melanocytes. Similar results are seen in second set of RGP, VGP and MET melanoma cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). HIF-1&#x003b1; was detected as 120 kD protein in nuclear extracts while no protein was detected in cytoplasmic extracts (data not shown).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein in human melanocytes and melanoma cells</bold>.

Since HIF-1&#x003b1; protein was increased in human melanoma cells under normoxic conditions, we determined whether this increase might be due to increased HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA levels. Initially we used semi-quantitative RT-PCR to assess expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; full length (FL) and a splice variant HIF-1&#x003b1;785 that is missing the acetylation site lys<sup>532 </sup>due to lack of exon 11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This splice variant encodes HIF-1&#x003b1; protein that has been reported to be stable under normoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Primers were designed so that full length HIF-1&#x003b1; would exclude HIF-1&#x003b1;785 by targeting exon 11, which is absent in HIF-1&#x003b1;785. Primers for HIF-1&#x003b1;785 excluded HIF-1&#x003b1; by targeting the exon 10:12 boundary only present in HIF-1&#x003b1;785. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> shows that human melanoma cell lines express both full-length and the 785 splice variant HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA at a level that appeared to be higher than normal human melanocytes.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of HIF-1&#x003b1;FL &#x00026; HIF-&#x003b1;785 mRNA in human melanoma cells</bold>. (A) Schematic representation of the functional domains of both HIF-1&#x003b1; full length and HIF-1&#x003b1;785. Both HIF-1&#x003b1;FL and 785 have various domains in common such as basic helix loop helix (bHLH), Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS), Oxygen Dependent Degradation Domain (ODDD), N-terminal transactivation domain N-TAD, inhibitory domain (ID), nuclear localization signal (NLS) and C-terminal transactivation domain C-TAD. Upon loss of exon 11 in HIF-1&#x003b1;785, part of the ODDD is deleted. This missing region contains the important lysine <sup>532 </sup>residue which is acetylated by ARD1 leading to increased stable interaction of HIF-1&#x003b1; with the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor. This interaction directs HIF-1&#x003b1; to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for degradation under normoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

Primers (see Methods for sequence) for HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-1&#x003b1;785 were designed to specifically amplify each variant with no cross-amplification.

Melanoma, if diagnosed and treated early, has a high cure rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. If the melanoma progresses, it can metastasize regionally to lymph nodes, and then to distant organs such as the lungs, and the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Metastatic melanoma is very difficult to treat and has a high mortality rate. Several studies have confirmed that HIF-1&#x003b1; is a survival factor, as well as a key regulator of metastasis in various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>HIF-1&#x003b1; regulates the adaptive responses to O<sub>2 </sub>tensions at cellular levels. It controls the expression of many genes involved in different aspects of tumor biology, including angiogenesis, cell survival, invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], anti-apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and genetic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. HIF-1&#x003b1; is rapidly degraded under normoxic condition and is stablilized under hypoxic condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We found that HIF-1&#x003b1; protein and RNA is expressed under normoxic conditions in several human melanoma cell lines and that the levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression correlates with the stage of cancer from which the melanoma cell line was established. In contrast, HIF-1&#x003b1; protein was undetectable in normal human melanocytes. Normoxic expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; has been found in a number of cancer cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] pathways has been implicated in stimulating normoxic expression of HIF-1&#x003b1;.</p><p>The epidermis of the skin is a partial hypoxic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Evidence has been provided that this partial hypoxia contributes to melanomagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, one possibility is that the increase in HIF-1&#x003b1; that we observed in melanoma ceils is due to the hypoxic adoptive response maintained by the cells in culture. However, hypoxia stabilizes the HIF-1&#x003b1; protein and does not increase the level of HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA. We found that the increased HIF-1&#x003b1; protein in the melanoma cells was correlated with an increase in HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA. Also, the normal human melanocytes used in our study came from the partial hypoxic environment of the skin and yet in culture, they do not express detectable levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein. Therefore, we think it more likely that the increased HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA and protein is due to an inappropriately activated signaling pathway.</p><p>We also found that an mRNA splice variant, HIF-1&#x003b1;785, was expressed at higher levels than full length HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA in the VGP and metastatic human melanoma cell lines. HIF-1&#x003b1;785 is missing the acetylation site lys<sup>532 </sup>due to lack of exon 11 and is thought to be more stable under normoxic conditions in comparison to full length HIF-1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In several non-melanoma cell lines it was found that phorbol ester stimulated the expression of HIF-1&#x003b1;785 mRNA under normoxic conditions via a redox-dependent ERK1/2 MAPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. How this alternatively spliced isoform of HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA is increased in melanoma is currently under investigation.</p><p>We examined the biological consequences of HIF-1&#x003b1; FL and 785 splice variant gain of function and HIF-&#x003b1; FL loss of function in selected human melanoma cells. The SbCl2 radial growth phase melanoma cells have low levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein expression and a limited capacity to form colonies in soft agar and to invade through Matrigel. This cell line was chosen to determine the biological effects of HIF-1&#x003b1; overexpression. Transient ectopic expression of FL HIF-1&#x003b1; did not result in a statistically significant increase in SbCl2 colony formation in soft agar. However, transient overexpression of HIF-1&#x003b1;785 resulted in a small, but statistically significant increase in soft agar colony formation. The effect on anchorage-independent growth may be limited by the transient nature of the overexpression of HIF-1. Overexpression of either HIF-1&#x003b1;FL or 785 led to a large and statistically significant increase in the ability of SbCl2 cells to invade Matrigel. There have been a few reports on the effect of HIF-1&#x003b1; overexpression on the in vitro biologic properties of cancer cells. Hypoxia-induced or exogenous overexpression of HIF-1&#x003b1; increased <italic>in vitro </italic>invasion by human colon adenocarcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], while stable normoxic overexpression of HIF-1&#x003b1; promoted anchorage-independent growth in melanocytes having an activated AKT signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. SbCl2 cells overexpressing HIF-1&#x003b1;785 showed a somewhat greater increase in soft agar colony formation as well as invasion ability compared to full length HIF-1&#x003b1;. Whether this difference is due to a longer half-life for the splice variant protein relative to the full length protein is currently under investigation.</p><p>HIF-1&#x003b1; loss of function experiments were carried out in the WM9 metastatic melanoma cell line. This cell line was chosen due to its high level of normoxic expression of HIF-1&#x003b1;. The WM9 is an aggressive metastatic melanoma cell line that has a high level of anchorage-independent growth and Matrigel invasion ability. We found a significant decrease in both anchorage-independent growth and Matrigel invasion upon silencing of normoxic expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; by siRNA treatment. These decreases were not due to a loss of cell viability as has been reported for knockdown of HIF-1&#x003b1; under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This decrease in invasion might be due to decreased expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; regulated genes involved in invasion such as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and cathepsin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Loss of anchorage-independent growth in HIF-1&#x003b1; silenced cells may be due to ERK/MAPK, PI3K/Akt and HIF-1 pathway interactions. The PI3K/Akt pathway is one of the most critical pathways involved in anchorage-independent growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Hypoxia independent expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; is thought to be regulated by growth signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The majority of melanomas have constitutively active ERK1/2 MAPK pathway due to BRAF or N-Ras mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In particular, human metastatic melanoma WM9 cells have a constitutively active ERK1/2 MAPK pathway most likely due to the V600E BRAF mutation found in these cells. Treatment of these cells with 30 &#x003bc;M of the selective MEK inhibitor, U0126, decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and also resulted in a time dependent decrease in HIF-1&#x003b1; protein expression.</p><p>This 30 &#x003bc;M concentration chosen for our initial studies was based on two other published papers that used this amount of U0126 to demonstrate the involvement of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in the regulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the original report describing U0126, it was stated that the Ki for intracellular inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in COS-7 cells was 0.1 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus the concentration used in our study and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] is 300 times higher than the Ki. Therefore we repeated the MEK inhibition studies using 10 &#x003bc;M U0126. In contrast to 30 &#x003bc;M U0126, the lower concentration completely eliminated ERK1/2 phosphorylation after a 24 h incubation with WM9 human metastatic melanoma cells. Despite this inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, there was no change in the expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein. At the later time point of 48 and 72 h of inhibitor treatment the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not completely suppressed and the level of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein was decreased. We also inactivated ERK1/2 signaling by knocking down the expression of MEK. We needed to use siRNA against both MEK1 and MEK2 in order to obtain a &#x0003e; 90% decrease in expression of these enzymes. Although this knockdown inhibited ERK phosphorylation, there was no decrease in HIF-1&#x003b1; protein expression at any time point assayed (up to 6 days). In the course of analyzing these data, we were informed by Promega, the manufacturer of U0126, that the compound is unstable in tissue culture media and produces metabolites that have poor MEK inhibitory activity. Considering the sum of our data, we hypothesize that the metabolites of U0126 are responsible for the decrease in HIF-1&#x003b1; protein levels. This would explain the lack of change in HIF-1&#x003b1; protein in cells treated for 24 h with 10 &#x003bc;M U0126 despite complete inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the fact that siRNA knockdown of MEK resulting in decrease ERK1/2 phosphorylation also did not result in a decrease in HIF-1&#x003b1; protein levels.</p><p>Analysis of BRAF and NRAS mutations in our human melanoma cell lines (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) shows that WM3211 cells do not have the common activating mutations in these genes, yet these cells express increased amounts of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein and mRNA under normoxic conditions. Overall our data suggest normoxic expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; is not regulated by the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, <italic>at least in the WM9 human metastatic melanoma cell line</italic>. The hypoxia independent expression in melanoma cells, like other cancers, might be regulated by phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], NFkB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or JAK/STAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] pathways.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Genotyping data of melanoma cell lines</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Mutation<break/>Cell lines</th><th align="left">NRAS</th><th align="left">WT/WT</th><th align="left">V600E BRAF</th><th align="left">V600D BRAF</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Sbcl2</td><td align="left">++</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">WM3211</td><td/><td align="left">++</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">WM1366</td><td align="left">++</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">WM3248</td><td/><td/><td align="left">++</td><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">WM9</td><td/><td/><td align="left">++</td><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">WM239</td><td/><td/><td/><td align="left">++</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The N-RAS or BRAF mutational status of melanoma cell lines RGP (Sbcl2, WM3211), VGP (WM1366, WM3248), MET (WM9, WM239).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, HIF-1&#x003b1; is overexpressed, in melanoma cell lines under normoxic conditions in a manner that correlates with the aggressiveness of the tumor from which the cell line was established. We also show that the novel splice variant HIF-1&#x003b1;785, which is missing part of the oxygen regulation domain is overexpressed in these melanoma cell lines. Manipulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in several of our melanoma cell lines suggests that this transcription factors regulates, in part, anchorage-independent growth and Matrigel invasion. Our results suggest that development of new therapeutic agents that inhibit HIF-1&#x003b1; function may be of use in the treatment of human melanoma regardless of the hypoxic condition of the tumor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and cell culture conditions</title><p>SbCl2, WM3211 (RGP), WM1366, WM3248 (VGP), and WM9, WM239 (Metastatic melanoma) cells were a generous gift from Meenhard Herlyn's lab at the Wistar Institute (University of Pennsylvania).
