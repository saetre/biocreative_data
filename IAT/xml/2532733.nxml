However, the apoptotic pathway mediated by p53 is not fully understood. Here, we showed that N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (<italic>NDRG2</italic>) is a new target gene that is regulated by p53. <italic>NDRG2</italic> mRNA and protein levels can be upregulated in a p53-dependent manner. The first intron of the <italic>NDRG2</italic> gene contains a site that binds p53 directly and mediates wild-type p53-dependent transactivation. In addition, silencing of <italic>NDRG2</italic> attenuates p53-mediated apoptosis, whereas overexpression of <italic>NDRG2</italic> suppresses tumor cell growth, regardless of the presence or absence of p53. Our results indicate that <italic>NDRG2</italic> is a novel p53-inducible target that is involved in the p53-mediated apoptosis pathway.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The p53 tumor suppressor has long been regarded as the most important factor for the maintenance of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In response to cellular stresses, p53 can induce diverse biological responses, including cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Though it is widely accepted that apoptosis induction is essential to the tumor-suppressive activity of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>), the complicated mechanism is not fully understood. Growing evidence has shown that p53 can induce apoptosis through its actions as a transcription factor by transactivating numerous target genes in the apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Recently, reports have demonstrated that p53 exerts its pro-apoptotic effects through transcription-repressive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>) as well as transcription-independent activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), suggesting that p53 may utilize multiple pathways to initiate apoptotic signals.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, p53 is maintained at low levels mainly via the action of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) E3 ubiquitin ligase, which directs p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Upon various stresses, such as hypoxia, heat shock, ionizing and UV light irradiation, treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and viral infection, p53 protein levels rise dramatically and are activated by posttranslational modifications to the protein itself and/or MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). Activated p53 functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor and induces expression of its downstream target genes by recognizing a 20-bp response element, which is generally located in the promoter or intronic regions. The consensus sequence is 5&#x02032;-PuPuPuC(A/T-A/T)GPyPyPy-N(0&#x02013;13)-PuPuPuC(A/TA/T)GPyPyPy-3&#x02032;, and the fourth C and seventh G are highly conserved in the 10-bp half-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). To date, more than a hundred p53 target genes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and some of these proteins are able to mediate p53-induced apoptosis. These proteins include molecules with a pro-apoptotic potential, such as BAX, NOXA, PUMA, BID, FAS/APO1, Pidd and KILLER/DR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">15&#x02013;21</xref>), as well as some newly identified proteins, which are not part of the canonical intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, such as Scotin, voltage-gated sodium channel, type III, beta (SCN3B) and N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (<italic>NDRG1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>). Nevertheless, none of these downstream targets fully contribute to the p53-mediated apoptotic response, indicating that p53 may activate a subset of apoptosis-related genes in a cell context- or stress type-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Human <italic>NDRG2</italic> (also named SYLD/KIAA1248) belongs to the <italic>NDRG</italic> family and was first cloned in our laboratory from a normal human brain cDNA library by subtractive hybridization (GenBank, Accession No. AF 159092) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This family consists of four members, <italic>NDRG1</italic>, <italic>NDRG2</italic>, <italic>NDRG3</italic> and <italic>NDRG4</italic>, which share roughly 60% residue identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29">27&#x02013;29</xref>). The members have different tissue expression patterns, indicating that they may play distinct roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), but some exhibit similarities in either expression regulation or biological functions. For example, both <italic>NDRG1</italic> and <italic>NDRG2</italic> can be transcriptionally repressed by Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and upregulated by hypoxia and nickel reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#x02013;34</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that both proteins were involved in cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37 B38">35&#x02013;38</xref>) and in certain human nervous system disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Importantly, <italic>NDRG1</italic> is well-documented to be associated with a tumor-suppression function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), and <italic>NDRG2</italic> was proposed to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene due to its reduced expression in many cancer tissues and its ability to inhibit proliferation in certain cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45 B46 B47 B48">43&#x02013;48</xref>). However, to date, the exact function of Ndrg2 in cellular processes, including carcinogenesis, is unclear. In a recent study, Stein <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) demonstrated that <italic>NDRG1</italic> acts as a necessary contributor during p53-induced caspase activation and apoptosis. This led us to question whether there is a relationship between <italic>NDRG2</italic> and p53, which would help identify the biological function of Ndrg2 and better understand the p53-regulated cellular responses.</p><p>In this study, we report that the <italic>NDRG2</italic> gene is transcriptionally regulated by p53. <italic>NDRG2</italic> mRNA and protein synthesis were induced by overexpressing p53 via either an adenovirus infection or stabilization of p53 after DNA damage. Analysis of the <italic>NDRG2</italic> genomic loci revealed one potential p53-binding element in intron 1, which was verified as a functional p53 response element that specifically binds to endogenous or exogenous p53. In addition, our experiments using RNA interference suggest that <italic>NDRG2</italic> is involved in the p53-mediated apoptosis pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>The human tumor cell lines H1299 (p53 null), Saos2 (p53 null), MDA-MB-231 (mutant p53), SK-BR-3 (mutant p53), A549 [wild-type (wt) p53], U87 (wt p53) and the human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).

It is well established that most of the biological effects of p53 are due to its function as a transcription factor. Although a variety of p53 downstream target genes have been identified, which are involved in apoptosis (e.g. BAX, DR5, BID, APAF-1, Caspase-6, PIGs, Perp, p53AIP, SCN3B and Scotin), knockout of any one individual gene has failed to protect cells completely from p53-induced death. These findings suggest that the p53 response requires a network of collaborating genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50 B51 B52 B53 B54">50&#x02013;54</xref>). In addition, several studies have shown that some genes with antiapoptotic activity, such as HB-EGF, DcR1 and DcR2, can be transcriptionally activated by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55 B56 B57">55&#x02013;57</xref>), while others, such as survivin and PTGG1, are repressed by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Thus, the p53 pathway is complicated, and identification of additional p53 targets is critical for understanding the pathway. Here, our results reveal that <italic>NDRG2</italic> is a p53-inducible target gene that is transactivated by p53 and is involved in p53-mediated apoptosis.</p><p>Increased <italic>NDRG2</italic> mRNA and protein levels occurred not only after treatment with the DNA-damaging agents or stress, which activates endogenous p53, but also following adenovirus-mediated ectopic expression of p53 in p53 null cells. Neither DNA damage in p53 mutant and p53 null cell lines nor introduction of mutant p53 could enhance <italic>NDRG2</italic> expression; moreover, knockdown of endogenous p53 markedly attenuated Adr-induced increase of Ndrg2, indicating that the effect requires intact p53. Considering the previous finding that <italic>NDRG1</italic>, a member of <italic>NDRG</italic> family, is a direct transcriptional target gene of p53, we hypothesized that <italic>NDRG2</italic> could also be a p53 target gene.</p><p>While <italic>NDRG1</italic> has a p53 responsive element in its promoter, we identified one candidate sequence for p53BSs within intron 1 of <italic>NDRG2</italic>. The <italic>NDRG2</italic> element contained all the conserved residues, as well as five mismatches, of the consensus p53BS. It is well documented that p53 target genes harbor p53BSs in either their promoters or intronic regions, and sequences with different mismatched bases may vary considerably in their transactivation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Interestingly, some response elements whose structures are quite different from the canonical p53 consensus site can also be recognized by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments demonstrate that the putative p53BS within <italic>NDRG2</italic> intron is a functional one in response to exogenous or endogenous wt p53, as shown in reporter assays. Reporter constructs carrying the endogenous <italic>NDRG2</italic> promoter region, exon 1 and intron 1 containing p53BSs exhibited increased transcriptional activity upon p53 activation. Meanwhile, the corresponding counterpart lacking p53BSs showed no response to p53, indicating that the intronic p53BSs are essential for p53-mediated transactivation of <italic>NDRG2</italic>. Using ChIP and EMSA, we demonstrated that the p53BSs form protein&#x02013;DNA complexes in Ad-p53-infected p53 null cells or Adr-treated wt p53-bearing cells, suggesting that the intronic <italic>NDRG2</italic> p53BSs can bind to p53 after its activation and DNA damage. Collectively, we provide compelling evidence that p53 directly transactivates <italic>NDGR2</italic> via intronic p53BSs.</p><p>As a member of the <italic>NDRG</italic> family, the <italic>NDRG2</italic> gene has been mapped to chromosome 14q11.2, and encodes a 41 kDa protein, which is expressed in various tissues, particularly in the brain, heart and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Although the precise function of Ndrg2 is still unclear, it has been shown to be intimately involved in numerous biological processes, such as cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), as well as carcinogenesis and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46 B47 B48">46&#x02013;48</xref>). Mounting evidence has indicated that <italic>NDRG2</italic> mRNA levels are downregulated or undetectable in a number of human cancers and cancer cell-lines, including glioblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal carcinoma, compared to their cognate noncancerous counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46 B47 B48">46&#x02013;48</xref>). Moreover, <italic>NDRG2</italic> expression has been inversely correlated with tumor grade and aggressive tumor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In two recent reports, <italic>NDRG2</italic> was even identified as a gene whose expression in high-grade primary astrocytomas or gastric cancers was positively correlated with survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). These findings strongly implicate Ndrg2 is a tumor suppressor. However, to date, only a few studies have explored the role of Ndrg2 in tumor suppression. Ndrg2 overexpression in a human glioblastoma cell line was shown to markedly inhibit cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Another study from our laboratory demonstrated that Ndrg2 translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus upon NiCl<sub>2</sub> treatment, where it interacts with the MSP58 oncoprotein and inhibits MSP58-induced proliferation of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Most recently, Choi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) demonstrated that <italic>NDRG2</italic> silencing can decrease Fas-mediated cell death via a slight downregulation of Fas expression in SNU-620 gastric cancer cell lines.</p><p>Here, we showed that Ndrg2 is required for the full p53-mediated apoptotic response. Additionally, we showed that <italic>NDRG2</italic> knockdown using siRNA markedly attenuated the p53-mediated apoptotic effect. It is possible that the attenuation was incomplete because the silencing efficiency in our current experiment was not high enough to entirely block the <italic>NDRG2</italic> expression. Alternatively, it is likely that other apoptosis-related proteins that are downstream of p53 play a compensatory role in the case of <italic>NDRG2</italic> knockdown by contributing to the apoptotic effect. In this regard, the function of Ndrg2 may be similar to many known p53 targets, such as BAX, BID, CD95, APAF-1 and DR5, since when each of these genes is silenced or removed from a particular model system, a partial resistance to p53-induced apoptosis is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Therefore, our results together with two recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) support the idea that p53-dependent apoptosis is a complex process, reflecting the combined effect of a number of p53-inducible targets. As for the role of Ndrg2 in the p53-initiated apoptosis pathway, it is unlikely that Ndrg2 functions as a pro-apoptotic factor because we did not observed Ndrg2-promoted apoptosis following its overexpression in p53-null Saos2 cells and p53-intact A549 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Another possibility is that Ndrg2 may play a regulatory role either by facilitating apoptosis choice over cell-cycle arrest for p53 in response to stresses, or by regulating p53 downstream targets that are implicated directly in apoptosis, such as Bax, PUMA and NOXA. Further studies are needed to prove or disprove these hypotheses. Interestingly, our previous data showed that <italic>NDRG2</italic> also participates in hypoxia-evoked apoptotic response in A549 cells at least partially by acting as a hypoxia-inducible HIF-1 target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), provided that hypoxia-induced p53 accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>) and subsequent induction of <italic>NDRG2</italic> may play a role during this process. Collectively, it appears that <italic>NDRG2</italic> can act as a stress-responsive gene to facilitate cell death in order to eliminate hazardous cells.</p><p>We have also shown that <italic>NDRG2</italic> overexpression led to inhibition of cell proliferation, regardless of the absence or presence of p53, which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). These results suggest that Ndrg2 has an inhibitory role on proliferation that might be p53 independent. Nevertheless, in case of p53-intact cells, whether the proliferation-inhibitory role of Ndrg2 influences its positive role in apoptosis and vice versa still remains to be determined.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated for the first time that <italic>NDRG2</italic>, a novel p53-inducible gene, is implicated in the p53-mediated apoptosis pathway in response to DNA damage and also plays a proliferation-inhibitory role that is independent of p53 status. These findings contribute insights for the function of Ndrg2, particularly its stress-responsive activity and tumor-repressive effects.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn504/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn504_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="gkn504_nar-00580-x-2008-File008.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkn504_nar-00580-x-2008-File009.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported in part by grants from The National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (2006AA02Z194), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT0459) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30370315, 30570676).
