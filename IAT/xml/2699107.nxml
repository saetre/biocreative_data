Therefore, events occurring in the cyclic nucleotide&#x02013;binding (CNB) domain must be coupled to the movements of the pore walls. When Glu363 in the pore region, Leu356 and Thr355 in the P helix, and Phe380 in the upper portion of the S6 helix are mutated into an alanine, gating is impaired: mutant channels E363A, L356A, T355A, and F380A desensitize in the presence of a constant cGMP concentration, contrary to what can be observed in wild-type (WT) CNGA1 channels. Similarly to C-type inactivation of K<sup>+</sup> channels, desensitization in these mutant channels is associated with rearrangements of residues in the outer vestibule. In the desensitized state, Thr364 residues in different subunits become closer and Pro366 becomes more accessible to extracellular reagents. Desensitization is also observed in the mutant channel L356C, but not in the double-mutant channel L356C+F380C. Mutant channels L356F and F380K did not express, but cGMP-gated currents with a normal gating were observed in the double-mutant channels L356F+F380L and L356D+F380K. Experiments with tandem constructs with L356C, F380C, and L356C+F380C and WT channels indicate that the interaction between Leu356 and Phe380 is within the same subunit. These results show that Leu356 forms a hydrophobic interaction with Phe380, coupling the P helix with S6, whereas Glu363 could interact with Thr355, coupling the pore wall to the P helix. These interactions are essential for normal gating and underlie the transduction between the CNB domain and the pore.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>CNG channels underlie sensory transduction in vertebrate photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fesenko et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zimmerman et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura and Gold, 1987</xref>) and require cyclic nucleotides (CNs) to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaupp et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zagotta and Siegelbaum, 1996</xref>). The analysis of the amino acid sequence of the CNGA1 subunit indicates the existence of six transmembrane segments, usually referred to as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6 helices. Between the S5 and S6 helices there is a pore region, showing a significant sequence homology with the pore region of K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becchetti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu and Siegelbaum, 2000</xref>); it suggests that the corresponding 3-D structure of CNG channels is similar to that of K<sup>+</sup> channels, composed of a P helix and a hairpin. Next to the S6 helix, near the C terminal of the channel, there is the CN-binding (CNB) domain located at a distance of some tens of angstroms from the pore region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matulef and Zagotta, 2003</xref>). The pore region in CNG channels also acts as the gate, and conformational changes occurring in the filter are indeed thought to underlie gating in these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fodor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becchetti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becchetti and Roncaglia, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu and Siegelbaum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flynn and Zagotta, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Contreras et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, molecular events occurring in the CNB domain must be coupled to movements of the pore walls.</p><p>CNG channels open in the presence of a steady CN concentration, and their opening probability remains unaltered as long as CNs are present in the medium bathing the intracellular side of the membrane. Some years ago, it was shown that a point mutation in the pore region changed rather profoundly the gating of CNGA1 channels from bovine rods: when Glu363 was mutated into alanine, serine, or asparagine, mutant channels desensitized in the presence of a steady cGMP concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucossi et al., 1996</xref>). Given the significant homology between K<sup>+</sup> and CNG channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becchetti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu and Siegelbaum, 2000</xref>), it is possible that desensitization of mutant channel E363A could originate from molecular mechanisms very similar to those underlying C-type inactivation in K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Contreras et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that C-type inactivation of K<sup>+</sup> channels and desensitization in CNGA1 channel E363A mutant are similarly associated with rearrangements of residues in the outer vestibule and in the P helix. The analysis of the presence or the absence of desensitization in different constructs from CNGA1 channels indicates that Leu356 has a strong hydrophobic interaction with Phe380, coupling the P helix and S6, and suggests that Glu363 could interact with Thr355, coupling the pore wall to the P helix. Our results show that these interactions are essential for normal gating: they underlie the transduction between the CNB domain and the pore, and their disruption is responsible for desensitization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Molecular biology</title><p>The CNGA1 channel from bovine rod consisting of 690 residues was used.

This second subunit was made by replacing the ApaI restriction site GGGCCC at the end of the CNGA1 DNA without changing the amino acid GGTCCC and adding to the start codon a new ApaI restriction site, followed by a linker using a PCR reaction.

We performed an extensive scanning mutagenesis from Val348 to Phe380 to find desensitizing mutant CNGA1 channels replacing the native residue with an alanine or cysteine. As the 3-D structure of CNGA1 channels is not identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mazzolini et al., 2008</xref>) to that of the construct where all native cysteines have been replaced by a residue not bearing a thiol group (CNGA1<sub>cys-free</sub>), we inserted alanine or cysteine residues in the CNGA1 background and not in the CNGA1<sub>cys-free</sub> background. The great majority of these mutant channels did not desensitize, but we found four mutant channels, which in the presence of a steady concentration of 1 mM cGMP desensitized: L356A, E363A, T355A, and F380A.

C-type inactivation has been recently investigated at a detailed molecular level in the KcsA channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cordero-Morales et al., 2006a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chakrapani et al., 2007</xref>), and it is almost abolished in the KcsA channel E71A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordero-Morales et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that modifications of chemical interactions in the pore region control the degree of inactivation. These observations indicate that desensitization of mutant channels T355A, L356A, E363A, and F380A, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, could originate from the disruption and/or weakening of important chemical interactions necessary for the physiological operation of the channel. As the gate of CNG channels is thought to be located in the pore itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fodor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becchetti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becchetti and Roncaglia, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu and Siegelbaum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flynn and Zagotta, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Contreras et al., 2008</xref>), the S6 helices must couple conformational rearrangements occurring in the CNB domain to movements of the pore walls. To identify the chemical interactions underlying this coupling, we analyzed similarities and differences between the amino acid sequence of CNGA1, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> channels. The sequence alignment of CNG channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>), compatible with previous experimental results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becchetti and Roncaglia, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu and Siegelbaum, 2000</xref>) and Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tempel et al., 1987</xref>), K<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Long et al., 2005a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">b</xref>), K<sub>v</sub>2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Long et al., 2007</xref>), KcsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>), and NaK channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi et al., 2006</xref>), shows three main features. First, the signature GYG of K<sup>+</sup> channels is absent in CNGA1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heginbotham et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">1994</xref>). Second, in CNGA1 channels there are several hydrophobic residues in the upper portion of the S6 (Phe380, Leu381, and Iso382) and in the P helix (Leu356 and Leu358), suggesting that the expected coupling between these two domains could be mediated by hydrophobic interactions between these residues. Third, Met448, Thr449, and Pro450 (in the green box of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>) of the K<sup>+</sup> Shaker channel change their accessibility to chemical modification during C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1996</xref>). The identification of residues in CNGA1 showing a similar behavior will identify conformational changes occurring during desensitization in mutant CNGA1 channels.</p><sec><title>Conformational rearrangements during desensitization</title><p>A seminal investigation of C-type inactivation of K<sup>+</sup> Shaker channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1996</xref>) has shown that C-type inactivation is associated to conformational changes occurring in the outer vestibule, during which some residues become more accessible to the reagents added to the extracellular side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1996</xref>). C-type inactivation is abolished in the KcsA channel E71A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordero-Morales et al., 2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2007</xref>), i.e., when a negative residue in the pore region has been neutralized and replaced with a smaller residue. Therefore, desensitization of mutant channel E363A, where the glutamate in the pore region has been neutralized, could share molecular mechanisms similar to those of C-type inactivation in K<sup>+</sup> channels. Given the homology between CNGA1 and K<sup>+</sup> channels, we asked whether desensitization in mutant channel E363A could be mediated by conformational changes similar to those occurring during C-type inactivation in K<sup>+</sup> Shaker channels in which mutant channels M448C, T449C, and P450C change their accessibility to chemical modification in the inactivated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>To verify this hypothesis, we engineered two desensitizing mutant channels, E363A+T364C and E363A+P366C, bearing a cysteine in positions similar to those of Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channels, known to become more accessible to extracellular MTSET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1996</xref>) in the inactivated state. In the K<sup>+</sup> channel M448C mutant, the current flowing through open channels rapidly declined and did not recover upon termination of the prolonged depolarization. This phenomenon is due to cross-linking among exogenous cysteines coming very close when observed in the inactivated state.</p><p>To test accessibility of the pore in the closed, open, and desensitized states, we used a protocol similar to that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al. (1996)</xref>. As desensitization is more pronounced and faster at negative voltages, we analyzed the time course of the CNG current at &#x02212;60 mV. Mutant channel E363A+T364C in the presence of a steady concentration of 1 mM cGMP rapidly desensitized, and the cGMP-activated current progressively and irreversibly declined to 18.7 &#x000b1; 2.0% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) from its original level within 1 or 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Removal of cGMP for several minutes did not restore the initial amplitude of the cGMP-activated current. Because in Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel M448C mutant the rundown of the current was reduced and reverted by the application of the reducing agent DTT to the extracellular medium, we performed similar experiments in mutant channel E363A+T364C. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, when 5 mM DTT was added to the solution filling the patch pipette, the decline of the cGMP-activated current in the mutant channel E363A+T364C was almost prevented. In fact, after 60 s the peak of the cGMP-activated current declined by &#x0223c;20% in the presence of DTT, but by &#x0223c;80% in its absence. The spontaneous decline of the cGMP-activated current in mutant channel E363A+T364C in the presence of a continuous application of 1 mM cGMP was greatly reduced by the presence of DTT both in the patch pipette and in the medium bathing the intracellular side of the patch membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>State-dependent modification of the mutant channel E363A+T364C. cGMP-activated current traces at +60 mV in three different conformations of mutant channel: desensitized (A), closed (D), and open (E) states.

By analogy with the interpretation of the results obtained for Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel M448C mutant, it is concluded that in CNGA1 channel E363A mutant, Thr364 in different subunits in the desensitized state becomes closer; consequently, disulfide bonds form spontaneously, leading to an irreversible channel closure.</p><p>When 2.5 mM MTSET was present in the solution filling the patch pipette, corresponding to the extracellular side of the membrane of excised patches, the CNG current declined faster in the open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>) than in the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>).

The CNGA1 channel contains seven native cysteines: Cys35, Cys169, Cys186, Cys314, Cys481, Cys505, and Cys573. Cys35 is located at the cytoplasmic side near the N terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molday et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 1998</xref>), and there are experimental evidences indicating that Cys35 interacts with Cys481 in the open state, but not in the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gordon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosenbaum and Gordon, 2002</xref>).

Cys481 is located in the C-linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 1998</xref>), and its role in channel function has been extensively studied. Modification of Cys481 in the open state with sulfhydryl reagents potentiates CNGA1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 1998</xref>). Cys505 in the CNB domain is accessible to sulfhydryl reagents in the closed state, but not in the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matulef et al., 1999</xref>). Cys573 is located near the C terminus of the CNGA1 channel. The only endogenous cysteine likely to be located near the pore region is Cys314 in the S5 transmembrane segment, and it is known to interact with residues at position 380 in the S6 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nair et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, we constructed the double-mutant channel T355C+C314S and verified that the current activated by 1 mM cGMP exhibited an irreversible decline, with a time course very similar to that noted for the single-mutant channel T355C, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>.

Therefore, Thr355's of CNGA1 channel in different subunits need to be closer to each other than Val58's in NaK channel.

The mutant channel F380C can be locked either in the open or closed state in the presence of oxidizing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nair et al., 2006</xref>), but in their absence it has normal gating and does not desensitize. The double-mutant channel L356C+F380C was constructed, and it did not desensitize in the presence of a steady cGMP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). However, application of DTT did not modify the observed behavior, and cGMP-activated current also did not desensitize after exposure to DTT for 20 min. The lack of effect of DTT could be explained if disulfide bonds between L356C and F380C are buried in the membrane and are poorly accessible to the bathing medium (not depicted). If Leu356 and Phe380 form a strong hydrophobic interaction necessary for normal gating, non-desensitizing functional channels should be observed in mutant channels where Leu356 and Phe380 were interchanged. The mutant channel L356F did not express (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>), but normal gating was observed in mutant channel F380L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Mutant channel L356F presumably did not express because phenylalanine is much larger than leucine and could not fit properly in the restricted space between the P helix and S6, whereas leucine could substitute for phenylalanine for the formation of the hydrophobic interaction in mutant channel F380L. The double-mutant channel L356F+F380L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>) expressed and had a normal gating.

These tandem constructs exhibited desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>, middle row), although to a lesser extent than mutant channel L356C; in particular, the cGMP-activated current at +60 mV declined to 79.0 &#x000b1; 5.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and to 80.0 &#x000b1; 4.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) of its original level for the tandem L356C<sub>tandem</sub>WT and L356C<sub>tandem</sub>F380C, respectively.

The hydrophobic interaction between Leu356 and Phe380 provides the molecular coupling between S6 and the P helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The upper portion of S6 is rich in hydrophobic residues (Val376, Val377, Phe380, Leu381, and Val384), whereas Leu356 in the P helix is mostly flanked by polar residues. Therefore, when Phe380 is mutated, neighboring hydrophobic residues contribute to the coupling with Leu356, whereas in mutant channel L356C this coupling is lost. These observations provide a rationale that explains why desensitization is observed in mutant channel L356C and not in mutant channel F380C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

The flexibility of the filter of CNGA1 channels is likely to underlie the poor selectivity of CNG channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaupp and Seifert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craven and Zagotta, 2006</xref>) and the coupling between permeation and gating observed in these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holmgren, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamel and Torre, 2000</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are extremely thankful to Anita Zimmerman for reading and commenting on the manuscript.
