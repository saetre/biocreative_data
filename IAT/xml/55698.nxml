It is clear that multiple parameters can contribute to exon recognition, including the sequence of the splice junctions bordering the exon, internal exon sequences, sequences in the surrounding introns and exon size. Most vertebrate exons are between 50 and 400 nt long, the average being 137 nt; &#x0003c;1&#x00025; of internal exons are &#x0003e;400 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c2">2</xref>). This observation, along with functional studies of small and large exons, has suggested that a functional exon size limit exists when an exon is surrounded by large (greater than &#x0223c;500 nt) introns (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c6">6</xref>). Interactions among factors bound at the splice sites bordering an exon is an important first step in exon recognition and these interactions are optimal when the exon is at least 50 nt and less than &#x0223c;500 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c7">7</xref>). Therefore, exons that fall outside these size constraints are more likely to be alternative exons or to have additional features that enhance their recognition by the splice machinery. Indeed, naturally occurring small exons are often alternatively processed such that the exon is included or excluded in different cell types and sequences within the exon and surrounding introns contribute to this regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c11">11</xref>). In several cases, when the splice sites were improved to better match the consensus sequences the small exons became constitutively spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c12">12</xref>). Only a few abnormally large internal exons have been examined to date, all of which are alternatively processed; these include the 3500, 1090 and 800 nt exons of the breast cancer 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c13">13</xref>), caldesmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c14">14</xref>) and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c15">15</xref>), respectively. Improving the 5&#x02032; splice site of the NCAM alternative exon resulted in constitutive splicing of this exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c16">16</xref>) and sequences in the upstream exon were shown to contribute to its regulated splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c17">17</xref>). However, other sequences in and surrounding these or other large exons have not been examined for splice enhancing activity. One might presume that exons &#x0003e;400&#x02013;500 nt, whether they are alternatively or constitutively spliced, would also require specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences in order to be efficiently recognized. These sequences may be similar to those found in small or alternatively processed exons. Alternatively, large exons may require multiple sequences, some of which may be similar to those described for other exons while others may be unique to large exons. In order to understand all the intricacies of the splicing machinery and exon recognition it will be important to understand how all types of exons are efficiently recognized. Therefore, we have examined sequences within and surrounding a large constitutively spliced exon and found that while some previously identified sequences may be important for recognition, other features, such as strong splice sites, that are sufficient for small exon inclusion may not be sufficient for large exons.</p><p> We have begun to study the fourth exon of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) gene which is 654 nt long yet is efficiently spliced into the mRNA in all vertebrates examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c22">22</xref>), except for the rabbit, where it is either excluded from or included in the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c23">23</xref>). The pIgR protein transports polymeric immunoglobulins (Ig), primarily IgA, from the basolateral to the apical surface of epithelial cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c24">24</xref>). This protein is a member of the Ig superfamily of structurally related cell surface proteins and the large exon 4 encodes two Ig-like domains. Such domains are usually encoded by single exons; pIgR exon 4 is the only example in which two domains are encoded by a single exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c25">25</xref>).</p><p> To study pIgR exon 4 splicing we have constructed a chimeric D<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;pIgR gene by placing the large exon 4 from the mouse pIgR gene with part of its surrounding introns into the third intron of the mouse major histocompatibility complex class I D<sup>d</sup> gene. We have shown that the pIgR exon is efficiently spliced into the D<sup>d</sup> mRNA and have described an exon deletion that creates a cryptic 3&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c26">26</xref>). This site activated an upstream cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site, resulting in creation of a cryptic intron. Interestingly, the location of the cryptic splice sites are between protein coding domains where introns exist in other Ig superfamily genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c26">26</xref>). Here we describe our further examination of sequences within the exon, the downstream intron and the normal and cryptic 5&#x02032; splice sites to better understand the interactions among these sequences that contribute to efficient recognition of this exon. We found that the strength of the 5&#x02032; splice site is a crucial feature of this large exon. However, although the splice sites are strong when compared to consensus sequences, they were not sufficient to confer efficient splicing of a large exon. Other sequences, including at least two exonic sequences and one evolutionarily conserved intronic sequence, are redundant features that contribute to pIgR exon 4 recognition. Also, since cryptic 5&#x02032; splice sites were activated by several different mutations, the balance between use of these potential splice sites, which create much smaller exons, and the normal 5&#x02032; splice site must be modulated by the presence of sequences that enhance use of the normal 5&#x02032; splice site or repress potential cryptic sites. In addition, sequences that enhance use of the cryptic splice sites must be absent from this large exon; when such sequences were introduced, cryptic splice reactions were activated and the large exon was no longer spliced intact.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The construction of D<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;pIgR was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c26">26</xref>).

A total of 100 &#x000b5;g RNA, a combination of 50&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;g specific RNA and carrier RNA, was hyridized overnight at 50&#x000b0;C with the labeled probe.

The protected fragments were separated on a 6&#x00025; acrylamide, 7 M urea gel and quantitated by phosphorimager analysis. Multiple protected fragments are observed with the cryptically spliced RNAs due to fortuitous partial homology between the probe and the D<sup>d</sup> exon 4 sequences to which the cryptic site is spliced; by changing the S1 digestion temperature all bands could be combined into one.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>We have previously described a chimeric D<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;pIgR gene constructed to study sequences within the 654 nt pIgR exon 4 that are necessary for its efficient full-length inclusion into the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c26">26</xref>). We placed the 654 bp exon with 262 bp of upstream intron and 420 bp of downstream intron sequence into the large intron 3 of the D<sup>d</sup> gene to produce D<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;pIgR; the intron upstream of the pIgR exon is 814 nt and the intron downstream is 1537 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f1">1</xref>A). This placement is important since the normal location of exon pIgR 4 is also between two large introns (2592 and 1237 nt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c30">30</xref>) and introns less than &#x0223c;500 nt can affect efficient splicing of large exons by intron definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c6">6</xref>). When we transiently expressed this chimeric construct in the human HepG2 liver cell line, full inclusion of the exon was observed by RT&#x02013;PCR using primers to the upstream D<sup>d</sup> exon 3 and the downstream D<sup>d</sup> exon 4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f2">2</xref>A, lane 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c26">26</xref>). This indicates that all sequences necessary for full inclusion of this large exon have been transferred to the heterologous context.</p><sec><title>5&#x02032; splice site mutations activate a cryptic splice reaction</title><p>A strong 5&#x02032; splice site has been shown to enhance the inclusion of both small and alternatively processed exons (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c16">16</xref>) and the normal 5&#x02032; splice site at the 3&#x02032;-end of pIgR exon 4 has a 7 out of 9 nt match to the 5&#x02032; splice site consensus sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f1">1</xref>B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c31">31</xref>). To determine if the 5&#x02032; splice site strength was required for recognition of pIgR exon 4 we made a single A&#x02192;C point mutation at nt &#x0002b;4 that would decrease the match to the consensus sequence of the 5&#x02032; splice site (5&#x02032;SS, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f1">1</xref>B). RNA from 5&#x02032;SS transiently expressed in HepG2 cells was analyzed by RT&#x02013;PCR using primers for D<sup>d</sup> exons 3 and 4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f2">2</xref>B). We detected the full-length 878 bp product plus two smaller products of &#x0223c;830 and 380 bp (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f2">2</xref>A, lane 7), which likely result from cryptic splicing within the pIgR exon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f2">2</xref>B). We cloned and sequenced these smaller RT&#x02013;PCR products and found that the smallest one corresponds to use of a cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site 158 nt into pIgR exon 4 that is being spliced directly to D<sup>d</sup> exon 4 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f2">2</xref>B). Interestingly, this is the same cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site that was activated in pIgR&#x02013;&#x00394;Hc when an improved 3&#x02032; splice site was created by the deletional junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c26">26</xref>). However, the sequence of the larger potential cryptic splice product matched that of the full exon. Also, this 830 bp PCR product was not present consistently in our PCR reactions. We conclude that it is likely a hybrid between the full-length RT&#x02013;PCR product and the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site RT&#x02013;PCR product and not a unique cryptically spliced RNA. Such a hybrid PCR artifact has been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c32">32</xref>).</p><p> To quantitate the relative amounts of cryptically spliced RNA compared to normally spliced RNA in 5&#x02032;SS, S1 nuclease protection assays were performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>). A cDNA probe that spans the D<sup>d</sup> exon 3&#x02013;pIgR splice junction and extends beyond the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site sequence was used to quantitate these two RNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>C). This probe would also identify RNAs from which the entire pIgR exon was omitted and those that use any other cryptic splice sites in this region. As seen by RT&#x02013;PCR, D<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;pIgR RNA was mostly fully spliced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>A, lane 1); because of a variable lane background we have determined the ratio of full-length to cryptically spliced RNA for this construct to be &#x02265;30 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>B, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke338tb2">2</xref>). The cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site was activated at least 6-fold when the normal 5&#x02032; splice site was mutated in 5&#x02032;SS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>A, lane 5 and 3B and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke338tb2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion of pIgR exon sequences</title><p>Alternatively processed and small exons often require sequences within the exon or surrounding intron for full exon inclusion; in some cases these exonic splice enhancer (ESE) sequences are purine-rich or A&#x0002f;C-rich (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c36">36</xref>). It is likely that large exons also contain splice enhancing sequences to enable efficient splicing. To begin to explore pIgR exon 4 sequences for such activities we made several deletions within the pIgR exon that ranged in size from 54 to 192 bp and that removed some of the 7&#x02013;12 nt long purine-rich and 7&#x02013;9 nt long A&#x0002f;C-rich sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f1">1</xref>B). We have previously shown that while the 84 bp <italic>Hin</italic>cII deletion resulted in striking activation of a cryptic splice reaction, this fragment did not contain ESE activity in a heterologous context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c26">26</xref>). We also constructed a 76 bp deletion that spanned the two <italic>Ppu</italic>MI sites (D<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;PpuMI), a 192 bp deletion that spanned the two <italic>Bsu</italic>36I sites (D<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;Bsu36I) and a 54 bp deletion that spanned the two <italic>Eco</italic>NI sites (D<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;EcoNI). These were transiently expressed in HepG2 cells and the RNA was analyzed by RT&#x02013;PCR. None of the deletion mutations noticeably affected pIgR exon 4 splicing; the full-length RT&#x02013;PCR product for each construct was predictably shortened by the size of the exon deletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f2">2</xref>A, lanes 2&#x02013;5). RNA from these exon deletions was also examined by S1 nuclease protection analysis. Predominantly full inclusion of the exon was seen with the EcoNI and PpuMI constructs, (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>A, lanes 2 and 4, and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>B). However, the Bsu36I construct showed an &#x0223c;2-fold increase in use of the same cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site that was strongly activated in the 5&#x02032;SS construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>A, lane 3, and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>B), suggesting that this 192 nt region may contain sequences with ESE-like activity. By Southern blotting the RT&#x02013;PCR reaction from the Bsu36I construct we were able to detect a faint band smaller than the full-length product but larger than the 382 bp product of the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site spliced to D<sup>d</sup> exon 4, suggesting that a different cryptic splice reaction had been activated (data not shown). However, this low abundance product was not characterized further. This exon deletional data suggests there may be some ESE activity within the Bsu36I region, but there was no evidence for similar activity in the other two fragments. However, it is not clear whether these regions truly lack ESE activity or whether it cannot be detected because redundant elements are present elsewhere in the pIgR sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>The 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; splice sites are not sufficient for pIgR exon inclusion</title><p>Since most of the pIgR exon 4 deletions had a minimal effect on splicing, but weakening the 5&#x02032; splice site activated a cryptic splice site, it was possible that the strength of the splice sites alone was sufficient for recognition of this large exon. Consistent with this idea, the normal 3&#x02032; splice site at the 5&#x02032;-end of exon 4 appears to be fairly strong; it contains a 6 of 7 nt match to the consensus branch point sequence followed by a 17 of 20 nt polypyrimidine tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c31">31</xref>). To test whether the pIgR exon 4 splice sites were sufficient for full exon recognition we replaced internal pIgR exon sequence with heterologous sequence and analyzed the splicing patterns of the chimeric exons. We removed a 580 bp <italic>Acc</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Eco</italic>NI fragment from pIgR exon 4, leaving 30 bp at the 5&#x02032;-end and 44 bp at the 3&#x02032;-end of the exon. Two cDNA fragments from the Ig &#x000b5; constant region (C&#x000b5;), 326 and 565 bp, were inserted into the pIgR exon; the 326 bp cDNA fragment was also inserted in the opposite orientation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f4">4</xref>). Thus, the exon sizes of 639 nt in AE&#x0002f;BP and 400 nt in AE&#x0002f;RR and AE&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) were similar to or smaller than the 654 nt pIgR exon. RNA from these constructs was analyzed by S1 nuclease protection; the RNA will protect the probe only to the <italic>Acc</italic>I site in pIgR exon 4 but will detect any RNA that has skipped the modified exon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>B). Both AE&#x0002f;BP and AE&#x0002f;RR RNA protected the probe to the <italic>Acc</italic>I site, indicating that the RNA was correctly spliced across the D<sup>d</sup> exon 3&#x02013;pIgR exon 4 junction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>A, lanes 4 and 7). However, the chimeric exon is frequently skipped in the AE&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) RNA and only a small amount of protection to the <italic>Acc</italic>I site is seen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>, lane 1). These results indicate that the pIgR exon 4 splice site sequences alone are not capable of directing efficient inclusion of the chimeric AE&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) exon, even though it is only 400 nt long, which is within the size range that should be more efficiently recognized by exon definition. They also suggest that there are ESE sequences within the C&#x000b5; cDNA BP and RR fragments in the sense orientation that are not present in the antisense orientation. While it is also possible that the RR(&#x02013;) fragment may contain sequences that inhibit splicing, exons containing this fragment are spliced when additional pIgR exon 4 is included (see below). Therefore, if such negative sequences exist in this fragment, they can be overcome by positive acting elements in the pIgR exon sequence.</p><p> To delineate the regions within pIgR exon 4 that could enhance exon inclusion we altered the portions of exon 4 remaining in the chimeric exon. We removed a 325 bp <italic>Hin</italic>cII&#x02013;<italic>Bsu</italic>36I fragment from pIgR exon 4, leaving 227 bp of sequence at the 5&#x02032;-end and 102 bp of sequence at the 3&#x02032;-end of the exon and inserted the 326 bp C&#x000b5; cDNA sequence in both orientations to make HB&#x0002f;RR and HB&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;); this chimeric exon is 655 nt long (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f4">4</xref>). We also removed the 84 bp <italic>Hin</italic>cII fragment from the pIgR exon and inserted the 326 bp C&#x000b5; cDNA, making the exon 896 nt long in HH&#x0002f;RR and HH&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f4">4</xref>). Correctly spliced RNA from all of these constructs will protect the S1 probe to the <italic>Hin</italic>cII site and any exon skipping or cryptic splice site use up to this sequence will also be detected. Both constructs with the C&#x000b5; RR fragment in the sense orientation mainly protected the probe to the <italic>Hin</italic>cII site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6). However, RNA from HB&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) used the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site predominantly; very little RNA protecting the probe to the <italic>Hin</italic>cII site was seen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>A, lane 2). This suggests that the pIgR exon 4 sequences that had been added back to this construct prevent exon skipping but are not sufficient to confer full-length exon inclusion; when the cryptic splice site was added back, in the <italic>Acc</italic>I and <italic>Hin</italic>cII fragment, this became the preferred 5&#x02032; splice site. Surprisingly, RNA from HH&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) mainly protected the probe to the <italic>Hin</italic>cII site, suggesting efficient exon inclusion, even though the exon is now 896 nt long (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>A, lane 3). Thus, replacing the downstream <italic>Hin</italic>cII&#x02013;<italic>Bsu</italic>36I region of pIgR exon 4 restored intact exon splicing and prevented use of the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site. These results identify two regions within pIgR exon 4, one upstream and one downstream from the <italic>Hin</italic>cII sites, that are likely to contain ESE elements that aid in efficient exon inclusion.</p><p> The S1 probe used with these exon replacement constructs only provides information about the splice patterns in the 5&#x02032;&#x000a0;portion of the exon; it would not detect other cryptic splice reactions within the substituted parts of the exon or further downstream. Thus, we examined the RNA from these constructs by RT&#x02013;PCR to determine the sizes of the pIgR exons spliced into the D<sup>d</sup> RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>C). The chimeric exon in AE&#x0002f;RR is fully spliced, as indicated by the 624 bp RT&#x02013;PCR product and AE&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) shows a significant amount of exon skipping, seen as the 224 bp product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>C, lanes 1 and 2). The chimeric exon in AE&#x0002f;BP was also fully spliced (data not shown). The RNA from HB&#x0002f;RR mainly included the full chimeric exon, but also skipped the exon and used the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site at detectable levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>C, lane 3); these other minor RNAs were not clearly seen in the S1 analysis. RNA from HB&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) was predominantly spliced using the cryptic 5&#x02032;&#x000a0;splice site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>C, lane 4), consistent with the S1 analysis data. Both HH&#x0002f;RR and HH&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) RNA predominantly included the entire 896 nt chimeric exon, as indicated by the 1120 bp RT&#x02013;PCR product, although a low level of other smaller products can also be seen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f5">5</xref>C, lanes 5 and 6). These results obtained by RT&#x02013;PCR analysis complement and confirm the information from the S1 nuclease assays.</p></sec><sec><title>An evolutionarily conserved intronic splice enhancer sequence</title><p>Intronic sequences have also been shown to contribute to splice site recognition and regulation (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c37">37</xref>). When we sequenced the intronic regions of the <italic>Eco</italic>RI&#x02013;<italic>Hin</italic>dIII mouse pIgR fragment included in our chimeric construct we found a strikingly purine-rich region 13 nt into the intron downstream of pIgR exon 4. In this region 21 of 22 nt are purines, including a run of 11 G residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f6">6</xref>). We sequenced this portion of intron 4 from the human gene and also found a purine-rich sequence (23 of 25 nt are purines) in a similar location with respect to the 5&#x02032; splice site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f6">6</xref>). The conservation of this purine-rich sequence led us to investigate whether this region may contribute to exon recognition. It has been shown that intronic G-rich sequences enhance use of a small exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c37">37</xref>) and G-triplets enhance use of an upstream 5&#x02032;&#x000a0;splice site in small introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c38">38</xref>). We deleted a 116 bp <italic>Xcm</italic>I fragment from the intron which removed the purine-rich region and some additional downstream sequence (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f6">6</xref>); this reduced the intron length minimally, from 1537 to 1421 nt. However, RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of this construct transiently expressed in HepG2 cells showed that there was no activation of cryptic splice sites or exon skipping; it was expressed identically to the wild-type construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f2">2</xref>A, lane 6, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>A, lane 6 and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>B).</p><p> It is likely that both the 5&#x02032; splice site strength and additional sequence elements contribute to exon 4 inclusion. If so, the&#x000a0;combination of the 5&#x02032; splice site mutation with the intron deletion may have a cumulative effect on pIgR exon 4 splicing. To test this idea we combined 5&#x02032;SS with the <italic>Xcm</italic>I deletion, to make Xcm 5&#x02032;SS. By RT&#x02013;PCR we observed activation of the same cryptic splice reaction seen in the 5&#x02032;SS mutation alone (data not shown). By S1 nuclease assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>A, lane 7) there was a 3-fold increase in cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site use in Xcm 5&#x02032;SS as compared to 5&#x02032;SS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f3">3</xref>B). This suggests that the <italic>Xcm</italic>I intronic element does aid recognition of the normal 5&#x02032; splice site but this can only be detected experimentally when other features that also contribute to exon recognition are weakened.</p></sec><sec><title>G-rich sequences activate the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site</title><p>The active sequences of the evolutionarily conserved intronic enhancer element within the <italic>Xcm</italic>I fragment are likely to be the long purine-rich stretch, more specifically, the multiple G residues. To determine whether a G-rich sequence could activate the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site in competition with the normal wild-type 5&#x02032; splice site we created a G<sub>8</sub> sequence 27 nt downstream from the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site in pIgR, to make pIgR Gs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f7">7</xref>A). This sequence should not act as an ESE since poly(G) does not have this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c39">39</xref>). As a control to ensure that the sequences we disrupted did not have regulatory activity, such as suppressing cryptic splice site use or enhancing full exon inclusion, we also changed this sequence to a non-G-rich sequence to make pIgR NonGs. By S1 nuclease analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f7">7</xref>B) we observed significant activation of the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site from the pIgR Gs construct, but not from the pIgR NonGs construct. RT&#x02013;PCR analysis showed that the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site was being spliced to D<sup>d</sup> exon 4 (data not shown). Surprisingly, the G<sub>8</sub> mutation activated the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site to a greater extent than did the 5&#x02032;SS mutation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke338tb2">2</xref>). The G-rich sequences are clearly strong activators of the weaker cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site even though the normal 5&#x02032; splice site remains wild-type and is followed by the downstream purine-rich sequence. These results are consistent with the activities of other G-rich intronic splice enhancing sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c38">38</xref>) and with our proposal that the G-rich sequence within the <italic>Xcm</italic>I fragment also has splice enhancing activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions among cryptic splice sites within pIgR exon 4</title><p>The frequency with which each nucleotide occurs at each position of a 5&#x02032; splice site has been determined and used to calculate a match to consensus score for any real or potential 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c31">31</xref>). We have calculated a score for the natural pIgR 5&#x02032; splice site of 89 and for the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site of 76 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f8">8</xref>); by this measure, this cryptic site is the closest match to the consensus sequence within pIgR exon 4. A sequence 50 nt upstream is the next best match to consensus with a score of 69; this site was used to a small extent only when the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site was mutated away from consensus (to a score of 63) in &#x00394;Hc547D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c26">26</xref>). To further examine the interactions among natural and cryptic splice sites in this exon and the features that contribute to their recognition we mutated the upstream potential cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site to enhance its match to the consensus sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f9">9</xref>A). We made a 1 nt change in pt1 and a 2 nt change in pt2 so that these sites now had scores of 81 and 90, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f8">8</xref>). These mutations were made in pIgR and in pIgR&#x02013;Xcm to determine whether the intronic element in the <italic>Xcm</italic>I fragment would affect use of the natural 5&#x02032; splice site under these conditions. By RT&#x02013;PCR analysis we observed both full-length pIgR exon 4 inclusion and activation of the new cryptic 5&#x02032;&#x000a0;splice site in all constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f9">9</xref>B, 878 and 332 bp products, respectively). S1 nuclease protection assays confirmed the location of the cryptic splice site and quantitated the amount of cryptic splice site activation (data not shown and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke338tb2">2</xref>). The pt1 mutation was able to detectably compete with the normal 5&#x02032; splice site, as seen by an &#x0223c;3-fold activation of the cryptic site in pIgR pt1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f9">9</xref>B and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke338tb2">2</xref>). Use of the new cryptic site was greatly enhanced by the pt2 mutation; there was a nearly 17-fold increase in the use of this site in pIgR pt2 relative to pIgR (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke338tb2">2</xref>). In both pt1 and pt2 the amount of new cryptic site activation was &#x0223c;2-fold higher when the <italic>Xcm</italic>I fragment was deleted, consistent with the presence of a splice enhancing sequence within this fragment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke338tb2">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this paper we have examined the 654 nt mouse pIgR exon 4 to identify features that contribute to its efficient splicing, even though it exceeds the size of &#x0003e;99&#x00025; of internal exons. This is the first constitutively spliced large exon that has been studied in this way. The strong 5&#x02032; splice site of this exon was required for full intact exon splicing as mutating it away from the consensus sequence partially activated a far upstream cryptic site. However, the splice junctions of the pIgR exon were not sufficient to confer efficient splicing on a chimeric large exon, indicating that strong splice sites are not always sufficient for exon recognition. Thus, pIgR exonic sequences must also contribute to overcoming the negative impact of a large exon size. However, rather than finding a single feature or sequence element that was responsible for efficient intact splicing, we found evidence for multiple redundant elements, including at least two exonic and one intronic sequence elements that each contribute to the exon recognition process (summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f10">10</xref>). These elements were only revealed when another positive acting element had been weakened or eliminated. For example, an effect of the intronic element was detected only&#x000a0;when the normal 5&#x02032; splice site was weakened or was in competition with an improved internal cryptic splice site. Also, a clear effect of the exonic sequences within the <italic>Bsu</italic>36I fragment were seen when they were added back to an exon that had been expanded by 242 nt; when this region was deleted from the intact exon only a 2-fold effect was observed. However, by deleting the <italic>Bsu</italic>36I fragment we also shortened the exon to 462 nt, which may have reduced the burden of large exon size and made it less dependent on ESE-like sequences. Indeed, if multiple <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements are involved in recognizing this large exon the removal of some, with the concomitant decrease in exon size, would make it difficult to identify these elements by this approach. Another feature of the pIgR exon that appears to be important for its intact full-length splicing is that potential internal cryptic 5&#x02032; splice sites must be sufficiently weak and lack nearby sequences that would enhance their use (e.g. G-triplets) so as to not compete with recognition of the normal 5&#x02032; splice site. It is also possible that the pIgR exon contains sequences that normally suppress the use of potential internal cryptic sites. When we improved potential splice sites and&#x0002f;or introduced nearby regulatory elements into the pIgR exon the cryptic sites were recognized by the splicing apparatus and the exon became alternatively spliced.</p><p> The exon replacement experiments clearly established that multiple exonic sequences contribute to the splicing efficiency of pIgR exon 4. The pIgR splice junctions were not sufficient for recognition of a large chimeric exon; the AE&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) exon was spliced out of the mRNA more frequently than it was spliced in. However, when the 197 nt <italic>Acc</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Hin</italic>cII fragment near the 5&#x02032;-end of the exon was added to the chimeric exon the exon was no longer skipped but was spliced nearly exclusively using the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site contained within this fragment. Therefore, this region must contain sequences that contribute to exon recognition, but they are not sufficient for recognition of the entire intact exon. When the 241 nt <italic>Hin</italic>cII&#x02013;<italic>Bsu</italic>36I fragment was also included in the HH&#x0002f;RR(&#x02013;) chimeric exon, recognition of the entire exon was restored, even though it was expanded by 242 nt to 896 nt long. Therefore, this region must contain ESE sequences that assist this large exon to be recognized intact and somehow suppress use of the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site. The positive acting element(s) within the <italic>Acc</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Hin</italic>cII fragment could be one or more of the purine-rich or A&#x0002f;C-rich sequences within this fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f10">10</xref>). Alternatively, it could be the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site sequence itself that eliminates exon skipping since 5&#x02032; splice site-like sequences have been shown to act as splice enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c41">41</xref>). There are also a couple of purine-rich and A&#x0002f;C-rich sequences within the <italic>Hin</italic>cII&#x02013;<italic>Bsu</italic>36I fragment which may be active. We have tested several subfragments of this exon for ESE activity in the heterologous &#x000b5;AV transcript whose splicing requires an ESE element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c10">10</xref>). However, the purine-rich sequences in the Hc fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c26">26</xref>) and several A&#x0002f;C-rich and purine-rich sequences we have so far tested do not contain ESE activity in this assay (data not shown). As these are not the only types of sequences known to have ESE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c42">42</xref>) it is very likely that other sequences also participate in pIgR exon 4 splicing.</p><p> While several of the exon deletions and exon replacements are predicted to change the reading frame of the chimeric D<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;pIgR protein and thus potentially cause the RNA to be less stable, we do not believe this has a major impact on the conclusions we have obtained from our data. We have been able to detect the predicted RNAs whether they are from out-of-frame or in-frame deletions or insertions. All of the exon replacements with the RR fragment are predicted to be out-of-frame, yet full-length splicing of the chimeric exon, exon skipping and cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site use are all observed in different constructs, depending on the amount of pIgR exon sequence included. The data fit well with the interpretation of gradual restoration of ESE sequences to the chimeric pIgR C&#x000b5; exon.</p><p> We found a strikingly purine-rich intronic sequence directly downstream from exon 4 in both the mouse and human pIgR genes. Deleting this sequence from the pIgR intron had no effect on pIgR exon 4 splicing until the 5&#x02032; splice site was weakened by a point mutation. Then, use of the normal 5&#x02032; splice site was decreased 3-fold in the absence of the <italic>Xcm</italic>I fragment. Also, the wild-type 5&#x02032; splice site was less able to compete with use of the improved cryptic splice sites in pt1 and pt2 when this purine-rich sequence was deleted. G-rich sequences in other splice enhancing intronic elements have been suggested to aid in defining exon&#x02013;intron boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c43">43</xref>). Consistent with this idea, when we mutated the sequence 27 nt downstream from the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site to G<sub>8</sub> the cryptic splice site was greatly activated. This site, which is a poorer match to the consensus than the authentic site, with a score of 76 compared to 89 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f8">8</xref>), competes very effectively with the authentic site when the G-rich sequence is placed downstream. Thus, this element clearly helps to define the cryptic splice site as an authentic site.</p><p> When the normal 5&#x02032; splice site of pIgR exon 4 was weakened by the 5&#x02032;SS point mutation, from a score of 89 to 78, a cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site located 496 nt upstream from the authentic splice site, which has a score of 76, was activated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f8">8</xref>). While activation of cryptic splice sites has commonly been seen in the presence of 5&#x02032; splice site mutations, the activated site is usually located within 100 nt of the authentic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c44">44</xref>). Thus, it is surprising that a site so far from the authentic site is used in the pIgR exon; this likely reflects the negative impact that large exon size has on the efficiency of splicing. The exon created by the cryptic splice site is 158 nt, close to the median internal exon size and likely to be more easily recognized by the spliceosomal apparatus. Also, when another potential cryptic 5&#x02032;&#x000a0;splice site further upstream was mutated to better match the consensus site, from a score of 69 to 90, this site created a 108&#x000a0;nt exon and was also used as an authentic splice site. When the cryptic and authentic sites were similarly matched to the consensus sequence, in pIgR pt2 and 5&#x02032;SS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke338f8">8</xref>), the authentic site was still used more frequently than the cryptic site, despite the differences in exon size. Clearly, other features besides the match to the consensus sequence, such as exonic and intronic sequences acting positively and&#x0002f;or negatively, as well as the size of the exon, contribute to the relative use of these two sites.</p><p> It is interesting that pIgR exon 4 is the only example of an exon in an Ig superfamily member that encodes two Ig-like domains; such domains are usually encoded by single exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c25">25</xref>). This suggests that during evolution of the pIgR gene two separate exons may have fused to create one large exon. Since large exons are rare, exon fusion events to create exons &#x0003e;400 nt must either be rare or not well tolerated, perhaps due to constraints on exon size. Our results suggest that multiple criteria, such as strong splice sites, the presence of ESE sequences and the absence of internal potential cryptic splice sites, would determine whether two fused exons could be successfully maintained as a large exon.</p><p> Despite having an abnormally large size, pIgR exon 4 is efficiently spliced in most mammals. The one exception is in the rabbit pIgR gene, where exon 4 is an alternative exon, being omitted from the mRNA &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c23">23</xref>). The sequence of the rabbit gene is the most divergent of the known pIgR cDNA sequences (mouse, human, rat and bovine; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke338c21">21</xref>); it is intriguing that at least some of the sequence differences would be expected to affect splicing when judged by the data presented here. For example, the rabbit exon 4 does not contain the cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site used in the mouse exon, five of the seven purine-rich sequences are interrupted by pyrimidines, only one of the five A&#x0002f;C-rich sequences have been conserved and the 5&#x02032; splice site sequence matches that of the 5&#x02032;SS mutation that we created in the mouse pIgR exon. These observations are consistent with our proposal that efficient splicing of this large exon is due to multiple features of the mouse pIgR pre-mRNA and, likely, the other organisms that constitutively splice exon 4. In addition, the rabbit contains several potential cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site sequences that have scores close to or better than the authentic splice site. It is likely that there are also exonic sequences that act to keep these potential splice sites silent, although a detailed RT&#x02013;PCR analysis has not been performed with the rabbit RNA to determine to what extent they are suppressed. Further comparison of the pIgR exon between rabbit and other species could serve as a model to elucidate how large exons are constitutively spliced, identify potential ESE activity in the mouse exon and examine the role of these ESE sequences in splicing unusually large exons.</p><p> The sequences reported in this paper have been submitted to GenBank, accession numbers AF261083 (human pIgR exon4&#x0002f;intron 4) and AF261084 (mouse pIgR fragment used in this study containing exon 4 and portions of introns 3 and 4).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke338f1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Chimeric D<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;pIgR construct.
