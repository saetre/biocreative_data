As a cell senses its environment, filopodia and lamellipodia are projected forward and extracellular cues are monitored by cell surface receptors. Actin additionally participates in the trafficking of vesicles that transport membrane-associated cargo to and away from the cell surface. To date, three classes of actin nucleators control the rate of actin filament extension, the Arp2/3 complex, Spire, and the formins. The formin family of proteins consists of approximately 25 members, with the forming homology 2 (FH2) domain defining family membership. The formins are expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Wallar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Faix1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

While much has been learned about the Diaphanous-related formins (DRF), very little is known about the regulation of the founding member of the formin family, Formin1.

Since they also possess an actin nucleation domain, functional regulation of the 6 different mRNA isoforms (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V) of Fmn1 will in part be defined by the cell type in which they are expressed, as well as by the different peptide sequences they encode to determine their respective subcellular localizations.

As an actin nucleator that localizes within the cytoplasm and can associate along microtubules, Fmn1-IV might be involved in lamellipodial regulation. To examine this possibility, we compared the protrusive and retractive behavior from the periphery of wild-type and Fmn1-IV &#x02212;/&#x02212; mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) after wound healing on a fibronectin substrate. MEFs were analyzed by kymography of time-lapse videos using ImageJ. Persistence (&#x00394;x) and distance (&#x00394;y) of protrusion and retraction of active cell lamellipodia were used to derive the protrusion rate (&#x00394;y/&#x00394;x) and retraction rate (&#x02212;&#x00394;y/&#x00394;x). Protrusion rates of Fmn1-IV &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs trended towards more rapid activity, 0.910&#x000b1;0.104 &#x003bc;m/min compared to wild-type MEFs, 0.780&#x000b1;0.0531 &#x003bc;m/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002497-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Rates of retraction similarly trended towards more activity for Fmn1-IV &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs, 1.41&#x000b1;0.143 &#x003bc;m/min compared to wild-type MEFs, 1.293&#x000b1;0.106 &#x003bc;m/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002497-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). These trends could be explained by a significant reduction in the persistence of protrusive activity for Fmn1-IV &#x02212;/&#x02212; versus wild-type MEFs, 0.861&#x000b1;0.098 min and 1.18&#x000b1;0.081 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002497-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Further the extension of protrusions were 0.920&#x000b1;0.0627 &#x003bc;m for wild-type and 0.784&#x000b1;0.0892 &#x003bc;m for Fmn1-IV &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002497-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Since the formins are actin nucleators, the observations that MEFs lacking Fmn1-IV have slightly more active protrusion and retraction rates suggests that Fmn1-IV acts to limit cell ruffling. Noting that Fmn1-IV does not significantly accumulate at the periphery of cells, further suggests that its regulatory activity may contribute to other sites of actin nucleation that indirectly play a role in cell protrusive behavior.</p><fig id="pone-0002497-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002497.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Fmn1-IV &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs exhibit altered protrusive behavior.</title><p>Time-lapse microscopic images were taken from the peripheries of representative wild-type and Fmn1-IV &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs grown on a fibronectin substrate after wound healing.

By co-staining epithelial cells with markers for adherens junction (E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin) as well as actin, we were unable to observe any significant localization of Fmn1-IV to adherens junctions.

Immunofluorescence was then performed with the exon 6 antiserum on wild type and Fmn1-IV null MEFs. This revealed a similar staining pattern for both cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002497-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>, left panels). This staining pattern was consistent with that of phalloidin, an actin stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002497-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>, right panels). We were able to confirm that the cells used in our experiments were truly null for Fmn1-IV expression by performing a western blot on wild type and Fmn1-IV null MEFs with our Fmn1 antibody &#x0005b;32; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002497-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>&#x0005d;.

The anti-serum directed against exon 6 of Fmn1 showed very strong reactivity to actin (43 kDa) with very little specific activity to Fmn1-IV (165 kDa). Although Fmn1-IV does not appear to localize significantly to adherens junctions, it remains possible that it may still have a regulatory role in adherens junction formation. In examining primary kidney epithelial cells, the Fmn1-IV null cells seemed to show a subtle delay in adherens junction formation as compared to wild type cells, but were ultimately able to form adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002497-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). It is possible that Fmn1-IV could contribute to the efficiency of adherens junction formation through an indirect mechanism, such as proper initiation of cell-cell contact.</p><fig id="pone-0002497-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002497.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against exon 6 of Fmn1-IV predominately reacts with actin.</title><p>(A) MEFs derived from Fmn1-IV wild type and null mice were stained for immunofluorescence with anti-Fmn1-IV antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Kobielak1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-ORourke1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and phalloidin, as indicated at the top of the panels.

In previous studies, it was shown that Fmn1-IV has a fairly broad tissue distribution pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-JacksonGrusby1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Chan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, and that it is expressed both in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. In this study we show through the deletion of Fmn1-IV that it contributes to cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. The subcellular localization of Fmn1-IV within the cytoplasm and along microtubules suggests that it might be involved in the transport of factors that play a role in focal adhesion formation.</p><p>Recent evidence has pointed to a coordinative link between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletal networks to direct proper polarization of cells. EB1 and APC have been identified as linking proteins to mDia and actin which stabilize microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Wen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The yeast formin protein, for3, complexes with the plus end microtubule protein, tea1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Feierbach1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest a role for formins in regulating polarization of cells through an actin/microtubule linkage. Here we have shown that Fmn1-IV localizes along microtubules. Unlike Formin1-isoform1 which has been shown to associate with microtubules <italic>in vitro</italic> through its N-terminal exon 2 encoded peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Zhou1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, Fmn1-IV does not possess this coding region and has a distinct localization. We speculate that the association of Fmn1-IV with microtubules might be transient.</p><p>Cell motility involves the interpretation of extracellular signals by cell surface receptors and subsequent downstream signals. One consequence is the well-characterized activation of the Rho family of GTPases which regulate numerous targets, some of which affect actin cytoskeleton organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Raftopoulou1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Microtubule stabilization at the leading edge is thought to proceed the extension of lamellipodia during cell migration, a process in which mDia1 is involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Palazzo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Wen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

FHOD1, another formin family member, acts through Rac and enhances cell migration when overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Koka1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, it has been shown that FRL enhances cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-YayoshiYamamoto1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Although we demonstrated a role for Fmn1-IV in cell motility, it is not clear that the Rho family GTPases directly regulates it. Fmn1-IV does not possess a consensus GTPase binding domain, however, it remains possible that Fmn1-IV might be activated by Rho GTPases indirectly.</p><p>Close examination of Fmn1-IV localization shows it not to be directly at the leading edge of the cell or at the tips of filopodia, but rather within the cytoplasm. This may suggest that Fmn1-IV is not directly contributing to the processivity of the cell periphery, but rather is involved in forming or maintaining filamentous actin of a less prominent nature. The contribution of Fmn1-IV to efficient focal adhesion formation would be predicted to play a role in proper cell spreading. Studies examining macrophages derived from focal adhesion kinase (FAK) null mice, demonstrated elevated protrusion rates coupled with reduced cell spreading and cell adhesion dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002497-Owen1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The FAK&#x02212;/&#x02212; phenotype is similar to that observed in the current study on Fmn1-IV, however, in contrast Fmn1-IV does not appear to be significantly localizing to sites of focal adhesion. This is distinct from mDia1 in that it is believed to act directly on focal adhesion turnover to influence cell motility. Reduced cell spreading and focal adhesion formation in Fmn1-IV &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs further demonstrates the role of Formin family members in cellular processes that involve regulation of actin nucleation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and materials</title><p>MEFs, and primary kidney epithelial cells were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Gibco-BRL), supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin.
