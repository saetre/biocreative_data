BER capacity plays a prominent role in dictating responsiveness to agents that generate oxidative or alkylation DNA damage, as well as certain chain-terminating nucleoside analogs and 5-fluorouracil. We describe within the development of a robust, 1536-well automated screening assay that employs a deoxyoligonucleotide substrate operating in the red-shifted fluorescence spectral region to identify APE1 endonuclease inhibitors. This AP site incision assay was used in a titration-based high-throughput screen of the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC<sup>1280</sup>), a collection of well-characterized, drug-like molecules representing all major target classes. Prioritized hits were authenticated and characterized via two high-throughput screening assays &#x02013; a Thiazole Orange fluorophore-DNA displacement test and an <italic>E. coli</italic> endonuclease IV counterscreen &#x02013; and a conventional, gel-based radiotracer incision assay. The top, validated compounds, i.e. 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA, Reactive Blue 2 and myricetin, were shown to inhibit AP site cleavage activity of whole cell protein extracts from HEK 293T and HeLa cell lines, and to enhance the cytotoxic and genotoxic potency of the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate. The studies herein report on the identification of novel, small molecule APE1-targeted bioactive inhibitor probes, which represent initial chemotypes towards the development of potential pharmaceuticals.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most drugs employed to eradicate neoplastic disease (e.g. alkylators, cross-linking agents, topoisomerase inhibitors and certain antimetabolites) operate by introducing DNA lesions/intermediates that block replication of rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, and activate cell death responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Helleday1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Alkylators, for instance, induce cell killing through the formation of alkylated bases, many of which are either lost spontaneously to form abasic sites or are substrates for DNA glycosylases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Wyatt1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> (see below). A primary goal of current studies is to devise combinatorial methods that (a) protect normal cells from the toxic effects of anti-cancer agents and (b) enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells. As DNA repair systems represent a major protective mechanism against the cytotoxic effects of clinical DNA-interactive compounds, recent efforts have focused on the design of novel small molecule inhibitors of DNA repair proteins, e.g. the DNA strand break response protein poly(ADP)ribose polymerase PARP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Zaremba1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Ashworth1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>BER is the major pathway for dealing with spontaneous hydrolytic, oxidative and alkylative base and sugar damage to DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Wilson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Central to this process is incision at an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, which is generated either spontaneously or via the enzymatic activity of a DNA repair glycosylase. The ensuing strand cleavage step is performed by the main, if not sole, mammalian AP endonuclease, APE1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Demple1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Wilson2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Significantly, APE1 has been found to be essential for not only animal viability, but also for cell viability in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Fung1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Izumi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, past studies incorporating either antisense or RNAi strategies have revealed that APE1-deficient cells exhibit hypersensitivity to a number of &#x0201c;DNA-damaging&#x0201d; agents, including the laboratory chemicals methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and hydrogen peroxide, and the anticancer agents ionizing radiation, thiotepa, carmustine, temozolomide, gemcitabine, and the nucleoside analogue troxacitabine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Fishel1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent work from our group employing a dominant-negative APE1 protein (termed ED), which binds with high affinity to substrate DNA and blocks subsequent repair steps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-McNeill1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, has shown that ED augments the cell killing of 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, implicating BER in the cellular response to such antimetabolites as well (McNeill et al., in press) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Wyatt2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These data underscore the potential of APE1 as a target for inhibition in the effort to improve therapeutic efficacy of clinical DNA-interactive drugs via inactivation of DNA repair responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Helleday1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Two groups have recently reported on the isolation of APE1 inhibitors using a high-throughput screening (HTS) approach. However, in the first instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Madhusudan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, the reported effectiveness of this compound (i.e. CRT0044876 or 7-nitro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid) has not been reproduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Bapat1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In the second case, the small molecules (i.e. arylstibonic acids) when used in culture did not elicit a cellular outcome typical of APE1 inactivation, such as increased sensitivity to the alkylating agent MMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Seiple1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, antimony-containing compounds are generally considered undesirable from a probe development standpoint due to their possible promiscuity akin to the effect of heavy metal ions and their occasional high toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-DeWolff1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, there is a need for improved biochemical, and effective biological, inhibitors of APE1. BER inhibitors or activators would provide novel resources, not only for basic science purposes, but for the potential development of high affinity targeted, therapeutics that may improve the efficacy of treatment paradigms by promoting selective sensitization of diseased cells or increasing the protection of normal cells, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Thiazole Orange (ThO), Tris-HCl, Tween-20, EDTA, NaCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub> and dithiothreitol (DTT) were purchased from Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich.

First, during an exhaustive docking, a pose ensemble is generated by rigidly rotating and translating each conformer within the active site. All surviving poses are scored with a scoring function (Chemgauss3) and the top 100 poses are passed to optimization. Next, a systematic solid body optimization is done by rigidly rotating and translating the poses at half the step size used in the exhaustive docking. Chemgauss3 is used in this step to score the poses during optimization. Lastly, poses are ranked via consensus structure method, in which the poses with the top consensus scores of Shapegauss, PLP, Chemgauss2 and Chemgauss3 are retained, and all other poses are discarded. Optionally after consensus scoring, poses can be refined using the Merck Molecular Mechanics Force Field.

The fold signal changes after a 30 min reaction, as well as the maximum reaction signals and the signal at 50 nM of single-stranded TAMRA-labeled deoxyoligonucleotide, were compared.

We describe herein (i) the development of a panel of complementary and improved miniaturized high-throughput screening and profiling assays, which we believe will have broad appeal to other investigators, and (ii) the identification of novel small molecule APE1 inhibitors, which represent initial chemotypes in the long-term endeavor of creating new targeted pharmaceuticals.</p><p>We outline within a robust APE1 screening assay that integrates TAMRA (a bright, pH-insensitive analogue of rhodamine) as the red-shifted fluorophore and BHQ-2 as the non-emitting dark quencher. While the FAM/DABCYL arrangement remains a convenient and largely appropriate choice in genotyping applications, its use in configuring small molecule screens is more problematic. In particular, in a recently performed profiling study, we found that up to 5&#x00025; of the NIH Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mli.nih.gov/mli/mlsmr/">https://mli.nih.gov/mli/mlsmr/</ext-link>) exhibited strong fluorescence in the blue-shifted UV light region (excitation near 350 nm, emission near 450 nm), and up to 0.2&#x00025; of the diverse small molecule collection interfered with fluorescein-like detection (excitation near 480 nm, emission near 530 nm). Conversely, the incidence of compounds capable of interfering with detection in the red-shifted region (e.g, excitation around 550 nm and emission near 590 nm) diminished to below 0.01&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Simeonov1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the combination of BHQ-2 with TAMRA resulted in a twofold improvement in the signal to noise ratio relative to the comparable FAM/DABCYL pair, and was better quenched in its dark state. We note that the implemented real-time fluorescence monitoring (kinetic read) to derive reaction rates also makes the TAMRA/BHQ-2 assay less susceptible to variations in the screening equipment and permits facile discovery of problematic compounds which may interfere with detection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Michael1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It is anticipated that the reconfigured APE1 assay described here will serve as a useful guide to future investigations aimed at screening other nucleic acid processing enzymes.</p><p>The concentration-response screen of the LOPAC collection yielded a number of previously-unreported APE1 inhibitors. The most potent hit was ATA, which inactivated the enzyme consistently in the low nanomolar range. While very effective, ATA has been noted to exist as a stable radical homopolymer of varying length and to act as a strong inhibitor of a large number of DNA- and RNA-processing enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Gonzalez1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Benchokroun1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-BinaStein1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, ATA did not represent a chemotype of value to study APE1 function. The other top hits (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005740-g003">Figure 3</xref>) comprised a diverse group of compounds and included small molecules with potent inhibitory potential, such as 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA, thiolactomycin and methyl 3,4-dephostatin, several larger-size comparatively weak inhibitors, such as PPNDS tetrasodium and ceftriaxone sodium, and suspected DNA binders, such as mitoxantrone and WB 64. Since a variety of factors, including promiscuous aggregators, non-selective covalent modifiers and compounds that sequester substrate molecules, can produce primary screening hits that are not relevant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Inglese2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, we developed and implemented a panel of secondary assays to run against a subset of initial hits or the entire LOPAC collection.</p><p>As a means of interrogating the primary screening hits, and to gain further insight into their mechanism of action, we employed a fluorescent dye-displacement assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Tse1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, substituting the frequently-used ethidium bromide with the more sensitive and robust reporter ThO. In a screen of the LOPAC collection against a ThO-substrate DNA complex, all annotated fluorescent DNA intercalators within the library, e.g. idarubicin, doxorubicin and distamycin, displayed strong displacement activity. Furthermore, the non-fluorescent APE1 screening hits WB 64 and mitoxantrone exhibited dye-displacement IC<sub>50</sub> values similar to or better than those displayed in the APE1 enzymatic incision assay. This behavior is reminiscent of an indirect, non-competitive DNA binding effect and is consistent with the multiple fused ring systems, which have a tendency for DNA intercalation, featured in both molecules. On the other hand, APE1 inhibitor molecules that lacked obvious DNA-binding features (i.e. fused aromatic ring structures or positively charged groups), such as thiolactomycin and Tyrphostin AG 538, yielded weak or no displacement activity. These findings support the ThO displacement assay as a convenient counterscreen to exclude DNA binders from further consideration, and the complete results with the LOPAC<sup>1280</sup> are available in the corresponding PubChem deposition (AID 1707).</p><p>To further probe the selectivity of the inhibitors identified in the APE1 qHTS, we tested the LOPAC collection against <italic>E. coli</italic> EndoIV. AP endonucleases are sub-classified into two major superfamilies based on homology to either <italic>E. coli</italic> exonuclease III (ExoIII) or <italic>E. coli</italic> EndoIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Mol1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. While members of the two superfamilies exhibit similar biochemical properties, such as AP endonuclease activity, there exists no sequence or structural homology between the different superfamily constituents. Since APE1 is an ExoIII family member, it was anticipated that inhibitors specific for human APE1 would not exert an effect on <italic>E. coli</italic> EndoIV. The screen of the LOPAC<sup>1280</sup> against EndoIV under conditions identical to those used in the APE1 screen resulted in relatively few hits, most of which had low potency. Among the actives shared between the two endonucleases were the non-specific DNA binders mitoxantrone and WB 64, whereas compounds with selectivity to APE1 included thiolactomycin, 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA, methyl 3,4-dephostatin, myricetin and Reactive Blue 2. The fact that the EndoIV screen did not identify either potent (other than Tyrphostin AG 538; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005740-g003">Figure 3</xref>) or EndoIV-selective hits may suggest an active site for this enzyme that is hard to access. Our ongoing studies of inhibitors for <italic>E. coli</italic> EndoIV are outside the scope of the present investigation and will be the subject of a separate report.</p><p>Finally, we tested the top screening hits in a standard radiotracer incision assay. All of the selected inhibitors, except those possessing the highest IC<sub>50</sub> values (i.e. PPNDS tetrasodium, cephapirin sodium and ceftriaxone sodium), yielded dose-dependent inhibition of APE1 in the gel-based assay, validating the present screening approach and indicating that the TAMRA/BHQ-2 assay is relatively insensitive to false-positive compounds acting via fluorescence interference.</p><p>As a step towards determining the biological potential of the top, validated APE1 inhibitors from the profiling assays above, we explored the ability of 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA, Reactive Blue 2, myricetin, Tyrphostin AG 538, thiolactomycin, methyl 3,4-dephostatin and NSC-13755 to inactivate AP site cleavage activity of protein extracts from HEK 293T and HeLa cells. Of these compounds, 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA, Reactive Blue 2 and myricetin had the most pronounced effect, leading to a significant reduction in total AP site cleavage activity, even amidst the pool of non-specific proteins. NSC-13755 also displayed potent inhibitory potential, but had been shown to fail in cell-based experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Seiple1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The known bioactives Reactive Blue 2, 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA and myricetin were subsequently demonstrated to enhance the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of the alkylating agent MMS in cell culture assays, indicating specificity for APE1 and exemplifying their prospect as biological probes for APE1 function.</p><p>While our manuscript was under preparation, a report came out describing the identification of APE1 inhibitors using a virtual screen with a set of three-dimensional pharmacophore models generated based on key interactions of abasic DNA with the enzyme active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Zawahir1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, the inhibitors uncovered shared a few common features, including the requirement of at least one negatively ionizable (NI) group; the most potent inhibitors possessed two such groups separated by a hydrophobic core. Several hits identified in our screen are compatible with these findings. Among them is ATA, which contains dicarboxylates in close proximity similar to the more potent inhibitors reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Zawahir1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as a third carboxylate group that may augment the polar interactions within the APE1 active site; the diphenylmethylene core of ATA may occupy the hydrophobic pocket of the protein, as outlined in the authors' model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Zawahir1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA, and the weaker inhibitors cephapirin and ceftriaxone, contain a single carboxylate, along with a relatively hydrophobic core decorated with various H-bond acceptor or donor combinations.</p><p>However, a consequence of utilizing interactions of abasic DNA with key APE1 active site residues to build the pharmacophore models is the potential to bias the results of the virtual compound database search. In particular, most of the models yielded compounds containing at least one carboxylate or bioisoteres that mimicked the NI group found in the phosphodiester backbone of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Zawahir1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Their success in retrieving APE1 inhibitors led to the conclusion that design of potent, therapeutically relevant inhibitors must contain the features discussed above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Zawahir1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Yet, our screen of a diverse set of pharmacologically known actives unveiled more structurally diverse and potent inhibitors that do not appear to fit the pharmacophore models. An example is thiolactomycin, which did not share any of the &#x0201c;required&#x0201d; features. Furthermore, the strong effect observed with Reactive Blue 2, which contains no carboxylates, but instead possesses three readily ionizable sulfonate moieties, two of which are separated by a hydrophobic stretch, indicates that the requirement for a carboxyl substituent is not absolute. Although carboxylate containing compounds are likely to be prevalent among APE1 inhibitors, our screening results suggest that alternate interactions in the binding site may provide additional opportunities for the design of potent and selective endonuclease inhibitors. An example of this is 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA, for which our modeling studies indicate that significant pi stacking interactions can occur between a ligand and the protein's sugar phosphate binding pocket. Such an interaction mode is different from the pharmacophore model developed by Zawahir et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Zawahir1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating a possibly new guiding principle for the design of small molecule inhibitors of APE1.</p><p>The most effective APE1 inhibitors within, i.e. Reactive Blue 2, 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA and myricetin, were identified from the LOPAC<sup>1280</sup>, a collection of 1280 bioactive compounds representing 56 pharmacological classes. Such results point to APE1 as a novel target for these biomolecules and substantiate this repair endonuclease as a pharmacological target going forward. Reactive Blue 2 and its analogues are known to occupy the nucleotide-binding sites of a variety of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Burton1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, and Reactive Blue 2 has been documented to be a selective antagonist of certain subtypes of P2Y receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Bo1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Brown1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Myricetin is a major flavonol, naturally occurring in a variety of vegetables, fruits and berries, as well as in beverages such as tea and wine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Hakkinen1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005740-Ong1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.
