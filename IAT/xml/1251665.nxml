CspA and some of its homologues play critical role in cold acclimation of cells by acting as RNA chaperones, destabilizing nucleicacid secondary structures. Disruption of nucleic acid melting activity of CspE led to loss of its transcription antitermination activity and consequently its cold acclimation activity. To date, the melting activity of Csp proteins was studied using partially double-stranded model nucleic acids substrates forming stem&#x02013;loop structures. Here, we studied the mechanism of nucleic acid melting by CspE. We show that CspE melts the stem region in two directions, that CspE-induced melting does not require the continuity of the substrate's loop region, and CspE can efficiently melt model substrates with single-stranded overhangs as short as 4 nt. We further show that preferential binding of CspE at the stem&#x02013;loop junction site initiates melting; binding of additional CspE molecules that fully cover the single-stranded region of a melting substrate leads to complete melting of the stem.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the CspA family includes nine homologous proteins, CspA to CspI. Four of these proteins are transiently and significantly induced upon temperature downshift from 37&#x000b0;C to 15&#x000b0;C (hence the name Csp, for Cold Shock Protein). None of the CspA homologues appears to be singularly responsible for cold-shock adaptation, since individual <italic>csp</italic> genes are dispensable at both normal and low growth temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). However, while all single, double or triple deletion mutants of <italic>csp</italic> genes grow at low temperature, a quadruple deletion strain (&#x00394;<italic>cspA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>cspB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>cspG</italic>&#x00394;<italic>cspE</italic>) is cold-sensitive for growth, indicating that a presence of at least one of these CspA family proteins is required to support growth at low temperature. Overproduction of any one of the nine <italic>cspA</italic> family genes, with the exception of <italic>cspD</italic>, complements the cold-sensitivity of the quadruple deletion strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), indicating that the functions of these proteins are redundant.</p><p>Many cellular functions have been attributed to CspE, a well-studied member of the <italic>E.coli</italic> CspA family. For example, the presence of camphor leads to chromosome decondensation. Overproduction of CspE leads to camphor resistance and chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). CspC and CspE were shown to be involved in the regulation of expression of <italic>rpoS</italic>, a gene encoding a global stress response regulator, and <italic>uspA</italic>, a gene encoding a protein that is induced by numerous stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Hanna and Liu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) demonstrated the interaction between CspE and the nascent RNA in transcription elongation complexes, suggesting that this protein is involved in transcription regulation. They also found that purified CspE interfered with Q-mediated transcription antitermination. CspA, CspE and CspC decrease transcription termination at several intrinsic terminators and also affect transcription pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). CspE also impedes poly(A)-mediated 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonucleolytic decay by PNPase and inhibits both the internal cleavage and poly(A) tail removal by RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>Among all these functions, the cold-shock function of Csp proteins is the focus of our study. The mechanism(s) through which the increase in the amount of CspA family proteins contributes to growth at low temperature is not fully known. <italic>In vitro</italic>, all CspA family proteins studied bind RNA or single-stranded DNA with low affinity and low specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and some act as nucleic acid chaperones, i.e. they can melt and/or destabilize nucleic acid secondary structure elements in an energy-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). This melting activity may be important at cold-shock conditions, when the stability of RNA secondary structure elements is increased, which could interfere with translation and transcription. Due to their RNA chaperoning activity, CspE, CspA and several other members of the family act as transcription antitermination factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The physiological relevance of this function of CspE is suggested by an observation that CspE overexpression at normal temperature leads to increased expression of several promoter-distal genes of the <italic>metY</italic>-<italic>rpsO</italic> operon due to transcription antitermination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The products of these genes&#x02013;NusA, IF2, RbfA and PNPase&#x02013;are known to be involved in cold acclimation of cells.</p><p>The three-dimensional structure of CspA from <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) reveals five antiparallel &#x003b2; strands, &#x003b2;1 to &#x003b2;5, forming a &#x003b2;-barrel structure with two &#x003b2;-sheets. Two evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding motifs, RNP1 and RNP2, are located on the &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 strands. In CspE, the RNP1 Tyr10, Phe17 and Phe19 and RNP2 Phe30, His32 and Phe33 form a compact surface-exposed aromatic patch. By systematic mutational analysis of CspE aromatic patch residues we showed that Phe17, Phe30 and His32 are critical for the nucleic acid melting function, since substitution of these residues leaves the RNA-binding activity of CspE unaffected but abolishes the nucleic acid melting activity and, consequently, transcription antitermination and cold acclimation functions of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Analysis of melting intermediates trapped by individual substitutions showed that Phe17 and Phe30 act at the earliest stages of melting, while His32 acts later and is necessary for the propagation of melting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies of CspE-induced melting used a single-stranded DNA substrate model that, when folded, contained a 9 bp stem and a 61 nt loop. The extent of CspE-induced melting of this substrate was dependent on the concentration of CspE in the reaction: while melting initiation was detectable at the site of the stem&#x02013;loop junction at the lowest CspE concentrations used, further propagation of melting required higher concentrations of CspE and complete melting was only achieved in the presence of a large excess of CspE over the DNA substrate. We explained these results by suggesting that melting is initiated by the binding of a single Csp molecule at the Y-shaped stem&#x02013;loop junction site, and that the propagation of melting is due to a strain generated at the Y-junction when enough CspE protomers crowded in the topologically constrained single-stranded loop and &#x02018;push&#x02019; outside, into the stem. According to this view, high concentrations of Csp needed for complete melting are the consequence of a large number of Csp monomers needed to cover the long loop of the melting substrate [note that a single Csp molecule is thought to occupy &#x0223c;6 bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>)]. In this work, we studied this hypothesis using melting substrates of different topologies and lengths. We show that although the &#x02018;strain&#x02019; hypothesis is unlikely to be correct, melting substrates with shorter single-stranded regions are melted at dramatically lower concentrations of CspE and the melting is initiated at the stem&#x02013;loop junction, as originally envisioned.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Purification of the proteins</title><p>The <italic>E.coli</italic> cells harboring plasmids pET11a-<italic>cspE</italic> and pET11a-<italic>cspE</italic>-F30R were grown at 37&#x000b0;C to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5 and the CspE expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc> thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 60 min at 37&#x000b0;C.

Previously, we reported a DNA melting assay for Csp proteins using a synthetic DNA substrate with a 61 nt single-stranded loop region and a 9 bp stem. CspE-mediated melting of this substrate (<italic>invertbeaconseq</italic>) was monitored with KMnO<sub>4</sub>, an agent specific for thymines in single-stranded form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). KMnO<sub>4</sub> modified thymines can be cleaved by piperidine and the cleavage sites can be revealed, after electrophoretic separation, by autoradiography. In the absence of CspE, the thymines in the loop region of the model substrate were accessible to modification, while thymines in the stem were protected, as expected. The addition of increasing concentrations of CspE led to gradual melting that initiated at the stem&#x02013;loop junction site.</p><p>One mechanism which would be compatible with CspE-concentration-dependent extent of melting of the model stem&#x02013;loop substrate envisions, the early and preferential binding of CspE on the Y-junction site between the loop and the stem (which initiates melting), followed by increased occupancy of the loop such that additional Csp molecules begin to &#x02018;push&#x02019; on the Y-junction-bound Csp molecule and induce the propagation of melting. Such an &#x02018;internal strain&#x02019; mechanism would imply that changing the topology of the substrate, by cleaving the loop region and leaving a 5&#x02032; or a 3&#x02032; overhang would interfere with melting. This prediction was tested in the experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>. We created two melting substrates by annealing of a 9 nt and a 70 nt synthetic DNA oligonucleotides. The resultant melting substrates corresponded to the original <italic>invertbeaconseq</italic> stem&#x02013;loop substrate with the loop &#x02018;split&#x02019; at either side of the last base pair of the stem. The two substrates differed from each other since one of them had a 5&#x02032; overhang (substrate 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while the other had a 3&#x02032; overhang (substrate 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next tracked the progress of the split substrates' melting as a function of CspE concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). With substrate 1, the profile of melting was identical to that previously seen with the <italic>invertbeaconseq</italic> substrate. For substrate 2, T<sup>4</sup> became sensitive to modification with KMnO<sub>4</sub> at the lowest concentration of CspE (0.2 &#x000b5;M, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 2; note that since in substrate 2 the 9 nt oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5&#x02032; end, the radioactive fragment arising from KMnO<sub>4</sub> modification at T<sup>5</sup> runs off the gel and thus, no conclusions can be made about the state of the corresponding base pair). At 2 &#x000b5;M CspE, T<sup>4</sup>, T<sup>3</sup> and T<sup>2</sup> became sensitive to KMnO<sub>4</sub> modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 3). The observed pattern of KMnO<sub>4</sub> modification in substrate 2 must have arised due to substrate melting, since a control experiment with 6.5 and 9 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 9 and 10, respectively) of a melting-deficient CspE mutant (CspE-F30R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), revealed that only T<sup>4</sup> became sensitive to modification with KMnO<sub>4</sub>. We do not know the reason for the difference in the observed pattern of CspE concentration dependence for substrates 1 and 2. The results clearly indicate that the topologically constrained loop is not required for Csp-induced melting, making the &#x02018;crowding&#x02019; mechanism of melting unlikely. The results also indicate that Csp-induced melting is bidirectional, i.e. it can proceed in both 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; directions.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation between effective melting concentration of CspE and the length of the single-stranded region of the melting substrate</title><p>We next investigated the dependence of CspE-induced melting on the length of the single-stranded 5&#x02032; overhang. The following was the rationale behind this experiment. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, high concentrations of CspE are required for complete melting of the substrates used. This can be due to intrinsically low affinity or low melting efficiency of CspE. Alternatively, long single-stranded overhangs may effectively titrate CspE from the site of the melting action, which is located at the junction site between the single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. If the latter were true, one would expect that shortening of the single-stranded region would allow complete melting to occur at lower concentrations of CspE. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> presents the results of an experiment where a series of melting substrates with varying lengths of the 5&#x02032; single-stranded overhang was used in CspE-induced melting assay. In addition to substrate 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, substrates with 31 nt, 16 nt, 8 nt, 4 nt and 2 nt 5&#x02032; overhangs were used (the stem sequence remained the same in all of these substrates). The substrates were combined with increasing amounts of CspE and probed with KMnO<sub>4</sub>. For the 31 nt overhang substrate, thymines up to T<sup>4</sup> and T<sup>3</sup> became susceptible to modification at 0.2 and 2 &#x000b5;M CspE, respectively. At 4 &#x000b5;M CspE, all four thymines in the stem became susceptible to modification, and the efficiency of modification was further increased at 6.5 &#x000b5;M CspE. In the experiment with the 16 nt overhang substrate, thymines up to T<sup>4</sup> became sensitive to KMnO<sub>4</sub> in the presence of as low as 0.1 &#x000b5;M CspE. The minimum concentration of CspE required for complete melting was 2 &#x000b5;M; higher concentrations of CspE only led to increased efficiency of T<sup>2</sup> modification. An additional band of unknown origin appeared between T<sup>2</sup> and T<sup>3</sup> at high (6.5 &#x000b5;M) concentration of CspE and was not further investigated. When the overhang's length was reduced to 8 nt, T<sup>2</sup> was efficiently modified in the presence of as little as 0.1 &#x000b5;M CspE and became more prominent in the presence of 0.2 &#x000b5;M CspE. The control lane (no CspE added to the reaction), showed faint background bands for T residues in the stem region for this substrate, however, the effect of CspE addition was prominent as seen from the figure. For the 4 nt overhang substrate, 0.1 &#x000b5;M CspE was sufficient to completely melt the substrate. Thus, shortening of the single-stranded overhang dramatically lowers the amount of CspE required for complete melting of the substrate, as is schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, where the minimal concentrations of CspE needed for complete melting of different substrates is plotted. With the 2 nt overhang substrate, background modification of stem thymines was observed even in the absence of CspE, and only a very slight increase in T<sup>4</sup> and T<sup>5</sup> modification was observed in the presence of high (2 and 4 &#x000b5;M) concentrations of CspE, indicating that no efficient CspE-induced melting occurred.</p><p>Next we tested the effect of titration by single-stranded DNA added <italic>in trans</italic> on CspE-induced melting. The melting substrate with an 8 nt 5&#x02032; overhang was combined with an equimolar amount of a 31 nt oligonucleotide whose sequence corresponded exactly to the single-stranded 5&#x02032; overhang of the 31 nt overhang melting substrate used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, followed by the addition of two concentrations of CspE. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the addition of the 31 nt oligonucleotide had no effect on the extent of the 8 nt overhang substrate melting, which was complete at both the low and high concentrations of CspE used. In contrast, only partial melting of the 31 nt overhang melting substrate was observed at the concentrations of CspE used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, it appears that single-stranded DNA added <italic>in trans</italic> is unable to effectively compete for CspE binding with the partially double-stranded melting substrate. This implies that after the first CspE molecule is bound at the double-stranded and single-stranded DNA junction site, it nucleates the binding of additional CspE molecules to the single-stranded DNA located <italic>in cis</italic>, which ultimately leads to complete melting.</p></sec><sec><title>CspE initiates melting by binding at the junction site between the single-stranded and double-stranded DNA</title><p>The above experiments are consistent with an idea that CspE first binds at the stem&#x02013;loop junction to initiate melting. In order to test this possibility, we carried out hydroxyl radical footprinting of the 61 nt 5&#x02032; arm 9 bp DNA. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The control reaction without CspE (lane 2) shows uniform set of bands arising from hydroxyl radical cleavage of the radioactively labeled DNA with 61 nt 5&#x02032; overhang and 9 bp stem (substrate 1). CspE, at low concentration protects the stem&#x02013;loop junction region from cleavage (lane 3). Vertical lines next to the lanes 3 and 4 show the areas protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage at the lowest and intermediate concentrations of CspE. The protected area in lane 3 is &#x0223c;6 nt in length and thus is likely due to the binding of a single CspE protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Higher concentration of CspE leads to further protection of the single-stranded arm region (lane 4) and at the highest concentration of CspE used, almost the entire DNA is protected (lane 5). At low or intermediate concentrations (0.2 and 4 &#x000b5;M, lanes 3 and 4, respectively), CspE is not expected to completely melt the stem (see lanes 2 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, a band arising due to hydroxyl radical cleavage in the stem and indicated by an arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is not protected at these concentrations of CspE. However, at higher concentration of CspE when the stem is expected to be completely melted (see lane 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and therefore bound by CspE, the band becomes protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage (lane 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore we conclude that CspE preferentially binds at the junction site between the single-stranded and double-stranded DNA; this initial interaction leads to binding of additional CspE protomers that cover the entire single-stranded region followed by complete melting of the stem region.</p></sec><sec><title>CspE cannot completely melt DNA substrates with longer stems</title><p>KMnO<sub>4</sub> probing allows to monitor melting of the stem with respect to thymines only. Thus, melting of substrates used in our study, all of them containing an identical 9 bp stem, could be followed only up to the fourth thymine counting from the end of the stem (5&#x02032;-&#x02026;GGGA-3&#x02032; being the terminal residues). However, our previous studies using a molecular beacon based on the <italic>invertbeaconseq</italic> substrate showed that CspE completely opens the 9 bp stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). To test if CspE can melt DNA substrates with longer stems, we created a version of substrate 1 containing a 16 nt 5&#x02032; overhang and 14 bp stem. The sequence of this substrate, substrate 3, is derived from the <italic>invertbeaconseq</italic>, except that the &#x02018;GGTTT&#x02019; sequence is inserted before the 3&#x02032; end-proximal GGGA residues of the longer oligonucleotide, and the complementary sequence is inserted in the shorter oligonucleotide. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the control reaction without CspE (lane 1) shows a low background of KMnO<sub>4</sub> sensitive thymines in the stem; other bases also appear to be sensitive to the probing reagent for reasons unknown. To make sure that the melting substrate is properly annealed, we also probed radioactively labeled, single-stranded longer oligonucleotide that was used to make substrate 3 (lane 5). As expected, thymines became modified by KMnO<sub>4</sub> with high efficiency and all stem thymines could be accounted for (an AG chemical sequencing ladder was used as a marker, lane 7). For unknown reasons, the G residue marked with a filled circle was also found to be sensitive to KMnO<sub>4</sub>. A thymine residue that lies immediately outside of the stem region is encircled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and was sensitive to KMnO<sub>4</sub> in all reactions including the control reaction without CspE (lane 1), as expected. Importantly, even at the highest CspE concentrations used here, 4 and 6.5 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 3 and 4, respectively), melting of the substrate 3 stem only up to the thymine residue marked with an asterisk was observed. At lower CspE concentration (2 &#x000b5;M), the efficiency of modification of this thymine was lower (lane 2). Increasing CspE concentration up to 9 &#x000b5;M did not lead to further melting (data not shown). The results thus show, that the length of the stem region imposes limitations on the melting activity of CspE. Though the use of KMnO<sub>4</sub> limits our ability to pinpoint the exact boundary of melting, there is no melting beyond a thymine enclosed by a square in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Elucidation of the function(s) of CspA and its homologues has been a subject of much recent effort. In our work, we use <italic>E.coli</italic> CspE as a prototypical member of this group. The distinct functions of CspE depend on its nucleic acid binding and melting activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). For example, mutants of CspE that have lost nucleic acid melting activity cannot antiterminate transcription and thus cannot support cold acclimation of cells. However, the RNA-binding activity of these mutants is intact and these are still capable of regulation of proteins such as RpoS at physiological temperatures, an activity that depends solely on its RNA-binding activity. In this work, we set up to learn more about the molecular mechanism of CspE-induced melting and how it relates to the physiological melting substrates, intrinsic transcription terminators.</p><p>Our previous studies suggested that Csp molecules bind to the single-stranded loop region of a model stem&#x02013;loop DNA melting substrate and initiate the melting of the stem. Both the DNase I protection studies and KMnO<sub>4</sub> probing showed the dependence of melting on CspE concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). As one Csp molecule covers &#x0223c;6 nt, several CspE molecules were needed to cover the 61 nt loop region in the original synthetic DNA substrate used in our studies. This gave rise to a hypothesis that binding of CspE molecules in the loop region creates a &#x02018;strain&#x02019;, which forces the stem to open. In the present study we used a &#x02018;split&#x02019; version of our <italic>invertbeaconseq</italic> that we used earlier to determine if CspE-induced &#x02018;strain&#x02019; is required for melting as no such strain is expected to accumulate in &#x02018;split&#x02019; substrates. The results show that CspE is fully proficient in melting partially duplex substrates with both the 5&#x02032; and the 3&#x02032; overhangs. Thus, binding of CspE molecules does not lead to creation of the strain that was presumed to be a prelude to melting. The concentration of CspE required for complete melting is inversely proportional to the length of the overhang, presumably because fewer CspE molecules are required to cover shorter overhangs. Interestingly, for the overhang whose lengths are between 61 to 8 nt, the melting process is gradual, with only partial opening of the stem at low concentrations of CspE. This suggests that though the first CspE may preferentially bind at the single- to the double-stranded DNA junction, resulting in partial initial opening, the entire single-stranded region needs to be covered by CspE for full opening of the stem. In contrast, melting of the 4 nt overhang substrate is an all-or-none process, indicating that the binding of a single CspE protomer, perhaps in a fixed position relative to the single-stranded and double-stranded DNA junction site is sufficient to induce complete melting. This must be a consequence of the fact that the 4 nt overhang is close to the 6 nt binding site for a single CspE protomer. By the same reasoning, the inability of CspE to melt the 2 nt overhang substrate must be due to the fact that the length of the overhang is too short to allow even a single CspE to bind.</p><p>The results obtained with single-stranded DNA added <italic>in trans</italic> suggest that the first CspE molecule bound serves as an efficient nucleus for the binding of additional CspE protomers to the same melting substrate. The complete melting could be a consequence of a strain generated by &#x02018;pushing&#x02019; between CspE molecules bound to the single-stranded region. However, the strain does not act by increasing the topological stress within the substrate, as studies with split substrates demonstrate. The hydroxyl radical footprinting showed that this hypothesis is correct as the CspE first binds at the junction between the single-stranded and double-stranded DNA and then progressively covers the single-stranded loop region leading to complete melting.</p><p>For experimental simplicity, our work was performed with DNA substrates. Conclusions drawn using DNA substrates correlated well with physiological function of CspE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The physiological substrate of CspE appears to be RNA, specifically, the nascent intrinsic transcription terminator RNA as it emerges from the RNA polymerase. Since most <italic>E.coli</italic> intrinsic transcription terminators are characterized by a &#x0223c;5&#x02013;7 stem and a &#x0223c;4 nt loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), these seem to present preferred melting substrates for CspE and should be melted in an all-or-none manner. The physiological concentration of CspE is around 30 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), which increases upon cold-shock. In fact, upon cold-shock, the cellular concentration of cold-shock-inducible CspA homologues is in the millimolar range. As seen from this study, very low concentration of Csp would be required to melt the intrinsic transcription terminators, and also single-stranded DNA does not compete efficiently <italic>in trans</italic> with the melting substrate, so competition by single-stranded nucleic acids should not interfere with their melting function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Future work on the specificity of CspE (and other Csp proteins) interactions with terminator structures of various sequences should allow to determine if different Csp proteins can target specific terminators <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported in part by the NIH RO1 grant 64530 to K.S.

Melting of stem structure of a DNA substrate with a 14 bp stem (substrate 3) with the addition of CspE was followed with KMnO<sub>4</sub> probing as described in Materials and Methods. This DNA has a 16 nt 5&#x02032; overhang. Lane 1, control reaction without CspE; lane 2&#x02013;4, wild-type CspE: 2, 4 and 6.5 &#x000b5;M, respectively. Lane 5 represents KMnO<sub>4</sub> probing reaction using only the single-stranded (ss) DNA (labeled oligonucleotide) and lane 6 designated by N represents naked DNA without KMnO<sub>4</sub> treatment. AG ladder is shown in lane 7. The thymines up to the residue marked with an asterisk are sensitive to KMnO<sub>4</sub> due to CspE-induced melting. A thymine residue that lies immediately outside the stem region is encircled.
