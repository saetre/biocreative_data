Here, we identify the molecular mechanism underlying this dual function. BMP2- or transgene-induced Oct4 up-regulation drives human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells to become cardiac progenitors. When embryonic stem cell pluripotency is achieved, Oct4 switches from the <italic>Sox2</italic> to the <italic>Sox17</italic> promoter. This switch allows the cells to turn off the pluripotency Oct4-Sox2 loop and to turn on the <italic>Sox17</italic> promoter.

Our data thus reveal a novel molecular Oct4- and Sox17-mediated mechanism that disrupts the stem cell microenvironment favoring pluripotency to provide a novel paracrine endodermal environment in which cell lineage is determined and commits the cells to a cardiogenic fate.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from reprogrammed somatic cells retain the ability to self-renew in culture and the potential to differentiate into any cell lineage. The ESC-specific protein, Oct4, is one of the most ancient transcription factors (TFs) and is expressed very early during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smith, 1991</xref>). In mouse ESCs, together with Sox2 and Nanog, Oct4 cooperatively maintains pluripotency through a tightly regulated transcriptional loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Loh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Niwa, 2007</xref>). However, a new function of this TF has recently emerged in the process of cell lineage determination. In fact, the level of Oct4 in ESCs determines its dual function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>). The mechanism of that process remained unknown. We demonstrated in vitro and in vivo a gene dosage-dependent function of Oct4, driving the ESC or the epiblast toward a mesodermal cardiogenic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zeineddine et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>However, the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the dual function of Oct4, maintaining pluripotency or inducing lineage progression, has remained puzzling. Furthermore, whether this concept applies to human pluripotent cells is also questionable.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We chose the cardiac lineage, determined as early as within the epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tam and Schoenwolf, 1999</xref>), to analyze the dual function of Oct4. First, we tested whether BMP2-induced cardiac commitment and differentiation of HESC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tomescot et al., 2007</xref>) was associated with modulation of Oct4. Expression of both human Oct4 isoforms, Oct4-iA, maintaining cell pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), and Oct4-iB of still unknown function, was monitored by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-Q-PCR). Oct4-iA was up-regulated threefold in response to BMP2. Expression of Oct4-iB remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We then used a HESC line harboring a reporter gene (HUES-9 pOct4/GFP, Oct4<italic>p</italic> driving EGFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, inset) to investigate BMP2-mediated regulation of the Oct4<italic>p</italic>. First, to ensure that <italic>GFP</italic> was under the tight control of the Oct4<italic>p</italic>, the HUES-9 pOct4/GFP cell line was nucleofected with COUP-TFI, a repressor of Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Shushan et al., 1995</xref>). GFP was switched off in cells expressing COUP-TFI, as shown by poor GFP distribution within colonies when compared with a fully green mock colony (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901040/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). Furthermore, overexpression of Oct4-iA in the HUES-9 pOct4/GFP line increased GFP expression as expected from regulation of <italic>Oct4p</italic> by its own protein (Fig. S1 B). Stimulation of this line with BMP2 up-regulated <italic>GFP</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and FACS revealed a 70% increase in the highly positive GFP population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of Oct4-iA induces cardiogenesis.</bold> HUES-24 (A) or HUES-9 pOct4/GFP (B) control or treated for 48 h with BMP2.

Cells were cultured for 4 d with FGF2. <italic>Oct4-iA</italic>-OEC (35 times), twofold more protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, inset), did not change expression of Oct4-iB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Indeed, only the 48-kD (Oct4-iA), but not the 35-kD band (Oct4-iB), was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, inset). SSEA-1 was first used as an early marker of HESC loss of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hoffman and Carpenter, 2005</xref>). Less than 1% of mock cells (EGFP nucleofected) but 68% of Oct4-nucleofected cells expressed SSEA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). This percentage (68%), normalized to the one of cell nucleofection assessed by scoring GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (42%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, inset), suggests that Oct4-iA-OEC as well as neighboring cells had entered a differentiation program. To examine which lineage was induced by Oct4, gene expression was monitored by Q-PCR. Oct4-iA-OEC expressed both mesodermal (<italic>Brachyury, Tbx6</italic>) and cardiac (<italic>Mesp1/2, Tbx20, Tbx5, Mef2C, Nkx2.5, cardiac</italic> &#x003b1;-<italic>actin</italic>) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Endodermal genes <italic>Hex</italic> and <italic>Sox17</italic> were also switched on by Oct4-iA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Furthermore, the corresponding proteins Sox17, Nkx2.5, and Mef2c were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). High content cell (HCC) imaging assay allowed us to monitor more than 2,500 cells and revealed that 48% of cells expressed Sox17, indicating that all nucleofected cells expressed the protein (when normalized to percentage of Oct4-iA nucleofection 42%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Up to 20% (i,e., 48% of nucleofected cells) expressed Mef2c, and 31% (74% of nucleofected cells) Nkx2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Very low expressions of the hematopoietic CD45, of the endothelial CD31, CD34 markers were detected (Fig. S1 C). Thus, PCR, immunofluorescence, and FACS data demonstrate that up-regulation of Oct4iA forces HESC to exit pluripotency to adopt a cardiovascular fate. Furthermore, the cardiogenic action of Oct4-iA was translated into a full cardiac differentiation program. While mock-nucleofected cells gave rise to cardiomyocytes expressing actinin and cardiac troponin T (cTnT), the later proteins were not yet organized in sarcomeric units 4 wk after embryoid body (EB) formation. In contrast, EBs generated from Oct4-iA-OEC featured 3.1 &#x000b1; 0.2 (<italic>n</italic> = 4) as many cTnT<sup>+</sup> and actinin<sup>+</sup> myocytes as in mock EBs, as assessed by measuring the anti-cTnT and anti-actinin fluorescent areas within whole EBs. Furthermore, the cardiomyocytes were assembled in strands and featured organized and adult-size sarcomeres (2 &#x000b5;m) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Next, we hypothesized that, to trigger specification to a cell lineage, increased Oct4 should disrupt the Sox2/Oct4 pluripotency loop. A potential candidate to replace Sox2 as an Oct4 target, namely Sox17, recently reported as essential for early cardiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Liu et al., 2007</xref>), was expressed in Oct4-iA-OEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). We therefore tested the presence of Oct4 on Sox17<italic>p</italic>. ChIP assays designed to pull down Oct4-bound chromatin revealed that BMP2 led to a 10-fold decrease in enrichment of DNA fragments containing the <italic>Sox2</italic> distal enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chew et al., 2005</xref>) and a 300-fold increase in the enrichment of DNA fragments containing a region of the <italic>Sox17p</italic> within the 700-bp upstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). This result obtained in the HUES-24 line was confirmed in two other HESC lines (H9.2 and I4). This was accompanied with induction of <italic>Sox17</italic> in BMP2-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, right inset). Oct4-iA-OEC featured a loss in Oct4-iA binding <italic>Sox2</italic> DNA including the distal enhancer and a gain in binding <italic>Sox17p</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). In line with these data, ChIP from Oct4-iA-OEC using anti-modified-H3 antibodies revealed significant changes in methylation and acetylation of H3 associated with both <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox17</italic> enhancer and promoter, respectively, when compared with mock cells (i.e., GFP nucleofected). Although the ratio of methylations of K4 versus that of K27 of H3, as well as acetylation of H3K9 associated with <italic>Sox2</italic> distal enhancer was decreased, these were increased for the <italic>Sox17p</italic>. This pointed to repression of <italic>Sox2</italic> and activation of <italic>Sox17p</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Furthermore, the Oct4/Sox2 interaction in control was lost upon up-regulation of Oct4-iA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). These transcriptional and epigenetic events led to Sox17 expression in BMP2-stimulated HESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). A similar effect was observed in Oct4-iA-OEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). To gain more insight into the molecular mechanism of the switch of Oct4-iA from the <italic>Sox2p</italic> to the <italic>Sox17p</italic>, we manipulated the level of expression of Sox2 in Oct4-iA-OEC, surmising that a stoichiometric competition occurs between Sox2 and Sox17. A displacement of Oct4/Sox2 complex on <italic>Sox2</italic> distal enhancer would permit Oct4 binding to <italic>Sox17p</italic>, turning on the gene and the protein, which would reinforce <italic>Sox17</italic> expression by forming an Oct4/Sox17 complex on its promoter. When Sox2 was up-regulated in cells nucleofected with the cDNA (Fig. S1 D), the gain in enrichment of Oct4-iA on the <italic>Sox17p</italic> was lost. When Sox2 was down-regulated using a shRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chew et al., 2005</xref>) (Fig. S1, D and E), Oct4-iA binding to the <italic>Sox17p</italic> was dramatically increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>). We next looked for Oct4&#x02013;Sox17 interaction in END-2 cells, an endodermal cell line expressing Sox17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mummery et al., 1991</xref>). Using coimmunoprecipitation after overexpression of Oct4-iA in this cell line, we found that Sox17 binds Oct4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>). Altogether, our findings point to Sox17, a novel target of Oct4 also interacting with it, to compete with Sox2 to switch HESC from a pluripotent toward an endodermal/mesodermal fate. To clarify whether Sox17 accounts for the switch of HESC from pluripotency to mesodermal and cardiac commitment of ESC, we used a shRNA approach. <italic>Sox17</italic> ShRNA was nucleofected in HESC together with Oct4-iA cDNA. <italic>Sox17</italic> mRNA was then reduced in the presence of an increased level of Oct4. The protein was also three times less induced by Oct4 overexpression (Fig. S1 F). The amount of Sox17 upon Oct4-iA up-regulation was thus too limited to significantly trigger cardiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Similarly, BMP2, which induces <italic>Sox17</italic> together with mesodermal and cardiac genes, could no longer induce these genes in the presence of <italic>Sox17</italic> ShRNA (Fig. S1 G). However, Sox17 shRNA did not prevent the loss of <italic>Sox2</italic> DNA elements bound to Oct4-iA when overexpressed. Interestingly, under the same condition (i.e., Sox17 silencing), the <italic>Sox17p</italic> was no longer occupied by Oct4-iA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Thus, collectively, these ChIP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) showed the occupancy of <italic>Sox17p</italic> by Oct4. They further revealed a predominance of K4 over K27 methylations, and an increase in K9 acetylation on H3 in the vicinity of the promoter, thus favoring an active chromatin state. This leads to gene and protein expression. The opposite scenario occurs on the <italic>Sox2</italic> distal enhancer (loss of Oct4 occupancy of the enhancer, increase in K27 methylation, and a decrease in K9 acetylation of H3). Manipulating the levels of Sox2 and Sox17 further pointed to a competition between both Soxs as shown by the capability of Oct4 to form a complex with Sox17. We can further surmise that the Oct4/Sox2 ratio is instrumental in creating various complexes with specific Sox proteins and/or DNA elements. At a normal level of Oct4 or Oct4/Sox2 ratio, it targets the Oct4&#x02013;Sox2 enhancer, maintaining the transcriptional Oct4/Sox2/Nanog loop and thus cell pluripotency. At a higher Oct4 level or at a low level of Sox2, the POU factor targets the <italic>Sox17p</italic> triggering expression of the protein, forming a more stabilized Oct4/Sox17 complex on the <italic>Sox17p</italic>. This mechanism drives the cells toward specific endo/mesodermal fates. Sox17 is known to target genes encoding cardiogenic factors such as Wnts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zorn et al., 1999</xref>). Wnt is also a trigger of BMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kasai et al., 2005</xref>). To test whether Oct4-iA and Sox17 operate in a cell non-autonomous manner, the conditioned medium (CM) from <italic>Oct4-iA</italic>-OEC was collected to test its potential to induce cardiogenesis. CM from Oct4-iA-OEC triggers in wild-type HESC expression of <italic>Brachyury</italic>, <italic>Mesp1/2, Tbx20, Tbx5, Tbx6, Nkx2.5</italic>, and <italic>cardiac &#x003b1;-actin</italic>, as well as <italic>Oct4-iA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). CM from cells overexpressing <italic>GFP</italic> used as a control did not show any gene induction. Furthermore, CM from Oct4-iA-OEC applied to wild-type cells triggered a switch of Oct4-iA binding from the <italic>Sox2</italic> distal enhancer to the <italic>Sox17p</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). We also mixed in the same well HUES-9 pOct4/GFP cells nucleofected with Oct4-iA cDNA with mock cells at different ratios (0:1, 1:1, 3:1, 9:1, respectively). After 4 d of co-culture, mock cell colonies were dissected out and used in real-time PCR. Expression of <italic>Tbx6 Mesp1</italic>, <italic>Isl1</italic>, <italic>Nkx2.5</italic>, <italic>Tbx5</italic> was significantly induced in mock cells when they were mixed with at least three times as many Oct4-iA-OE HUES-9 pOct4/GFP cells as mock cells (3:1 ratio) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901040/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). In another set of experiments, mixed cells were fixed and stained with an anti-Nkx2.5 antibody. These experiments showed that Nkx2.5<sup>+</sup> cells were mainly mock HESC neighboring GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (Fig. S2 B), further confirming that Oct4-iA-OEC exert their cardiogenic function through secretion of cardiogenic factors. We hypothesized that BMP2 or/and Wnt, both direct or indirect targets of Sox17/Hex pathway, as well as Nodal, a Sox17 inducer, might be cardiogenic candidates released by OctiA- and Sox17-OEC. Thus, HESC were nucleofected with <italic>Oct4-iA</italic> cDNA and then cultured for 4 d in the absence or in the presence of 150 ng/ml Dipkopf (DKK), 100 ng/ml Noggin, or 10 ng/ml Lefty to prevent Wnt, BMP2, or Nodal signaling, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref> shows that both DKK and Noggin, but not Lefty, prevented Oct4-iA&#x02013;induced expression of <italic>Brachyury, Mesp, Tbx20</italic>, <italic>Tbx5</italic>, <italic>Tbx6</italic>, <italic>and Nkx2.5</italic>. Challenging HESC with BMP2 (10 ng/ml) together with Wnt3a (50 ng/ml) significantly improved the effect of BMP2 on early cardiac gene expression as well as on BMP2 and Wnt3a expression (Fig. S2 C). In line with these data, Oct4-iA-OEC expressed <italic>BMP2</italic> and <italic>Wnt3a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Thus, BMP2 and Wnt3a are the cardiogenic factors released by Oct4 induced Sox17<sup>+</sup> cells. Four other findings confirmed this claim. First, phosphorylated Smad recognized by an anti-phosphoSmad1,5,8 antibody was barely detectable in mock cells cultured alone, but observed into nuclei of Oct4-iA-OEC in wells including 50% (i.e., nucleofection efficiency) of <italic>Oct4-iA</italic>-OEC and 50% of non-nucleofected cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901040/DC1">Fig. S3 B</ext-link>). Second, anti-Smad4 ChIP experiments revealed a binding of Smad to both the Nkx2.5 and Tbx6 promoters, two targets of BMP2 (Fig. S3 A) in Oct4-iA-OEC. Third, Wnt3a signaling pathway was activated in Oct4-iA-OEC, as visualized by nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-catenin in contrast to the membrane staining observed in mock cells (Fig. S3 B). Finally, both anti-BMP2 and anti-Wnt3a antibodies added for 2 d in the medium of Oct4-iA-OEC prevented expression of genes marking the mesoderm (<italic>Tbx6</italic>), the cardiogenic mesoderm (<italic>Mesp1</italic>), and cardiac progenitors (<italic>Tbx5</italic>) (unpublished data). To further investigate whether cells expressing Sox17 exerted their cardiogenic action through an autocrine and/or paracrine mechanism, HUES-9-pOct4/GFP cells were plated in microwells and stimulated for 4 d with BMP2. Cells expressing GFP were stained for Sox17 and Mesp1/2, the earliest cardiac marker. Cells not challenged with BMP2 did not express Sox17 or Mesp1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>, top). Cells challenged with BMP2 expressed both Sox17 and Mesp1/2. Careful observation of cells revealed that a few BMP2-stimulated cells expressed both Sox17 and Mesp1/2, whereas most of them expressed only Sox17 or Mesp1/2. This differential expression of Sox17 and Mesp1/2 was observed in the same or neighboring cell colonies. To further quantify the phenomenon, we set up a high-content imaging assay. 32 wells and 50 fields per well were scanned for expression of GFP, Sox17, and Mesp1/2. Cells expressing GFP, Sox17, Mesp1/2 alone or expressing two or three markers were separately scored. The Venn diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>) first revealed that &#x0223c;50% of cells responded to BMP2, as 44% did not express Sox17 and/or Mesp1/2. Half of responder cells (33% of total) expressed Sox17 and the other half (26% of total cells) expressed Mesp1/2. The diagram clearly shows that most of the cells expressed only Sox17, with many still highly GFP<sup>+</sup> or only Mesp2 having lost GFP. A minority of the cells expressed Sox17 and Mesp1/2; almost no cell expressed the three markers. Although 40&#x02013;50% cells were nucleofected and overexpressed Oct4-iA, 40&#x02013;60% also expressed several markers including Mef2c and Nkx2.5, which together confer to the cells a cardiac fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>), further pointing to a robust paracrine effect of the latter. These findings suggest that the dual function of Oct4 is mediated by a paracrine phenomenon mediated by both BMP2 and Wnt3a. This claim is supported by three series of experiments: first, inhibitors or blocking antibodies, suggesting the presence in the medium of Sox17 expressing cells of both Wnt, known to be a target of Sox17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zorn et al., 1999</xref>) and BMP2, which cooperates with Wnt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crease et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kasai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sumi et al., 2008</xref>); second, the BMP2 and Wnt signaling pathways were both activated in wells containing Oct4-iA&#x02013;overexpressing cells, as revealed by intranuclear localization of both p-Smad1,5,8 and &#x003b2;-catenin in these cells together with the binding of Smad4 to the <italic>Nkx2.5p</italic> and <italic>Tbx6p</italic>; and third, expression of <italic>BMP2</italic> and <italic>Wnt3a</italic> mRNAs by Oct4-OEC. Indeed, both Wnt and BMP2 are well-known cardiogenic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">M&#x000e9;nard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). Wnt exerts a cardiogenic action early on during embryogenesis to establish the primitive streak/mesendoderm and then BMP2 together with Wnt drive the cells toward the posterior primitive streak and mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sumi et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, Wnt in the absence of Activin does not promote the hematopoietic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nostro et al., 2008</xref>) as well as Sox17 prevents the development of ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">S&#x000e9;guin et al., 2008</xref>). Then, BMP2 takes over the cardiogenic task, Wnt becoming a cardiogenic inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Naito et al., 2006</xref>). The cardiogenic factors released by Oct4-induced Sox17<sup>+</sup> cells may exert their action in an autocrine, and/or in a paracrine manner on neighboring Sox17-negative cells driving them from an undifferentiated to a mesodermal cardiogenic fate. Using HCC imaging to monitor expression of Sox17 and Mesp2 in BMP2-induced Oct4-iA-OEC revealed that one third of Oct4-iA-OEC expressed Sox17 as expected from a direct targeting of Sox17 by the POU factor, whereas many cells expressing Mesp2 did not express any longer Oct4 or Sox17. This observation argues more for a paracrine effect, although we cannot exclude a kinetic effect, cells going through a endo/mesendodermal stage (Sox17<sup>+</sup>) and then to the cardiogenic mesoderm (Mesp1/2<sup>+</sup>) turning off Sox17 in line with the inhibitory effect of Mesp1/2 on Sox17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bondue et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Oct4 interaction with Sox17 promoter and protein at the expense of Sox2.</bold> Ctrl HESC or treated for 48 h with BMP2, and used for anti-Oct4 ChIP. <italic>Sox2</italic> distal enhancer (A, pSox2) or <italic>Sox1</italic>7<italic>p</italic> (B, p<italic>Sox17</italic>) were amplified in RT-Q-PCR (insets = products on gel).

We wondered whether manipulating the Oct4-iA level in such cells could also drive them through the Sox2/Sox17 switch toward a cardiogenic fate. Thus, iPSCs were nucleofected with <italic>Oct4-iA</italic> cDNA and both gene expression and <italic>Sox17p</italic> occupancy were monitored by Q-PCR. Fig. S3 C shows that 5 d after nucleofection, iPSC expressing 10 times more <italic>Oct4-iA</italic> mRNA than GFP nucleofected cells changed of morphology, displaying more flat and irregular colonies in comparison with compact colonies in mock cells expressing GFP.

Oct4-iA switched from the <italic>Sox2</italic> to the <italic>Sox17p</italic> (Fig. S3 E).

This circuit is functional within an ESC colony or &#x0201c;niche&#x0201d;, BMP2 acting first in cells surrounding the colony, likely generating a gradient from the outer to the inner part of colonies rather secreting factors such as GDF3 maintaining a basal level of Oct4 and cell pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Peerani et al., 2007</xref>). Then, mesendo/endodermal Sox17<sup>+</sup> cells amplify the differentiation process by secreting cardiogenic factors (i.e., Wnt3a, BMP2), further acting on the colonies to direct the cells toward a cardiogenic fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). This molecular and cellular circuitry is likely to occur during the process of somatic cell reprogramming using Oct4 as the main reprogramming inducer, pointing to the importance of an accurate Oct4/Sox2 dosage in these experiments. Oct4 dosage within the nucleus is thus crucial to build specific bridges between different (i.e., Sox2 or Sox17) chromatin domains, resulting in generation of &#x0201c;transcription factories&#x0201d; working either to maintain ES cell pluripotency or to drive them toward a cardiogenic fate.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>The Sox17/Oct4 circuit is functional within a stem cell colony or &#x0201c;niche&#x0201d;.</bold> Oct4 and Sox17 work in combination to drive HuPSC toward a mesendodermal fate, and through secretion of BMP2 and wnt3a toward the fate of cardiac progenitors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200901040R_RGB_Fig5"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Culture and cardiac commitment of human pluripotent stem cells</title><p>Two HESC lines and one HiPSC line 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maherali et al., 2008</xref>), using human dermal fibroblasts infected by lentivirus harboring the cDNAs encoding Oct4, Sox2, Lin 28, Klf4, and Nanog, were used throughout this study without any difference in results.
