Interaction with a complex formed by uPA and its inhibitor PAI-1 induces cell surface down regulation and recycling of the receptor via the clathrin-coated pathway, a process dependent on the association to LRP-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In this study, we have found that along with the ligand-induced down-regulation, uPAR also internalizes and recycles constitutively through a second pathway that is independent of LRP-1 and clathrin but shares some properties with macropinocytosis. The ligand-independent route is amiloride-sensitive, does not require uPAR partitioning into lipid rafts, is independent of the activity of small GTPases RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, and does not require PI3K activity. Constitutively endocytosed uPAR is found in EEA1 positive early/recycling endosomes but does not reach lysosomes in the absence of ligands. Electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of uPAR in ruffling domains at the cell surface, in macropinosome-like vesicles and in endosomal compartments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These results indicate that, in addition to the ligand-induced endocytosis of uPAR, efficient surface expression and membrane trafficking might also be driven by an uncommon macropinocytic mechanism coupled with rapid recycling to the cell surface.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>By localizing the proteolytic activity at the plasma membrane and modulating cell adhesion, migration and proliferation, the urokinase receptor (uPAR/CD87) plays an important role in processes such as wound healing, stem cell mobilization, inflammation, HIV-1 replication, tumour progression and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Blasi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. uPAR is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein that binds the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) at the cell surface thus promoting the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin. Plasmin generation triggers the activation of proteolytic cascades that lead to the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Lacking transmembrane and cytosolic domains, uPAR is unable to transduce signals. It is therefore generally believed that uPAR associates and activates transmembrane receptors on the cell surface. uPAR has been reported to associate to various proteins like integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGFR) and a G-protein coupled receptor (e.g. FPRL1), thus affecting cell adhesion, migration and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Blasi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the direct interaction of uPAR with vitronectin, a protein present in the ECM, has been reported to suffice for the induction of at least part of the uPAR-induced cell signalling, resulting in dramatic changes in cell morphology and increased cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Madsen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. As a GPI-anchored protein, uPAR should be found in lipid microdomains and/or clustered within caveolae, a specialized form of lipid rafts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Parton1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. However, careful biochemical measurements have shown that only a fraction of uPAR segregates with detergent resistant membranes (DRM), the rest partitioning with the detergent soluble (DS) membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Cunningham1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Sahores1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Lipid rafts partitioning of uPAR is associated with uPAR dimerization and binding to vitronectin, while plasminogen activation by uPAR-bound uPA is independent of its lipid environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Cunningham1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, binding of uPA not only promotes plasminogen activation but also regulates the partitioning of uPAR into lipid rafts independently of its catalytic activity, and such localization is important for uPAR-dependent signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Sahores1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Caiolfa1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Although an appropriate lipid environment seems to be important for some signalling function of uPAR, their role during uPAR endocytosis remains unknown.</p><p>Although tethered to the plasma membrane by a GPI anchor, uPAR is efficiently removed from the cell surface via clathrin coated pits and then recycled back, a property dependent upon lateral association with LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) or other members of the LDL receptor family. In the proposed model, the specific uPA inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) binds covalently to uPAR-bound uPA thus inhibiting its enzymatic activity. The ternary uPAR:uPA:PAI-1 complex rapidly associates to LRP-1 and is sequestered in clathrin-coated pits. The ligands are then targeted to the lysosomes for degradation, while the receptors recycle back to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Nykjaer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Czekay1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The partitioning of uPAR within specific domains of the plasma membrane that undergo clathrin-independent endocytosis and macropinocytosis (lipid rafts and ruffles/lamellipodia) suggests that other endocytic mechanisms may regulate uPAR trafficking as well. In mammalian cells, even if clathrin-dependent internalization is the best-characterized pathway of endocytosis, several other clathrin-independent pathways coexist in the same cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Mayor1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Cargo and machinery proteins regulating these alternative pathways are still poorly characterized; however, it is largely accepted that most of them require cholesterol and that the primary transport carriers eventually merge at the level of the early endosome overlapping with other pathways.</p><p>We have undertaken a study of uPAR endocytosis utilizing two cell lines. HEK293-uPAR, an uPAR overexpressing highly-motile cell line, does not produce uPA or PAI-1 and hence cannot carry out uPA:PAI-1-triggered, clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The other motile cell line (HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma expressing high levels of uPAR) on the other hand also expresses high levels of uPAR, uPA and PAI-1 and therefore undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis of uPAR. Importantly, both cell lines express LRP-1.</p><p>In this report, we have established the existence of a second constitutive endocytic route for uPAR internalization. In fact, in addition to the uPA:PAI-1- and LRP-1-mediated route, both cell lines possess an uncommon uPA:PAI-1-independent, lipid rafts-independent but amiloride-sensitive, macropinocytic-like process that is associated with rapid recycling of uPAR to the cell surface. This endocytic mechanism might support the sustained expression of uPAR at its functional sites as well as ensuring the preservation of a constant membrane area.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>uPAR is found in early and late/lysosomal compartments in the presence of endogenous ligands</title><p>Formation of the quaternary uPAR:uPA:PAI-1:LRP-1 complex on the cell surface is known to induce clathrin-mediated internalization of the whole uPAR complex, resulting in degradation of the ligands (uPA and PAI-1) and recycling of the receptors (uPAR and LRP-1) &#x0005b;7-8-9&#x0005d;.

We therefore analysed the subcellular distribution of uPAR by confocal laser microscopy.

These results suggest that in HEK293-uPAR cells the urokinase receptor may be endocytosed also in the absence of uPA and PAI-1, indicating the presence of a constitutive uPAR endocytic pathway. The presence of uPAR in EEA-1-positive membranes in both HEK293-uPAR and HT1080 cells suggests that the two pathways might overlap at the level of the early endosomal system, even though probably distinct mechanisms probably regulates the initial entry.

First, we demonstrated the existence of the constitutive uPAR internalization pathway. HT1080 and HEK293-uPAR cells were acid washed (in order to remove any pre-bound ligands), and then incubated at 4&#x000b0;C with a cross-linking biotin derivative (that does not cross the plasma membrane and can be removed from the cell surface by reduction with reduced glutathione, GSH). The cells were then incubated at 4&#x000b0;C with or without uPA:PAI-1 complexes, and then shifted to 37&#x000b0;C to allow internalization. At this point cells were treated with reduced glutathione to remove the cell surface-associated biotin and lysed. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-uPAR antibodies, blotted and membranes treated with HRP-streptavidin. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g003">Fig. 3A</xref></bold> shows as expected the presence of biotinylated (i.e. endocytosed) uPAR in HT1080 cells both in the absence and presence of exogenous uPA:PAI-1; however, the presence of uPA:PAI-1 increases the level of biotinylated intracellular uPAR. When the same experiment was performed in HEK293-uPAR cells in the absence of exogenous uPA:PAI-1, a fraction of uPAR was also internalized at 37&#x000b0;C, confirming the existence of a constitutive, uPA:PAI-1-independent pathway (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g003">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>).

Panel A shows a biotinylation assay performed in HT1080 cells. Cells were acid-washed in order to remove pre-bound ligands, surface biotinylated and then internalization was allowed for 15 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Western Blots analysis of cell extracts revealed that uPAR is being internalized in the absence of uPA:PAI-1 in HT1080 (lane 1: background, lane 2: internalized uPAR in the absence of uPA:PAI-1, lane 3: internalized uPAR in the presence of uPA:PAI-1, lane 4: total biotinylated uPAR). Panel B shows the same experiment in HEK293-uPAR cells (Lane 1: background, Lane 2: internalized uPAR in the absence of uPA:PAI-1, Lane 3: total biotinylated uPAR). Panel C shows the biotinylation assay performed in HEK293-uPAR cells, where internalization was allowed for different times, as indicated (total: total biotinylated uPAR). Panel D shows uPAR endocytosis measured by cell cytometry assay in HEK293-uPAR cells. HEK293-uPAR cells were first incubated with anti uPAR polyclonal antibodies bound to Neutravidin-PE for 30 min at 0&#x000b0;C, and then the temperature was raised for 15 min to 37&#x000b0;C. Samples were also incubated at 0&#x000b0;C to account for unspecific binding. After this period, the remaining antibodies at the cell surface were removed by acid washing at 0&#x000b0;C. By cell cytometry we obtained fluorescent intensity values that allow us to calculate the amount of internalized receptor as &#x00025; of total cell surface uPAR (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref>). White bar: amount of receptor internalized at 4&#x000b0;C. Grey bar: amount of receptor internalized at 37&#x000b0;C. Black bar: actual amount of receptor internalized at 37&#x000b0;C after 15 min, corresponding to 17.5&#x00025; of cell surface uPAR.

Lane 5 and 7: internalized uPAR (second step) for 10 and 20 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, respectively, with GSH treatment.

After this internalization-period, the antibodies remaining at the cell surface were removed by acid washing at 0&#x000b0;C. Flow-cytometry analysis showed that a fraction of cell surface uPAR (17.5&#x00025;) was internalized during the 37&#x000b0;C incubation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g003">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>), in agreement with the biochemical data.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether constitutively endocytosed uPAR could recycle back to the cell surface. For this purpose, biotinylated HEK293-uPAR cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes, treated with GSH to remove cell-surface biotin, reincubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 10 or 20 minutes, and the amount of cell-surface (recycled) uPAR evaluated after a second GSH treatment by immunoprecipitation with anti-uPAR antibodies and immunoblotting with HRP. The data (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g003">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>) show that the initial GSH treatment removes biotin from the extracellular uPAR (lane 1) and that incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes leads to a substantial GSH-resistance of biotinylated uPAR (i.e. uPAR is internalized) (lane 3). After this step, a second GSH-treatment performed after a econd 37&#x000b0;C incubation, allowed to determine the amount of GSH-sensitive uPAR (i.e. on the cell surface). This increased with the time (lanes 5 and 7), showing that previously endocytosed uPAR was recycled back to the cell surface. The immunoblotting of <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g003">Fig. 3E</xref></bold> also show that a substantial amount of uPAR is lost (degraded/shedded) during this second incubation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g003">Figure 3F</xref> quantifies both recycling and degradation/shedding.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The constitutive pathway is clathrin and LRP-1 independent</title><p>We next addressed the mechanism regulating the initial entry of uPAR in the absence of uPA:PAI-1 complexes and tested the involvement of the clathrin-dependent pathway.

No inhibition was observed in the level of internalization, compared to controls (lane 1 versus lane 2), indicating that constitutive endocytosis of uPAR is LRP-1-independent. On the contrary, in the presence of uPA:PAI-1, uPAR is internalized at a higher rate, which is inhibited by RAP (compare lanes 3 and 4). Immunofluorescence analysis of HEK293-uPAR cells pre-incubated with a fluorescent monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody on ice and then washed and transferred to 37&#x000b0;C for 10 min also demonstrated internalization of the fluorescent anti-uPAR antibody even in the presence of RAP (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g004">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>).

This unusual pathway was associated with rapid recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and did not require ligand binding and LRP-1 association nor the activity of regulatory proteins such as members of the Rho GTPases and PI3K, usually involved in macropinocytosis and in promoting cell motility. Biochemical and immunofluorescence studies provided clear evidence that constitutive uPAR endocytosis did not require LRP-1 association since it is insensitive to RAP and does not employ commonly used endocytic routes that are dependent on clathrin, as demonstrated by the use of hypertonic medium and the eps15 dominant negative mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

This process requires extensive plasma membrane reorganization, actin remodelling as well as the coordinated activity of several regulatory proteins. Macropinocytosis is constitutive in some cell types (e.g. dendritic cells and macrophages) but it is also prominent in cells stimulated with growth factors (such as EGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Cao1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Orth1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Another study reported a direct role for GPI-anchored proteins-enriched macropinosomes in Brucella infection of macrophages. Removal of GPI-anchored proteins from macrophages dramatically inhibited macropinocytosis and infection, suggesting a direct role of GPI-anchored proteins in modulating macropinosome function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Watarai1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The only known mechanism that we could partially tie with the constitutive uPAR endocytosis is macropinocytosis. Our best evidence that uPAR is constitutively endocytosed via macropinocytosis comes from the ultrastructural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Endocytosed uPAR was found in large structures originated from the plasma membrane with the morphology and size of macropinosomes. Additional evidence in this direction is that uPAR endocytosis is sensitive to amiloride, an extremely potent inhibitor of macropinocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-West1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have also demonstrated that uPAR is eventually sorted to EEA1-positive endosomes. Upon endocytosis, early uPAR-enriched macropinosomes might acquire regulatory proteins such as EEA1 and fuse with pre-existing early/sorting endosomes. Interestingly, both the constitutive and ligand-dependent pathways provide trafficking via EEA1-positive early endosomal compartments and efficient recycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Conese1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, but the latter mechanism requires clathrin and LRP-1. Since the uPA:PAI-1-mediated route regulates important extracellular uPAR functions, we speculate that also the constitutive pathway supports similar functions under different conditions, i.e. in the absence of ligands/inhibitors.</p><p>The interaction of uPAR with vitronectin induces strong cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Madsen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. uPAR binds the matrix protein vitronectin as a dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Cunningham1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> in the basal membrane of the cell.

Possibly the constitutive internalization regulates the constitutive adhesion/release of uPAR/Vn adhesion which is an important step during cell migration. Obviously, this mechanism might operate in both ligand-dependent and independent conditions, i.e. in parallel with a Clathrin/LRP-1-mediated or in a macropinocytosis-type turnover of uPAR/vitronectin adhesion.</p><p>Therefore, EM morphology and amiloride sensitivity suggest that constitutive uPAR endocytosis would follow a macropinocytic route. However, classical macropinocytosis has been shown to be lipid rafts dependent and to require Rac-1 activity and upstream effectors such as PI3K, Ras and PLC. From our investigations, neither Rac-1 nor PI3K appear to be required for uPAR internalization. In fact, even though lamellipodia formation in uPAR overexpressing cells is documented to require Rac-1 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Kjller1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that the constitutive internalization of uPAR was Rac-1 independent. Macropinocytic mechanisms that do not require Rac-1 and actin dependent membrane ruffling have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-West1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Hasegawa1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that ruffling and macropinocytosis are not entirely dependent on Rac1 activity. In addition, since all these factors are also considerably involved in promoting cell motility, it is possible that the uPAR constitutive pathway is not related to cell motility. Potentially, the insensitivity to Rac-1 inhibition might also be explained as the result of a association between uPAR and the EGF receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Jo1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, uPAR association with the EGF receptor activates ERK signalling pathway independently of Rac-1.</p><p>The link between growth factors stimulation and macropinocytosis is well documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Cao1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Lanzetti1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Growth factors stimulation has been recently associated to a second type of ruffles termed circular dorsal ruffles (CDR or dorsal waves). Whereas lamellipodia are associated with cell motility, growth factor-induced circular ruffles are involved in macropinocytosis and in three-dimensional migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Lanzetti1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Orth1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether uPAR expression induces dorsal ruffles is currently unknown and would be of significant interest to further elucidate the basis of the macropinocytic mechanism.</p><p>PI3K inhibitors such as the fungal metabolite Wortmannin dramatically affect fluid phase uptake and early endosome homotypic fusion. In macrophages, wortmannin also inhibits macropinocytosis reducing the closure of ruffles rather than the formation of protrusions. Our results, however, indicate that PI3K activity was not required for the constitutive sorting of uPAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p>Many receptors, like those necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis, are recycled back to the cell surface, whereas receptors whose signals need to be attenuated are delivered to the lysosomal compartment. We have monitored the endocytic compartments in which uPAR travels after endocytosis. Immunofluorescence studies using early endocytic and lysosomal markers revealed that uPAR is distributed among the overall endocytic pathway in cells (HT1080) producing the natural ligands of uPAR, however in HEK293-uPAR cells uPAR failed to reach lysosomes in the absence of these ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g001">Fig. 1A, Panel B</xref>). The association of uPAR, in the absence of ligands, with early endosomal compartments, supports its rapid recycling, possibly to ensure efficient membrane retrieval and its constant exposure at the leading-edge. We have demonstrated biochemically and through flow cytometry that once uPAR is sorted into macropinosome vesicles it is rapidly recycled back to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003730-g003"><bold>Figure 3, E&#x02013;F</bold></xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have described a novel mechanism supporting constitutive endocytosis and recycling of uPAR that shares ultrastructural properties and amiloride sensitivity with macropinocytosis, while is clearly distinct from the clathrin-mediated uPA:PAI-1 endocytic pathway. In this respect, uPAR might represent a model for the constitutive internalization of GPI-anchored receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>HT1080 cells and HEK293 cells stably transfected with human uPAR were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 U/ml), glutamine and 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C in 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.

Then cells were incubated at 0&#x000b0;C with Neutravidin-Phycoerythrin (to label biotinylated antibodies). As control for autofluorescence, cells were only incubated with Neutravidin-Phycoerythrin. One set of samples was kept at 0&#x000b0;C while another set was transferred for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C to allow internalization. Half of the samples kept at either 0 or 37&#x000b0;C were acid washed at 0&#x000b0;C to remove the surface-bound antibodies (AW). In this way, only the uPAR-bound internalized antibodies remain labeled. The other half of the samples were kept at 0&#x000b0;C, corresponding to total amount of labeled receptor at the cell surface. Then cells were analyzed by cell cytometry using a FACSCalibur cytometer (Beckton and Dickinson). Median fluorescence (MF) values were obtained that correspond to the amount of labeled receptor present in each set of samples. The amount of internalized receptor was calculated by subtracting the internalized fraction (IF) at 4&#x000b0;C from the internalized fraction at 37&#x000b0;C. The IF at 4 and 37&#x000b0;C were calculated according to:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0003730.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>Other molecules tested with this assay were LRP-1, CD59, Transferrin, 70kDa-Dextran, and uPA:PAI-1 complexes. When amiloride was used, cells were pre-incubated with amiloride for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by receptor labeling at 0&#x000b0;C, and internalization at 37&#x000b0;C in the presence of amiloride. For experiments with RhoA, Rac1 and cdc42 GDP-bound mutants, HEK293-uPAR cells were cultured on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche) for 24 hours with 1 &#x000b5;g of the indicated DNA construct, and analyzed as described above but gating only GFP positive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Electron microscopy</title><sec id="s4k1"><title>Uptake of 5 nm gold BSA</title><p>After washing cells with serum-free DMEM, HT1080 cells were incubated for 2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C with BSA gold (<italic>OD</italic><sub>520 nm</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5) and processed as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4k2"><title>Cryosectioning and immunolabeling</title><p>According to the conventional protocol of Tokuyasu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Tokuyasu1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> adapted by Geuze and Slot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003730-Slot1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, HT1080 cells were fixed with 2&#x00025; paraformaldeyde and 0.2&#x00025; glutaraldeyde in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature, embedded in 12&#x00025; gelatin and cooled at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes.

Subsequently, cells were washed twice with ice cold HBSS medium and incubated with the primary antibody (monoclonal R3 antibody, anti-human uPAR) alone or with 200 nM RAP for 1 hour at 0&#x000b0;C. Cells were washed with pre-chilled HBSS medium to remove the excess of the antibody and incubated with a rabbit anti-mouse (Jackson, dilution 1&#x02236;100) for 30 minutes at 0&#x000b0;C. After extensive washing, cells were incubated with Protein A gold 10 nm (Utrecht, The Netherlands, dilution 1&#x02236;80) for 30 minutes at 0&#x000b0;C. Cells were re-washed and incubated with pre-warmed HBSS for different time (0 minutes, 5 minutes and 20 minutes) at 37&#x000b0;C in order to allow internalization. The RAP inhibitor was also used during endocytosis. The cells were then processed for conventional electron microscopy. Briefly, after fixation in 2,5&#x00025; glutaraldeyde in 0.1 M Sodium Cacodylate buffer for 10 minutes at room temperature, cells were gently scraped from petri dishes and washed 5 minutes with 0.1 M Sodium Cacodylate buffer.

Then, staining for 1 hour at room temperature with 1&#x00025; Uranyl Acetate was performed. Subsequently, the pellets were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and embedded in LX112 resin overnight at 42&#x000b0;C and 2 days at 60&#x000b0;C. Ultrathin plastic sections of 50 nm were stained with Uranyl Acetate and Lead Citrate and viewed using either a Philips CM10 or a Tecnai G2 (FEI Company) electron microscope.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Simona Polo and Daniela Talarico for their generous gift of reagents.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0003730-Blasi1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blasi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Carmeliet</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><year>2002</year><article-title>uPAR: a versatile signalling orchestrator.</article-title><source>Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol</source><volume>3</volume><fpage>932</fpage><lpage>943</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12461559</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0003730-Madsen1"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Madsen</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferraris</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Andolfo</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Cunningham</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Sidenius</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><year>2007</year><article-title>uPAR-induced cell adhesion and migration: vitronectin provides the key.</article-title><source>J Cell Biol</source><volume>177(5)</volume><fpage>927</fpage><lpage>39</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17548516</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0003730-Parton1"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Parton</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><name><surname>Simons</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><year>2007</year><article-title>The multiple faces of caveolae.</article-title><source>Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol</source><volume>3</volume><fpage>185</fpage><lpage>194</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17318224</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0003730-Cunningham1"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cunningham</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Andolfo</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Santovito</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Iuzzolino</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Blasi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2003</year><article-title>Dimerization controls the lipid raft partitioning of uPAR/CD87 and regulates its biological functions.</article-title><source>EMBO J</source><volume>22</volume><fpage>5994</fpage><lpage>6003</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14609946</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0003730-Sahores1"><label>5</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sahores</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Prinetti</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Chiabrando</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Blasi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Sonnino</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year>2008</year><article-title>uPA binding increases UPAR localization to lipid rafts and modifies the receptor microdomain composition.</article-title><source>Biochim Biophys Acta</source><volume>1778</volume><fpage>250</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17963689</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0003730-Caiolfa1"><label>6</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Caiolfa</surname><given-names>VR</given-names></name><name><surname>Zamai</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Marengo</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Andolfo</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Madsen</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2007</year><source>J Cell Biol</source><volume>179</volume><fpage>1067</fpage><lpage>82</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18056417</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0003730-Nykjaer1"><label>7</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nykjaer</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>M&#x000f8;ller</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>PH</given-names></name><name><surname>Moestrup</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>1992</year><article-title>Purified alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/LDL receptor-related protein binds urokinase plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 complex.
