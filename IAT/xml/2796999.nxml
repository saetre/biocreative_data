At early times after peptide treatment endogenous occludin and the LYHY peptide were co-localized in extrajunctional patches, which were also shown to contain components of the death inducing signaling complex (DISC), caspases 8 and 3, the death receptor FAS and the adaptor molecule FADD. After this treatment occludin could be immunoprecipitated with FADD, confirming its interaction with the DISC.

They suggest that occludin has a protective as well as a barrier forming role in epithelia; pathogenic agents which utilize this protein as an entry point into the cell might set off an apoptotic reaction allowing extrusion of the infected cell before the pathogen can gain entry to the interstitial space.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Tight junctions, known as the <italic>zonula occludens</italic>, form an anastomosing network of protein and lipid strands that apically circumscribe every luminal cell of an epithelium. Classically, they form a continuous and selective barrier to paracellular solute flux and ionic current (the <italic>gate </italic>function) and help maintain the distinct lipid and protein composition of the apical and basolateral cellular membranes (the <italic>fence </italic>function). It is becoming increasingly clear that this structure is also the direct or indirect target of many pathogens including Hepatitis C virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], Coxsackie virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], <italic>Clostridium perfringens </italic>endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], <italic>Campylobacter jejuni </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and that the tight junction protein occludin is often involved in host-pathogen interactions that result in infection.</p><p>The tight junction is a complex and multifunctional structure consisting of integral membrane molecules, occludin, claudins and junction adhesion molecule. Occludin and the claudins are tetraspanin proteins with two extracellular loops and are considered to form the variable permeability barrier between the luminal and interstitial spaces separated by the epithelium. Tight junction plaque proteins such as ZO1, ZO2, and ZO3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] link the integral proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. They also interact with a diverse group of signaling molecules that connect tight junction function to paracellular permeability, cell division, cell polarity and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The focus of this paper, occludin, is a tetraspanin protein with four transmembrane domains, intracellular N and C termini and two extracellular loops (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Although occludin has been shown to be important in establishing and maintaining the physiological properties of the tight junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and appears to be important for survival of cultured hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the occludin-null mouse is viable and appears to have relatively minor alterations in epithelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The claudins are now considered to play the major role in tight junction formation and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Importantly for this work, interference with occludin either by overexpression of a truncated form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or with peptides that disrupt its cell recognition complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] has been shown to alter endothelial or epithelial permeability. More recently enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>have been shown to alter occludin localization in T84 epithelial cells and to bring about caspase mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Intriguingly, overexpression of occludin in a variety of tumor cells sensitized the cells to apoptosis inducing agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and occludin negative clones showed reduced ability to extrude apoptotic cells from MDCK monolayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus there is conflicting evidence suggesting that occludin both enhances cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and participates in reactions leading to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The work presented here suggests that occludin can have an important direct interaction with the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in the mammary epithelium.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Occludin and occludin disrupting molecules</bold>.

The intestinal monolayer is in a constant state of flux with cells originating in the crypt moving to the apex of the microvillus where they undergo apoptosis without a loss of epithelial integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the mammary gland a massive wave of apoptosis in the involuting gland leads to loss of 75% of the epithelial cells within 3 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] with no apparent loss of the barrier function until the process is well advanced ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], Beeman and Neville, unpublished). In a landmark paper Rosenblatt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and her colleagues showed that isolated apoptotic cells are extruded from epithelial monolayers by the formation of an actinomyosin ring in neighboring cells; this ring gradually tightens around the extruding cell in such a manner that the neighboring cells maintain their intercellular contacts. Thus in epithelia the apoptotic process, called "cellular demolition" by Martin and his colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], occurs in a highly controlled fashion, removing apoptotic cells without a loss of epithelial integrity.</p><p>To determine whether changes in the tight junction could provide a link to extrusion and apoptosis of epithelial cells, we examined the effects of occludin disruption on mouse mammary epithelial cell monolayers with fully formed junctional complexes. We expressed truncated occludin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] by transient transfection at low efficiencies. We also treated the monolayers with a peptide that mimics four amino acids in the second extracellular loop of occludin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Both agents brought about an increase in non-junctional occludin that was associated with increased TUNEL staining, activation of caspases 8 and 3, and extrusion of cells from the monolayer with no changes in transepithelial resistance (TER). Most intriguing was our finding of occludin association with the death inducing signaling complex (DISC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], suggesting that occludin itself may act as a signaling molecule that activates the extrinsic pathway of programmed cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of dominant-negative occludin using a plasmid construct</title><p>In an initial experiment we examined the effects of occludin disruption by transiently transfecting CIT3 and Eph4 cells with plasmids expressing a flag-tagged truncated occludin, F-&#x00394;Occ, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

Cells that expressed F-BAP maintained normal morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, control panel), whereas a variety of apoptotic morphologies were observed in the F-&#x00394;Occ transfected cells. At 48 hr, 25% of control-transfected cells and 60% of F-&#x00394;Occ-transfected cells were TUNEL positive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the Eph4 cell line (not shown). Close inspection of the stained cultures showed that the majority of F-&#x00394;Occ-transfected cells were in various stages of extrusion and/or cellular demolition (Figure 2B&#x00026;D). In a very occasional view (2B, lower right) an extrusion stalk could be seen extending apically from the monolayer. Nuclei in these extruding cells often were TUNEL negative.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> shows an F-&#x00394;Occ-transfected cell rising above the plane of the epithelium with a condensed but non-fragmented nucleus. A condensed ring of actin and myosin is visible at the level of the apical junction complex and below the plane of the nucleus in the extruding cell, suggesting that the mechanism of extrusion is similar to that observed by Rosenblatt et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Note that actin and myosin are not visible in the surrounding, non-apoptotic cells. Thus expression of a disrupted form of occludin in a mammary epithelial monolayer is associated with apoptosis and extrusion of the transfected cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of polarized epithelial monolayers with an occludin disrupting peptide</title><p>The next question was whether disruption of occludin by another means would produce a similar result. We utilized a peptide previously reported to disrupt tight junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This peptide contained the LYHY sequence from the second extracellular loop of mouse occludin circularized for stability by oxidation of flanking cysteine residues. To confirm that this peptide disrupted the tight junction, we performed a "calcium switch" experiment on filter-grown Eph4 cells with an initial TER of 1000 Ohms&#x02022;cm<sup>2</sup>, removing extracellular Ca<sup>++</sup>and Mg<sup>++ </sup>to disrupt intercellular junctions. After 15 minutes in the divalent cation depleted-medium TER was reduced to zero. Cells were then switched back to normal medium containing the LYHY or control LYQY peptide (350 &#x003bc;M). The control peptide (LYQY) has a one amino acid substitution of the occludin peptide and was similarly circularized. Peptides were removed after 24 hours. Control peptide-treated cells recovered the initial TER by 48 hours and the TER continued to climb, reaching 4000 Ohms&#x02022;cm<sup>2 </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The occludin peptide severely retarded TER recovery during the 24 hours it was present in the medium (see inset), although once removed, the TER began to climb in parallel with the control.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of an occludin second loop peptide (LYHY)</bold>. A. Transepithelial resistance (TER) recovery following the calcium switch. EDTA was applied for 15 minutes to filter grown Eph4 monolayers that had achieved a TER of 1000 Ohms&#x02022;cm2, reducing the TER to the baseline of 66 Ohms&#x02022;cm2. LYHY or LYQY (350 &#x003bc;M) in growth medium containing normal Ca++ and Mg++ was placed above and below the filter supports. The TER was measured at 12 and 24 hours following peptide application (inset). Peptides were washed away 24 hrs following application and the TER measured every 24 hrs thereafter. B. Effect of peptides on occludin distribution in mature Eph4 cell monolayers. EPH4 cells on glass slides were treated with 350 &#x003bc;M LYHY or LYQY for 8 hours then fixed and stained with an anti-occludin antibody.

Higher concentrations of peptide produced severe disruption of the monolayer (not shown). Because we were interested in examining effects on single cells, unless noted, experiments were conducted with 350 &#x003bc;M peptide. Only an occasional cell showing a non-junctional distribution of occludin was observed in monolayers treated with the control peptide. Similar results were obtained with CIT3 and MDCK cells (data not shown). The next question was whether this disruption of non-junctional occludin led to apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Occludin peptide treatment increased apoptosis in polarized epithelial cell monolayers</title><p>We treated Eph4 monolayers with the LYHY peptide for 12 hours then examined TUNEL staining by immunohistochemistry (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1A</xref>). Quantitation of TUNEL stained cells showed that large numbers of apoptotic cells were present at 4 hours compared to cultures treated with the control LYQY (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To be sure that occludin was the target of this reaction, we plated primary cells derived from the mammary gland of a pregnant occludin knock-out mouse obtained from M. Furuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and obtained monolayer cultures. Control cells were obtained from a wild type female. Both were treated with the LYHY peptide for 16 hours and stained with an antibody to the effector caspase 3. Increased apoptosis was observed in cultures from the wild type but not the occludin-null mice, providing strong evidence that occludin is necessary for the apoptotic reaction.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>LYHY causes apoptosis with no change in TER</bold>.

Results of three wells averaged.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-10-85-4"/></fig><p>The next question was whether we were dealing with the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Both pathways utilize an "initiator" caspase to activate the effector caspase, caspase 3; however, both the site of the initial reaction and the initiator caspase differ between the two. In the intrinsic pathway cell stress or damage leads to release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The cytochrome C seeds a remarkable "apoptosome" assembly leading to activation of the initiator caspase 9 which in turn activates caspase 3. The external apoptotic pathway starts with activation of transmembrane death receptors such as FAS, TRAIL and others. Activation of these receptors leads to binding of an adaptor protein FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein), which in turn binds and aggregates caspase 8, promoting its autoactivation. Activated caspase 8 in turn cleaves and activates pro-caspase 3 leading to the full apoptotic reaction. We tested the hypothesis that the pathway activated by the occludin peptide was the extrinsic pathway in two ways. We first examined activation of the initiator caspase 8 and the effector caspase 3, costaining live cells with labeled peptides specific for the active sites of the two caspases. Interestingly slightly more cells reacted with the caspase 8 peptide than the caspase 3 peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1B</xref>). Further, cells could be observed with activated caspase 8 alone but never with activated caspase 3 in the absence of caspase 8 (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1B</xref>). These results suggested that LHYH activates the death receptor pathway and that caspase 8 is the initiating caspase. These caspases were only slightly activated by the control peptide LYQY (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><p>To provide a second, more rigorous test of the hypothesis that caspase 8 is the initiating caspase we measured the number of cells showing activation of the downstream effector caspase 3 during inhibition of caspase 8/10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Mature monolayers were incubated with inhibitors of caspase 8 and 10 (Z-IETD-FMK and Z-AEVD-FMK respectively), no inhibitor, or an inhibitor (Z-LEHD-FMK) of caspase 9, the initiator caspase of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Monolayers were then treated with cyclic LYHY peptide and stained for activated caspase 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The number of cells staining for activated caspase 3 during caspase 8/10 inhibition decreased 75%. Caspase 9 inhibition produced a reduction of 25% or less. Similar results were obtained when only the caspase 8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) was used in this experiment, as expected, since mouse cells do not express caspase 10 (data not shown). Our findings provide strong evidence that internalization of the LYHY peptide with non-junctional occludin leads to activation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. With this concentration of peptide cells are extruded from the monolayer with no loss of epithelial resistance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Extrusion of a caspase stained cell after treatment with LYHY</bold>.

They were stained live during the 6th hour of treatment with carboxyfluorescein-LETD-fluoromethyl ketone for activated caspase 8 as described in Materials and Methods. After fixation monolayers were stained for occludin and nuclei. An extruding cell stained for caspase 8 shows a narrow extrusion "tail" and has a slightly pyknotic nucleus.

Careful microscopic examination revealed occasional caspase 8 staining cells being extruded from the monolayer, complete with extrusion stalk (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) consistent with the extrusion mechanism shown earlier with F-&#x00394;Occ.</p></sec><sec><title>Non-junctional occludin interacts with the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC)</title><p>The question now is "What is the pathway by which the peptide leads to activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway?" We first asked where the LYHY peptide localized by treating the cell with a FITC-labeled cyclic LYHY peptide. We found that this peptide did indeed colocalize with non-junctional occludin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) in contrast to the control FITC-labeled LYQY peptide, which neither caused internalization of occludin nor became enriched in regions of displaced occludin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). E-cadherin distribution was not changed by the peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) indicating that the adherens junction was not disrupted. This experiment provides evidence that the LYHY peptide interacts with occludin, but does not provide information about the nature of the "occludin patches" or their localization with respect to the polarity of the epithelial cells. The next experiments were designed to examine these issues.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Peptide localization in EPH4 cells</bold>.

If occludin and these caspases are localized to the DISC, components of the death receptor should also be present in these regions. In fact, immunostaining showed that Fas and FADD are localized to the same regions as non-junctional occludin and caspase 8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Thus the DISC appears to contain Fas, FADD, and caspases 3 and 8 and occludin, suggesting death receptor activation by non-junctional occludin.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of caspase 8 with displaced occludin and DISC proteins after LYHY treatment of Eph4 monolayers on glass slides</bold>.

Using digital confocal microscopy we examined a Z-stack of images from the apex to the basal surface of the cell. To mark the apical surface cells were co-stained with an antibody to MUC1, a mucin localized exclusively to the apical surface of the cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The middle images show the XY plane. The ZX plane was calculated at two different positions of Y, as shown by the white lines in the middle left image, and the ZX images are depicted above and below the XY images. In these images activated caspase 8 appeared to be localized just basal to MUC1 and the main body of occludin staining. However, there is a fuzzy projection of occludin into the region of caspase 8 staining as shown by the yellow band separating the red occludin and green caspase 8 bands in the lower left hand image. Thus the DISC is located apically and the occludin associated with the DISC appears to be in the membrane suggesting that occludin moves through the membrane to activate the death receptor.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Cellular localization of activated caspase 8 and non-junctional occludin</bold>.

We found that both a truncated occludin construct and a peptide identical to 4 amino acids in the second extracellular loop of occludin increased non-junctional occludin, increased activation of caspases 8 and 3, and brought about TUNEL staining in treated cells. Cells with these signs of apoptosis were extruded from the monolayer with no change in TER. There was no increased apoptosis in occludin null cells exposed to the peptide. At early times non-junctional occludin was localized in the DISC with activated caspases 8 and 3 as well as with the death receptor FAS protein and the adaptor protein FADD. It could be co-immunoprecipitated with FADD. These findings suggest that disruption of occludin leads to its displacement from the tight junction to the DISC, initiating extrusion and apoptosis of the affected cell by the Type I extrinsic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><sec><title>Expression of truncated occludin</title><p>The F-&#x00394;Occ construct had been previously used as a dominant negative occludin to transfect cultured salivary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These cells showed normal distribution of endogenous occludin, ZO-1, and JAM. However, tracer flux was increased and TER decreased. This experiment differed from ours in that the salivary cells were stably transfected and constitutively expressing, surviving cells were selected. We used low concentrations of plasmid to obtain transient transfection of sparsely located cells, which then underwent apoptosis and left the monolayer. It would be of considerable interest to determine how the stably transfected monolayers were able to adapt to expression of the mutant construct.</p></sec><sec><title>Peptides mimicking other occludin sequences</title><p>Tight junction disruption via peptides containing sequences in the second extracellular loop of occludin has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. When intact EPH4 cell monolayers were treated with a 44 amino acid peptide comprising the entire second extracellular loop of chicken occludin, isolated patches of cells throughout the monolayer showed a punctate, intracellular, non-junctional distribution of occludin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These peptide-treated cells maintained a TER above 3000 Ohms&#x000b7;cm<sup>2</sup>, about 50% of that of controls. In another laboratory a peptide mimicking a 22 amino acid sequence in the second extracellular loop impeded recovery of TER and caused internalization of several tight junction transmembrane proteins following the calcium switch in human intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Similar results were obtained with a rat 19 amino acid second extracellular loop mimic in a rat Sertoli cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In these latter two studies the peptide ended two amino acids upstream of the LYHY sequence suggesting that regions comprising peptides other than LYHY are also involved in homophilic interactions of occludin.</p></sec><sec><title>Extrusion and TER</title><p>The finding that a large increase in apoptosis, which occurred in all studies, did not decrease the trans-epithelial resistance suggests that loss of single epithelial cells proceeds by an orderly biological process that maintains rather than disrupts the epithelial barrier. Similarly, cultured monolayers of intestinal epithelial cells were able to maintain 50% of basal TER when treated with a Fas crosslinking antibody that led to the loss of half of the cells in the culture in only 24 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Because we observed an actomyosin "purse string" around extruding cells in our study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), the mechanism of extrusion first elucidated by Rosenblatt and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] is likely used.</p></sec><sec><title>Is displaced junctional occludin acting as a signaling molecule?</title><p>It has been known for some time that viral and bacterial pathogens can enter cells utilizing occludin and other elements of the tight junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In fact, Greber and Gustaldelli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] have called the tight junction the "Achille's heel of epithelial cells in pathogen infection". Our studies raise the very important question of whether signaling through disrupted occludin could provide a significant host defense against, at least moderate concentrations of, pathogens by producing controlled extrusion and apoptosis of affected cells. A recent study of the induction of epithelial cell apoptosis by enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>(EPEC) is consistent with such a mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. EPEC infection led to the cleavage of occludin and ZO-1 and the mis-localization of these molecules. Subsequently an increase in apoptosis markers was observed. We only observed full length occludin in FADD pulldowns, suggesting that the peptide in some way releases full length occludin from the tight junction freeing it to interact with apical membrane FAS and FADD prior to any cleavage. This reaction contrasts with the finding that occludin prevents apoptosis in cultures of hepatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is possible that occludin can both stabilize junctional complexes and signal to a cell that its junctional complex has been perturbed by a pathogenic agent. If so, occludin is quite a versatile molecule.</p><p>Schneeberger has previously suggested that occludin might serve as a signaling molecule, although in a different context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. While the results of our studies are consistent with a role for non-junctional occludin as a signaling molecule, it is clear that many other signaling molecules are also associated with tight junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Any one of a number of these could transmit a signal from a disrupted tight junction to the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. An intriguing possibility is that the Akt antagonist, lipid phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10) links loss of occludin function to apoptosis. Several reports have demonstrated that the PTEN binds to the tight junction associated MAGI-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], PAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and DLG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] proteins and PTEN binding to the PDZ domain of Magi-2 promoted its stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Moreover, PTEN plays a role in activation of the death receptor pathway of apoptosis under various conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our preliminary results show that PTEN is associated with the tight junction in Eph4 cells (data not shown). It will be of interest to determine whether it plays a role in linking occludin disruption to death receptor mediated apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Future directions</title><p>The results of our experiments link disruption of the tight junction protein occludin to stimulation of apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway and provide a potential defense mechanism for ridding the epithelium of cells exposed to pathogens. They also raise questions for further experimentation: For example, does the apoptotic process involved meet criteria for Type I death receptor activation other than the recruitment of large amounts of caspase 8 to the DISC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]? Interestingly, Nusrat and her colleagues have proposed that the tight junctional components reside in lipid raft-like complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The diffuse nature of the occludin stain in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> leads us to ask whether portions of these rafts might detach from the junction and fuse with the DISC, which has also been shown to localize to lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found that a small cyclized peptide LYHY disrupts occludin localization at the tight junction and activates the extrinsic pathway of programmed cell death. At early times occludin is localized at the death inducing signaling complex and can be immunoprecipitated with FADD, a member of this complex. These observations suggest that occludin has a protective as well as a barrier forming role in epithelia; pathogenic agents which utilize this protein as an entry point into the cell might set off an apoptotic reaction allowing extrusion of the infected cell before the pathogen can gain entry to the interstitial space.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Anti occludin, Zymed<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>clone OCOC-3F10; anti Fas, BD Biosciences clone 13; anti ZO-1, Chemicon<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>MAB1520; anti FADD, USBiological clone 12E7; anti MUC1, Abcam inc. clone EP1024Y; anti-caspase 3, Cell Signaling Technology<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(8G10); anti-caspase 8, Axxora<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(1G12).</p></sec><sec><title>Mice</title><p>A breeding colony of occludin null homozygous mice is maintained in our animal facility.
