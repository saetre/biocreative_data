We have established a general method to efficiently produce reversible and inducible gene knockout and rescue in mice. In this system, which we named iKO, the target gene can be turned on and off at will by treating the mice with doxycycline. This method combines two genetically modified mouse lines: a) a KO line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene, and b) a line with a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated (TIGRE) genomic locus, which provides for low basal expression and high inducibility. Such a locus occurs infrequently in the genome and we have developed a method to easily introduce genes into the TIGRE site of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by recombinase-mediated insertion. Both KO and TIGRE lines have been engineered for high-throughput, large-scale and cost-effective production of iKO mice. As a proof of concept, we have created iKO mice in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, which allows for sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. The results demonstrated reversible switching of ApoE transcription, plasma cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The iKO system shows stringent regulation and is a versatile genetic system that can easily incorporate other techniques and adapt to a wide range of applications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>We describe a technology for the creation of inducible and reversible gene inactivation in mice. It combines two genetically modified mouse lines: a knock-out line with a tetracycline transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene, and a line in which a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene has been inserted into a specific genomic locus. A critical component of this system is the unique chromosomal loci we have identified and engineered that offer a platform for easy insertion of any gene of interest for tightly controlled expression. Because of its simple binary nature, allowing independent modification of each of the two components and possibility of use in a high-throughput mode, we believe that our system will be useful for multiple applications, such as introducing mutant or humanized form of the target gene as well as functional manipulating tools. We have applied this technology to the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene and have demonstrated that: a) the expression of ApoE is strictly dependent on the presence of doxycycline, a tetracycline group antibiotic, in the mouse diet, b) in the absence of doxycycline (ApoE repressed) atherosclerotic plaques are formed, confirming the importance of ApoE in the process, and c) upon re-induction of ApoE in the animals with doxicyclin, atherosclerosis regressed.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the post-genome era, a major challenge is deciphering the function of thousands of newly identified genes. One of the main approaches for studying gene function involves inactivation of genes in cells or animals using random (chemical or insertional) mutagenesis or gene targeting. A common problem with these methods stems from the fact that the gene of interest is usually mutated throughout the animal's life. As a result, 1) in many cases the mutation leads to embryonic or neonatal lethality, precluding the assessment of the gene's function in later life; 2) in viable mutants interpretation of observed phenotypes is often complicated by the inability to distinguish the direct effects of the gene loss at the time of observation from the results of developmental abnormalities caused by the gene loss earlier in life; 3) in still other cases, life-long absence of a gene product causes compensatory adjustments of activities of other genes precluding the elucidation of the function of the gene of interest. Conditional knockout and gene expression technologies, such as the Cre/lox-mediated tissue-specific knockout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Lewandoski1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and the tetracycline (Tet) regulated transcriptional activation system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Gossen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, can regulate gene expression in a more spatially and temporally controlled fashion. However, these technologies are often laborious to establish and the results are frequently variable.</p><p>Here we report the development of a system that provides for the inducible and reversible gene inactivation in the mouse and can also be readily scaled up for high-throughput applications. The iKO system is a binary approach based on the Tet-dependent regulatory technology. It involves the combination of two mouse lines &#x02013; a KO line that expresses the Tet-transactivator (tTA or rtTA) in place of the gene of interest, and a TIGRE (for <underline>tig</underline>htly <underline>re</underline>gulated) line that contains the gene of interest under the control of the Tet-responsive element (TRE) at a predetermined genomic locus. It has the advantage of, 1) ability to turn genes on or off at will by adding or removing doxycycline (Dox) at any time during the animal's life, thus minimizing embryonic lethality, developmental effects, and compensatory effects; 2) high degree of regulation to any gene inserted at the TIGRE locus, which has been selected to confer minimal basal expression and high inducibility, and to insert any gene of interest in a single step by Cre/loxP recombination; 3) efficiency; the design allowing streamlined production of both KO and TIGRE mice makes it possible to generate iKOs for a large number of genes in a cost-effective manner; 4) flexibility; KO and TIGRE lines can be engineered independently and combined in numerous ways, making a wide range of applications possible.</p><p>As a proof of concept, we report the characterization of an iKO of the apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE iKO). ApoE plays a key role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis progression. ApoE KO mice develop hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis that closely resemble the human conditions and are rapidly reversed when APOE protein is supplied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Plump1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Zhang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Boisvert1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Linton1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Tsukamoto1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Raffai1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, inducible and reversible regulation of ApoE expression could result in rapid physiological changes, which in turn can help assess the iKO technology. Furthermore, the phenotype of ApoE deficiency is quantifiable and very sensitive to leaky expression, allowing for the evaluation of the stringency of gene regulation by iKO technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Thorngate1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we demonstrate that in the ApoE iKO mice, ApoE gene expression, as well as blood cholesterol levels, is tightly controlled by Dox. In the presence of Dox, ApoE is expressed and the cholesterol levels are low; in its absence, the reverse is observed. Furthermore, on examination of aortic atherosclerosis in the ApoE iKO mice we found that Dox treatment before the onset of atherosclerotic lesions completely prevented lesion formation and Dox treatment after extensive lesions had already formed resulted in regression of the lesions. These results demonstrate the reversibility of the iKO, leading to phenotype switching within the same animal. ApoE iKO is also useful in its own right as a novel model system for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis progression and regression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Principle of the iKO System</title><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, two genetically modified mouse strains are created. The first is a KO line in which a Tet-dependent transactivator (rtTA in this example) is inserted into the target gene (Gene X). The insertion inactivates Gene X, and places rtTA under the control of the endogenous promoter of Gene X. The KO line can be generated via either homologous recombination or insertional mutagenesis. The second line (TIGRE) contains an additional copy of Gene X cDNA (or genomic fragments) driven by TRE-promoter inserted in a specific locus in the genome (the TIGRE locus), which has been pre-selected for low basal transcriptional activity and high inducibility. When these two lines are crossed, rtTA protein produced from the KO allele can activate the TRE-Gene X in the TIGRE locus only in the presence of Dox. (Alternatively, tTA can be used, which works in the opposite way &#x02013; Tet-off instead of Tet-on.)</p><fig id="pgen-1000069-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000069.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the principle of the iKO system.</title><p>(A) Two components of the iKO system, a KO line and a TIGRE line. (B) Generation of iKO mouse by crossing the KO and TIGRE lines. The iKO is a composite mouse in which: 1) both copies of the endogenous Gene X are disrupted by the insertion; 2) rtTA is driven by the promoter of Gene X; and 3) the cDNA of Gene X is in the TIGRE locus under the control of TRE. Functional Gene X is only expressed from the TIGRE locus when rtTA is bound to Dox, and therefore is inducibly and reversibly regulated by Dox.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000069.g001"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g001">Figure 1B</xref> illustrates the breeding of KO and TIGRE lines to produce the iKO mouse, which is homozygous for the KO locus and carries one copy of the TIGRE allele. The status of the iKO mouse is regulated by Dox. In the absence of Dox, rtTA protein is produced, but is inactive. As a result, TRE-Gene X is silent, Gene X protein is not produced and the KO phenotype is manifested. In the presence of Dox, rtTA stimulates the synthesis of Gene X protein from the TIGRE locus in the same cells in which the endogenous gene would normally be expressed. Expression complements the missing endogenous Gene X activity and leads to phenotypically normal animals. Thus, one can switch between wild type and KO state of animals by simply adding or removing Dox (e.g. with food).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Selection of TIGRE Loci</title><p>To screen for TIGRE loci, we constructed a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retroviral vector, pRTonZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), in which the TRE-controlled lacZ gene was used as a reporter for gene regulation. Retroviral transduction at low multiplicity of infection ensures integration of a single copy of the TRE-lacZ unit into the genome. pRTonZ contains a modified neomycin phosphotransferase gene, loxneo, in which initiating AUG has been placed upstream of a loxP site in frame with the neo coding region. Once optimal locus is selected, it is utilized as a target site for transgene-integration by the scheme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g002">Figures 2B and 2C</xref>. The TRE-lacZ unit is removed by Cre-mediated recombination of flanking loxP sites, leaving one loxP site and the neo gene in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Since the promoter of the loxneo gene as well as the initiating AUG are also removed, ES cells become G418-sensitive. In this configuration, any gene of interest can be introduced into the same locus by Cre/loxP recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Recombinant ES clones can be selected by G418-resistance because the neo expression unit is reconstituted. PCR screening showed that &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of these G418-resistant clones had correct insertion of the new gene.</p><fig id="pgen-1000069-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000069.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Retroviral vector used to search for tightly regulated loci and strategy to introduce a new gene into these predetermined loci.</title><p>(A) Structure of the pRTonZ retroviral vector. To prevent effects of viral enhancer on the TRE promoter, the enhancer sequence was deleted in the 3&#x02032; long terminal repeat (LTR). Subsequent transduction into target cells is expected to lead to enhancer deletion in both LTRs. The insert was cloned in the opposite orientation of the LTRs, so that the polyA addition signals would not decrease the viral titer. (B) Excision of the lacZ reporter gene from TIGRE loci. LoxP-flanked sequences within the retroviral vector are removed by transient expression of Cre recombinase in ES cells, leaving a single copy of loxP site in the genome. ES cells become G418-sensitive since the loxneo gene loses its promoter and initiating AUG. (C) Introduction of a new gene into the TIGRE locus. The G418-sensitive ES cells selected in (B) are cotransfected with the TIGRE-targeting vector carrying a new gene (gene X) and the Cre expression vector. Proper Cre-mediated recombination between the TIGRE-targeting vector, containing the new gene, and the TIGRE site introduces the new gene into the TIGRE locus and converts the G418 sensitive ES cells into G418 resistant (the expected recombinant leads to neo expression by placing the PGK promoter and initiating AUG upstream of the loxneo gene).

Difference between lacZ(&#x02212;)tTA(&#x02212;) and lacZ(&#x0002b;)tTA(&#x02212;) indicates basal activity of lacZ gene in the absence of tTA, and comparison of lacZ(&#x0002b;)tTA(&#x02212;) and lacZ(&#x0002b;)tTA(&#x0002b;) reveals induction levels in the presence of tTA. Overall, the three mouse lines showed similar pattern of &#x003b2;-gal activity, although some differences were also seen. Basal activities were low but detectable in many tissues, and they were comparable to the values measured in the parental ES clones. &#x003b2;-gal activity was inducible in almost every tissue, and overall induction levels correlated with the expression levels of tTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom panel).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Improvement of Gene Regulation Control at the TIGRE Loci</title><p>Although the three loci T1, T2 and T3 showed tight regulation of gene expression, basal activity was still detectable in many tissues.

Although the insulator sequences were effective, basal activity was still clearly detectable in every clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). To test whether tight regulation is achieved by using other genes, we replaced the lacZ gene with a luciferase gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000069.s002">Figure S2</xref>). With this reporter, insulators reduced basal activity by 14, 20 and 11 fold in T1, T2 and T3 loci, respectively, bringing it close to the instrument detection limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Calculation of the number of luciferase molecule per ES cell (Supporting Methods) revealed that on average only 1, 0.7 and 0.3 luciferase molecule were expressed per cell in T1, T2 and T3 loci, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, induced levels were not impaired by the insulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), leading to high induction ratio of luciferase activity. Similar basal activity levels could also be achieved by expressing transrepressor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000069.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

Endogenous ApoE gene comprises of 4 exons. In the ApoE KO line, retroviral vector is inserted into the third intron of the ApoE gene, 205 bp upstream of the fourth exon (the largest coding exon). The retroviral vector contains the virus backbone (including 5&#x02032;LTR and 3&#x02032;LTR), a splice acceptor (SA) &#x02013; stop codon (stop) &#x02013; IRES cassette immediately followed by rtTA, a PGK promoter (P) driven neo selection marker flanked by two loxP sites (L), and a transcriptional terminator sequence (t). pA, polyadenylation sequence. From this locus, transcription initiated from the endogenous ApoE gene continues through rtTA to form an ApoE-SA-Stops-IRES-rtTA-polyA hybrid transcript in place of the full-length endogenous ApoE transcript. The rtTA protein is produced from this hybrid transcript through IRES-mediated translation, and in turn turns on the expression of the TRE-ApoE from the TIGRE locus only when Dox is present. The ApoE TIGRE locus contains an exogenous copy of ApoE cDNA driven by TRE and flanked by four copies of chicken &#x003b2;-globin insulator (ins) sequences, two on each side, and a PGK promoter (P) driven loxneo selection marker.

Heterozygous mice carrying one allele of the intact endogenous gene and one allele interrupted by the rtTA-bearing retroviral vector were used to prepare total RNA samples from different tissues and amplify gene-specific transcript and rtTA transcript from the same RNA preps for side-by-side comparison. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g006">Figure 6B</xref> shows three examples of such comparison for genes P2Y6, RE2 and LGR6 respectively.

Real-time qPCR for 16 tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000069.s004">Table S1</xref>) also showed high degree of correlation between rtTA and endogenous gene from tissue to tissue.

In the remaining 7 lines in which rtTA was not expressed well, 5 lines had the retroviral vector inserted upstream of the first (and usually fairly large) intron of each gene. It has been recognized that the first intron (especially if it is large) could contain essential transcriptional regulatory elements, and thus insertions in this region might disrupt the transcriptional regulation and so should be avoided.

Attempts to target both tTA and TRE together into an endogenous gene locus to achieve inducible activation and inactivation were successful in a few cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Shin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Bond1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Gross1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, but this method is not applicable to most other genes as the TRE is easily subject to activation from nearby enhancers independent from tTA. Our iKO technique utilizes each gene's own promoter to direct the expression of transcriptional activators, e.g. rtTA and tTA. Therefore it is not limited to certain tissues and available tissue-specific promoter driven transgenic lines. It could be applicable to any gene in any tissue. Dox-regulated expression can be turned on and off rapidly, i.e. within a few days, and at any time in development or adult. It also allows analysis of the effects of gene inactivation in the same animal. The TIGRE locus has been selected to confer little or no basal transgene expression throughout the body while maintaining high inducibility, enabling stringent control of the on/off switching of the target gene. Our system also has the flexibility to allow for further improvements. For example, in some cases it may be more desirable to put the genomic copy of the gene under TRE promoter into the TIGRE locus instead of the cDNA to more precisely mimic the expression of the endogenous gene. Also, the IRES we have used to drive rtTA translation may not work uniformly well in all tissues, and can be replaced by other approaches such as using the viral 2A-like sequences for bicistronic translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Szymczak1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> or direct targeting of tTA/rtTA into the ATG start codon of the endogenous gene.</p><p>Unique chromosomal loci for predicted gene expression provide fundamental tools for genetic studies. The most widely used is the ROSA26 locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Zambrowicz1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> in which ubiquitous gene expression is achieved by endogenous promoter activity of this locus. The TIGRE loci identified in this study allow a different mode of gene regulation &#x02013; they were selected from hundreds of insertion sites for tight gene regulation by an exogenous promoter. Therefore, the TIGRE loci offer a platform for easy insertion of any gene in a tightly regulated locus, applicable to not only the tetracycline system but also other gene expression systems utilizing exogenous promoters such as constitutively active promoters, tissue specific promoters, or other inducible promoters regulated by reagents such as ecdysone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-No1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, mifepristone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Wang1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and streptogramin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Fussenegger1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently a similar approach was also applied to a human fibrosarcoma cell line to pre-screen optimal integration sites for transgenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Brough1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, here we demonstrated that the stringency of the regulation at TIGRE loci is further enhanced by the incorporation of insulators, i.e. basal expression level was reduced to less than one luciferase molecule per cell without impairing inducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g004">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Insulators were also shown previously to improve inducibility of randomly integrated TRE-reporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Anastassiadis1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. It should be noted that in our study the insulator effect was limited in many other loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g004">Figure 4A versus 4B</xref>), demonstrating the uniqueness of the TIGRE loci. The genomic location of the T1 TIGRE locus, which was most extensively used in our study including the ApoE iKO mice, was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Further manipulation of this locus would be possible to expand its application.</p><p>The stringent gene regulation is demonstrated in the ApoE iKO mice. It is known that regulation of blood cholesterol levels is very sensitive to the plasma ApoE protein levels. Even with the production of 3&#x00025; of wild-type level of ApoE protein, the hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis phenotypes of the ApoE KO mice can be reversed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Thorngate1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Given this high sensitivity, the fact that our ApoE iKO mice in the uninduced state (i.e. in the absence of Dox) exhibit similarly high levels of cholesterol compared to ApoE KO mice indicates that there is hardly any expression of functional APOE. Reversing the KO at will is a particularly powerful approach in atherosclerotic regression studies. Dox-treatment of ApoE iKO mice results in expression of ApoE, marked reduction of plasma cholesterol levels, and regression of aortic atherosclerotic lesions. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that aggressive lipid lowering or expression of ApoE can induce regression of pre-existing atherosclerotic lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Tsukamoto1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Raffai1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-MacDougall1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Trogan1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. It is becoming increasingly clear that lesion regression is regulated by a complex interplay between lipids, inflammation and the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Trogan1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The ApoE iKO mice will allow detailed studies on the roles of specific genes in these complex interactions.</p><p>The binary nature of the iKO system is inherently simple, with the KO line serving dual roles: it could be used as a constitutive KO or combined with the TIGRE line to produce an inducible and reversible iKO. The 10-million clone ES cell library we utilized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Gragerov1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> has been estimated to contain insertional mutations for &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of genes, and individual ES clones with retroviral insertions in a specific target gene can be rapidly identified through a PCR pooling strategy and subsequently isolated in a streamlined process. The identification and modification of the TIGRE locus allows rapid insertion of any gene of interest via co-transfection with Cre. Therefore, each component of the binary system, the KO or the TIGRE line, is amenable for high-throughput production to generate inducible and reversible KOs for a large number of genes.</p><p>It should be noted that the iKO system may not be applicable in certain situations where highly stringent gene regulation is required. For example, even though the system had enough stringency in low basal activity and high induction, the induced gene expression level is usually not exactly the same as the endogenous gene's level and this could be a problem for genes that are highly sensitive to gene dosage effect or show haploid deficiency. The kinetics of the system (days) may be also too slow for some developmental problems where transient expression of developmental genes are critical, although it should be noted that it could still work well in carefully thought-out developmental studies (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Shin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that rtTA often can not induce sufficient gene expression in the brain, at least partially due to developmental inactivation of the TRE promoter in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Zhu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. It appears that the tTA (Tet-off) system is better suited for the use in brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Mayford1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, as substantial &#x003b2;-gal induction was observed in brain with tTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>Our results of the ApoE iKO mice and the quantitative data using lacZ and luciferase reporters suggest that the iKO system could be a useful tool in addressing a variety of biological questions. The two components of the iKO system can be independently modified, and pairing of their different forms can generate numerous combinations. In KO lines, genes with unique expression patterns are tagged with a transcription transactivator, which can control, in an inducible fashion, the expression of a variety of genes derived from TIGRE lines, enabling a number of additional applications in specific types of tissues or cells. Those include: 1) introducing mutant forms of the target gene into the TIGRE locus for better functional probing of different domains, splice variants, post-transcriptional modifications (e.g. phosphorylation), or modeling human diseases; 2) humanizing target genes by placing a human ortholog of the mouse gene under TRE control, which can facilitate drug efficacy studies; 3) placing a cytotoxic gene under TRE control to allow inducible cell-type specific ablation; 4) introducing a marker gene such as GFP, protein interacting probe, or transneuronal tracer, into the TIGRE locus for cell-type specific tagging, functional analysis, isolation of specific cell population, or mapping neuronal networks; 5) combining with recently developed RNAi techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Ventura1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Dickins1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Stegmeier1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> to down-regulate any genes of interest in a tissue-specific and inducible manner; 6) re-engineering the TIGRE locus to place a TRE-driven Cre, and combining it with a tissue-specific rtTA or tTA line and floxed target genes to achieve inducible region-specific gene knockout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Monteggia1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000069.s006">Text S1</xref> online for a more detailed description of the methods.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Screening and Isolation of ES Clones with Insertions in Target Genes</title><p>Construction of ES cell library infected with the retrovirus and screening and isolation of ES clones with genes of interest inactivated by the viral insertion is described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000069-Gragerov1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically for ApoE, insertions were found by nested PCR analysis of the ES DNA using two vector-specific and gene-specific primer pairs. The ApoE-specific primers are antisense and located in the fourth exon. Several independent retroviral insertions in the ApoE gene were identified. PCR fragments were sequenced to confirm insertion into the gene. A library tube with a clone of interest identified by the PCR also contains a few hundred other ES cell clones. The sole desired clone was isolated from the mixture by three rounds of cell sorting and growing followed by PCR using the same pair of primers to identify positive clones. Additional PCRs using ApoE primers located in the third intron flanking the viral insertion site were conducted to confirm the precision of the insertion and integrity of the genomic sequence of ApoE.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generation of TIGRE ES Clones Containing Target Genes</title><p>Full length cDNAs for the coding sequences of target genes were cloned into the TIGRE-targeting vector containing TRE, insulators, a PGK promoter and a pair of loxP sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000069-g005">Figure 5A lower panel</xref>). The TIGRE-targeting vectors were co-transfected with a Cre-expressing plasmid into the neo-sensitive ES cells carrying the minimal TIGRE locus with a single loxP site and the promoterless, ATGless loxneo marker. When the TIGRE-targeting vector is integrated into the TIGRE locus through Cre/lox-mediated recombination, neo-resistance is restored to the ES cells by the addition of PGK promoter and in-frame fusion of ATG to the loxneo marker. Correctly integrated ES clones were identified and confirmed by PCR screening and southern blot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Animal Production and Maintenance</title><p>ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6J mice following standard techniques. Chimeric mice were bred with C57BL/6J mice to test germline transmission and generate heterozygous mice.

All mice used for studies in this paper were in a mixed genetic background of 50&#x00025; 129S1/SvImJ and 50&#x00025; C57BL/6. For the ApoE KO line, southern blot using rtTA coding sequence as probe confirmed the correct insertion of the retroviral vector into the endogenous ApoE gene. It also revealed an additional retroviral insertion somewhere else in the genome. The additional insertion was selectively bred out, and the ApoE iKO colony was maintained with a single retroviral insertion at the ApoE locus. MMTV-tTA, P<sub>CAMKII</sub>-tTA and P<sub>NSE</sub>-tTA mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of NCI and Nura, Inc. in accordance with NIH guidelines.</p><p>Dox was administered to the mice through Dox-containing food, which was custom made by Bio-Serv (Frenchtown, NJ) to contain 2 g Dox per kilogram of food. The nutrition content of the Dox food (e.g. 19&#x00025; protein and 8.6&#x00025; fat) was very similar to the regular diet (20&#x00025; protein, 9&#x00025; fat) used in our colony.
