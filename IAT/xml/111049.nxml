The high transcriptional activity of rp-genes has been attributed in part to the presence of T-rich regions downstream of the GRF binding site(s) in the rp-gene promoters. T-rich elements appeared to have the capacity to activate transcription even by themselves, albeit with low efficiency. However, high transcriptional yields are reached when these elements function in synergism with a binding site for Rap1p, Abf1p or Reb1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c3">3</xref>). The latter factors are abundant, essential for cell viability and are involved in multiple cellular functions. In many instances a binding site for one GRF can be replaced by another GRF binding site and, furthermore, protein domains can be exchanged among GRFs without loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c6">6</xref>). Abf1p, the GRF that binds the promoters of several rp-genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c7">7</xref>), including <italic>RPS28A</italic>, functions in transcriptional regulation of a very diverse set of genes, but is also involved in silencing at HML and HMR, as well as in DNA replication. Finally, it binds in nearly all X-regions of telomeres (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c8">8</xref>). The mechanism by which Abf1p exerts its functions is still elusive. Several observations, however, suggest that it affects chromatin structure. De Winde <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c9">9</xref>) reported that Abf1p is involved in the formation of a nuclease-hypersensitive region at the <italic>QCR8</italic> promoter, while Venditti <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c10">10</xref>) concluded that it acts as a nucleosomal boundary element at the autonomous replication sequence 1.</p><p>Although chromatin structure is dynamic in general, nucleosomes are often located at specific positions. The actual position of a nucleosome is determined by histone&#x02013;DNA interactions, elements that function as a nucleosomal boundary, and&#x0002f;or by chromatin folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c11">11</xref>). Since the presence of nucleosomes is generally repressive to transcription, it has long been thought that T-stretches present in promoter regions act to exclude nucleosomes. However, stretches of As or Ts have been found in nucleosome-protected regions <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c14">14</xref>), and homopolymeric (dA:dT) elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c15">15</xref>) as well as naturally occurring promoter-proximal T-stretches can be incorporated into nucleosomes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c16">16</xref>). Nevertheless, Iyer and Struhl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c17">17</xref>) have found that introduction of a homopolymeric (dA:dT) element increases the occupancy of a neighbouring transcription factor binding site <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, it was observed that the stimulatory effect of such elements on transcription increases with length and that homopolymeric (dG:dC) elements which, like homopolymeric (dA:dT) elements, are structurally rigid DNA sequences, have a similar stimulatory effect on transcription. These and other observations led to the proposal that such structurally rigid elements increase the accessibility of neighbouring DNA, either by causing a local decrease in nucleosomal occupancy or by altering nucleosomal conformation.</p><p>Many naturally occurring T-rich elements, however, are not homopolymeric. These elements may harbour recognition site(s) for a specific DNA binding protein(s). A yeast protein that has been shown to specifically recognize T-rich elements is Dat1p. This protein binds any 11 bp sequence of which 10 bp are dA:dT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c18">18</xref>). Unexpectedly, Dat1p appears to be able to affect transcription both negatively and positively. Genes that contain putative Dat1p-binding T-rich elements are 1.5&#x02013;2.5-fold derepressed in a <italic>dat1</italic> deletion strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c18">18</xref>) and the transcriptional activity of promoters containing homopolymeric dA:dT elements decreases when Dat1p is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c17">17</xref>). On the other hand, Moreira <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c19">19</xref>) have shown that Dat1p functions as a transcriptional activator at the <italic>ILV1</italic> promoter.</p><p>In order to obtain more insight into the role of the T-rich elements in transcriptional activation of yeast rp-genes we have studied the T-rich element that is present adjacent to the Abf1p binding site in the <italic>RPS28A</italic> rp-gene promoter. This element is located at the centre of the 294 bp intergenic region separating the coding regions of <italic>RPS28A</italic> and the oppositely transcribed <italic>GLN4</italic> gene, which encodes glutamine tRNA synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c20">20</xref>). Our data indicate that the Abf1p binding site and the T-rich element act synergistically to create a nucleosome-free region downstream of the Abf1p-binding site followed by an ordered array of nucleosomes. This local (re-)organization of the chromatin may serve to increase the accessibility of downstream promoter sequences for additional protein factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>The haploid strain BJ2168 (MATa, <italic>leu2</italic>, <italic>trp1</italic>, <italic>ura3-52</italic>, <italic>prc1-407</italic>, <italic>prb-1122</italic>, <italic>pep4-3</italic>) of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> was used to analyse the <italic>GUS</italic>-reporter constructs (with respect to the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> &#x003b2;-glucuronidase gene).

This is consistent with results obtained in promoter reconstitution experiments previously performed in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c22">22</xref>). Clearly, binding of Abf1p is essential for optimal activation of transcription by the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter.</p><p>Interestingly, the T-rich element located 7 bp downstream of the Abf1p binding site is equally important for attaining high transcriptional yields.

The latter explanation derives from the observation that homopolymeric (dT:dA) stretches can be functionally replaced by homopolymeric (dG:dC) or (dC:dG) stretches that are also structurally inflexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c17">17</xref>).</p><p>As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f1">1</xref>B the sequence of the 3&#x02032; portion of the T-rich element of the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter conforms to the consensus Dat1p binding site proposed by Reardon <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c18">18</xref>), with respect to any 11 bp homopolymeric (dT:dA) tract with one mismatch allowed.

Rather, a slightly (&#x0223c;20&#x00025;) higher level of the <italic>RPS28A</italic> transcript was observed in the <italic>dat1</italic> deletion strain.

In the wild-type construct well-defined Mnase (hyper)sensitive sites as well as protected regions can be seen, while in the mutant construct, which does not bind Abf1p, no such sites are visible.</p><p>In order to increase the sensitivity of our analysis we repeated the experiment using multicopy vectors carrying the same constructs (Episomal constructs ERS3 and ERS&#x0002a;, respectively). Again for the wild-type promoter (construct ERS3) a clear pattern of Mnase-induced cuts was obtained which is identical to that observed for the integrated construct, while the ERS&#x0002a; construct fails to produce such a pattern. These data indicate a defined positioning of nucleosomes in the wild-type construct which depends on the presence of a functional Abf1p binding site.</p><p>From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f3">3</xref> it is evident that binding of Abf1p induces two well-defined Mnase hypersensitive sites on either side of its binding site, as well as a regular pattern of sensitive sites and protected regions in the coding regions of both the <italic>GUS</italic> and the <italic>GLN4</italic> gene. The two hypersensitive sites are separated by a region of &#x0223c;130 bp that appears to be protected against Mnase digestion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f3">3</xref>A and B). Although such a small region might reflect a positioned nucleosome, data presented below clearly demonstrate that this is not the case. In the coding regions of the <italic>GLN4</italic> gene and the <italic>GUS</italic> reporter, on the other hand, the protected regions span a distance of 160&#x02013;170 bp that corresponds to the length of DNA that is wrapped around a positioned nucleosome. Thus, nucleosomal arrays spread both downstream and upstream of the <italic>GLN4</italic>-<italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter regions.</p><p>Since our main interest concerns the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter region, the nucleosomal border of the nucleosome located downstream of Abf1p was mapped by primer extension with linear amplification (five cycles). As can be observed (ERS3 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f5">5</xref>), several hypersensitive bands were found which map between positions &#x02013;49 and &#x02013;83 upstream from the ATG. Identical hypersensitive sites were found with the integrated wild-type construct IRS3 (data not shown). We conclude that the first nucleosome downstream of the T-rich element can occupy several different translational positions. The &#x0223c;10 bp periodicity of the main hypersensitive bands (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f5">5</xref>) may suggest rotational phasing of the corresponding nucleosome.</p><p>In conclusion, binding of Abf1p is required to maintain a highly ordered nucleosome organization of the <italic>RPS28A</italic> and the <italic>GLN4</italic> genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of a nucleosome-free region depends upon the T-rich element</title><p>The possible role of the T-rich element in organizing the chromatin structure of the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter was investigated in the same manner as described above. The TS6 mutant, in which the T-rich element has been inactived (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f1">1</xref>B), as well as its wild-type counterpart were introduced into yeast cells on a multicopy vector and subjected to digestion with either Mnase or DNaseI. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f4">4</xref> shows the results of an indirect end-labeling experiment to detect the cleavage sites within the wild-type and mutant promoters (ERS3 and ETS6, respectively). Mnase and DNaseI sites in naked DNA do not differ between these constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f3">3</xref> and data not shown). From these results it is clear that functional inactivation of the T-rich element notably changes the chromatin structure of the downstream region of the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter and the adjacent <italic>GUS</italic> reporter gene, while the upstream region and the <italic>GLN4</italic> gene remain unaffected. In the ETS6 construct the lower one of the two hypersensitive sites is shifted to a position &#x0223c;50 bp closer to the Abf1p site. Since a similar shift has occurred in the pattern of protected and sensitive regions in the coding region of the <italic>GUS</italic> gene, it shows that the entire array of nucleosomes has shifted towards the Abf1p site. As a result of this nucleosomal rearrangement, the 130 bp protected region present in the wild-type ERS3 promoter has decreased to 85 bp in the T-rich element mutant ETS6 (open boxes in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f4">4</xref>). Apparently this region is not protected by a positioned nucleosome and should therefore be considered as a nucleosome-free region.</p><p>The upstream boundary of the nucleosomal array covering the region downstream of the Abf1p site in the ETS6 construct was mapped by primer extension. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f5">5</xref>, the hypersensitive sites that are found in the wild-type ETS3 construct, from &#x02013;83 to &#x02013;49, are protected in the ETS6 construct, and a new set of hypersensitive bands appears between positions &#x02013;145 and &#x02013;107. Hence, inactivation of the T-rich element repositions the first nucleosome downstream of the Abf1p site 50&#x02013;60 bp closer to this site compared to the situation in the wild-type promoter.</p><p>We conclude that inactivation of the T-rich element causes the downstream nucleosomal array as a whole to shift by &#x0223c;50&#x000a0;bp towards the Abf1p site, resulting in loss of the nucleosome-free region downstream of Abf1p.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results reported in this paper shed more light onto the mechanism by which the high efficiency of transcription of yeast rp-genes is attained. Using a fusion between the promoter of the <italic>RPS28A</italic> gene and the <italic>GUS</italic> reporter gene we have performed a mutational analysis that establishes a correlation between the transcriptional activation by the common elements within the rp-gene promoter and the effect of these elements on the local chromatin structure.</p><p>The data presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f1">1</xref> demonstrate that the Abf1p binding site and the T-rich element of the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter are equally important for full transcriptional activity, confirming earlier conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c22">22</xref>). However, substitution of the individual segments of the bipartite T-rich element causes a much smaller reduction in transcriptional activity, showing that even a short T-stretch still has a substantial stimulatory capacity. The extent of the stimulatory activity shows an approximate correlation with the size of the segment; in mutant ITS1, in which the remaining portion of the T-stretch is 9&#x000a0;residues long, transcriptional activity is &#x0223c;65&#x00025; of the wild-type level versus 55&#x00025; in mutant ITS3 having a six residue long T-stretch. Changing the bipartite T-rich element into a 21 residue long homopolymeric T sequence (mutant ITS2), however, did not significantly increase transcription over the wild-type level. This contrasts with the results of Iyer and Struhl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c17">17</xref>), who did observe an increase in transcriptional activity with increasing size of the homopolymeric T-stretch. Thus, the bipartite structure of the T-rich element in the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter might have functional significance.</p><p>Two observations prompted us to analyze the effect of the various mutations in the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter elements on the local chromatin structure. First, we found that deletion of the <italic>DAT1</italic> gene, encoding the only protein so far known to influence transcription by binding specifically to T-rich elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c19">19</xref>), had very little effect on <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter-driven transcription of the <italic>GUS</italic> reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f2">2</xref>). Secondly, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f1">1</xref>, replacement of the two (dA:dT) stretches of the T-rich element, which are thought to form a rigid DNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c27">27</xref>), by similarly rigid stretches of dC:dG (mutant IT<sub>c</sub>) suggests the requirement for structural rigidity of the DNA downstream of Abf1p in order to activate transcription. These two observations make it unlikely that the T-rich element functions as a recognition site for specific transcriptional activator proteins.</p><p>The chromatin structure of the wild-type promoter shows a well-defined organization consisting of a protected region, delineated by two hypersensitive sites, that spans the Abf1p binding site. Several lines of evidence indicate that this protected region of 130 bp does not correspond to a positioned nucleosome: (i) the relatively small size of the region; (ii) the finding that the protected region in DNaseI digests is much smaller, &#x0223c;90 bp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f4">4</xref>); and (iii) the 130 bp protected region present in the wild-type promoter (ERS3) has decreased to a region of &#x0223c;85 bp when the T-rich element is mutated (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f5">5</xref>). Hence, the 130 bp protected region should be considered as the result of two independent protections on either side of the Abf1p binding site. Analysis of the nucleosome organization of the IRS&#x0002a; and ERS&#x0002a; mutants, carrying a non-functional Abf1p binding site, revealed the complete loss of this highly ordered chromatin structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f3">3</xref>). Thus, we conclude that after binding to its recognition site in the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter, Abf1p acts as a strong organizer of chromatin structure both upstream and downstream of the binding site.</p><p>Whereas the organization of nucleosomes into an ordered array is due to the binding of Abf1p, the creation of the nucleosome-free region adjacent to the Abf1p binding site depends upon the presence of the T-rich element. In the ETS6 mutant, which lacks a functional T-rich element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f1">1</xref>), the positioning of the nucleosomal array upstream of the Abf1p binding site, extending into the <italic>GLN4</italic> gene, remains the same as in the wild-type. Downstream of the Abf1p site, however, the array of positioned nucleosomes has shifted towards the Abf1p binding site by &#x0223c;60 bp, thus completely obliterating the nucleosome-free region present in the wild-type <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter. Apparently, Abf1p is not able to create a nucleosome-free region but merely acts as a nucleosomal boundary element.</p><p>High-resolution mapping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f5">5</xref>) shows that the nucleosome-free region extends 35&#x02013;55 bp beyond the T-rich element. Since sequences from 18 bp downstream of the T-rich element are A-rich, having one A<sub>4</sub> and two A<sub>3</sub> stretches, the observed shift of the nucleosome beyond this region may be attributed to nucleosome exclusion properties of both the T-rich element and the A-rich region. Such nucleosome exclusion properties are known for stretches of As and Ts (see Introduction). However, the strong nucleosomal protection of both the core promoter and the A-rich region upon replacement of the T-rich element (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f5">5</xref>), suggests that the nucleosome exclusion properties of the A-rich region are very minor indeed. An alternative explanation for the extended nucleosome-free region at the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter may be that yet unidentified proteins bind downstream of the T-rich element and form a physical boundary for nucleosomes. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> DNase footprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c28">28</xref>) and methylation interference experiments (T.M.Doorenbosch, unpublished data) carried out in our laboratory, indicate the existence of a protein(s), called GDUF, that binds to the region of the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter downstream of the T-rich element between positions &#x02013;108 and &#x02013;87. Since the latter position is very close to the upstream boundary of the nucleosomal array at position &#x02013;83, this factor(s) may form a physical boundary for nucleosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>. So far, however, both the identity of these proteins and their possible role in transcriptional activation remains unclear. Nevertheless, the observation that the nucleosome-free region is completely lost when the T-rich element is mutated consequently suggests that the T-rich element enables binding of these proteins to downstream sequences. This strongly correlates with the observations that homopolymeric (dA:dT) elements increase the accessibility of neighbouring binding sites <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c17">17</xref>). The idea that the T-rich element functions through a similar mechanism to these homopolymeric (dA:dT) elements is further supported by our finding that structurally rigid poly(dC:dG) can functionally replace the poly(dA:dT) sequences of the T-rich element (IT<sub>c</sub> in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f1">1</xref>), suggesting that the T-rich element also functions by virtue of its intrinsic DNA structure and in this manner increases the accessibility of adjacent sequences to additional proteins.</p><p>Even though a T-stretch encompassing as few as six residues can still act in synergism with the Abf1p site to cause substantial transcriptional activation, the fully active T-rich element consists of two stretches of thymidines separated by an A-rich region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f1">1</xref>). This type of alternating sequence is expected to cause bending of the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c30">30</xref>), rather than form the &#x02018;rod-like&#x02019; structure characteristic of homopolymeric sequences. Gel electrophoretic analysis of DNA fragments containing the various wild-type and mutant promoter sequences depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd257f1">1</xref> have indeed revealed differences in mobility that suggest differences in intrinsic DNA bending (data not shown). Abf1p binding, however, also causes the DNA to bend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c31">31</xref>). Altering the phasing between these adjacently positioned DNA-bending elements by insertion of 5 or 10 bp between Abf1p binding site and T-rich element did not significantly affect transcription, neither did insertion of 5 or 10 bp downstream of these elements (data not shown). Apparently, the respective bends in the DNA are not interdependent and are not likely to be involved in, for instance, DNA looping. Alternatively, since any anomalous intrinsic DNA structure may affect the curved path of the DNA around a nucleosome, both the intrinsic DNA-bending properties and the structural rigidity of the thymidine stretches of the T-rich element may contribute in locally affecting DNA&#x02013;nucleosome interactions, similar to the proposed nucleosome destabilizing action of structurally rigid sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd257c17">17</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the data presented in this paper demonstrate that the Abf1p binding site and the T-rich element each play a distinct role in organizing the chromatin structure of an rp-gene promoter and the adjacent coding region. We favour a model in which Abf1p is able to organize chromatin by forming a physical boundary for nucleosomes and the T-rich element subsequently enables binding of other proteins to downstream sequences, creating a nucleosome-free region of &#x0223c;65 bp downstream of the Abf1p binding site.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd257f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Effect of mutations in the Abf1p binding site and T-rich element of the <italic>RPS28A</italic> promoter on transcription of the <italic>GUS</italic> reporter gene &#x0005b;with respect to the <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003b2;-glucuronidase gene (32)&#x0005d;.
