However, the precise molecular mechanism of Raf activation, especially for B-Raf, remains unresolved. By genetic and biochemical studies, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of tyrosine 510 is essential for activation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Raf (Draf), which is an ortholog of mammalian B-Raf. Y510 of Draf is phosphorylated by the c-src homolog Src64B. Acidic substitution of Y510 promotes and phenylalanine substitution impairs Draf activation without affecting its enzymatic activity, suggesting that Y510 plays a purely regulatory role. We further show that Y510 regulates Draf activation by affecting the autoinhibitory interaction between the N- and C-terminal fragments of the protein. Finally, we show that Src64B is required for Draf activation in several developmental processes. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism of Raf activation via Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Since Y510 is a conserved residue in the kinase domain of all Raf proteins, this mechanism is likely evolutionarily conserved.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras signaling pathways control many different biological processes during metazoan development.

However, the kinases responsible for their phosphorylation remain elusive. Interestingly, in B-Raf, the equivalent of S338 is constitutively phosphorylated and the equivalent of Y340/341 are occupied by aspartic acids; consequently, B-Raf exhibits higher basal activity and was shown not to be regulated by Src &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, it has been unclear how B-Raf or Draf are regulated in vivo.</p><p>In an effort to identify potential activators of Draf, we have previously conducted a genetic screen for genes involved in Draf signaling, taking advantage of a <italic>Draf</italic> hypomorphic allele, <italic>Draf<sup>Su2</sup></italic>, which causes partial lethality to flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Draf<sup>Su2</sup></italic> encodes a Draf variant with two point mutations that abolish its Ras-binding ability, making it more sensitive to reductions in Ras-independent Draf activators &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

To determine the role of Src64B in Draf activation in vivo, we genetically and biochemically investigated the function of Src64B in Draf activation. Here, we show that Src64B behaves as a direct Draf activator in vivo. An activated form of Src64B induces Draf target genes in the absence of RTK or Ras in vivo, and associates with and phosphorylates Draf. Moreover, we identified a novel tyrosine (Y510) within the Draf kinase domain that mediates Draf phosphorylation by Src64B in vitro. Interestingly, the role of Y510 appears to be purely regulatory, as mutating it to phenylalanine or glutamate had no significant impact on the enzymatic activity of a Draf kinase domain fragment. However, mutating Y510 to glutamate resulted in activation of full-length Draf and reduced affinity between N- and C-terminal Draf fragments. These results suggest that Y510 phosphorylation plays an essential role in Draf activation by interfering with the association of the C-terminal kinase domain with the inhibitory N-terminal regulatory region.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Src64B Can Function Downstream or in Parallel to Ras1</title><p>To investigate whether Src64B plays a direct role in Draf activation, we first tested whether it can induce Draf activation in the absence of Ras1.

In the inactive state of Raf, Y510 may participate in physical interaction between the N-terminal regulatory domains and the C-terminal kinase domain.

The least-affected RTK pathway is the Torso pathway, which utilizes the same Ras1/Draf signaling cassette to specify the embryonic terminal structures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in none of the above mutant combinations did we detect defects in the Torso pathway (unpublished data). Thus, genetic studies based on a partial loss-of-function <italic>Src64B</italic> allele, <italic>Src64B<sup>&#x00394;17</sup></italic>, suggest a differential threshold requirement for Src64B function in the following biological processes: ring canal formation &#x0003e; egg chamber dorsoventral polarity &#x0003e; R7 specification &#x0003e; embryonic termini formation. Since Draf<sup>Y510F</sup> poorly rescued the terminal structure in <italic>torso</italic> null embryos, tyrosine phosphorylation on Y510 could be conferred by protein kinases other than Src64B.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Possible Redundancy of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Src Family Tyrosine Kinases</title><p>It is possible that Src64B is functionally redundant with other cytosolic tyrosine kinases such as Src42A and Tec29A. This may explain the subtle phenotypes of Src64B mutant alleles. Src42A is another Src homolog in the fly genome. Outside of the Src family, Tec kinases are mostly homologous to Src kinases. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Tec29A has been identified that functions downstream from Src64B during oogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, Tec29A is also a potential Draf activator &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. It is thus an interesting scenario that these three tyrosine kinases may function redundantly in phosphorylating and activating Draf. However, it has been shown that the kinase activity of Src42A is not crucial for mediating RTK signaling, as overexpression of either a wild-type or kinase-dead form of Src42A equally induces hyperactivation of RTK signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. It has recently been shown that a kinase-independent scaffolding function of Src42A regulates Draf by a novel CNK-dependent derepression mechanism, and Src64B does not share such a function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, Src64B and Src42A may have overlapping as well as distinct functions, and further investigation is required to determine how these tyrosine kinases are involved in Draf signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly strains and genetics.</title><p>The following strong or null alleles were used in this study: <italic>torso<sup>XR1</sup></italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Ras1<sup>&#x00394;C40B</sup></italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Draf<sup>11&#x02212;29</sup></italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Draf<sup>C110</sup></italic>, <italic>Draf<sup>Su2</sup></italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Src64B<sup>&#x00394;17</sup></italic>, and <italic>Src64B<sup>PI</sup></italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060128-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Egfr<sup>f2</sup></italic>, <italic>sev-Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> (on a TM3 balancer chromosome), <italic>Nanos-Gal4</italic> (on X), <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> (on the second chromosome), and <italic>hsp70-Gal4</italic> are from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center.
