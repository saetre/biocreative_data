The significance of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP-1) in <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> pulmonary infection and innate immune response was investigated in cIAP-1 knockout (KO) mice using a novel non-invasive intra-tracheal infection method. In contrast to wildtype, cIAP-1 knockout mice failed to clear the infection from their lungs. Wildtype mice responded to infection with a strong inflammatory response in the lung. In contrast, the recruitment of macrophages was reduced in cIAP-1 KO mice compared to wildtype mice. The concentration of Interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) was increased whereas that of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-&#x003b1;) was reduced in the lungs of infected cIAP-1 KO mice compared to infected wildtype mice. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> experiments on mouse peritoneal macrophages and splenocytes revealed that cIAP-1 is required for innate immune responses of these cells.

Because cIAP-1 has been implicated in the control of apoptosis, we investigated the effect of these treatments on the induction of apoptosis in wildtype and mutant macrophages. Since none of the treatments elicited a significant increase in the apoptotic population or affected the viability of treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006519.s004">Fig. S3</xref>), the reduced production of NO by mutant macrophages in response to certain stimuli was not due to increased cell death in these cases.

Since cIAP-1 KO macrophages were clearly affected in their production of TNF-&#x003b1; and NO, we expected an increased resistance of these mice to endotoxin-induced toxicities. We therefore determined the dose of lethal endotoxin-induced shock in wildtype and cIAP-1 KO mice. Wildtype mice died in a dose-dependent fashion; for example, a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight of bacterial LPS evoked 100&#x00025; mortality within 96 h post induction of shock in wildtype mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006519-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>).

To test whether cIAP-1 affects the infection efficiency, macrophages from wildtype and cIAP-1 KO animals were infected and the inclusions were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy.

We observed the up-regulation of cIAP-2 in lung tissue, but not in macrophages of cIAP-1 knockout mice. Due to the clear phenotype of the cIAP-1 knockout mice, we postulate a non-redundant role of cIAP-1 in chlamydial lung infection. This does not exclude a function of cIAP-2 in chlamydial lung infection since both may be organized in functional complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006519-Rajalingam2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> infection induces secretion of inflammatory mediators like IFN-&#x003b3; in host macrophages, which is crucial for their anti-bacterial defense via induction of TNF-&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006519-Rottenberg1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. It was therefore expect that increased titers of IFN-&#x003b3; in the lungs of infected cIAP-1 KO mice results in the increased production of TNF-&#x003b1;. However, infected cIAP-1 KO mice had lower TNF-&#x003b1; titers than wildtype mice. This could be due to either the depletion of alveolar macrophages or their reduced recruitment to the lungs of infected cIAP-1 KO mice. These assumptions are supported by our comparative histo-pathological analyses of lungs from infected KO and wildtype animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006519-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found an increased sensitivity of cIAP-1 KO macrophages for high concentrations of TNF-&#x003b1; <italic>in vitro</italic> (not shown) compared to macrophages from wildtype animals.

Interestingly, this effect was not observed if macrophages were treated with IFN-&#x003b3; suggesting that cIAP-1 is involved in specific signaling pathways leading to the generation of NO. The block in NO production in cIAP-1 KO macrophages is probably upstream of iNOS induction since inducers which triggered a cIAP-1-dependent increase in NO (LPS, TNF-&#x003b1;) also induced iNOS expression. However, stimulation of NO in wildtype and cIAP-1 KO macrophages by IFN-&#x003b3; remained comparable and redundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006519-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), indicative of cIAP-1-independent stimulation of NO by IFN-&#x003b3;.
