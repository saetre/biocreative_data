In this report, we determine the exact sites of pausing and analyze the structure of the ternary complex by footprint techniques. Under synchronized transcription initiation conditions in vitro, three closely-spaced transcription pause sites were identified. These pause sites appeared downstream of the first region of dyad symmetry, which encodes an RNA hairpin in the transcript, and occurred at positions G112, G114 and A116 of the thr leader RNA. The results showed that the half-life of the thr paused complexes at G112 and G114 could be enhanced by limiting the concentration of the nucleoside triphosphate GTP in the transcription reactions. In addition, the half-life of the paused complexes was shown to increase in the presence of NusA protein. The thr leader complex that paused immediately before residues G112 and G114 of the nascent transcript was isolated and its structure was analyzed with enzymatic and chemical cleavage reagents. The footprinting studies using DNase I showed that there were approximately 35 nucleotides on both strands of the DNA that were protected by RNA polymerase from DNase I cleavage. The DNA segment protected by RNA polymerase is approximately 19 nucleotides upstream and 14 nucleotides downstream of the pause sites. The results from hydroxyl radical footprints also showed a similar pattern of protection at the transcription pause sites. However, no significant differences in the footprinting patterns were observed in the presence or absence of NusA protein.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0306-a" xlink:role="1674"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0307-a" xlink:role="1675"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0307-b" xlink:role="1675"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0308-a" xlink:role="1676"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0308-b" xlink:role="1676"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0309-a" xlink:role="1677"/></fig><fig id="F7"><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0309-b" xlink:role="1677"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0303.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1671"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0304.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1672"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0305.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1673"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0306.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1674"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0307.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1675"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0308.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1676"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0309.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1677"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0310.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1678"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0311.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1679"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00243-0312.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1680"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
