The relationship between ABA and ethylene during ripening was also investigated. Among six sampling times in tomato fruits, the <italic>LeNCED1</italic> gene was highly expressed only at the breaker stage when the ABA content becomes high. After this, the <italic>LeACS2</italic>, <italic>LeACS4</italic>, and <italic>LeACO1</italic> genes were expressed with some delay. The change in pattern of ACO activity was in accordance with ethylene production reaching its peak at the pink stage. The maximum ABA content preceded ethylene production in both the seeds and the flesh. The peak value of ABA, ACC, and ACC oxidase activity, and ethylene production all started to increase earlier in seeds than in flesh tissues, although they occurred at different ripening stages. Exogenous ABA treatment increased the ABA content in both flesh and seed, inducing the expression of both ACS and ACO genes, and promoting ethylene synthesis and fruit ripening, while treatment with fluridone or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) inhibited them, delaying fruit ripening and softening. Based on the results obtained in this study, it was concluded that <italic>LeNCED1</italic> initiates ABA biosynthesis at the onset of fruit ripening, and might act as an original inducer, and ABA accumulation might play a key role in the regulation of ripeness and senescence of tomato fruit.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ABA</kwd><kwd>ethylene</kwd><kwd>fruit ripening</kwd><kwd><italic>LeACS2</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>LeACO1</italic></kwd><kwd>NCED gene</kwd><kwd>tomato</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) not only plays a regulatory role in plant growth and development, in seed dormancy, and in the adaptation of plants to stress conditions, but also displays a pattern of change similar to ethylene at late stages of fruit development. Some scholars considered that ABA had a crucial role, perhaps even more crucial role than that of ethylene, in fruit maturation and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giovannoni, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rodrigo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). To date, the ripening mechanism of climacteric fruit, especially the effect of ethylene, has been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Grierson, 2002</xref>). However, the mechanism involved in the ripening of non-climacteric fruits remains unclear, despite similar research efforts being made. The two types of fruits exhibit the same ripening phenomena in terms of colour and texture, with only a difference in ethylene production. Therefore, it is assumed that an upstream gene for ethylene expression should exist in controlling fruit ripening of both fruit types.</p><p>On the other hand, tomato has proved to be an excellent model system for the analysis of fruit ripening and development, in part due to the availability of well characterized ripening mutants. The ripening inhibitor (<italic>rin</italic>) and non-ripening (<italic>nor</italic>) mutants are deficient in climacteric respiration and the associated burst peak in ethylene biosynthesis. Application of exogenous ethylene does not promote fruit ripening, yet it does induce expression of ethylene-regulated ripening genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tigchelaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), which indicated that in addition to general ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, upstream of ethylene there may be other ethylene-independent regulatory factors for climacteric fruit maturation. ABA can be considered as the other ripening control factor, because the ABA content is very low in unripe fruit but increases during the process of fruit ripening in both climacteric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vendrell and Buesa, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buesa <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>) and non-climacteric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coombe, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kojima, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kondo, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">1998</xref>) fruits.

Recently, it was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galpaz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) that the ABA content in ABA-deficient mutants is 75% lower than the normal level. Because of this, both the plant and fruit did not show the normal growth observed in the wild type; the total fruit weight and average fruit weight in ABA-deficient mutant fruits were reduced compared with wild-type fruit, and the plant weight was 50% lower in the ABA-deficient plant than in the wild type, indicating that ABA was not only required for plant growth, but was also indispensable for fruit development and ripening. The degreening stage of ABA-deficient orange mutants started later than that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rodrigo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and the sensitivity to ethylene of ABA-deficient orange mutants was also weaker than that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alferez and Zacarias, 1999</xref>), which indicated that plants could not grow normally if there was insufficient ABA available.</p><p>There is now biochemical and genetic evidence showing that 9-<italic>cis</italic>-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) is the key enzyme of the ABA biosynthesis pathway in higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burbidge <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iuchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).

Moreover, fruit ripening in both <italic>rin</italic> and <italic>nor</italic>, ripening-impaired tomato mutants, was not induced by exogenous ethylene treatment, although the expression of some ripening-associated genes is induced by ethylene treatment in both mutant fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lanahan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giovannoni, 2001</xref>).

However, the content of ABA increases during the ripening of respiratory climacteric fruits such as apples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scriren and Wills, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kondo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>), peaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Looney <italic>et al.</italic>, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsuchida, 1990</xref>), and pears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rudnicki <italic>et al.</italic>, 1968</xref>). In this study, endogenous ABA accumulated before ethylene production in tomatoes. The results suggested that it is endogenous ABA, but not ethylene, that is critical for the onset of ripening, while the role of ethylene is limited to later ripening stages. The results indicated that exogenous ABA accelerated fruit ripening and, in contrast, fluridone treatment delayed the ripening by inhibiting ABA.</p><p>The production of ethylene was triggered by applying ABA to tomato fruits during the ripening stage, which indicated that increasing ABA to a certain level in the fruit could promote the transformation of ACC to ethylene and result in a series of physiological and biochemical responses that facilitate fruit ripening. Thus, it was proposed that ABA may act at upstream metabolic events of ethylene action/perception and initiate the ripening process by inhibiting or activating general metabolic events. In addition, ABA might induce the expression of non-ethylene-dependent genes and initiate the ripening process in respiratory climacteric fruits.</p><p>Since 1-MCP effectively blocks ethylene receptors and represses ethylene-mediated effects in plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sisler and Serek, 1997</xref>), it was used to study ethylene-regulated processes during later ripening in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). The result showed that fruit ripening and softening were effectively inhibited by 1-MCP treatment, although ABA was fully biosynthesized by exogenous ABA stimulation. These results indicate that ABA plays an important role in fruit ripening, and ethylene is more important for later ripening stages.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of exogenous ABA, fluridone, and NDGA on ABA accumulation, ethylene synthesis, and fruit ripening</title><p>In higher plants, ABA is formed by oxidative cleavage of epoxicarotenoids, such as neoxanthin and violaxanthin. Fluridone specifically inhibits the biosynthesis of epoxicarotenoid, and thus is considered as an effective inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartels and Watson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rasmussen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Fluridone inhibits phytoene desaturase, which converts phytoene to phytofluene in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. Since carotenoids are the precursors of ABA in plants, carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors should also prevent the biosynthesis of ABA. The results in this study showed that exogenous applications of ABA to mature green fruit could induce ethylene synthesis, accelerated fruit colouring, and accelerated softening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In contrast, treating the fruits with fluridone led to an obvious reduction of endogenous ABA and impeded fruit maturity and softening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figs 4&#x02013;6</xref>). Because colour change and fruit softening are dependent on both the presence and perception of ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blankenship and Sisler, 1993</xref>), the results suggest that ABA has a direct effect on ethylene synthesis although fluridone could not completely block ABA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). In order to block ABA accumulation fully, NDGA was used in the test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). NDGA is now emerging as a useful compound to study ABA function in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Creelman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). Preliminary tests showed that NDGA was an ideal inhibitor of the NCED enzyme with regard to its permeating speed and ability to block ABA biosynthesis. ABA accumulation in detached mature green tomato is very sensitive to NDGA. Because a concentration of 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M could totally block ABA accumulation, it was then used for the assessment of the role of ABA. There are two ways for NDGA to inhibit ABA accumulation: one is to inhibit the expression of ABA synthase genes at the transcriptional level while the other is to inhibit synthase activities at the post-transcriptional level, or both. The results of northern analysis of ABA synthase genes showed that the expression of <italic>LeNCED1</italic> was not influenced by NDGA compared with the control samples. This indicates that the blocked ABA accumulation caused by NDGA was due to its direct inhibition of the synthase activities at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, ABA accumulation was totally blocked by 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M NDGA, but ethylene production increased &#x0223c;12&#x02009;d after NDGA treatment, suggesting that fluridone or NDGA were acting only during a limited period of time, and the increase of ethylene and fruit ripening at later stages could be explained by a cessation of the effectiveness of fluridone or NDGA with time after treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, a relationship between ABA and ethylene during ripening and senescence was indicated in the tomato fruit: (i) the expression of the ABA biosynthetic gene (<italic>LeNCED1</italic>) occurs before that of ethylene biosynthesis genes; (ii) ABA content also preceded the climacteric increase in ethylene production; (iii) ABA may induce ethylene biosynthesis via the regulation of ACS and ACO gene expression; (iv) exogenous ABA accelerates fruit ripening, and fluridone or NDGA treatment delayed fruit ripening by inhibition of ABA; and (v) ethylene plays a key role in the later stages of fruit ripening.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was
