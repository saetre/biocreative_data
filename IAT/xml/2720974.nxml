Several years ago, the three-dimensional structures of the YbaB orthologs of both <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>H. influenzae </italic>were determined, revealing a novel "tweezer"-like structure.

This distinctive structure that has been described as resembling a set of tweezers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although the researchers who initially characterized YbaB<sub>Hi </sub>speculated that it may be a DNA-binding protein, studies conducted at that time failed to detect binding to any of their analyzed DNA probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>chromosome carries an orthologous gene that has been referred to as "ORF 12" (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>YbaB (YbaB<sub>Ec</sub>) has also been crystallized and information about its unpublished three-dimensional structure is available on-line <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1PUG">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1PUG</ext-link>. The determined structures of YbaB<sub>Ec </sub>and YbaB<sub>Hi </sub>are nearly identical. A function for YbaB<sub>Ec </sub>appears not to have been investigated prior to the current work.</p><p>The spirochete <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi </italic>produces a protein named EbfC that shares 29% identical and 56% similar amino acids with YbaB<sub>Hi </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Those results suggested that orthologous proteins may also be DNA-binding proteins. We therefore re-examined the properties of YbaB<sub>Hi</sub>, and found that it does bind to certain DNAs. YbaB<sub>Ec </sub>was also demonstrated to be a DNA-binding protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The abilities of YbaB<sub>Ec </sub>and YbaB<sub>Hi </sub>to bind DNA were first tested using a labeled DNA probe corresponding to sequences surrounding <italic>B. burgdorferi erpAB </italic>Operator 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This DNA was chosen because the <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>YbaB ortholog, EbfC, binds specifically to sequences within that region of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Both the <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>H. influenzae </italic>orthologs bound this DNA probe, each forming multiple DNA-protein complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The simplest interpretation of these data is that each ladder of gel bands represents a stoichiometric series with higher stoichiometry (lower mobility) products formed from lower stoichiometry (higher mobility) precursors as protein concentration is increased. Similar patterns have been reported for other molecular systems (e.g., lac repressor-DNA complexes and CAP-DNA complexes) for which this interpretation has been found to be correct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The EMSA assay does not provide information about the nature of the macromolecular interactions that stabilize each protein-DNA complex. Thus while the formation of the first complex must involve protein-DNA contacts, the interactions that stabilize higher-order complexes may include protein-protein contacts or protein-DNA contacts or both. The simplest model, and the one we favor, is one in which similar mechanisms direct the binding of each protein unit to DNA or pre-existing protein-DNA complex. Affinity data for the first two binding steps (described below) are consistent with this picture, but do not rule out more heterogeneous binding mechanisms.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Nucleotide sequences (5' to 3') of DNA probes used for EMSA in these studies, based on the operator 2 sequences of <italic>B. burgdorferi erpAB </italic></bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

These data are consistent with models in which 2 molecules of YbaB<sub>Hi </sub>bind free DNA to form the first complex, and in which the second binding step involves the concerted binding of 2 additional YbaB<sub>Hi </sub>molecules. For these binding models, the association constants for the first and second binding steps are K<sub>a,1 </sub>= 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>13 </sup>M<sup>-2 </sup>and K<sub>a,2 </sub>= 3.0 &#x000b1; 1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>12 </sup>M<sup>-2</sup>. Assuming equipartition of binding free energies, these values correspond to apparent, monomer-equivalent dissociation constants K<sub>d,1 </sub>= 2.4 &#x000b1; 0.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7 </sup>M and K<sub>d,2 </sub>= 5.8 &#x000b1; 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7 </sup>M. These values indicate that the two best YbaB<sub>HI </sub>binding sites on this DNA are of nearly equal affinity; the ~2-fold difference in affinity between first and second binding steps is just what would be expected on a statistical basis for independent binding to identical sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Parallel measurements were made for the binding of YbaB<sub>Ec </sub>to the b-WT DNA fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These data also indicate that 2 molecules of YbaB<sub>Ec </sub>bound free DNA to form the first complex and two more bound to form the second complex. The association constants for the first and second binding steps are K<sub>a,1 </sub>= 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>14 </sup>M<sup>-2 </sup>and K<sub>a,2 </sub>= 2.9 &#x000b1; 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>13 </sup>M<sup>-2</sup>. Assuming equipartition of binding free energies as before, these correspond to monomer-equivalent dissociation constants K<sub>d,1 </sub>= 7.7 &#x000b1; 0.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-8 </sup>M and K<sub>d,2 </sub>= 1.9 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7 </sup>M. As with the <italic>H. influenzae </italic>protein, the ~2-fold difference in affinity is what would be expected for independent binding to two identical sites. We note that these binding constants reflect binding under our standard <italic>in vitro </italic>conditions and should not be interpreted to represent the corresponding affinities for binding <italic>in vivo</italic>. None of our binding data suggests that either protein can bind DNA as a monomer. YbaB<sub>Hi </sub>and YbaB<sub>Ec </sub>proteins crystallized as dimers, and both previous sedimentation analyses and our gel filtration analyses indicated that YbaB<sub>Hi </sub>exists primarily as a homodimer in solution [data not shown and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]]. Taken together, these data indicate that the homodimer is the basic unit of DNA-binding activity for this family of proteins.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of stoichiometries and affinities of YbaB<sub>Ec </sub>and YbaB<sub>Hi </sub>binding to b-WT DNA</bold>.

Many bacterial <italic>ybaB/ebfC </italic>orthologs are located between <italic>dnaX </italic>and <italic>recR</italic>, a synteny that has led to suggestions of roles in DNA replication or recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. While the abilities of the examined orthologs to bind DNA may support those hypotheses, several lines of evidence suggest that YbaB/EbfC proteins perform functions that are independent of DNA recombination or replication. Proteomic analyses of cultured <italic>H. influenzae </italic>detected production of YbaB without accompanying production of DNA repair proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A <italic>ybaB recR </italic>double mutant of <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor </italic>exhibited recombination defects that could be complemented with <italic>recR </italic>alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The <italic>ybaB/ebfC </italic>orthologs of some bacterial species are not linked to <italic>recR </italic>or any other recombination-related gene and some, such as the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, do not even encode RecR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Several bacteria, such as <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, have <italic>ybaB </italic>genes located distantly from their <italic>dnaX </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

It exhibits an element of specificity, in that the protein preferentially bound to <italic>B. burgdorferi erp </italic>Operator 2 DNA over poly-dI-dC and, apparently, the DNA sequences examined by an earlier research group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Consistent with those data, the <italic>E. coli </italic>YbaB ortholog was also determined to be a DNA-binding protein. For both orthologs, the basic unit of DNA-binding is a homodimer, consistent with results from analyses of soluble proteins and crystallization data. The solved structures of YbaB<sub>Ec </sub>and YbaB<sub>Hi </sub>are distinct from any other known DNA-binding protein. Genes encoding orthologs of YbaB/EbfC proteins are found throughout the Eubacteria, including many important human pathogens, suggesting that these proteins perform important function(s). Thus, continued study of these unique proteins may provide insight regarding critical bacterial processes that might be exploited for infection control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial gene sequences</title><p>Bacterial protein sequences orthologous to YbaB<sub>Hi</sub>, YbaB<sub>Ec </sub>and <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>EbfC were identified by BlastP, using the predicted sequences of those three proteins as queries <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>.
