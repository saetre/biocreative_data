However, this gene gives rise to three species of glycophorin A mRNA of sizes about 1.0, 1.7 and 2.8 kilobases in reticulocytes, foetal liver cells and erythroleukaemic K562 cells. In an investigation of how the three mRNAs originated, we showed by primer extension analysis that all three mRNAs in K562 cells had identical 5' termini and, by nucleotide sequencing of correlated cDNAs, that they had identical coding regions, except for the well-known glycophorin AM-AN polymorphism. However, we found also by sequencing the cDNAs that the mRNAs apparently differed from each other in the lengths of their 3' untranslated regions. This was confirmed by Northern blot analysis which also provided evidence that the three mRNAs originated by use of different polyadenylation signals of which seven were found in the longest cDNA we analyzed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0218-a" xlink:role="5830"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0221-a" xlink:role="5833"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0221-b" xlink:role="5833"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0217.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5829"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0218.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5830"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0219.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5831"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0220.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5832"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0221.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5833"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0222.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5834"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0223.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5835"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0224.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5836"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
