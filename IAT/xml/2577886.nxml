Therefore, lesions in transient single-strand stretches of chromosomal DNA are expected to be especially threatening to genome stability. To test this hypothesis, we designed systems in budding yeast that could generate many kilobases of persistent single-strand DNA next to double-strand breaks or uncapped telomeres. The systems allowed controlled restoration to the double-strand state after applying DNA damage. We found that lesions induced by UV-light and methyl methanesulfonate can be tolerated in long single-strand regions and are hypermutagenic. The hypermutability required PCNA monoubiquitination and was largely attributable to translesion synthesis by the error-prone DNA polymerase &#x003b6;. In support of multiple lesions in single-strand DNA being a source of hypermutability, analysis of the UV-induced mutants revealed strong strand-specific bias and unexpectedly high frequency of alleles with widely separated multiple mutations scattered over several kilobases. Hypermutability and multiple mutations associated with lesions in transient stretches of long single-strand DNA may be a source of carcinogenesis and provide selective advantage in adaptive evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A variety of error avoidance mechanisms assure low mutation rates across the genome. Genetic defects in DNA replication or repair can lead to genome-wide increase in mutation frequency that may result in cancer predisposition and genetic disease. Transient localized hypermutability drastically differs in its biological consequences from genome-wide mutators. Since genome-wide hypermutability can cause reduced fitness due to accumulation of dysfunctional alleles, mutators are under negative selection pressure. By contrast, there would be less selection against temporary hypermutability within limited genomic regions, suggesting a special role in adaptive evolution and carcinogenesis. Mechanisms of transient hypermutability are poorly understood. Long stretches of single-strand DNA have been implicated but not demonstrated as a source of localized transient hypermutability. Using sophisticated yeast genetic systems that we developed, we found that transient stretches of chromosomal single-strand DNA at double-strand breaks and that telomeres can tolerate multiple lesions and are highly prone to damage-induced mutations, including a very unusual class of widely spaced multiple mutations. The hypermutability relied on error prone translesion DNA synthesis. Our work demonstrates a simple in vivo mechanism for localized transient hypermutability extending over several kilobases that can result in widely spaced multiple mutations without severe mutation load in the rest of the genome.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate DNA synthesis and repair of DNA lesions assure low rates of mutation.

High mutation frequencies during transient hypermutability might contribute to overall population mutability and could represent a prominent source of multiple mutations important for evolution and cancer.

While the mechanisms remain to be explained, transient stretches of single-strand (ss) DNA have often been proposed as intermediates in hypermutation. Extended regions of ssDNA would be expected in association with DSBs and with dysfunctional uncapped telomeres, where many kilobases of ssDNA can be formed by 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; resection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Harrison1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Lydall1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The genome would be expected to be especially vulnerable to lesions in ssDNA since repair mechanisms such as base-excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER) and post-replication repair (PRR) operate only in double-strand (ds) DNA. Restoration of damaged ssDNA to a ds-state would be expected to require translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases that are tolerant of lesions in a template and are often error-prone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Friedberg1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> due to misincorporation during synthesis past lesions.</p><p>While error-prone restoration of damaged long stretches of ssDNA to dsDNA might explain many examples of transient hypermutability, this hypothesis has yet to be substantiated. Long tracts of ssDNA formed at DSBs and uncapped telomeres (and potentially in other cell contexts) are known to cause checkpoint responses, where the fate of the cell is determined by a balance of arrest, adaptation, recovery and repair processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Harrison1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Harper1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Longhese1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Direct estimates of extent of damage tolerance and amounts of damage-induced mutations in ssDNA formed in a chromosomal context are required to establish that damage in long ssDNA actually leads to hypermutability rather than to cell death. We, therefore, designed systems in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> for the generation of defined, persistent long stretches of transient ssDNA in the vicinity of a unique DSB or an uncapped chromosomal telomere. Lesions could be induced in the ssDNA before restoration to dsDNA. The consequences of restoration could be assessed with genetic reporters located within the regions that give rise to ssDNA. We demonstrate here that damage tolerance in stretches of long ssDNA formed at DSBs and uncapped telomeres results in extremely high frequencies of single and widely-separated multiple mutations caused by two major types of DNA damaging agents.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DNA Damage Amplifies Hypermutability Associated with DSB Repair</title><p>Recently, we demonstrated that, following the induction of a DSB in a yeast chromosome by the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I site-specific endonuclease, there is 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; resection extending up to 20 kb from the break, after which repair can be mediated by a short oligonucleotide spanning the region of repair around DSB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Storici1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, we sought to estimate the actual frequencies of mutation per kilobase based on truncated Poisson distribution as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Drake2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000264-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s015">Table S15</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s019">Text S1</xref>). To estimate the probability of mutation it is necessary to know what fraction of all (single and multiple) mutant alleles result in loss of function. The fraction is expected to be smallest for single mutations and increase with multiplicity, thus multiple mutations would provide more accurate estimates of mutation probability. Therefore, for each set of data two types of calculations were developed based only on alleles with multiple mutations as well as based on the entire experimental distributions as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s015">Table S15</xref>. While both calculations gave comparable results, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000264-t001">Table 1</xref> presents calculations based on multiple mutations. Each truncated Poisson distribution was calculated with two assumptions: all alleles included in a calculation lead to loss of function and the probability of mutation is the same for all survivors. The range of calculated densities of UV-induced mutations was 0.8&#x02013;2.2 per target (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s015">Table S15</xref>). In the case of hypermutability associated with uncapped telomere arrest we obtained a direct estimate of the mutation density. For that purpose we sequenced the1848 nt <italic>NPR2</italic> ORF located in the immediate vicinity of a telomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000264-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We looked for the presence <italic>npr2</italic> mutations in the subsets of UV-induced <italic>lys2</italic> mutants that originated from the G1 and G2-arrested <italic>cdc13-1</italic> cells. There were no <italic>npr2</italic> mutations associated with 9 <italic>lys2</italic> mutants originating from UV-irradiated G1-cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s011">Table S11</xref>); however, we found 8 mutations in the <italic>npr2</italic> ORFs of the 12 UV-induced <italic>lys2</italic> mutants associated with uncapped telomere arrest (P&#x0003c;0.02). The density of mutations in <italic>NPR2</italic> derived from this direct measurement is 0.36 mutations per kb, which is close to the density of mutations in the more distant telomere <italic>LYS2</italic> calculated on the basis of truncated Poisson distribution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000264-t001">Table 1</xref>). The fit between the experimental numbers of multiple mutants and the numbers expected from truncated Poisson distributions was high (0.4&#x0003c;P(<sub>&#x003c7;</sub><sup>2</sup>)&#x0003c;0.9) indicating that the mutations were independent and that there was no preferential loss of ssDNA molecules with higher density of damage within the population of damaged molecules. However, the relative survival of damaged <italic>vs</italic> undamaged ssDNA remains to be established using systems that would provide synchronous generation of ssDNA by 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; resection in all cells (such as site-specific DSB caused by inducible HO-endonuclease).</p><p>Extrapolations of the calculated mutation densities yielded probabilities of 0.55&#x02013;0.88 that cells contain at least one mutation (P<sub>mut</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1&#x02212;P<sub>0</sub>). This is 10 to 100 times greater than the observed frequencies of UV-induced mutants associated with DSB repair or uncapped telomere arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000264-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000264-g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s003">S3</xref>). This discrepancy could be explained if there is a high likelihood of UV-induced mutants not being detected and/or by a non-uniform distribution of UV-induced mutability among cells. The latter would be expected if UV-induced hypermutability in ssDNA is associated with variable amounts of 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; resection. In this case the extremely high likelihood of mutation would be a feature of only a small fraction of survivors where resected DNA extended through the reporter at the time of UV-irradiation. Regardless of the reason for the discrepancy, the high incidence of multiple mutant alleles provides evidence for exceptionally high levels of UV-induced hypermutability associated with DSB repair or uncapped telomere arrest.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Strand Bias of UV-Induced Single and Multiple Mutations Identifies Stretches of ssDNA Associated with DSB-Repair and Uncapped Telomere Arrest as a Source of Hypermutability</title><p>The primary products of UV-damage as well as sources of mutations are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts resulting from covalent linkages of adjacent pyrimidines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Pfeifer1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

The lower incidence of multiple mutations could be due to the size of the ORF (804 nt, <italic>URA3</italic>; 1773 nt, <italic>CAN1</italic>), a potentially lower probability of <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation by mutations as well as to more distant location from a DSB than <italic>CAN1</italic>.

For the case of the induced DSB, the continuous ssDNA regions would have to be &#x0003e;6.3 kb (distance between the DSB-<italic>cen</italic> and the 5&#x02032;-end of <italic>URA3</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000264-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and &#x0003e;6.4 kb for the uncapped telomere (distance between the Tel-<italic>de novo</italic> and the 5&#x02032;-end of <italic>LYS2</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000264-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The continuity of subtelomeric hypermutable regions can also be derived from the observed multiple, strand-biased UV-induced mutations in <italic>NPR2</italic> and <italic>LYS2</italic> (previous section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s012">Table S12</xref>). These observations strongly support the view that the hypermutable region is created by 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; resection starting at the telomere and extending through both ORFs. Altogether, the strong strand bias of UV-induced single and multiple mutations demonstrates that long stretches of damaged ssDNA are the source of mutagenesis and that the ssDNA can be successfully restored to the ds-state even if it contains multiple lesions.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Role of Translesion Synthesis in Hypermutability Associated with ssDNA</title><p>To address the mechanism(s) of mutation during restoration of damaged ssDNA to complete chromosomes, we investigated the roles of genes involved in translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and post-replication repair (PRR) on mutagenesis associated with DSB-repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000264-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000264-g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s002">S2</xref>).</p><p>Similar to the other forms of damage-induced mutagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Friedberg1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, hypermutability associated with DSB-repair required the translesion polymerase (Pol &#x003b6;.

Similar to findings by Jeff Strathern and co-authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Rattray1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, spontaneous hypermutability associated with DSB-repair was also reduced 2&#x02013;30 fold by inactivation of Pol &#x003b6; mediated translesion synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000264-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000264-g003">3</xref>). Possibly there is damage to ssDNA prior to DSB repair that results in spontaneous hypermutability.</p><p>We considered the possible contribution of greater variability and apparent overall reduction in transformation frequencies, regardless of DNA damage, to these results. For example, if transformants arose through recombination between unbroken chromosomal DNA and oligonucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Storici2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, then there would be little contribution of ssDNA to mutagenesis. However, we found that most transformants were indeed associated with DSB repair. In experiments involving MMS treatment of the various mutants, the DSB-induced transformation frequencies were 30- to 1000-fold higher than found with the wild type no-DSB controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000264.s002">Table S2</xref>).

However, since even for the 2-fold increase at least 50&#x00025; of the transformants could be assigned to events associated with oligonucleotide mediated DSB repair, drastic effects of TLS mutations on reductions in mutagenesis could be detected.</p><p>Similar to the observations with DSB-repair associated mutagenesis, the UV-induced hypermutability of <italic>LYS2</italic> associated with uncapped telomere arrest depended on the translesion Pol &#x003b6; (<italic>REV3</italic>) and was not affected by elimination of Pol &#x003b6; (<italic>RAD30</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000264-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Lesions in ssDNA along with ssDNA itself were hypermutable and hypermutability relied on TLS Pol &#x003b6;. We established the involvement of a ssDNA intermediate in transient hypermutability based on the strand-biased spectrum of UV-induced single and multiple mutations. Importantly, strand biased multiple mutations provide a useful tool for detecting in vivo mutagenesis in single molecules containing long stretches of damaged ssDNA. UV or any other mutagen with a bias towards certain DNA bases would create a permanent signature of strand-biased multiple mutations in chromosomal regions containing long stretches of ssDNA at the time of acute induction of lesions. Importantly, the density of UV-induced mutations was estimated to be &#x0223c;1 per 1.5&#x02013;3 kb, which is comparable to the density of pyrimidines dimers induced by UV as determined in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Wheatcroft1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Resnick1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we conclude that many UV-lesions in ssDNA directly result in mutations during the DNA synthesis that leads to chromosome restoration. Based on the similarity in genetic controls and responses to UV and MMS, we propose that there is a general phenomenon whereby lesions in long ssDNA tracts lead to hypermutagenesis. Remarkably, the mutation frequencies can reach 0.4&#x02013;0.8 per kb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000264-t001">Table 1</xref>). This is comparable to the very high frequencies found for somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Odegard1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Since survival in our experiments is high and the mutation load in the rest of the genome is low, we anticipate that damage-induced localized hypermutability associated with ssDNA can achieve extremely high levels.</p><p>Transient long stretches of ssDNA can form in several ways. Tens of kilobases of ssDNA can be formed in yeast by 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; resection at site-specific DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Harrison1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and uncapped telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Lydall1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, we found that ssDNA is also formed by resection at random DSBs induced by ionizing radiation (J. Westmoreland, W. Ma and M. Resnick, unpublished). Also, there are strong indications of ssDNA formation at DSBs in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-BekkerJensen1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000264-Sartori1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Since delays in DSB-repair or in telomere recapping would increase the time of exposure and the length of ssDNA tract, resulting in hypermutability, it will be important to identify factors responsible for coordination of steps in DSB-repair and/or telomere maintenance. These factors would suppress the potential for hypermutability associated with ssDNA.</p><p>In addition to end-resection, there are several possible sources of ssDNA.

At this point the cell density reached 1 to 2&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml and more than 95&#x00025; cells were in G1, based on cell morphology.
