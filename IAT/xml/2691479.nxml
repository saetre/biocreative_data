As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g001">Figure 1a</xref>, clathrin heavy chain (CHC) was identified in the SNX4 precipitate, but not in the negative control (- IgG). A complex involving SNX4 and CHC has not previously been reported.

We found that tubulin, but not actin, came down with SNX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Furthermore, the minus end-directed microtubule motor protein dynein was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g001">Figure 1a</xref>).

In agreement with the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we observed GFP-SNX4 positive vesicles in close proximity to, or overlapping with, tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). In the case of CHC, we observed a clear co-localization with GFP-SNX4, and even triple co-localization with the early endosomal protein EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). The fraction of GFP-SNX4 that co-localized with CHC at moderate expression level was quantified to be 27.8&#x000b1;6.6&#x00025; (average with standard deviation, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;15), and with tubulin 19.4&#x000b1;7.6&#x00025; (average with standard deviation, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5). In order to exclude the possibility that this co-localization was random, we expressed GFP alone and performed the corresponding experiments. Even though GFP is expressed throughout the cell, less than 0.5&#x00025; co-localization could be detected with CHC (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;16) or tubulin (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) (pictures not presented). This clearly demonstrates that the co-localization between GFP-SNX4 and CHC or tubulin is significant (p&#x0003c;0.0001 by Student's t-test). At high GFP-SNX4 expression level, CHC appeared more recruited to GFP-SNX4 positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g002">Figure 2c</xref>).

Amino acid sequence analysis of SNX4 did not show such a motif. However, a variant, or an &#x0201c;inverted&#x0201d; clathrin box, <sup>109</sup>EFELL, was found in its PX domain. We therefore chose to test whether this sequence was required for CHC binding. We constructed the deletion mutant SNX4 109-113&#x00394; and also designed a SNX4 construct deleted of its C-terminal half, SNX4 198-451&#x00394; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). Both wild-type SNX4 and the two mutants were designed with a myc-tag. Since a mutation in the PX domain could potentially affect the endosomal localization of SNX4, we first investigated the cellular distribution of the recombinant SNX4 proteins by immunofluorescence. No apparent change in localization was observed for SNX4 109-113&#x00394; compared to SNX4 wt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005935.s003">Figure S2a</xref>), but its co-localization with EEA1 was reduced to 67&#x00025; relative to the wild type (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6 for SNX4 wt and 8 for SNX4 109-113&#x00394;) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005935.s003">Figure S2b</xref>). SNX4 198-451&#x00394; was for an unexplained reason present in the nucleus in addition to its expected cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005935.s003">Figure S2a</xref>). We next performed anti-myc immunoprecipitation experiments on cells expressing the SNX4 constructs, and examined the presence of CHC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3b, a</xref> mild reduction in the CHC binding was observed for SNX4 198-451&#x00394;, whereas it was practically abolished for the SNX4 109-113&#x00394; mutant. Three independent experiments were quantified and corrected for SNX4 expression level. The result showed an &#x0223c;80&#x00025; reduction in CHC binding for SNX4 109-113&#x00394; compared to SNX4 wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). This suggests that the clathrin box variant present in SNX4 may be a CHC binding site. In order to validate this, we designed GST-peptides from the SNX4 sequence containing the putative CHC binding motif. We made one peptide containing amino acids 101&#x02013;132, and a shorter one from amino acid 105&#x02013;116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). The peptides were purified and added to cell lysate before pull-down. CHC was present in both the 101&#x02013;132 and 105&#x02013;116 pull-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). GST alone was used as negative control and was unable to pull down CHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). Sequences corresponding to <sup>109</sup>EFELL in SNX4 are also present in other SNXs. We therefore investigated whether these sequences from SNX1, SNX2 and SNX3 could also pull down CHC. A sequence containing the clathrin box of Hrs was used as positive control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005935-Raiborg1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The clathrin box of Hrs is represented from the C- to the N-terminal end (rev) and aligned with the putative clathrin boxes of the SNXs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3d</xref>. The main residues are conserved. In pull-down experiments all the peptides, but not GST alone, were able to bind CHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3d</xref>). In order to study the contribution of the different amino acids of <sup>109</sup>EFELL, we performed an &#x0201c;alanine scan&#x0201d; of the short peptide. We exchanged the five amino acids one by one with alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3e</xref>), and performed pull-down experiments with these peptides. We observed that the E109A mutant was still able to pull down CHC, perhaps more efficiently than the wild type, while the mutants F110A, E111A, L112A and L113A only showed background binding to CHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3e</xref>). Interestingly, F110 and L113 are strictly conserved in all the putative clathrin boxes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g003">Figure 3d</xref>), and might represent necessary residues.

Ricin is after endocytosis transported via early endosomes and the Golgi apparatus, to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Since we here show that SNX4 and CHC form a complex, we were interested in the effect of reduced CHC levels on ricin transport. We took advantage of siRNA to knock down CHC, and employed both the oligo-based and vector-based approach (siCHCo and siCHCv, respectively). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g005">Figure 5a</xref> shows the strong effect of these siRNAs on the protein level of CHC.

We also confirmed that ricin degradation was not affected by CHC knockdown (not shown). In order to confirm the increased retrograde transport in CHC knockdown cells, we measured the mannosylation of ricin which takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum. In agreement with the sulfation data, we observed a strong increase in ricin mannosylation when CHC was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g005">Figure 5c</xref>, black bars). Total protein mannosylation was also mildly increased at this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g005">Figure 5c</xref>, white bars). We next studied the cellular localization of ricin by confocal microscopy. Interestingly, ricin appeared in dense perinuclear clusters in knockdown cells, in contrast to the spread vesicular localization in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g005">Figure 5d</xref>). Also SNX4 changed its localization upon CHC knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g005">Figures 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005935.s004">S3</xref>).

In agreement with the biochemical assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g005">Figure 5b, c</xref>), the ricin cluster in knockdown cells co-localized with the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi protein TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g005">Figure 5e</xref>). Quantification revealed a 2.4 fold increase in ricin co-localization with TGN46 in CHC knockdown cells compared to control cells, and a 22.6 fold increase in TGN46 structures positive for ricin (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4 for control cells and 7 for siCHC cells, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.025 and &#x0003c;0.0001 by Student's <italic>t</italic>-test for the two measurements, respectively). The difference in these numbers is likely due to the fact that TGN46 labelling remained stable upon CHC knockdown, whereas ricin was often more easily detected in knockdown cells due to its clustering (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005935-g005">Figure 5e</xref>).

Interestingly, we found that dynein interacted with the same region of SNX4 as CHC, but the clathrin box variant was not sufficient for dynein binding.

This is in agreement with the findings that the dynein/SNX4 interaction is independent of CHC, and that dynein and CHC bind to the same region of SNX4. When cells were treated with nocodazole, an increased binding of CHC to SNX4 was observed. This could be a result of obstructed vesicle movement due to tubulin depolymerisation, and therefore SNX4 remains bound to CHC. Surprisingly, we did not observe an increased binding of dynein to SNX4 upon CHC knockdown. This may be explained by an altered kinetics in knockdown cells, since when CHC is reduced, endosomes appear closer to the Golgi apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005935-Bennett1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005935-Lau1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, one can not exclude that dynein is present in excess and therefore sufficient for further recruitment of CHC. By showing that SNX4 exists in complex with CHC, most probably upstream of its interaction with dynein, we contribute with another piece of the endosomal puzzle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005935.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005935.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005935.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>SNX4 co-localizes with GFP-CLC.
