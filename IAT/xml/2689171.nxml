However, there is no effective therapeutic option for metastatic chondrosarcoma patients since chondrosarcoma is resistant to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new therapeutic approaches for metastatic and surgically unresectable chondrosarcoma cases. P-glycoprotein, a product of multidrug resistant gene 1, and antiapoptotic protein overexpression are two common mechanisms of chemoresistance in tumor cells. It has already been reported that chondrosarcoma cells highly express P-glycoprotein and antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The role of P-glycoprotein in drug efflux has been identified as one of the mechanisms for chemoresistance in human chondrosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], while the function of antiapoptotic genes in chemoresistance has not been elucidated.</p><p>P-glycoprotein is a transmembrane ATP-dependent pump that transports drugs out of cells as protection against toxins. Tumor cells exposed to a single cytotoxic drug are resistant to structurally and functionally unrelated drugs, and P-glycoprotein is largely responsible for this multidrug resistance (MDR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. MDR resulting from the overexpression of P-glycoprotein has been reported in different types of soft tissue sarcomas (eg, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma) and hematologic malignancies (eg, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to drug transportation, P-glycoprotein overexpressing cells exhibit abrogation of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, which may be dependent on Bcl-xL overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Bcl-xL, one of the well-known antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, controls apoptosis by blocking the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Furthermore, the activation of caspases, the effector molecules of apoptosis, is dependent on this cytochrome c release. It has been reported that the inhibition of apoptosis can lead to tumorigenesis and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although the role of antiapoptotic proteins in the chemoresistance of chondrosarcoma is not well understood, the overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP) is one of the mechanisms of radiation resistance in chondrosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Since chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy both induce apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], antiapoptotic proteins may contribute to chemoresistance, as well. Several studies have suggested that antiapoptotic proteins have a major role in chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Chondrosarcoma cells with MDR properties conferred by membrane-bound P-glycoprotein still have a significant amount of cytoplasmic levels of doxorubicin remaining after doxorubicin treatment and washout, which further supports the involvement of antiapoptotic proteins in chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Based on these findings, we hypothesize (1) antiapoptotic proteins mediate chemoresistance in chondrosarcoma cells and (2) the knockdown of these proteins, as well as P-glycoprotein, would enhance chemosensitivity to the doxorubicin remaining in the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Chondrosarcoma cells are resistant to chemotherapy</title><p>In order to verify the chemoresistance of chondrosarcoma cells, we treated well-known human grade II chondrosarcoma cells, SW1353 and JJ012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], with doxorubicin <italic>in vitro</italic>. Doxorubicin treatment did not increase apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cells while human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were undergoing robust apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Normal chondrocyte cells also exhibited chemoresistance, suggesting that chondrocytes, in general, are chemoresistant. To confirm P-glycoprotein and antiapoptotic protein expression as a possible mechanism of chemoresistance in chondrosarcoma, we measured P-glycoprotein, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP expression by immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Normal chondrocytes and chondrosarcoma cells express all these proteins, suggesting that both P-glycoprotein and antiapoptotic proteins may contribute to doxorubicin resistance.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Doxorubicin resistance and expression of antiapoptotic protein and P-glycoprotein in chondrosarcoma cells</bold>.

P-glycoprotein was present on the cell surface of both chondrosarcoma cell types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Doxorubicin has inherent autofluorescent (excitation wavelength: 480 nm, emission wavelength: 580 nm) and intracellular doxorubicin uptake was measured. Our results show that as doxorubicin dose increased, the number of fluorescent cells increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To examine the functional activity of P-glycoprotein, we measured doxorubicin levels in chondrosarcoma cells after doxorubicin washout. Doxorubicin levels decreased in cells in a time dependant manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). However, a substantial amount of doxorubicin still remained 24 hours after doxorubicin washout (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These data suggest that P-glycoprotein may not be the only responsible mechanism for chemoresistance by chondrosarcoma cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cell surface expression of P-glycoprotein and doxorubicin uptake and efflux in chondrosarcoma cells</bold>.

We hypothesize that antiapoptotic proteins have a critical role in chemoresistance since a significant amount of doxorubicin remains within chondrosarcoma cells. To test our hypothesis, we treated cells with inhibitors of antiapoptotic proteins and P-glycoprotein in the presence or absence of doxorubicin. First, we performed a dose-response experiment using 3 different doses of pharmacologic inhibitors based on previously published reports in order to find an optimal concentration that is least cytotoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. There were no significant changes in the rate of apoptosis with 10 &#x003bc;M of Bcl-2 inhibitor (2.36 &#x000b1; 0.67%), 10 &#x003bc;M of C-4 (3.19 &#x000b1; 0.91%) or 10 &#x003bc;M of embelin (3.53 &#x000b1; 1.75%) when compared with the DMSO treated control group (1.53 &#x000b1; 0.74%). Based on these data, chondrosarcoma cells were treated with 10 &#x003bc;M of Bcl-2 inhibitor, 10 &#x003bc;M of C-4 (P-glycoprotein inhibitor) or 10 &#x003bc;M of embelin (XIAP inhibitor) and two different concentrations of doxorubicin (0.1 &#x003bc;M and 1 &#x003bc;M). Apoptosis rates were measured to investigate whether or not inhibition of antiapoptotic proteins or P-glycoprotein would enhance doxorubicin sensitivity in chondrosarcoma cells. While the DMSO treated chondrosarcoma cells exhibited chemoresistance (SW1353; 2.42 &#x000b1; 0.96% at 0.1 &#x003bc;M, 4.24 &#x000b1; 2.53% at 1 &#x003bc;M.

In addition, the combination of inhibitors for antiapoptotic proteins and P-glycoprotein enhanced the chemosensitivity by up to 5.5 fold (Bcl-2 inhibitor+C-4 treated JJ012: 13.93 &#x000b1; 2.76%, p &#x0003c; 0.01) at 0.1 &#x003bc;M, 5.5 fold (embelin+C-4 treated SW1353:23.51 &#x000b1; 3.50%, p &#x0003c; 0.01) at 1 &#x003bc;M. The increase in the chemosensitizing effect by combinatorial use of antiapoptotic protein and P-glycoprotein inhibitors was maximal when P-glycoprotein (C-4) and XIAP (embelin) were inhibited simultaneously in doxorubicin treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Apoptosis after inhibitor and doxorubicin treatment</bold>.

Doxorubicin treatment with inhibitors of antiapoptotic protein or P-glycoprotein induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). However, doxorubicin treatment alone did not trigger mitochondrial cytochrome c release significantly. These data suggest inhibition of antiapoptosis proteins and P-glycoproteins enhance doxorubicin sensitivity by the cytochrome c release mechanism.</p><p>There is a possibility that antiapoptotic protein inhibitors treatment may change the function or the expression of P-glycoprotein instead of the direct effect on antiapoptotic proteins in P-glycoprotein expressing chondrosarcoma cells.

Interestingly, antiapoptotic or <italic>P-glycoprotein </italic>gene silencing without doxorubicin treatment caused a very modest induction of apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).

In this regard, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for chemo- and radioresistance is necessary to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Failure of chemotherapy results from both patient and tumor variances. The host factors include poor absorption, rapid metabolism and insufficient drug delivery to the tumor site, while the tumor factors include the loss of cell surface receptors or drug transport proteins, specific metabolism of chemotherapy drugs, mutation of the specific target of drugs, and the increase in drug efflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Drug efflux has been studied extensively, since it has the most relevance to multidrug resistance. Consequently, it is believed that the major mechanism of multidrug resistance in tumor cells is P-glycoprotein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Several <italic>in vitro </italic>studies have already reported that most chondrosarcoma cells express P-glycoprotein to confer MDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Our experiments have confirmed this as previously reported by other groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Doxorubicin resistant normal cartilage and chondrosarcoma cells express high levels of antiapoptotic proteins as well as P-glycoprotein, suggesting that both P-glycoprotein and antiapoptotic proteins may contribute to doxorubicin resistance.</p><p>P-glycoprotein is located on the plasma membrane which removes cytotoxic drugs from the cell. It is believed to be the main mechanism of chemoresistance in P-glycoprotein expressing tumors regardless of antiapoptotic gene expression since cytotoxic drugs were thought to be removed before antiapoptotic proteins would work. However, our data reveals that doxorubicin uptake increases with higher doses in P-glycoprotein expressing chondrosarcoma cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and antiapoptotic protein inhibition and gene silencing enhanced doxorubicin sensitivity independent of P-glycoprotein (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Additionally, significant amounts of doxorubicin still remained in chondrosarcoma cells 24 hours after doxorubicin washout (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that antiapoptotic proteins play a role in the chemoresistance of chondrosarcoma cells by enhancing cell survival in addition to P-glycoprotein. These antiapoptotic proteins and P-glycoprotein are two independent chemoresistance mechanisms in chondrosarcoma cells since targeting antiapoptotic proteins did not have any effect on the activity, mRNA expression level and protein expression level of P-glycoprotein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and targeting P-glycoprotein did not change the expression level of antiapoptotic proteins, either (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The two independent mechanisms are closely related in terms of a cell death pathway by blocking cytochrome c release for doxorubicin resistance in chondrosarcoma cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). We also found targeting both P-glycoprotein and antiapoptotic protein with doxorubicin treatment showed additive effect rather than synergistic effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). This may be due to the fact that apoptosis which results from targeting antiapoptotic proteins, induces the cleavage of P-glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] which may weaken the effect of targeting P-glycoprotein.</p><p>Among the antiapoptotic genes screened, the knockdown of <italic>Bcl-xL </italic>and <italic>XIAP </italic>enhanced doxorubicin sensitivity as effectively as <italic>P-glycoprotein </italic>and the combined knockdown of <italic>Bcl-xL </italic>with <italic>P-glycoprotein </italic>and <italic>XIAP </italic>with <italic>P-glycoprotein </italic>were significantly effective in our dual gene silencing group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). This may be explained by the fact that Bcl-xL and XIAP overexpression in P-glycoprotein expressing tumor cells has been associated with a much stronger resistance to treatment and a worse prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Moreover, apoptosis itself induces the cleavage of P-glycoprotein, which may enhance apoptotic sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Yet, the knockdown of <italic>Bcl-2 </italic>did not induce significant apoptosis in SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>) while Bcl-2 inhibitor treatment enhanced doxorubicin sensitivity in SW1353 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This may be due to the low knockdown efficiency of <italic>Bcl-2 </italic>(SW1353; <italic>Bcl-2</italic>: 39 &#x000b1; 5.1%, <italic>Bcl-xL</italic>: 72 &#x000b1; 10.3%, <italic>XIAP</italic>: 66 &#x000b1; 12.2%, <italic>P-glycoprotein</italic>: 47 &#x000b1; 6.8%. JJ012; <italic>Bcl-2</italic>: 57 &#x000b1; 10.2%, <italic>Bcl-xL</italic>: 75 &#x000b1; 11.7%, <italic>XIAP</italic>: 70 &#x000b1; 9.6%, <italic>P-glycoprotein</italic>: 62 &#x000b1; 9.9%). In addition, Bcl-2 inhibitor inhibits Bcl-xL as well as Bcl-2 since Bcl-2 inhibitor competes with Bak BH3 peptide for binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Consequently, we could not establish its role in chemoresistance. There are several factors which can explain this discrepancy in the knockdown efficiency of each target protein. siRNA efficiency can be determined by the cell type, passage number, confluency of cells, turnover rate of proteins, and the stability of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Each protein has different turnover rates and stabilities which is why our siRNA knockdown efficiency is quite different for each target protein.</p><p>Although chondrosarcoma cells are resistant to doxorubicin, clonogenic survival data showed that the colony numbers of the untreated groups were decreased significantly at 0.1 and 1 &#x003bc;M of doxorubicin. This may be the result of a number of factors including trypsinization and the small number of cells seeded, in addition to doxorubicin's effect.</p><p>We used Grade II chondrosarcoma cells which are well characterized and have been widely used by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Grade III chondrosarcoma cells could be a more attractive experimental model but grade III chondrosarcoma cells often lose cartilage phenotypes with more heterogeneous cellularity. Hence, grade II chondrosarcomas were the best choice for our purposes since they have a high resistance to both chemo- and radiotherapy, metastatic potential and a high recurrence rate but still maintain the cartilaginous phenotype. Although our study was limited to Grade II chondrosarcomas, the proposed therapeutic concept may be relevant to other high grade sarcomas including Grade III chondrosarcomas which overexpress P-glycoprotein and antiapoptotic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that antiapoptotic proteins as well as P-glycoprotein confer chemoresistance to P-glycoprotein expressing chondrosarcoma cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). As a result, antiapoptotic gene and <italic>P-glycoprotein </italic>silencing via siRNA possibly could be used as a molecular adjuvant therapy for metastatic or surgically unresectable chondrosarcomas. However, additional <italic>in vivo </italic>studies will be necessary before applying the proposed therapeutic concept in clinical trials.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Doxorubicin resistance mechanisms in chondrosarcoma cells</bold>.
