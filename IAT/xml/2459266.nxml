The regulated production and distribution of phospholipids during the cell cycle or during development often underlie striking changes in membrane biogenesis, which, in turn, can impact on the size, shape, or number of organelles. For example, stimulation of phospholipid biosynthesis accompanies the expansion of the ER<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref> in professional secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>) or neurite growth during neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Despite these interesting observations, the molecular mechanisms responsible for coupling lipid production to organelle morphology remain largely unknown.</p><p>An organelle that undergoes striking structural changes during the cell cycle is the nucleus. The nucleus is delimited by the nuclear envelope, which consists of a double lipid bilayer, the outer and inner nuclear membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). The outer membrane is continuous with the ER, whereas the inner membrane faces the nucleoplasm and binds to chromatin. Nuclear membrane growth is essential for cell division. In yeast, nuclear membrane expansion allows anaphase to take place within a single nuclear compartment that partitions between mother and daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). In metazoan cells, the nuclear membrane expands at the end of mitosis to accommodate chromatin decondensation and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). The source of the nuclear membrane and the mechanism by which it is added to the nuclear envelope remain unknown. Nuclear envelope remodeling is also important for cell types that undergo dramatic nuclear structure changes during their differentiation, such as mammalian blood cell types, where nuclei can be highly lobed and segmented, or spermatocytes and myocytes, where nuclei can take very elongated morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). The importance of proper nuclear envelope structure in cell physiology is underscored by the recent identification of several diseases that are associated with changes in nuclear shape and are caused by mutations in nuclear envelope proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p><p>We have recently identified an unexpected link between phospholipid biosynthesis and nuclear structure. Mutations in Pah1p, a PA phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PA to DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), cause proliferation of the nuclear/ER membrane and a massive expansion of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Interestingly, the activity of Pah1p is regulated by Cdc28p-dependent phosphorylation during mitosis. A phosphorylation-null Pah1p mutant has higher PA phosphatase activity than the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Consistent with this, cells lacking Nem1p-Spo7p, the phosphatase complex that dephosphorylates Pah1p, accumulate hyperphosphorylated Pah1p and exhibit nuclear membrane proliferation like <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>).</p><p>There are two key consequences of the changes in PA levels that take place in <italic>pah1</italic> mutants. First, in yeast cells, PA regulates coordinately the transcription of many phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme genes through the PA-sensitive repressor Opi1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). When levels of PA are high, as in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells, Opi1p is excluded from the nucleus, and transcription is derepressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Interestingly, Pah1p regulates the transcription of these genes through both Opi1p-dependent and Opi1p-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Second, both PA and DAG are the precursors for the synthesis of abundant phospholipids that are used for membrane biogenesis, through the CDP-DAG and CDP-choline pathways, respectively (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Therefore, changes in PA and DAG levels in <italic>pah1</italic> mutants impact on the cellular levels of these phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>).</p><p>How the inactivation of Pah1p leads to nuclear growth is not understood. Moreover, whether Pah1p regulates primarily ER or nuclear membrane biogenesis and whether particular lipids are associated with these changes are not known. We have shown previously that the up-regulation of phospholipid synthesis is necessary but not sufficient to drive nuclear growth in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Therefore, there could be additional factors required for nuclear expansion. To investigate the role of phospholipid biosynthesis in nuclear membrane formation and to identify novel components involved in this process, we applied two complementary genetic approaches. First, a systematic search among mutants of known phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes revealed that only Pah1p affects nuclear structure. We therefore performed two non-biased screens looking for previously uncharacterized genes that could encode PA regulators and examined their effect on nuclear structure. Both screens identified the same gene, <italic>DGK1</italic> (known previously as <italic>HSD1</italic>), encoding a nuclear/ER integral membrane protein. We show that Dgk1p counteracts the effects of Pah1p at the nuclear membrane by controlling PA levels. Dgk1p is a novel CTP-dependent <underline>D</underline>A<underline>G</underline><underline>k</underline>inase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of DAG to PA. Unlike previously described DAG kinases that use ATP, Dgk1p utilizes CTP as a phosphate donor for the kinase reaction. Overexpression of <italic>DGK1</italic> causes recruitment of PA reporter protein on the nuclear membrane and leads to its expansion. Interestingly, cortical ER membrane is not proliferating in these cells. These data reveal a specific role for PA metabolism in nuclear membrane biogenesis.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions</italic>&#x02014;The yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

We therefore undertook two screens to identify novel genes encoding PA regulators. Both screens are based on our previous finding that the PA phosphatase activity of Pah1p, which controls cellular concentration of PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), is inhibited by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Expression of constitutively dephosphorylated Pah1p, generated by mutating its phosphorylation sites (<italic>PAH1</italic>-7P mutant), increases its PA phosphatase activity, represses transcription of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, and results in lethality in medium lacking inositol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). This phenotype is consistent with a decrease in cellular PA levels. Similarly, overexpression of the Nem1p-Spo7p phosphatase complex, which dephosphorylates Pah1p, is also lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). We therefore screened for high copy number suppressors that can rescue the lethality of the overexpression of <italic>PAH1</italic>-7P (screen I) or the <italic>NEM1</italic>-<italic>SPO7</italic> phosphatase (screen II). Both screens identified independently the same gene, <italic>DGK1</italic> (known previously as <italic>HSD1</italic>). The suppression of the <italic>PAH1</italic>-7P and <italic>NEM1</italic>-<italic>SPO7</italic> lethality was confirmed by overexpressing <italic>DGK1</italic> in the respective strains using the inducible <italic>GAL1</italic>/<italic>10</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>, respectively). <italic>DGK1</italic>/<italic>HSD1</italic> was originally isolated in a screen for suppressors of a <italic>sly1</italic> mutant involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), but its function and mechanism of suppression remained so far unknown.

Indeed, wild-type cells overexpressing <italic>DGK1</italic> from a galactose-inducible promoter contain enlarged and irregularly shaped nuclei and a striking nuclear/ER membrane proliferation that is reminiscent of that originally observed in cells lacking <italic>PAH1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Because the overproduction of <italic>DGK1</italic> phenocopies the morphological defects of <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells, we next asked whether the complementary possibility would be true, <italic>i.e.</italic> whether lack of <italic>DGK1</italic> would rescue the nuclear expansion that takes place in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells.

Therefore, the function of Dgk1p in the nuclear structure appears to counteract that of Pah1p.</p><p>Because the accumulation of PA contributes to the transcriptional up-regulation of phospholipid biosynthetic genes and to the increased membrane biogenesis in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells, we next asked whether the lack of <italic>DGK1</italic> rescues the nuclear membrane proliferation of <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells by affecting cellular PA levels. To test this hypothesis, we compared the phospholipid composition of <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>dgk1</italic>&#x00394; cells with that of the corresponding single mutants and wild-type strain. Indeed, deletion of <italic>DGK1</italic> returns the PA levels of the <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells to normal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>).

The levels of PE in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>dgk1</italic>&#x00394; are also brought back to normal, whereas the levels of PC are partially corrected. However, the abnormal phosphatidylinositol (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>) and major neutral lipid triacylglycerol (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>) levels of the <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; mutant are not affected by the deletion of <italic>DGK1</italic>.

The cytidylyltransferase domain present in Dgk1p shows significant similarity to the PA cytidylyltransferase Cds1p (also known as CDP-DAG synthase), the enzyme that synthesizes CDP-DAG from CTP and PA. Cds1p can also catalyze the reverse reaction that leads to PA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). To investigate whether <italic>DGK1</italic> can function as a CDP-DAG synthase, we asked whether (<italic>a</italic>) overexpression of <italic>DGK1</italic> could rescue a conditional <italic>CDS1</italic> mutant and (<italic>b</italic>) overexpression of <italic>CDS1</italic> could rescue, like <italic>DGK1</italic>, the toxicity of <italic>PAH1</italic>-7P. In both cases, the results were negative.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">4</xref> Taken together, these data suggest that Dgk1p does not function as a CDP-DAG synthase <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>A second reaction that can directly generate PA is the phosphorylation of DAG.

This, coupled with the fact that Dgk1p contains a CTP transferase domain, prompted us to test whether Dgk1p could be a CTP-dependent DAG kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). We measured DAG kinase activity in extracts derived from wild-type, <italic>dgk1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>dgk1</italic>&#x00394; cells using [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]CTP as a phosphate donor.

This result indicated that <italic>DGK1</italic> encodes a DAG kinase activity. To confirm this, Dgk1p was partially purified as a PtA-Dgk1p fusion over an IgG-Sepharose column, followed by removal of the PtA tag by tobacco etch virus protease cleavage, and assayed for DAG kinase activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). The purified protein catalyzed a dose- and time-dependent phosphorylation of DAG using CTP as a phosphate donor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Taken together, these data show that Dgk1p is a novel CTP-dependent DAG kinase enzyme. The fact that Dgk1p uses CTP, rather than ATP, as a phosphate donor, explains why it does not show homology to any of the previously described DAG kinases from other species.

Therefore, the DAG kinase activity of Dgk1p is responsible for nuclear membrane expansion.</p><p>If the DAG kinase activity of Dgk1p causes nuclear expansion, then one would expect that PA levels in intracellular membranes would rise following the induction of Dgk1p. To visualize the intracellular location of PA accumulation, we followed the distribution of a GFP fusion of a short domain of the t-SNARE (<underline>t</underline>arget membrane <underline>s</underline>oluble <underline><italic>N</italic></underline>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor <underline>a</underline>ttachment protein <underline>re</underline>ceptor) Spo20p (GFP-Spo20p-(51-91)). This GFP fusion is responsive to changes in PA levels <italic>in vivo</italic> and has been used previously as a PA sensor in both yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) and mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) cells.

Consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>), in control cells, GFP-Spo20p-(51-91) was found at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). When cells carrying <italic>GAL</italic>-<italic>DGK1</italic> were transferred into galactose medium, the PA sensor relocalized to internal membranes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). Interestingly, in the majority of these cells (79% of the cells with internal membrane staining), the PA-enriched membranes formed around the irregularly shaped nucleus and often extended into the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). Overexpression of bacterial Dgk1p, which has been shown to relocalize to internal membranes in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>), resulted in a similar relocation of the PA sensor to the nuclear membrane.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">4</xref> Taken together, these results indicate that Dgk1p-produced PA accumulates on intracellular membranes around the nucleus.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>The DAG kinase activity of Dgk1p is required for nuclear membrane expansion.</bold><italic>A</italic>, multiple sequence alignment of Dgk1p (residues 162-182) with cytidylyltransferases from the indicated species.

To test this hypothesis, we deleted the redundant acyltransferase genes <italic>GAT1</italic> and <italic>GAT2</italic>, previously shown to be required for PA production (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>; see also <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), in the <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; mutant.

This epistatic effect is due to the lack of Gat2p enzymatic activity, required for PA production, because it can be reproduced using a mutant (G253L) that is predicted to be catalytically dead (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9<italic>C</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>).

Therefore, inhibition of upstream steps that reduce PA synthesis is sufficient to decrease the membrane proliferation defects of <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells.

In this work, we have shown that PA homeostasis is a critical factor controlling nuclear structure in yeast. In two genetic screens looking for novel regulators of PA metabolism, we identified Dgk1p, the first DAG kinase described in yeast. Dgk1p-driven overproduction of PA at the nuclear membrane causes nuclear expansion, without proliferating cortical ER membrane. Thus, the modulation of Dgk1p activity offers a unique model system to study the regulation of nuclear growth.</p><p><italic>Dgk1p Is a Novel CTP-dependent DAG Kinase</italic>&#x02014;DAG kinase enzymes have been identified in almost all organisms examined, including bacteria, plants, worms, flies, and mammals. All DAG kinases have a catalytic domain that contains an ATP-binding site with the sequence G<italic>X</italic>G<italic>XX</italic>G that is essential for the kinase reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Dgk1p is an unconventional DAG kinase that uses CTP, instead of ATP, as a phosphate donor and therefore does not exhibit sequence similarity to DAG kinases from other species. Furthermore, Dgk1p contains a short motif recently identified in a family of CTP-dependent phytol and dolichol kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">4</xref>. Although the significance of this difference between Dgk1p and the other DAG kinases is not yet clear, it could have important physiological implications. Previous studies have established that elevated levels of cytosolic CTP (due to a defect in CTP feedback inhibition of CTP synthase) lead to increased PA levels, derepression of <italic>INO1</italic>, and the inositol excretion phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Our data raise the possibility that this regulation is mediated by the CTP-driven activation of Dgk1p.</p><p><italic>Regulation of PA Homeostasis by Dgk1p</italic>&#x02014;The genetic interactions between <italic>DGK1</italic> and <italic>PAH1</italic> fit well with the biochemical data on the activity of Dgk1p. Overexpression of a hyperactive Pah1p mutant decreases cellular PA by converting it to DAG, causing the PA-dependent repression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes by Opi1p, and results in inositol auxotrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). This lethality can be rescued by the overexpression of Dgk1p, which catalyzes the reverse reaction and restores PA levels. The fact that the deletion of <italic>DGK1</italic> in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells returns PA levels to normal could indicate that, in wild-type cells, Dgk1p produces some of the ER pools of PA that are accessible to Pah1p.</p><p>Although the <italic>dgk1</italic>&#x00394; mutation returns the levels of the other abundant phospholipids, PC and PE, almost to normal in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells, it does not change the defects in phosphatidylinositol and triacylglycerol levels. The fact that <italic>dgk1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells have completely normal nuclear structure but still exhibit growth defects at 30 &#x000b0;C and are temperature-sensitive at 37 &#x000b0;C, like <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells, suggests that PA and/or PC and PE are responsible for the effects on the nuclear membrane, whereas phosphatidylinositol and triacylglycerol levels contribute more to the toxicity of <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells.</p><p>Interestingly, not all enzymes involved in the production of PA can rescue <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; when removed.

The fact that these two enzymes have distinct fatty acyl substrate specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) raises the intriguing possibility that different PA pools, with respect to acyl chain length and/or saturation, could have different physiological effects.

High PA levels can have two distinct effects on lipid homeostasis and membrane biogenesis that could be responsible for nuclear growth. First, PA acts as a signal that derepresses transcription of key enzymes of the CDP-DAG pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), which provide bulk phospholipids for membrane formation. Indeed, transcriptional derepression of these enzymes is necessary for nuclear membrane proliferation in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). However, constitutive overexpression of the biosynthetic enzymes in cells lacking the repressor <italic>OPI1</italic> does not lead to nuclear membrane expansion, suggesting that, apart from the derepression of lipid synthesis in the ER, other events contribute to nuclear membrane expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). The second effect of PA on membranes is due to its conical structure and its bending functions that are implicated in many remodeling events like membrane budding and fission. Changes in the physical properties of the double bilayered nuclear membrane could contribute to its expansion. Interestingly, a role for membrane tubulation in nuclear membrane expansion has been described recently in tissue cultured cells in which expression of membrane-deforming mutants of CTP-phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-&#x003b1; causes nuclear membrane proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>).</p><p>The distinct functions of Dgk1p-driven PA production in the nuclear envelope are also underscored by the fact that overproduction of Dgk1p does not appear to significantly induce cortical ER membrane proliferation, as visualized using a reticulon-GFP fusion. This raises the intriguing question of whether PA and downstream-derived phospholipids are differentially processed in the two subcompartments or whether active Dgk1p concentrates preferentially on the nuclear membrane. Given the significant changes that yeast nuclei undergo during cell division, the temporal and spatial regulation of PA metabolism by Dgk1p and Pah1p could play crucial roles in this process. Future studies will further address the role of Dgk1p in nuclear structure and phospholipid biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Author Profile]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M802903200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M802903200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Aaron Neiman for plasmids and Drs.
