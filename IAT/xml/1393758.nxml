In normal mouse thymocyte subpopulations, the expression of <italic>IAN1, IAN4,</italic> and <italic>IAN5</italic> was increased in accordance with the positive selection of immature DP thymocytes to mature SP thymocytes, including the increase along the early events during the development of DP CD69 <sup>low</sup> cells to DP CD69 <sup>high</sup> cells and the increase along the late events during the development of CD4SP CD69 <sup>high</sup> cells to CD4SP CD69 <sup>low</sup> cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).

By contrast, the knockdown of <italic>IAN1</italic> did not significantly affect T cell development. On the other hand, the premature overexpression of <italic>IAN1</italic> induced the apoptosis of DP thymocytes, whereas the overexpression of <italic>IAN4</italic> or <italic>IAN5</italic> showed no significant effects on T cell development. These results indicate that <italic>IAN1, IAN4,</italic> and <italic>IAN5</italic> critically and differentially regulate the development of T lymphocytes in the thymus. </p><p>Our results suggest that IAN4 and IAN5 are associated with the Bcl-2 family proteins including anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as well as pro-apoptotic Bax, whereas IAN1 is selectively associated with Bax. The overexpression of Bcl-xL restored the reduced survival of T cells caused by IAN5 deficiency, suggesting the role of Bcl-xL in the IAN5-mediated regulation of T cell survival. Our results also show that TCR signals in immature thymocytes upregulate the expression of <italic>IAN1, IAN4,</italic> and <italic>IAN5</italic>. Although it is possible that the expression and function of these IAN family members in developing thymocytes may also be regulated by the survival signals derived from other receptors, such as the IL-7 receptor and Notch-1, our results suggest that IAN1, IAN4, and IAN5 may relay TCR signals for apoptosis regulation by the Bcl-2 family members, critically controlling the survival and death of immature thymocytes and possibly regulating the repertoire selection of developing T cells in the thymus. </p><p>IAN4 and IAN5 are highly similar in terms of primary structure and subcellular localization. However, the knockdown of <italic>IAN4</italic> and <italic>IAN5</italic> differentially affected thymocyte development; i.e., IAN4 deficiency disturbed positive-selection&#x02013;mediated SP thymocyte generation, whereas IAN5 deficiency affected DP thymocyte generation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g005">5</xref>). As the expression of <italic>IAN5</italic> but not <italic>IAN4</italic> was detected in the newly generated DP thymocytes before the TCR engagement (e.g., TCR&#x003b1;-deficient DP thymocytes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, and DP CD69 <sup>low</sup> thymocytes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), the differential effects of IAN4 deficiency and IAN5 deficiency may be due, at least in part, to their differential expression profiles in the developing thymocytes. On the other hand, it was also shown that the knockdown of <italic>IAN5,</italic> but not <italic>IAN4,</italic> enhanced the apoptosis of the IL-2&#x02013;dependent T cell line upon IL-2 withdrawal, suggesting that IAN4 and IAN5 differentially regulate the survival of mature T cells that express both IAN4 and IAN5. The differential functions of IAN4 and IAN5 may also be applied to developing thymocytes. We are currently producing mice deficient in either IAN4 or IAN5 in order to elucidate the differential roles of IAN4 and IAN5 in thymocyte development and selection as well as mature T cell survival in vivo. </p><p>It was previously reported that IAN4 and IAN5 are highly expressed in leukemia cells &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. However, our results showed that the overexpression of either IAN4 or IAN5 did not significantly influence the cellularity or development of immature thymocytes in FTOC ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g003">Figure 3</xref>). It is thus possible that in promoting cellular growth and/or oncogenesis, IAN4 and IAN5 may differentially affect immature thymocytes and other lymphoid cells including mature T lymphocytes. In vivo analysis of the long-term effects, including malignancy, of IAN4 or IAN5 overexpression in hematopoietic cells is in progress. </p><p>It was previously shown that a mutational loss of IAN5 in rat ( <italic>lyp</italic> mutation) causes T lymphopenia &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b016">16</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, which leads to the development of insulin-dependent type I diabetes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. IAN5 deficiency in rat T lymphocytes causes mitochondrial dysfunction and spontaneous apoptosis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of T cell survival by IAN5 was not clarified. Our results indicate that IAN5 knockdown enhances the apoptosis of T lymphocytes upon cytokine withdrawal, and that the reduced survival of T cells by the IAN5 knockdown is restored by the overexpression of Bcl-xL. Our results also suggest that IAN5 is associated with the Bcl-2 family proteins. Together, the present results suggest that IAN5 expressed in T lymphocytes regulates the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway through the interaction with the Bcl-2 family proteins. </p><p>Our results also show that the IAN5 knockdown perturbs the generation of DP thymocytes. This perturbation appears to occur during the differentiation of CD8SP immediate precursor cells to DP thymocytes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g005">5</xref>D). A similar phenotype of the thymocytes was described in vivo in IAN5-deficient rat, in which the number of DP thymocytes was reduced and that of DN thymocytes was increased &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, this phenotype was found in not only <italic>lyp</italic>/ <italic>lyp</italic> rats but also <italic>lyp</italic>/+ rats &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, indicating that the haploinsufficiency of IAN5 affects thymocyte development. Indeed, our results show that the reduction of IAN5 mRNA level to approximately 50&#x00025; could affect thymocyte development ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g004">4</xref>F), supporting the notion that the amount of IAN5 expression critically regulates the generation of DP thymocytes. </p><p>The molecular basis for the association of the IAN family proteins with the Bcl-2 family proteins is still unclear. Our results show that either IAN4 or IAN5 interacts with endogenous Bax in apoptotic T cells rather than in healthy growing T cells even though the total amount of intracellular Bax expression is equivalent in apoptotic cells and growing cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040103-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). It was previously shown that Bax, which is localized in the cytosol of normal cells, responds to apoptosis-inducing stimuli by translocating onto the mitochondrial membrane where apoptotic reactions including &#x00394;&#x003a8;m loss and cytochrome-c release are operated &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the interaction between Bax and IAN4 or IAN5 is likely regulated by the apoptotic stress-induced translocation of Bax to the mitochondria where IAN4 and IAN5 are localized. These results suggest that the association between the IAN family proteins and the Bcl-2 family proteins, including the pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, likely reflects a specific association with physiological relevance rather than merely a detection of nonspecific binding between overexpressed molecules. Accordingly, we detected the association between endogenous IAN4 and endogenous Bcl-2 in T cells. The specific association at the mitochondria between anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and either IAN4 or IAN5 is further supported by our preliminary results that the deletion of the C-terminal hydrophobic region from either one of Bcl-xL, IAN4, or IAN5 caused the failure in their mitochondrial localization and in the association between Bcl-xL and either IAN4 or IAN5 (unpublished data). We are currently studying the structural basis for the intracellular association between the IAN family proteins and the Bcl-2 family proteins in detail to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of IAN-family&#x02013;mediated apoptosis regulation. </p><p>Finally, our results showed that the premature overexpression of <italic>IAN1</italic> kills DP thymocytes. Our results also showed that unlike IAN4 and IAN5, IAN1 is selectively associated with pro-apoptotic Bax rather than anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Thus, IAN1 may be involved in regulating the apoptosis of immature DP thymocytes, possibly during the negative selection of self-reactive thymocytes. However, in agreement with previous reports &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040103-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, our results showed that the expression of <italic>IAN1</italic> is increased during the positive selection of thymocytes. It is possible that differential TCR signals that determine the positive and negative selection of immature thymocytes may critically regulate the timing and amount of IAN1 expression; high-avidity and/or strong TCR engagement may result in a rapid and/or marked elevation of IAN1, which may cause the apoptosis of immature thymocytes, whereas low-avidity and/or weak TCR engagement may slowly and/or modest increase IAN1 expression, which may not be sufficient to kill positively selected thymocytes. We are currently studying the role of IAN1 in positive and negative selection in greater detail by using TCR-transgenic thymocytes. </p><p>In conclusion, the present results indicate that the IAN family genes encode a novel family of TCR-responsive proteins that critically regulate the survival and death of developing T lymphocytes. As the first described gene cluster conserved in vertebrates and higher plants, the IAN family may also provide clues to yet unknown self-defense mechanisms common in higher organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Oligonucleotide microarray</title><p>Total RNA extracted from thymocytes of <italic>H-2 <sup>b</sup></italic> AND-TCR&#x02013;transgenic mice and C57BL/6 mice was reverse-transcribed, in vitro transcribed in the presence of biotinylated UTP and CTP (Enzo Diagnostics, New York, New York, United States), and hybridized to an oligonucleotide array (Murine Genome U74Av2, U74Bv2, and U74Cv2, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, United States).
