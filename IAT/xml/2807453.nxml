The potential oncogenic role of Sei1 is further suggested by its overexpression in various types of human cancers. To study the role of Sei1, we have generated a mouse line deficient for this gene. Sei1-null fibroblasts did not show abnormalities regarding proliferation or susceptibility to neoplastic transformation, nor did we observe defects on Cdk4 complexes or E2f activity. Sei1-null mice were viable, did not present overt pathologies, had a normal lifespan, and had a normal susceptibility to spontaneous and chemically-induced cancer. Pancreatic insulin-producing cells are known to be particularly sensitive to Cdk4-cyclin D and E2f activities, and we have observed that Sei1 is highly expressed in pancreatic islets compared to other tissues. Interestingly, Sei1-null mice present lower number of islets, decreased &#x003b2;-cell area, impaired insulin secretion, and glucose intolerance. These defects were associated to nuclear accumulation of the cell-cycle inhibitors p21<sup>Cip1</sup> and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> in islet cells. We conclude that Sei1 plays an important role in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, which supports a functional link between Sei1 and the core cell cycle regulators specifically in the context of the pancreas.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammalian cells, entry from quiescence into the cell cycle and advance through G1 into S phase are controlled by the activity of the D-type cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6 (Cdk4,6/D complexes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008744-Malumbres1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The expression of D-type cyclins in response to extracellular mitogenic signals is tightly regulated at different levels, as well as their binding to Cdk4,6. An important level of regulation is exerted by the Cdk inhibitors (CKIs), which include the Ink4 family (p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>, p15<sup>Ink4b</sup>, p18<sup>Ink4c</sup> and p19<sup>Ink4d</sup>) and the Cip/Kip family (p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and p57<sup>Kip2</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008744-Lowe1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008744-Besson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Once active, Cdk4,6/D complexes phosphorylate members of the pocket protein family, namely, Rb, p107 and p130. These proteins bind and inhibit transcription factors important for cell cycle progression, most notably the E2f family of transcription factors, whose target genes are necessary for the replication of the DNA during S-phase. Upon phosphorylation, the pocket proteins are released from the E2f transcription factors allowing them to become transcriptionally active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008744-Polager1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

At a more physiological level, Cdk4, D-type cyclins and the E2f family have a clear impact in pancreas development and homeostasis.

To further explore this issue, we decided to subject our mice to carcinogenic treatments.

Interestingly, pancreatic islets of Sei1-null mice showed a significant reduction in the number of pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008744-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>), as well as, a decrease of approximately 50&#x00025; in &#x003b2;-cell area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008744-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). The reduction in &#x003b2;-cell surface observed in Sei1-null mice was of intermediate magnitude when compared with the severe defect characteristic of Cdk4-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008744-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). Sei1-null islets presented a normal architecture, with &#x003b1;-cells predominantly located at the periphery of the islet and &#x003b2;-cells in the core (see below <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008744-g008">Fig. 8F</xref>). In an effort to understand the mechanisms that lead to decreased &#x003b2;-cell surface in the absence of Sei1, we measured apoptosis and proliferation by TUNEL and Ki67 immunohistochemistry, respectively, however the number of positive islet cells for both markers was very low (&#x0003c;1&#x00025;) and quantifications could not detect significant differences between wt and Sei1-null islets (data not shown). In an alternative approach, immunohistochemical detection of the cell cycle inhibitors p21<sup>Cip1</sup> and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> revealed higher levels of positive nuclei in Sei1-null pancreatic islets compared to wt islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008744-g008">Fig. 8D&#x02013;F</xref>).

At the organismal level, Sei1-null mice were viable and showed no overt phenotypes, including normal lifespan, spontaneous tumors and chemically-induced tumors. The most probable explanation for this lack of phenotypes is redundancy with other members of the Sertad family that compensate for the absence of Sei1.

All these observations suggest that pancreatic islets could be more particularly sensitive to the absence of Sei1. Interestingly, Sei1-null mice displayed abnormal insulin secretion and blood glucose clearance, as well as a reduction in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell surface.

After two days the supernatant containing the viral particles was filtered by 45 &#x000b5;m pore-filters, mixed with polybrene to a final concentration of 4&#x000b5;g/ml and added to 10 cm diameter plates with the recipient MEFs.
