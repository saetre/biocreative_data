Using mRNA from lactating rat mammary glands a cDNA expression library was established. With the overlapping immunologically positive clones we have an 8.9kb cDNA sequence for rat FAS. In the 3'-nontranslated region of the rat FAS cDNA we find a prototype polyadenylation/termination signal and 779 nucleotides upstream, a mutated one. Both of these polyadenylation/termination signals are used and give rise to two equally abundant mRNA species which are coordinately regulated. In the derived amino acid sequence we could locate six of the eight component functions; their order is NH2- beta-ketoacyl synthase - acetyl/malonyl transferases -enoyl reductase - acyl carrier protein - thioesterase -COOH. Comparison of FAS from different sources shows that the primary sequence is conserved only for the active residues and the amino acids in their immediate vicinity.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0107-a" xlink:role="573"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="567"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="568"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="569"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="570"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="571"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="572"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="573"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="574"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="575"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="576"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="577"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="578"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="579"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="580"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="581"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="582"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="583"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="584"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="585"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00211-0120.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="586"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
