In order to restore the meniscal function it is important to understand the pathomechanisms of meniscal destruction.</p><p>Increased levels of nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1, have been found in the synovial fluid and tissues of inflamed joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is also well established that cytokines can be involved in cartilage tissue or proteoglycan degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has recently been shown in a serum-containing porcine <italic>in vitro </italic>model that these cytokines are able to inhibit the intrinsic meniscal repair response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and part of this effect has been found to be mediated by the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The patterns of enzyme expression during experimental OA suggest that there are similarities in the involvement of MMPs and aggrecanases in the degradation of menisci and articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is therefore suggested that members of the MMPs as well as the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) family, such as ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1) and ADAMTS-5 (aggrecanase-2), must also be involved in cytokine-dependent degradation of proteoglycans in the meniscus. Meniscal expression and biomechanical regulation of all these enzymes has recently been shown in a porcine tissue explant model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Aggrecanases are known to be responsible for aggrecan degradation in articular cartilage in diseases such as OA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and cleave the aggrecan core protein at several specific sites; one is between Glu<sup>373 </sup>and Ala<sup>374 </sup>which generates the G1-NITEGE fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown in many studies that meniscal tissue can produce NO during experimental OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], or after partial meniscectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], mechanical stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], or cytokine treatment with IL-1 or TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of endogenous NO involvement in meniscal degeneration still remain unclear. It is associated with cartilage tissue destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], but was also found to protect from IL-1-mediated proteoglycan degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In order to investigate the influence of TNF&#x003b1; on the meniscus we present a bovine <italic>in vitro </italic>model that allows the isolation of meniscal tissue explants of defined geometry and anatomical location. Using this model we study the effect of TNF&#x003b1; on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release, biosynthetic activity, NO production, aggrecan fragmentation (because aggrecan has been described as one of the major proteoglycans in the meniscus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]), and gene expression of matrix molecules, MMPs and aggrecanases in the meniscus. We demonstrate that within three days of incubation there is a TNF&#x003b1;-dependent up-regulation of MMP-3 and ADAMTS-4 expression, as well as aggrecanase activity. The latter induces GAG release, cleaves aggrecan at the NITEGE site and is independent of the TNF&#x003b1;-induced NO production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Isolation and culturing of meniscal explant disks</title><p>Meniscal explant disks were isolated from bovine menisci (from 16 to 24 month old cattle), procured from a local abattoir with authorization from the relevant meat inspectors. This study does not involve human subjects, human tissue or experimentation of animals. Up to four full thickness tissue cylinders (10 mm in diameter) per meniscus were punched perpendicular to the meniscus bottom surface. Tissue disks 1 mm in thickness were sliced including the original meniscal surface using a sterile scalpel blade, and four to five smaller explant disks (3 mm in diameter &#x000d7; 1 mm thick) were isolated using a biopsy punch (HEBUmedical, Tuttlingen, Germany) and cultured in DMEM (supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 &#x003bc;g/ml amphotericin B; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>environment after measurement of wet weight. The total of up to 60 explants per animal (2 knee joints including medial/lateral menisci) were randomised among the different experimental groups matched by their anatomical location for every single experiment and cultured in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of recombinant human TNF&#x003b1; (R &#x00026; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). In most of the experiments a concentration of 100 ng TNF&#x003b1;/ml was used. Three explant disks per well of a 24-well plate were cultured in 1 ml medium. After three days of culture the medium and explants were used for measurements. For inhibitory studies different tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs; R &#x00026; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and the NO synthetase inhibitor L-NMMA were used. For these investigations only one meniscal explant per well was cultured for three days in 200 &#x003bc;l medium in 96-well plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The meniscal explants were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (7 &#x003bc;m) were cut sagittally through the entire thickness of the explant disks, immobilised on glass slides, and deparaffinised. After incubation for 2.5 minutes in a digester at 100&#x000b0;C (in 0.01 M citric acid, pH 6.0), they were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibody (anti-NITEGE; 1:50 dilution in 1% BSA; ABR Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO, USA), rinsed in Tris-NaCl three times for five minutes and incubated with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for one hour at room temperature. After further washing, the sections were labeled for nuclear staining with bisbenzimide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), mounted with fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and visualised using the Apotome (ZEISS, Jena, Germany) fluorescence microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of biosynthetic activity, glycosaminoglycans and nitric oxide production</title><p>For radiolabel incorporation the meniscal explants were placed in fresh culture medium containing 10 &#x003bc;Ci/ml [<sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub>]-sulfate (Amersham Pharmacia, GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany) for six to eight hours at 37&#x000b0;C under free-swelling conditions right after cytokine treatment.

A 100 &#x003bc;l aliquot of each sample and 100 &#x003bc;l Griess reagent were mixed and incubated for five minutes, and the absorption was determined in an automated plate reader (SLT Reader 340 ATTC, SLT-Labinstruments, Achterwehr, Germany) at 540 nm. Sodium nitrite (NaNO<sub>2</sub>, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used to generate a standard curve for quantification.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>After three days of incubation, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as reference gene to determine gene expression levels. Meniscal explants (approximately 100 mg from each group) were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted after pulverisation of the tissue using the TRIZOL reagent (1 ml/100 mg wet weight tissue; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by extraction with chloroform and isopropanol precipitation. The concentration of extracted RNA was quantified spectro-photometrically at OD<sub>260</sub>/OD<sub>280 </sub>nm. Before real-time RT-PCR was performed using the Qiagen QuantiTect SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions the extracted RNA was digested with DNase (65&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to remove any traces of DNA.

However, the TNF&#x003b1;-induced GAG release was significantly reduced by TIMP-3 by approximately 52% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>), whereas TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 showed a trend to increase the TNF&#x003b1;-induced GAG release, although this effect was not significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of matrix molecules and matrix degrading enzymes</title><p>To further determine the mechanisms of TNF&#x003b1;-dependent GAG release, the mRNA of meniscal explants was analyzed after a three-day incubation by quantitative RT-PCR. GAPDH had been used as a reference gene, and it had been tested that there is no significant alteration in the C<sub>T </sub>values of GAPDH expression under the influence of TNF&#x003b1; (control: 27.1 &#x000b1; 1.7 versus TNF&#x003b1;: 27.3 &#x000b1; 0.9; n = 4 independent experiments). Additionally, GAPDH expression had been tested in relation to another housekeeping gene, 18sRNA: the ratio of GAPDH expression remained unaffected under the influence of TNF&#x003b1; (1.03).</p><p>The mRNA levels of most of the genes tested were quite variable under the influence of TNF&#x003b1; except for the matrix-degrading enzymes MMP-3 and ADAMTS-4 (see below). Collagen type I mRNA was decreased in all cases (0.75 &#x000b1; 0.15), while aggrecan and collagen type II as well as MMP-1 and MMP-13 showed both increases and decreases depending on the experiment. ADAMTS-5 was not detectable in some cases or not increased by TNF&#x003b1;. MMP-3 and ADAMTS-4 showed a mean TNF&#x003b1;-dependent 6.9 &#x000b1; 2.1 and 3.7 &#x000b1; 0.8-fold increase of mRNA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). Comparing delta-C<sub>T</sub>-values (C<sub>TGAPDH </sub>- C<sub>Tgene of interest</sub>) of controls and TNF&#x003b1;-stimulated meniscal explants allows a statistical analysis and showed a significant mean change of about 2.5 &#x000b1; 0.58 for MMP-3 and 1.86 &#x000b1; 0.16 for ADAMTS-4, indicating a clear up-regulation of these enzymes in all four independent experiments. The TNF&#x003b1;-dependent MMP-3 expression was also detectable in the supernatants of the cultures by casein zymography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). There was only one band detectable in the gels, which was missing or expressed at lower levels in controls, but strong in TNF&#x003b1;-stimulated cultures. This band was not visible in gelatin zymograms (not shown), and had a molecular size of about 57 kDa (typical size for MMP-3, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]). TIMP-3 as well as L-NMMA had no influence on the band intensity. However, the enzyme activator substance APMA altered the size of the band, indicating that most of the enzyme was expressed as a pro-form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Casein zymograms of culture supernatants after a three day-incubation of meniscal explants under the influence of TNF&#x003b1;, TIMP-3, L-NMMA, or APMA.

Therefore, our study focused on the TNF&#x003b1;-dependent depletion of proteoglycans in a three-day bovine <italic>in vitro </italic>meniscal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. TNF&#x003b1; induced a dose-dependent increase in GAG release supporting data from other investigations on pro-inflammatory cytokines in which IL-1 promoted GAG release in lapine and porcine meniscal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. TNF&#x003b1;, therefore, appears to be another key factor in meniscal diseases.</p><p>To study the mechanisms of TNF&#x003b1;-dependent proteoglycan degradation we investigated the transcription of different matrix-degrading enzymes. One limitation in our study is that aggrecanases had been detected on the mRNA level only; there is no measurement of enzyme proteins, which could help to specify the degradative potencies of enzymes involved in TNF&#x003b1;-dependent proteoglycan degradation. A reason for the missing protein detection is that enzyme levels in the tissue are quite low compared with the large amounts of matrix proteins. We performed immunostainings in tissue sections (not shown), but differences in ADAMTS-4 expression were hard to differentiate, probably due to the fact that immunohistochemistry is not useful for the differentiation of slightly variable expression levels. We therefore mainly focus on the effect of inhibitors such as TIMPs or NO synthetase inhibitor (L-NMMA), and the cleavage products of aggrecan (NITEGE), which both suggest that aggrecanases must be involved in the early TNF&#x003b1;-dependent aggrecan degradation and GAG release in the meniscus (see below).</p><p>Increased concentrations of MMPs have been found in animal models of OA, in osteoarthritic human articular cartilage and in the synovial fluid of RA and OA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], but only little is known about the extent to which the meniscus might be involved in the production of these enzymes. We demonstrate that the meniscus can be an additional source for MMP-3 production, especially under the influence of TNF&#x003b1;. Wilson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] emphasise the importance of MMP activity in meniscal proteoglycan degradation after a 12-day incubation of bovine meniscal tissue from one to two-weekold calves with 20 ng/ml IL-1 and different enzyme inhibitors, but the authors do not specify the kind of MMPs. Additionally, Wilusz and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] found MMPs to be responsible for some of the repair inhibition by pro-inflammatory cytokines in a serum-containing porcine model. However, in our study most of the MMP-3 in the culture supernatant was in the pro-form, and it remains unclear to what extent this enzyme might have been involved in the present GAG release. But it is reasonable to believe that MMP-3 will be involved in the subsequent TNF&#x003b1;-dependent matrix degradation, as indicated by Wilson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. TIMP-3, but not the other TIMPs, were able to inhibit the TNF&#x003b1;-induced GAG release and NITEGE production. This suggests that in the early three-day phase of meniscal proteoglycan degradation, aggrecanases must be involved. TIMPs are able to inhibit the active forms of almost all MMPs by binding to the C-terminal site of these enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, TIMP-3 additionally inhibits ADAMTS-4 and -5 activity, whereas TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 have no effect on or even increase the activity of aggrecanases at concentrations of 1 &#x003bc;M or less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. According to our mRNA study, ADAMTS-4 might be one of the aggrecanases involved in TNF&#x003b1;-dependent proteoglycan degradation in bovine meniscal tissue, even though final evidence is still missing. This is supported by the fact that TIMP-3 inhibited, whereas TIMP-1 and -2 increased, the TNF&#x003b1;-dependent GAG release (in contrast to TIMP-3, TIMP-1 and -2 are known to stimulate the activity of ADAMTS-4 under certain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]). ADAMTS-4 mRNA has also been found in degenerated human menisci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that there might be similar effects in the human meniscus. Other studies showed that ADAMTS-5 mRNA was expressed next to ADAMTS-4 in osteoarthritic rabbit menisci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that both aggrecanases may play a role in the degradation of meniscal tissue. However, in the present investigation there was a basal meniscal mRNA expression of ADAMTS-4 in the bovine meniscus which increased with TNF&#x003b1;-treatment, whereas ADAMTS-5 mRNA expression was low or not detectable.</p><p>We were able to localize the NITEGE fragment in meniscal tissue by immunostaining in TNF&#x003b1;-treated explants, while it was almost non-detectable in control tissue. This is another strong indicator for aggrecanase involvement, according to many articular cartilage studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Additionally, TNF&#x003b1;-dependent NITEGE-formation could be blocked by TIMP-3, while TIMP-1 and -2 had no inhibitory effects (not shown). TIMP-3 is not a specific aggrecanase inhibitor. It has to be mentioned that it also regulates the activity of members of the membrane-bound ADAM-family, sheddases (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase: ADAM-10, -12 and -17; TACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]). The importance of these enzymes should therefore also be investigated in future studies.</p><p>We found a significant TNF&#x003b1;-dependent increase in meniscal NO production, which could be blocked completely by the common NO synthetase inhibitor L-NMMA. Although NO has been described as a meniscal product in several joint diseases and as an important mediator of meniscal tissue degradation in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we did not see a stimulating influence of NO on the TNF&#x003b1;-induced GAG release or aggrecan cleavage. Our study suggests that NO is not involved in the early degradation of aggrecan in the meniscus. The slight but not significant increase in TNF&#x003b1;-induced GAG release after incubation with L-NMMA might reflect a protective function of endogenous NO in this context, as it has been shown previously by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>TNF&#x003b1;-treatment of meniscal tissue causes a reduced biosynthetic activity, release of GAG, degradation of aggrecan, and up-regulation of MMP-3 expression and aggrecanase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report, showing that aggrecanase activity might be involved in the early TNF&#x003b1;-mediated aggrecanolysis in the meniscus. Inhibition of aggrecanase activity or TNF&#x003b1;-activity might therefore help to prevent meniscal destruction. TNF&#x003b1; also induces NO production, but it remains unknown what role NO might play in meniscal proteoglycan destruction because there is no evidence for a definite influence of endogenous NO on GAG release or aggrecan cleavage at the NITEGE site in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADAMTS: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; ANOVA: analysis of variance; APMA: p-aminophenyl mercuric acetate; BSA: bovine serum albumin; C<sub>T</sub>: cycle of threshold; DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAG: glycosaminoglycan; IL: interleukin; L-NMMA: NG-monomethyl-L-arginine.monoacetate; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; NO: nitric oxide; OA: osteoarthritis; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; RT-PCR: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; TIMP: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HV made the acquisition of data and part of the analysis of the data, and was also involved in drafting of the manuscript.
