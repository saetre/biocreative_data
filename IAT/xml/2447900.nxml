However, direct evidence for the involvement of MAGUK proteins in synapse formation is lacking. In this study, we investigate the function of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), a MAGUK protein, in dendritic spine formation by RNA interference. Knockdown of CASK in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces spine density and shrinks dendritic spines. Our analysis of the time course of RNA interference and CASK overexpression experiments further suggests that CASK stabilizes or maintains spine morphology. Experiments using only the CASK PDZ domain or a mutant lacking the protein 4.1&#x02013;binding site indicate an involvement of CASK in linking transmembrane adhesion molecules and the actin cytoskeleton. We also find that CASK is SUMOylated. Conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) to CASK reduces the interaction between CASK and protein 4.1. Overexpression of a CASK&#x02013;SUMO1 fusion construct, which mimicks CASK SUMOylation, impairs spine formation. Our study suggests that CASK contributes to spinogenesis and that this is controlled by SUMOylation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CaMK, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; CASK, calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase; DIV, day in vitro; KS, Kolmogorov-Smirnov; MAGUK, membrane-associated guanylate kinase; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; SynCAM, synaptic cell adhesion molecule; TTX, tetrodotoxin.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In neurons, synapse formation is initially triggered by the interaction between pre- and postsynaptic plasma membranes. Several postsynaptic transmembrane proteins, including syndecan-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ethell and Yamaguchi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2007</xref>), neuroligin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nam and Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>), synaptic cell adhesion molecule (SynCAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biederer et al., 2002</xref>), and netrin G1 ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2006</xref>), have been shown to trigger synaptogenesis. Membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins, the scaffold proteins at synapses, interact with these membrane proteins. For instance, the C-terminal tails of neuroligin and netrin G1 ligand interact with the PDZ domains of PSD-95, the prototype MAGUK protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). The C-terminal tails of syndecan-2 and SynCAM bind to the single PDZ domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), another MAGUK protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsueh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biederer et al., 2002</xref>). The interactions with these synaptogenic factors suggest a potential role of PSD-95 and CASK in synapse formation. In this study, we investigate whether CASK directly regulates dendritic spinogenesis.</p><p>From the N terminus to the C terminus, the CASK protein consists of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)&#x02013;like, L27A, L27B, PDZ, SH3, protein 4.1&#x02013;binding, and guanylate kinase&#x02013;like domains. All of the domains of CASK function as protein&#x02013;protein interaction motifs (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsueh, 2006</xref>). Unlike PSD-95, which is highly concentrated at the postsynaptic density, CASK is widely distributed in different subcellular regions of neurons, including presynaptic buttons, postsynaptic sites, and nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsueh and Sheng, 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsueh et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2000</xref>). Via the interactions with its binding partners, CASK plays multiple roles in neurons. For instance, it forms an evolutionally conserved protein complex with Mint1/X11 and Veli/mLIN7/MALS through its N-terminal CaMK and L27 domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaech et al., 1998</xref>). The interactions with Mint1 and Veli further link CASK to KIF17b and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor 2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Setou et al., 2000</xref>) and regulate vesicle transport of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor to the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Setou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wong et al., 2002</xref>). This complex is involved in neurotransmitter release because knocking out Veli alters synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olsen et al., 2005</xref>). CASK also interacts with liprin-&#x003b1;2 through the CaMK and the first L27 domains. It has been suggested that the liprin-&#x003b1;&#x02013;CASK&#x02013;Veli complex is involved in recruitment of synaptic release machinery to the presynaptic active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olsen et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Syndecan-2, the first identified postsynaptic binding partner of the CASK PDZ domain, is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan. It is highly concentrated at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsueh et al., 1998</xref>), and its increased expression levels are correlated with synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ethell and Yamaguchi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsueh and Sheng, 1999a</xref>). Knockdown of endogenous syndecan-2 inhibits spine formation in mature hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). When syndecan-2 is overexpressed in cultured hippocampal neurons at 1&#x02013;2 d in vitro (DIV), it first induces filopodia formation at 4&#x02013;5 DIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2007</xref>) and then promotes dendritic spinogenesis at 8&#x02013;9 DIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ethell and Yamaguchi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). A syndecan-2 mutant lacking the last three amino acid residues, the PDZ binding motif, loses the ability to promote spine formation but still efficiently induces filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). These studies suggest that the PDZ binding of syndecan-2 is important for the transformation of spines from filopodia or the maintenance of spines rather than the initiation of spinogenesis.</p><p>Because CASK also interacts with protein 4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biederer and Sudhof, 2001</xref>) and because the function of protein 4.1 is to bind spectrin, a postsynaptic density protein required for synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sytnyk et al., 2006</xref>), and to promote the interaction between spectrin and actin cytoskeleton (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoover and Bryant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bretscher et al., 2002</xref>), it is reasonable to speculate that the role of CASK in spinogenesis is to link the plasma membrane proteins, such as syndecan-2 and SynCAM, to the actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we test this hypothesis using cultured hippocampal neurons. We also investigate whether the function of CASK in spinogenesis is regulated by posttranslational modification. Echoing recent exciting studies showing the role of SUMOylation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shalizi et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Niekerk et al., 2007</xref>), we found that CASK is SUMOylated in neurons and that SUMOylation affects the interaction between CASK and protein 4.1 and alters spine morphology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>CASK is required for spinogenesis</title><p>To examine the function of CASK in spine formation, RNA interference was used to knock down endogenous CASK in cultured neurons. The efficiency and specificity of a CASK short hairpin RNA (shRNA) construct were first examined in HEK and COS cells. Because the sequence of this CASK shRNA construct is identical for all human, rat, and mouse CASK genes, this shRNA was expected to knock down all human, rat, and mouse CASK genes. Compared with a nonsilencing control shRNA with no sequence homology to any mammalian gene, CASK shRNA reduced the expression of endogenous human CASK in HEK cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and exogenous Myc-tagged rat CASK in COS cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The CASK shRNA was specific for CASK because it did not affect expression of other MAGUK proteins, such as rat PSD-95 and SAP97 in COS cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We then examined the effect of CASK shRNA in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. At 14 DIV, cultured neurons were cotransfected with GFP-actin and either CASK shRNA or the nonsilencing control at a ratio of 3:5. Neurons were then analyzed by immunostaining at 16 DIV. CASK shRNA knocked down endogenous CASK in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712094/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712094/DC1</ext-link>). In general, reduction of CASK expression did not influence the global morphology of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). However, in higher magnification images, compared with the nonsilencing construct, neurons transfected with CASK shRNA at 13&#x02013;14 DIV had reduced spine density (Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] test; D &#x0003d; 0.241 and P &#x0003d; 0.005), shortened spines (KS test; D &#x0003d; 0.327 and P &#x0003c; 0.001), and narrowed spine heads (KS test; D &#x0003d; 0.213 and P &#x0003c; 0.001) at 18&#x02013;19 DIV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). To rule out an off-target effect of CASK shRNA on spine formation, rescue experiments were performed. Overexpression of a CASK silent mutant, which was not affected by CASK shRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), rescued the inhibitory effect of CASK shRNA on spine density (KS test; shRNA vs. shRNA &#x0002b; mutant, D &#x0003d; 0.221 and P &#x0003d; 0.05; nonsilencing vs. shRNA &#x0002b; mutant, D &#x0003d; 0.109 and P &#x0003d; 0.774), spine length (KS test; shRNA vs. shRNA &#x0002b; mutant, D &#x0003d; 0.299 and P &#x0003c; 0.001; nonsilencing vs. shRNA &#x0002b; mutant, D &#x0003d; 0.051 and P &#x0003d; 0.32), and width of the spine head (KS test; shRNA vs. shRNA &#x0002b; mutant, D &#x0003d; 0.17 and P &#x0003c; 0.001; nonsilencing vs. shRNA &#x0002b; mutant, D &#x0003d; 0.048 and P &#x0003d; 0.38; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>), indicating a specific effect of CASK shRNA. These results suggested that reduction of CASK expression in neurons resulted in fewer and smaller dendritic spines.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Knockdown of endogenous CASK prevents dendritic spine formation in cultured hippocampal neurons.</bold> (A) CASK shRNA reduced the expression of endogenous CASK in HEK cells.

In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, cell morphology was outlined by GFP-actin, which is highly enriched at dendritic filopodia and spines. To rule out the role of GFP-actin in the effect of CASK shRNA, we cotransfected GFP with either CASK shRNA construct or nonsilencing control in the following experiments. Similar to the results with GFP-actin, neurons expressing GFP and CASK shRNA had fewer spines at 18 DIV (KS test; D &#x0003d; 0.211 and P &#x0003d; 0.002; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>).

However, there were no significant differences in cumulative probability distribution between CASK shRNA and nonsilencing control in the length and width of spines (KS test; for length, D &#x0003d; 0.034 and P &#x0003d; 0.344; for width, D &#x0003d; 0.017 and P &#x0003d; 0.978; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>).

Because the protein 4.1&#x02013;binding site covers only around 10 amino acid residues, it was inconvenient to simply express the protein 4.1&#x02013;binding site alone to interrupt the interaction between endogenous CASK and protein 4.1. Instead, a CASK mutant lacking the protein 4.1&#x02013;binding motif was introduced into cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), and quantitative analyses showed that compared with GFP alone, overexpression of this CASK&#x00394;p4.1 mutant also reduced the density and length of spines and the width of spine heads (KS test; for density, D &#x0003d; 0.447 and P &#x0003c; 0.001; for length, D &#x0003d; 0.114 and P &#x0003d; 0.025; for width, D &#x0003d; 0.231 and P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>).</p><p>The effect of these CASK mutants in spine morphology was also examined in the presence of CASK shRNA. Similar to the results in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the morphology and density of dendritic spines were impaired by reducing the protein levels of endogenous CASK (nonsilencing &#x0002b; vector GW1 vs. CASK shRNA &#x0002b; vector GW1; for density, D &#x0003d; 0.539 and P &#x0003c; 0.001; for length, D &#x0003d; 0.317 and P &#x0003c; 0.001; for width, D &#x0003d; 0.283 and P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). Overexpression of the CASK PDZ domain or CASK&#x00394;p4.1 mutant did not rescue the spine phenotype seen in CASK knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). These results suggested that the PDZ domain and protein 4.1&#x02013;binding sites of CASK have to be present in the same molecule to perform their functions in spine morphology. When CASK was overexpressed, the spine density was increased (nonsilencing control &#x0002b; vector control vs. nonsilencing control &#x0002b; CASK; D &#x0003d; 0.406 and P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). However, CASK overexpression did not appear to further enlarge spine heads (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). Collectively with the result in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, it suggests that CASK functions as a molecule stabilizing or maintaining spine morphology rather than a factor triggering spine enlargement.</p></sec><sec><title>CASK proteins are SUMOylated</title><p>We then wonder whether the activity of CASK in spinogenesis is regulated by posttranslational modification. According to sequence analysis using the program SUMOPlot (Abgent), several putative SUMOylation sites on CASK protein were predicted, including K20, K60, K70, K159, K192, K615, K648, K716, K762, and K763. Among these sites, K648 and K716 are very close to the protein 4.1&#x02013;binding site (residues 685&#x02013;697 of rat CASK; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Because SUMOylation usually modifies target protein&#x02013;protein interaction, distribution, or activity, we wondered whether CASK is SUMOylated and whether CASK SUMOylation affects the interaction between CASK and protein 4.1 and thus regulates the function of CASK in spinogenesis. In mammals, four small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) have been identified, SUMO1&#x02013;4. Among them, SUMO4 is the least studied. Whether SUMO1, SUMO2, or SUMO3 are conjugated to CASK proteins was investigated by cotransfecting CASK and Myc-tagged SUMOs into COS cells followed by immunoprecipitation using CASK antibody. In addition to 110-kD full-length CASK protein, an extra protein species at &#x0223c;140&#x02013;150 kD was also revealed by CASK antibody from cells transfected with Myc-SUMO1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, top; arrow). To confirm that this extra protein band represented SUMOylated CASK, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with Myc tag antibody. A prominent Myc tag immunoreactivity was present in the product precipitated by CASK antibody from cells cotransfected with CASK and Myc-SUMO1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, bottom; arrow). These data support SUMO modification of CASK in COS cells. Although SUMO2 and SUMO3 could also be conjugated with CASK, the efficiency was much lower than for SUMO1. Therefore, we focused on SUMO1 in the following experiments.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>CASK is modified by SUMO1 at residue K679.</bold> (A) A schematic diagram of CASK, CASK deletion mutants, and SUMO1-CASK fusions.

The deletion of SH3 domain by removing amino acid residues 598&#x02013;682 of rat CASK impaired CASK SUMOylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). From the computational prediction, K648 is the only SUMOylation site within this region. However, a K648R mutation was not able to abolish the SUMOylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). We then looked closer at the sequence in this region and predicted residue K679 to be a potential SUMOylation site.

Coimmunoprecipitation was performed using FLAG antibody.

Perhaps CASK SUMOylation in COS cells was underestimated because deSUMOylation may occur immediately after SUMOylated proteins performed their functions in cells and because isopeptidase activity is extremely high after cell lysis.

We also identified SUMOylation as a posttranslational modification of CASK that regulates the interaction between CASK and protein 4.1 and, thus, modulates spinogenesis. In addition to spinogenesis, CASK also acts presynaptically to regulate synaptogenesis through a different mechanism: CDK5 phosphorylates residues S51 and S395 of CASK proteins, which enhances the interaction between CASK and N-type calcium channels but impairs the interaction between CASK and liprin-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Samuels et al., 2007</xref>). Because CASK is involved in synaptic targeting of N-type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maximov and Bezprozvanny, 2002</xref>), phosphorylation of CASK by CDK5 modulates presynaptic calcium influx and controls synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Samuels et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, through different binding partners and different posttranslational modifications, CASK regulates synaptogenesis in both pre- and postsynaptic ways.</p><p>Recently, CASK knockout mice have been produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atasoy et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with the phenotype of mice carrying an insertional mutation in the CASK gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laverty and Wilson, 1998</xref>), deletion of the CASK gene results in lethality within 1 d after birth. Although glutamatergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential frequency is increased and GABAergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential frequency is decreased, cultured cortical neurons isolated from CASK-deficient mice form synapses at a similar density to wild-type neurons at 14 DIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atasoy et al., 2007</xref>). This is not the only case in which the results of a mouse knockout conflict with those of RNA interference knockdown. Gene target mutation of PSD-95 fails to alter glutamatergic synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Migaud et al., 1998</xref>). However, knockdown of PSD-95 in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces synaptic targeting of glutamate receptor 2 and the event frequency of AMPAR excitatory postsynaptic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elias et al., 2006</xref>). Compensation of the phenotype of PSD-95 knockout mice by other MAGUK proteins, such as PSD-93, has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elias et al., 2006</xref>). For CASK, it is also possible that molecular redundancy among CASK and other MAGUK proteins (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsueh, 2006</xref>) play a role in modulating the spinogenesis phenotype of CASK knockout mice. Another possibility is the result of selection in vitro during culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atasoy et al. (2007)</xref> found more apoptotic cells in the CASK-deficient brain, suggesting a role of CASK in neuronal survival. In the cerebral cortex, some neurons express higher levels of CASK, whereas other neurons express very low levels of CASK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsueh et al., 1998</xref>). When cortical neurons are cultured in vitro for 14 d, this may select neurons that originally have a very low level of CASK. The difference in spinogenesis between CASK-deficient neurons and wild-type neurons therefore cannot be found after 14 d in culture. In our experiment, CASK was knocked down at 13&#x02013;14 DIV; the effect of CASK on spinogenesis was then monitored at 18&#x02013;19 DIV. This can avoid the secondary effect of long-term selection during culture.</p><p>In our previous study, we found that two cytoplasmic motifs of syndecan-2 are involved in two sequential processes of spinogenesis: the C1 region of syndecan-2 interacts with neurofibromin and promotes filopodia formation; the C2 region then transforms filopodia to dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). The results indicated that the C2-binding proteins contribute to the transformation of dendritic spines from filopodia. Several C2-binding proteins have been identified, including CASK, syntenin, synbindin, and synectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grootjans et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsueh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ethell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2000</xref>). Although we have not tested other C2-binding proteins, in this study, we show that CASK contributes to dendritic spinogenesis. Our results suggest that both the PDZ domain and the protein 4.1&#x02013;binding motif are involved in spine formation. Because protein 4.1 binds spectrin, an abundant component at the postsynaptic density, and thus promotes the interaction between spectrin and filamentous actin (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoover and Bryant, 2000</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bretscher et al., 2002</xref>), CASK may act as a linker between transmembrane proteins and the actin cytoskeleton and, therefore, stabilize dendritic spines. Because CASK and protein 4.1 are widely expressed in different tissues, SUMOylation of CASK may also regulate the interaction between CASK and protein 4.1 in nonneuronal cells. CASK-deficient mice show a cleft palate phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laverty and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atasoy et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this phenotype, SUMO1 haploinsufficiency has been shown to result in cleft palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkuraya et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to spinogenesis, it is likely that the SUMOylation of CASK also contributes to craniofacial development.</p><p>Our results also suggest that CASK tends to modulate spinogenesis late. At 15 DIV, 2 d after the expression of CASK shRNA, CASK protein levels were knocked down (Fig. S2). Longer incubation times, such as 3 or 5 d after transfection of CASK shRNA, did not appear to further reduce the CASK protein levels (Fig. S2). However, the spine morphology of CASK knockdown neurons was comparable with neurons transfected with vector control at 15 DIV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). One extra day later (16 DIV), the effect of CASK knockdown was first observed. A delayed response to CASK knockdown in synapse formation is consistent with our previous observation that the PDZ binding of syndecan-2 is not required for filopodia formation, the initial stage of spine formation, but is essential for transformation from filopodia to spines, the stage of spine maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). It is very likely that CASK is mainly involved in the maturation or stabilization of dendritic spines by cross-linking adhesion molecules and the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with this idea, overexpression of CASK in cultured hippocampal neurons increased the spine number but did not further enlarge the spine heads. It is possible that CASK stabilizes the labile spines and therefore increases the total spine number.</p><p>SUMOylation is an important posttranslational modification that modulates protein&#x02013;protein interaction, subcellular distribution, and function of its target proteins. Recently, SUMOylation has been shown to regulate synapse function and formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin et al., 2007</xref>). Kainate stimulation triggers SUMOylation of the kainate-sensitive glutamate receptor 6 and thus regulates endocytosis of glutamate receptor 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin et al., 2007</xref>). Kainate receptor&#x02013;mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents are therefore decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin et al., 2007</xref>). Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), a family of neuronal activity&#x02013; and calcium-dependent transcription factors, is also regulated by SUMO conjugation. SUMOylation at residue K403 of MEF2A promotes dendritic claw differentiation of cerebellar granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shalizi et al., 2006</xref>). MEF2 may control the expression of <italic>arc</italic> and <italic>synGAP</italic> genes and therefore regulate synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flavell et al., 2006</xref>). Here, our data suggest another mechanism underlying SUMOylation regulation of synapse formation. SUMOylation of CASK modulates the interaction between CASK and protein 4.1, which may therefore down-regulate the association between CASK and the actin cytoskeleton. Although SUMOylated CASK proteins were still localized at synapses, they did not appear to be associated with the synaptic membrane. Instead, they were mainly present in the synaptic cytosol. Because overexpression of C-SUMO1-CASK impairs dendritic spine morphology, it suggests that SUMO1 conjugation leads to dissociation of CASK from postsynaptic plasma membrane. It may therefore uncouple adhesion molecules and actin cytoskeleton and destabilize dendritic spines.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies provide evidence that in addition to a presynaptic mechanism, CASK regulates synaptogenesis postsynaptically. CASK may link transmembrane adhesion molecules with actin cytoskeleton and therefore stabilize or maintain dendritic spine morphology. SUMOylation of CASK modulates the interaction between CASK and protein 4.1 and contributes to spinogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>CASK and PSD-95 monoclonal antibodies are available from Millipore.

Myc-tagged CASK mutant resistant to CASK shRNA was mutated at residues 786, 789, and 792 of rat CASK by the QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmid expressing the HA-tagged PDZ domain was constructed by inserting the PDZ domain (residues 483&#x02013;568 of rat CASK) into vector GW1-HA.
