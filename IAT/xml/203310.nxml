Regulated transcription of such genes is achieved by transcription factors that bind specific regulatory sequences in the genome and recruit co-activators or co-repressors to the promoters of target genes. Transcription factors function modularly and can be classified according to the structure of their DNA binding domain.</p><p>Many broad complex, tramtrack, bric &#x000e0; brac&#x0002f;poxviruses and zinc-finger (BTB&#x0002f;POZ) proteins are transcriptional regulators. The BTB&#x0002f;POZ domain is an evolutionarily conserved protein&#x02013;protein interaction domain that is involved in homophilic and heterophilic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c2">2</xref>). Analysis of promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) dimers shows that a charged pocket is formed at the BTB&#x0002f;POZ dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c3">3</xref>). Melnick <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c4">4</xref>) showed that the charged pockets of PLZF and Bcl-6 are required for recruitment of corepressor-HDAC complexes by directly interacting with N-CoR and SMRT. The majority of BTB&#x0002f;POZ transcriptional regulators also contain C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger motifs, one of the most common DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c7">7</xref>).</p><p>The functionally related bric &#x000e0; brac 1 (Bab1) and bric &#x000e0; brac 2 (Bab2) proteins are nuclear BTB&#x0002f;POZ proteins that are required during the development of adult ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>), legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c11">11</xref>), antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c12">12</xref>) and abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c13">13</xref>) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Bab1 and Bab2 can homo- and hetero-dimerize <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c14">14</xref>). The BTB&#x0002f;POZ domain of Bab proteins binds to BIP-2&#x0002f;TAF3, which is a component of TFIID, suggesting that the Bab proteins can interact directly with the basal transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c15">15</xref>). There is no detectable zinc-finger motif in either Bab protein. However, both Bab proteins share a strongly conserved domain that we call the Bab conserved domain (BabCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>).</p><p>The BabCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>) contains a pipsqueak (psq) motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c16">16</xref>) and an AT-Hook motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c17">17</xref>). The psq motif was first identified in the Psq protein which contains four tandem repeats of this motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c16">16</xref>). It has been shown that three of these repeats are required for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c18">18</xref>). A systematical search for the psq motif in protein databases has shown that it is evolutionarily conserved and present in several <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins that also have BTB domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c19">19</xref>).</p><p>The AT-Hook motif is a positively charged stretch of 10 amino acids containing the invariant core peptide sequence RGRP and is usually flanked by basic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c20">20</xref>). It binds to DNA through the minor groove with the optimal DNA binding site centered at the sequence AA(T&#x0002f;A)T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c21">21</xref>). The AT-Hook was first identified in the high mobility group of non-histone chromosomal proteins, called HMGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c17">17</xref>). Since its discovery, the AT-Hook motif has been found in either single or multiple copies in a large number of DNA binding proteins, many of which are transcription factors or components of chromatin remodeling complexes from a wide range of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c22">22</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we show that the BabCD of both Bab1 and Bab2 is able to bind DNA through a composite DNA binding domain. They bind <italic>in vitro</italic> to several DNA fragments from the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of <italic>bab1</italic> and <italic>bab2</italic> genes. Our data indicates that the BabCD binds specifically to A&#x0002f;T-rich regions and that its optimum binding site contains TA or TAA repeats. The psq motif and AT-Hook motif within the BabCD are both required for its DNA binding activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Immunostaining of <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland polytene chromosomes</title><p>Salivary glands were dissected from wild-type and homozygous <italic>bab</italic><sup><italic>AR07</italic></sup> mutant larvae at the third instar.

Immunostainings of squashed polytene chromosomes using this Bab2 antibody shows that Bab2 binds to many sites on the chromosome arms but not to the chromocenters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f1">1</xref>A). This staining pattern was not seen on chromosomes from <italic>bab</italic> mutant larvae that lack Bab2 (data not shown), which served as a control, demonstrating that the staining pattern indeed represents the binding pattern of the Bab protein. Approximately 66 sites are stained, and the position of the 12 most intensely stained bands are listed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f1">1</xref>. One of the strongest sites corresponds to the <italic>bab</italic> locus, which maps to 61F1-2 at the tip of the left arm of the third chromosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f1">1</xref>B and C). This observation indicates that the Bab proteins are chromosomal proteins and are able to bind directly or indirectly to DNA. It also suggests that the chromosomal binding sites identify loci whose expression is regulated by the Bab proteins and that the Bab proteins regulate the expression of the <italic>bab</italic> genes.</p></sec><sec><title>The BabCD is highly conserved between the Bab proteins of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic>, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> and <italic>Apis mellifera</italic></title><p>The <italic>bab</italic> locus is composed of two paralogous genes, <italic>bab1</italic> and <italic>bab2</italic>. The corresponding proteins Bab1 and Bab2 are nuclear and have a BTB&#x0002f;POZ domain in their N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>). However, in contrast to many other known BTB&#x0002f;POZ domains containing nuclear proteins, neither Bab1 nor Bab2 contain a zinc-finger motif. The Bab1 and Bab2 proteins have a second domain in common, the BabCD that is 183 amino acids long and shows 78&#x00025; identity between the two Bab proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>). A search of the genome of <italic>A.gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c26">26</xref>) and of a library of EST sequences of <italic>A.mellifera</italic> (Honey Bee Brain EST Project, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://titan.biotec.uiuc.edu/bee/honeybee_project.htm">http://titan.biotec.uiuc.edu/bee/honeybee_project.htm</ext-link>) revealed that a <italic>bab</italic> gene is present in these species. The presence of only one <italic>bab</italic> gene in the genome of <italic>A.gambiae</italic> suggests that the duplication of the <italic>bab</italic> gene might have occurred after the divergence of mosquitoes and flies. We have also identified part of the genomic sequence of a <italic>bab</italic> gene from <italic>D.virilis</italic> from a genomic library (a gift from Ron Blackman, University of Illinois) (C.Lours, unpublished data). A comparison of the BabCD of these different insect species shows that this domain is highly conserved as at least 85&#x00025; of the amino acids are identical and most of the differences represent conservative exchanges (see Supplementary Material), indicating that the BabCD must have functional importance in Bab proteins.</p><p>The BabCD contains two known motifs, a psq motif and an AT-Hook motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>). The psq motif has been defined by comparison of the Bab proteins with the Psq domains of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins Tkr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c27">27</xref>), Piefke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c28">28</xref>), Ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c29">29</xref>) and Psq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c16">16</xref>). The sequence similarity between the psq motifs of these different proteins is low compared with the psq motifs of Bab proteins of different insect species that are almost identical (<italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, <italic>A.gambiae</italic>, <italic>A.mellifera</italic> and <italic>D.virilis)</italic>. The psq domains of Bab 1 and Bab2 of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> differ by only two amino acids (see Supplementary Material). The sequence of the 10 amino acid long Bab AT-Hook domain is perfectly conserved between these different insect species and contains the consensus core RGRP sequence surrounded by several basic amino acids (four of six). These motifs have been shown to be involved in the DNA binding activity of many proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c18">18</xref>). We therefore speculated that the BabCD could function as a DNA binding domain.</p></sec><sec><title>The BabCD specifically binds to DNA <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Since the Bab2 protein is localized to the <italic>bab</italic> locus on polytene chromosomes, we decided to scan several genomic subclones covering the <italic>bab</italic> locus to test for direct binding of the BabCD to DNA. To test DNA binding activity, the BabCD of Bab1 protein (BabCD1) was expressed as a GST fusion protein in <italic>E.coli</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f2">2</xref>A, lane 1) as well as GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f2">2</xref>A, lane 4). These two proteins were purified using glutathione&#x02013;agarose beads (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f2">2</xref>, lanes 3 and 6). The purified GST&#x02013;BabCD1 and GST were used for IVPO experiments. The results obtained with HaeIII fragments from either an 8 kb subclone of the <italic>bab1</italic> intron 1 or a 2.5 kb subclone of the <italic>bab2</italic> intron 1 are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f2">2</xref>B and C, respectively. Five fragments of the <italic>bab1</italic> subclone ranging from 209 to 1172 bp are specifically retained by the BabCD1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f2">2</xref>B, lane 3), and two fragments of the <italic>bab2</italic> subclone, which are 222 and 342 bp in size, are retained by the BabCD1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f2">2</xref>C, lane 3). No plasmid sequences are retained, and not all the <italic>bab</italic> genomic fragments are retained under these conditions. The GST protein alone did not retain any of the DNA fragments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f2">2</xref>B, lane 2 and C, lane 2). Together, these data show that the BabCD1 binds specifically <italic>in vitro</italic> to DNA sequences of the <italic>bab</italic> locus and that the BabCD is sufficient for this specific binding.</p><p>The BabCDs of Bab1 and Bab2 are 78&#x00025; identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>). To test whether both have the same binding specificity, the fusion protein GST&#x02013;BabCD2 was expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> and IVPO experiments were performed with the 2.5 kb <italic>bab2</italic> subclone. BabCD2 specifically retains the 222 and 342 bp fragments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f2">2</xref>C, lane 4), that are also bound by the BabCD1 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f2">2</xref>C, lane 3). This result shows that the BabCD is a DNA binding domain and suggests that the BabCDs of Bab1 and Bab2 have the same DNA binding specificity. We have concluded that the BabCD is a DNA binding domain, and is responsible for specific DNA binding.</p></sec><sec><title>The BabCD binds to TA- or TAA-rich sequences</title><p>To examine in detail which sequences are bound by the BabCD, DNase I footprinting experiments were carried out using the BabCD1 protein and some of the retained genomic fragments identified. The 209 and the 347 bp <italic>bab1</italic> fragments and the 222 bp <italic>bab2</italic> fragment were used as probes (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f2">2</xref>B and C). Two regions (C1 and D1) of the 209 bp <italic>bab1</italic> fragment were protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f3">3</xref>A), and two footprints, called A1 and B1 were detected on the 347 bp <italic>bab1</italic> fragment (data not shown). The 222 bp <italic>bab2</italic> fragment showed two footprints, called A2 and B2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f3">3</xref>B). The protected sites are &#x0223c;20 bp in length and T&#x0002f;A-rich containing several TA or TAA repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f3">3</xref>C). Footprints like C1&#x0002f;D1 and A2&#x0002f;B2 are separated by &#x0003c;20 bp. Thus, the 209 and the 347 bp <italic>bab1</italic> and the 222 bp <italic>bab2</italic> fragments contain several contiguous Bab binding sites.</p><p>A different approach, CAST, was used to identify a consensus binding site for the BabCD. The amplified DNA was selected by IVPO. After 10 rounds of binding site selection, 27 independent fragments were sequenced. The same data were obtained in a second CAST experiment in which the amplified fragments were selected by gel-shift. These experiments show that selected targets of the BabCD have a very high A&#x0002f;T content. Analysis using the motif elicitation method (MEME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c25">25</xref>) revealed similarities between selected targets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f3">3</xref>D): almost all the sequences contain repeats of TAA or TA with the possibility of permutations between A and T. These results are consistent with our footprinting data from <italic>bab</italic> genomic fragments. The analysis of footprint sequences with MEME gave similar results, revealing that the BabCD binds specifically to DNA containing TA or TAA repeats.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding specificity of the BabCD domain</title><p>Repeats of TA and TAA motifs are found in BabCD cognate binding sites. In order to better define the binding specificity of the BabCD, we conducted EMSAs with GST&#x02013;BabCD1 protein and synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides containing one, two, three or four TAA repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>A). The BabCD1 does not bind to an oligonucleotide containing a single TAA motif (1TAA) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3) and binds very weakly to an oligonucleotide containing two TAA motifs (2TAA) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6). The presence of a retarded complex indicates that the BabCD1 binds strongly to oligonucleotides containing three or four TAA motifs (3TAA or 4TAA) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>A, lanes 8, 9 and 11, 12). The GST protein alone does not bind to any of these oligonucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>A, lanes 1, 4, 7 and 10). The BabCD1 shows a higher affinity for 4TAA than for 3TAA oligonucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>A, lanes 8 and 11). A 30-fold molar excess of an unlabeled 4TAA oligonucleotide completely abolished the labeled retarded complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>B, lane 3), whereas addition of a 100-fold excess of an oligonucleotide containing an ecdysone binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>B, lane 8) did not significantly compete with the 4TAA oligonucleotides for BabCD binding. These results confirm that the BabCD binds to TAA repeats and that more than two repeats are required for efficient binding <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, the BabCD1 binds to an oligonucleotide containing five TA repeats (5TA) with the same affinity as to a 3TAA oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Oligonucleotides containing less than five TA repeats are not recognized (data not shown). In our gel-shift assays, the BabCD thus equally recognizes TA or TAA repeats if there is a minimal length of at least 9 nt.</p><p>Mutations were introduced into oligonucleotides containing 3TAA repeats. Introducing one cytosine in the center as in oligonucleotides 3TAA<sup>&#x0002a;1TCA</sup> or 3TAA<sup>&#x0002a;1TAC</sup> completely abolishes binding by the BabCD1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>C, lanes 6 and 7) as does the replacement of only one T by an A as in the oligonucleotide 3TAA<sup>&#x0002a;1AAA</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>C, lane 5). In oligonucleotide 3TAA<sup>&#x0002a;1TTA</sup>, the central TAA is replaced by the complementary sequence TTA, a change that increases the affinity of the BabCD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>C, lane 4) to a similar level as for the 4TAA oligonucleotide. Thus, the BabCD does not bind to A&#x0002f;T-rich sites that are interrupted by a C or a G and does not recognize a monotonous stretch of A or T. Moreover, BabCD binds neither to a 5GA- nor to a 4GAA-containing oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>C, lanes 8 and 9). A series of competition EMSAs were done in order to compare the affinity of BabCD1 for the 4TAA, 5TA and 3TAA<sup>TTA</sup> oligonucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>D). The increase of cold 4TAA (lanes 2&#x02013;4), 3TAA<sup>TTA</sup> (lanes 6&#x02013;8) or 5TA (lanes 10&#x02013;12) oligonucleotides leads to a decrease of labeled 4TAA oligonucleotides bound by the BabCD. Each shift was quantified and the percentage of labeled 4TAA oligonucleotides bound by the BabCD1 was calculated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f4">4</xref>D). A 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled 4TAA oligonucleotide is sufficient to almost completely abolish the retarded complex containing the labeled oligonucleotide, showing the specificity of the interaction. A 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled 4TAA oligonucleotide drastically reduced the labeled retarded complex; a 30- and 100-fold molar excess of 3TAA<sup>TTA</sup> oligonucleotide and 5TA oligonucleotide, respectively, were required to obtain the same reduction. These results reveal that the affinity of the BabCD for oligonucleotides decreases from 4TAA to 3TAA<sup>TTA</sup> to 5TA oligonucleotides confirming that the BabCD binds to different target sites with different affinities. Together, these data indicate that the BabCD binds specifically to uninterrupted repeats of TA or TAA and that the optimal binding site is a repeat of three or four TAA motifs.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding is mediated by both the Psq motif and AT-Hook motif of the BabCD</title><p>The BabCD, as defined by sequence comparison, is a large domain that consists of 183 amino acids. We wanted to determine whether the entire domain is involved in the DNA binding activity, and more specifically, whether the psq motif and&#x0002f;or the AT-Hook motif might be involved in DNA binding. To address this issue a series of BabCD1 deletion constructs were produced and tested with IVPO using the HaeIII fragments of the 2.5 kb <italic>bab2</italic> subclone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f5">5</xref>). Deletions BabCD<sub>151</sub> and BabCD<sub>123</sub> that truncate the N-terminal region of the BabCD, but keep the psq and AT-Hook motifs intact, retain DNA binding activity. BabCD<sub>93</sub>, which lacks part of the psq motif, has lost DNA binding ability. BabCD<sub>119</sub>, BabCD<sub>73</sub> and BabCD<sub>59</sub> which have an intact psq motif but lack the AT-Hook motif are also unable to bind DNA. Thus, only a BabCD that contains both the psq and AT-Hook motif is able to bind DNA, indicating that both motifs are required for the DNA binding function of the BabCD. Point mutations were introduced in either one or the other motif and the ability of the mutated BabCD to bind to DNA was tested.</p><p>In the Psq protein, the DNA binding domain consists of four tandem repeats of the psq motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c16">16</xref>). At least three psq motifs are required for the DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c18">18</xref>). The single psq motif of the BabCD appears to be required for DNA binding, since BabCD<sub>92</sub>, which has the AT-Hook but lacks a part of the psq domain, is not able to bind to DNA; whereas BabCD<sub>123</sub>, which contains both the psq and the AT-Hook motifs, is able to bind to DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f5">5</xref>). The psq motif of Bab1 and Bab2 is likely to be composed of three &#x003b1; helices (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f6">6</xref>A). Mutations disrupting the first and the second helix of the BabCD1 psq motif were made (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f6">6</xref>A). These mutated proteins were tested in EMSAs using labeled 3TAA and 4TAA oligonucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f6">6</xref>B). Although BabCD1 protein strongly binds to these oligonucleotides, neither BabCD<sup>AI576GP</sup> which destroys helix1 nor BabCD<sup>A590P</sup> which destroys helix2 are able to bind DNA. These data indicate that the integrity of the unique psq domain of the BabCD is important for specific binding to DNA.</p><p>The AT-Hook motif is composed of a short basic amino acid sequence containing the motifs GRGRP or PRGRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c20">20</xref>). The conserved amino acids RGR in the AT-Hook core motif have been changed to DGR or DGD in the proteins BabCD<sup>AT-Hook1</sup> and BabCD<sup>AT-Hook2</sup>, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f6">6</xref>D). These mutated BabCD1 proteins were not able to bind and shift a target site in EMSAs using the labeled 4TAA oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f6">6</xref>C), indicating that the AT-Hook motif is necessary for the DNA binding activity of the BabCD and that the Psq motif is not sufficient. The anti-tumor drug distamycin selectively binds to AT-rich DNA via minor groove interactions and effectively competes with AT-Hook proteins such as High Motility Group protein A (HMGA) proteins for DNA binding to AT-rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c30">30</xref>). Binding of the BabCD to the 4TAA oligonucleotide is abolished by distamycin in EMSA experiments (data not shown) indicating that the BabCD binds to this AT-rich target site through the minor groove. It is presumably the AT-Hook of the BabCD that is involved in DNA binding to the minor groove of DNA. In summary, our data show that the psq and AT-Hook motifs are both necessary for the DNA binding activity of the BabCD.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Bab1 and Bab2 belong to the family of nuclear BTB&#x0002f;POZ domain proteins and are required during metamorphosis for proper development and morphogenesis of ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>), legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c11">11</xref>), antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c12">12</xref>) and abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c13">13</xref>) of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. Many BTB&#x0002f;POZ proteins are transcriptional regulators and a large number contain, in addition to this N-terminal protein&#x02013;protein interaction motif, a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c33">33</xref>). There is no detectable zinc-finger motif in the two Bab proteins, although the Bab2 protein binds to several discrete sites on the polytene chromosomes suggesting that it can bind to DNA. We show here that the BabCD, a second conserved domain in the Bab proteins, is a sequence-specific DNA binding domain. The BabCDs of Bab1 and Bab2 can bind sequences that contain several TA or TAA repeats. This domain contains an AT-Hook and a psq motif which are both necessary for DNA binding. It had been previously determined that zinc-finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c33">33</xref>), basic leucine zipper (bZip) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c34">34</xref>) or Psq domains &#x0005b;in the case of Psq and Pfk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c19">19</xref>)&#x0005d; function as DNA binding domains of BTB&#x0002f;POZ proteins. Here we reveal a new type of DNA binding domain which is a combination between a psq motif and an AT-Hook motif.</p><p>The AT-Hook motif is primarily found in HMGA proteins, which, like other HMG proteins, are thought to function as architectural elements that modify the structure of DNA and chromatin to facilitate various DNA-dependent activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c17">17</xref>). The AT-Hook motifs of HMGA proteins bind specifically to the minor groove of stretches of A&#x0002f;T-rich DNA with the optimal DNA binding site centered at the sequence AA(T&#x0002f;A)T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c20">20</xref>). High-affinity HMGA binding sites have two or three appropriately spaced A&#x0002f;T tracts allowing at least two AT-Hooks to bind to DNA, indicating that multiple AT-Hooks are required in HMGA proteins for high-affinity binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c21">21</xref>). We have shown that in the BabCD, a single AT-Hook, in combination with a psq domain, is required for DNA binding. In several proteins a single AT-Hook is associated with an additional DNA binding domain, such as a homeodomain, ETS domain or zinc finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c20">20</xref>). It has been postulated that in these proteins the AT-Hook modulates the specificity and the affinity of the associated domain through its interaction in the minor groove. We also favor this hypothesis for the BabCD as we have shown that distamycin prevents the binding of the BabCD to its DNA target sites.</p><p>The Psq domain of the Psq protein has been shown to specifically recognize the sequence GAGAG, with three of the four psq motifs being required for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c18">18</xref>). There is only one psq motif in the BabCD, which we have shown to be required for DNA binding activity. However, the BabCD has a binding specificity that is different from Psq, as it binds to TA- or TAA-rich sites and is not able to bind to GA or GAA sites. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> there are nine BTB&#x0002f;POZ proteins that do not contain a zinc-finger motif but do contain one or more psq motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c19">19</xref>). Two of these proteins, Psq and Pfk, have three or more psq motifs, the seven others have only a single psq motif. We have shown that an AT-Hook motif is required in addition to a psq motif for the DNA binding activity of the BabCD. We believe that in BTB&#x0002f;POZ proteins containing a single psq motif, this motif is not sufficient to bind to a specific DNA sequence, but requires an additional motif for specific binding. Of the seven <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins that contain a single psq motif, only the two Bab proteins and the protein encoded by the <italic>CG3726</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c35">35</xref>) contain an AT-Hook motif. Whether the four remaining proteins contain alternative DNA binding domains remains to be determined.</p><p>The psq motif shows significant sequence similarity to the DNA binding domain of eukaryotic and prokaryotic recombinases such as the Pogo and the Hin recombinases, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c19">19</xref>). The secondary structure of the Hin recombinase, determined by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c37">37</xref>), indicates that its DNA binding domain is composed of three &#x003b1; helices forming a helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motif. Protein secondary structure prediction programs indicate that the psq motif of the BabCD also forms three &#x003b1; helices (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg724f6">6</xref>A). Point mutations disrupting one of these helices abolish the DNA binding activity of the BabCD. Specific binding of Hin recombinases requires both major groove interactions by the helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motif and minor groove interactions by a part of the protein containing the sequence GRPR. The two residues Gly&#x02013;Arg (GR) are invariant among all DNA invertases and are required for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c37">37</xref>). This GRPR sequence is similar to the AT-Hook core motif that is present in the BabCD. Therefore, the BabCD could bind DNA in the same manner as the Hin recombinase. We speculate that the BabCD binds to target sites with its AT-Hook motif (RGRP) interacting with the minor groove and with one of the &#x003b1; helices of the psq motif recognizing specific bases in the major groove, providing the binding specificity of the BabCD. Determining the secondary structure of the BabCD complexed to target sites will be required to confirm this model.</p><p>We have shown that the BabCD binds specifically to several different DNA fragments in the regulatory regions of the <italic>bab</italic> locus. In two of these fragments (2.5 kb bab2 and 8.0 kb bab1) several smaller sub-fragments are recognized by the BabCD. DNase1 footprinting analysis of three of these sub-fragments (222, 209 and 347 bp) reveals that there are at least two binding sites per sub-fragment. Both <italic>bab</italic> genes contain a large number of contiguous sites that are specifically recognized by the BabCD. The BTB&#x0002f;POZ domain is a protein&#x02013;protein interacting domain that allows oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c38">38</xref>), suggesting that the Bab proteins that are bound to the <italic>bab</italic> locus might form large aggregates. Such aggregates might play an architectural role by bringing together regulatory elements that are scattered over the large <italic>bab</italic> locus. Moreover, the BTB domain of the Bab proteins interacts with a component of the basal transcriptional machinery, the TAF3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg724c15">15</xref>). These results suggest a model in which Bab proteins directly modulate the transcription of target genes by bringing regulatory sequences close to the basal transcriptional machinery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_31_18_5389__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_31_18_5389__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg724f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Bab2 proteins bind to several loci on polytene chromosomes.
