Subtractive hybridization was used to identify transcripts expressed exclusively in fiber cells that had detached from the lens capsule. Database searches and PCR amplification with degenerate primers were used to identify human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and bovine orthologs of one such sequence and to confirm its expression in the lenses of these animals. The ability of in vitro-transcribed and translated protein to bind DNA was assessed by mobility shift assays. The locus encoding this transcript and an area about 6 kb upstream of the translation start site were sequenced. The microscopic morphology of lenses from mice in which the locus encoding this protein had been disrupted by the insertion of a nuclear-targeted bacterial lacZ sequence were analyzed. Gene expression was analyzed by PCR, in situ hybridization, and by staining for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in lenses expressing <italic>lacZ</italic> in place of the coding sequence. Knockout lenses expressing green fluorescent protein in a mosaic pattern were sectioned in the equatorial plane and viewed with a confocal microscope to assess the presence of cell-cell fusions during fiber cell maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Subtractive hybridization identified transcripts encoding Hop, a short, atypical homeodomain-containing protein that had previously been shown to be an important regulator of gene expression in the heart and lung. Chicken Hop did not bind to known homeodomain-binding sequences in DNA. In chicken embryos, <italic>Hop</italic> transcripts were first detected at E6. At all stages analyzed, <italic>Hop</italic> mRNA was only detected in cells that had detached from the lens capsule. Mice in which the <italic>Hop</italic> coding sequence was replaced with nuclear-targeted &#x003b2;-galactosidase showed that Hop was expressed in the mouse lens in a similar pattern to the chicken lens.

Stimulation by factors present in the vitreous body causes epithelial cells near the lens equator to withdraw from the cell cycle and differentiate into lens fiber cells. Differentiating fiber cells elongate and initiate the transcription of genes that encode a distinct array of abundant membrane, cytoskeletal, and cytoplasmic proteins. The accumulation of high concentrations of cytoplasmic proteins (crystallins) in fiber cells is important for the transparency and refractive power of the lens. Some crystallins, cytoskeletal, and membrane proteins are found primarily in lens cells, or are present only at very low levels in non-lens tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Diagram of lens regions. Diagram representing a section through the center of a lens showing the regions of the fiber mass that were dissected to produce region-specific cDNA libraries. Fiber cells in the cortex region are still in the process of elongation and are attached at their basal ends to the lens capsule, the lens basement membrane. Cells in the middle region have completed the process of elongation and have detached from the capsule. The apical and basal ends of these cells abut the ends of fiber cells from the other side of the lens at the anterior and posterior sutures. Cells in the core region have degraded their nuclei and other membrane-bound organelles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mv-v13-114-f1"/></fig><p>Lens fiber cells undergo remarkable morphological changes during their differentiation. Fiber cells first elongate to many times their original length, extending to over 140 &#x003bc;m per day in the chicken embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. As they elongate, the anterior and posterior ends of the fiber cells extend beneath the lens epithelium and along the posterior lens capsule toward the optical axis. When the ends of these cells approach the anterior and posterior poles of the lens, they meet elongating fiber cells extending from the other side, resulting in the formation of the anterior and posterior sutures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Once the cells stop elongating, they become buried beneath the next group of elongating fiber cells. Soon after the fiber cells detach from the posterior capsule, the composition of their cell-cell adhesion proteins changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], their lateral membranes become interdigitated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] and partially fuse with the membranes of neighboring fiber cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], and all intracellular, membrane-bound organelles are degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Mature fiber cells persist in this state for the life of the organism.</p><p>Many of the genes that are preferentially expressed in lens fiber cells have been identified, cloned, and sequenced, and their promoters used to express foreign genes in the lenses of transgenic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. The products of all these "fiber-specific" genes are detected at or soon after the initiation of fiber cell differentiation. To date, only a few transcripts have been identified that are preferentially expressed late in fiber cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], and no mRNAs have been identified that are expressed only at this stage.</p><p>To identify molecules that might regulate or be required for the final stages of fiber cell differentiation, we used subtractive hybridization between cDNA libraries created from chicken embryo lens fiber cells before and after they detached from the lens capsule. The open reading frame of one of the transcripts that was selectively expressed after fiber cells detached from the capsule consisted of 73 amino acids, 60 of which had strong sequence similarity to the homeodomain consensus. This gene was previously named <italic>Hop</italic>, for "homeodomain-only protein" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and surgical procedures</title><p>Animals were treated in accordance with the guidelines of the U.S. Public Health Service under a protocol approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Mice were maintained in an animal facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Fertile chicken eggs were obtained from CBT Farms (Chestertown, MD) and incubated in a humidified, forced-draft incubator at 38 &#x000b0;C. Embryos at different stages of development were removed, their lensers were fixed, and sectioned at 500 &#x003bc;m with a tissue slicer (OTS-4000; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Warrington, PA), and examined for the distribution of <italic>Hop</italic> mRNA by in situ hybridization.

RNA was prepared from microdissected regions of the lens fiber cells and region-specific cDNA pools were synthesized. The cDNAs were amplified by PCR, made single-stranded (tester), and annealed with excess biotinylated, single-stranded cDNA prepared from a different region of the lens (driver). The biotinylated complex was removed with magnetic streptavidin beads and the remaining cDNA was cloned into a bacterial plasmid. Bacterial clones were screened with labeled probes prepared from both regions of the lens to confirm the effectiveness of the subtraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of region-specific libraries</title><p>In chicken embryos, organelle degradation in the central fiber cells begins at E12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. After this age, lenses contain elongating fiber cells, fiber cells that have stopped elongating and detached from the capsule but not yet degraded their organelles, and mature fiber cells with no organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). To isolate mRNA from these populations, we removed E15-16 lenses from the eye, embedded them in 4% agar, and cut 500 &#x003bc;m slices parallel to the optic axis with a tissue slicer. Slices that included the center of the lens were dissected into three regions: "cortex," which contained elongating fiber cells, "middle," which contained fiber cells that had detached from the capsule yet still contained organelles, and "core," which contained the fiber cells that had already lost their organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The following primer sequences for PCR reactions were used: T primer: 5'-GTG CCT CTA GAT TTT TTT TTT-3'; TC primer: 5'-GTG CCT CTA GAT TTT TTT TTT GGA TCC CCC CCC CC-3'; C primer: 5'-TTT TCA CGG ATC CCC CCC CCC-3'; X primer: 5'-GTC CGG CCA ACG GTA TGG TG-3'; XT primer: 5'-GTC CGG CCA ACG GTA TGG TGC CTC TAG ATT TTT TTT TT-3'; and XC primer: 5'-GTC CGG CCA ACG GTA TGG TGC ACG GAT CCC CCC CCC C-3'.</p><p>Total RNA from these regions was extracted using the standard guanidine thiocyanate procedure as described in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Total RNA (0.25-1 &#x003bc;g) was heat-denatured at 65 &#x000b0;C for 5 min and annealed at room temperature for 5 min with 5 pM of T-primer in a total volume of 20 &#x003bc;l containing 1X RT buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 75 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM of each dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP), and 1 U RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI). After addition of 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II; Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), incubation was continued at 42 &#x000b0;C for 1 h, followed by 94 &#x000b0;C for 5 min, using a programmable thermal cycler (PTC-100TM; MJ Research, Watertown, MA). The tube was spun briefly and the cDNA was purified from the T-primer and dNTPs by ultrafiltration through a Microcon-100 concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Purified cDNA (5 &#x003bc;l aliquots) was oligo-dG-tailed at 37 &#x000b0;C for 0.5-1.5 h in a total reaction volume of 15 &#x003bc;l containing 1X terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) buffer (50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM CoCl<sub>2</sub>), 400 mM dGTP and 2 U TdT. Higher TdT concentration (5-20 U) as well as longer time of incubation can significantly reduce the amount of DNA available for subsequent amplification with TC- and T-primers. For this reason, 4 &#x003bc;l aliquots of DNA were removed every 30 min of incubation and submitted to 18 cycles of "hot-start" PCR in 50 &#x003bc;l of 1X PCR buffer (40 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 9.2, at 20 &#x000b0;C; 10 mM potassium acetate, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 50 mg/ml BSA, 200 mM of each dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP), 5 pM TC primer, 20 pM T primer and 1.5 U Taq Polymerase. The first cycle of PCR was 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 52 &#x000b0;C for 1 min, 72 &#x000b0;C for 1.5 min, followed by 16 cycles (94 &#x000b0;C for 10 s, 56 &#x000b0;C for 20 s, and 71 &#x000b0;C for 1.5 min). The final cycle had 5 steps: 94 &#x000b0;C for 10 s, 56 &#x000b0;C for 20 s, 71 &#x000b0;C for 2 min, 56 &#x000b0;C for 20 s, and 71 &#x000b0;C for 2 min. The five-step PCR was used during the last cycle for converting single-stranded "pan-like" DNA to double-stranded products. Full-length TC-T cDNA was prepared using the same conditions and cycle parameters except the elongation time was extended to 5 min and 0.05 U of Pfu polymerase was added to the PCR mix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of biotinylated T-C cDNA</title><p>To obtain biotinylated "middle" and "cortex" T-C cDNA, 10 ng of the original TC-T cDNA was amplified through 10 cycles of PCR with 5'-end biotinylated T- and C-primers (Integrated DNA Technologies), the product purified from the primers and unincorporated nucleotides with a PCR purification kit (Promega), ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 12 &#x003bc;l of deionized water.</p></sec><sec><title>Driver preparation</title><p>About 7 &#x003bc;g of sense and antisense cDNA (driver) were prepared from 5 &#x003bc;l (2 &#x003bc;g) of biotinylated T-C cDNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) by five cycles of asymmetric amplification with 100 pM of biotinylated C-primer (for sense) or biotinylated T-primer (for antisense) in five tubes with a total volume 250 &#x003bc;l.

Purified cDNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 4 &#x003bc;l of hybridization buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.3; 0.5 M NaCl; 0.05 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), overlaid with mineral oil, heated 2 min at 95 &#x000b0;C and incubated overnight at 68 &#x000b0;C. The hybridization mix was diluted in 400 &#x003bc;l of NTE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) and the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube with 100 &#x003bc;l of streptavidin-beads (Dynal Biotech, Lake Success, NY) in NTE buffer (the beads were washed 3X in NTE buffer before use). After 5 min incubation at room temperature, the beads and bound DNA were removed with a magnet, and the remaining cDNAs were subjected to a second round of purification with streptavidin beads.

We and others identified transcripts that are differentially accumulated late in fiber cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. It is not known whether these transcripts change in abundance due to increased rates of synthesis or decreased degradation. Vinculin and paxillin mRNAs increase markedly in fiber cells after they detach from the capsule, compared to fiber cells that were still elongating and were attached to the capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. However, the expression of vinculin and paxillin is not unique to mature fiber cells; these transcripts are expressed at lower levels in elongating fiber cells.</p><p>To identify transcripts that are expressed only in fiber cells that have detached from the capsule, we prepared libraries from microdissected lens regions and performed subtractive hybridization. One of the transcripts detected in this screen encoded chicken Hop, an unusual homeodomain-containing protein. Other labs found that <italic>Hop</italic> is prominently expressed in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. Based on its unusual coding sequence, these groups named it "homeodomain only protein" (<italic>Hop</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] or "odd box" (<italic>OB1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. <italic>Hop</italic> is the first gene to be identified that is not expressed in elongating fiber cells but is transcribed after fiber cells detach from the lens capsule. This pattern of gene expression demonstrates that there are mechanisms to initiate transcription at this critical stage of lens fiber cell differentiation and raises the possibility that other genes may be similarly regulated.</p><p><italic>Hop</italic> transcripts appear in fiber cells soon after they detach from their basal lamina, the lens capsule. There is ample precedent for the activation of a new gene expression program in other types of epithelial cells after they separate from their basal laminae. For example, when keratinocytes detach from the epidermal basal lamina and move out of the germinative layer of the epidermis, they initiate a complex program of differentiation that is related to the ability of superficial keratinocytes to protect the body surface from desiccation, injury and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Thus, <italic>Hop</italic> expression in maturing fiber cells may be regulated by signals from integrins or other matrix-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>] that are altered following detachment from the capsule.</p><p>Previous studies found that Hop positively and negatively modulates gene expression in the heart and lung. In heart muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>], Hop reduces transcriptional activation by serum response factor by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the promoters of several heart muscle-specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. Hop also functions prominently in the atrium and in the cardiac conduction system, where loss of Hop function results in an abnormal electrocardiogram, associated with a marked and selective reduction in the expression of connexin40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. In the airway epithelium, Hop suppresses surfactant production in type II pneumocytes, again by recruiting HDACs to surfactant protein genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. Hop may function in a similar manner in the lens, perhaps by regulating the expression of crystallin or connexin genes.</p><p>In the heart and lung, the expression of <italic>Hop</italic> is regulated by members of the Nkx2.x and GATA families of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. Of the several members of these families, none was detectable in whole, adult mouse lens fibers by microarray analysis (Vasiliev, Wang, and Beebe, unpublished). Whether these proteins are expressed at sufficient levels to contribute to Hop expression in the lens remains to be tested.</p><p>Analysis of the genomic sequence upstream of the <italic>Hop</italic> coding sequence identified few potential binding sites for transcription factors considered to be key for regulating gene expression during lens fiber cell differentiation (Pax6, c-maf, L-maf, Prox1, Sox1-3, RAR/RXR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>]. There is a potential Pax6 binding element 3.4 kb upstream of the translation start site. However, Pax6 levels decline sharply during fiber cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>], making it unlikely that Pax6 contributes to the regulation of <italic>Hop</italic> late in fiber cell differentiation. Since <italic>Hop</italic> is the first gene known to be expressed exclusively during the latest phase of fiber cell differentiation, it is not surprising that it may not be regulated in the same manner as genes expressed early in fiber cell formation.</p><p>In spite of the paucity of binding sites for these "core" lens fiber cell transcription factors, a CP2 binding site is located at position -2876. CP2 is a ubiquitous factor that was shown to be essential for lens-specific expression of &#x003b1;-crystallin in the chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. Similarly, USF1, which is expressed in lens cells and regulates the expression of the chicken and mouse &#x003b1;A-crystallin genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>], may regulate <italic>Hop</italic> expression by binding the USF site at -2042. The HAND1/E47 E2 boxes at -559 and -2352 bind basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and might be negatively regulated by the &#x003b4;-crystallin enhancer-binding protein, &#x003b4;EF1, which competes for E2 sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>]. In addition, there are two CHOP10 (C/EBP homologous protein 10) binding sites beginning at position -5184. These are of interest because CHOP10 dimerizes with other members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors to inhibit their activity. C/EBP family members can heterodimerize with ATF4 (CREB2), which is required for the differentiation of secondary lens fiber cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>]. In a preliminary microarray study, CHOP10 transcripts were decreased tenfold in <italic>Hop</italic> knockout mice, compared to wild type (Vasiliev, Wang, and Beebe, unpublished). This raises the possibility that CHOP10 and Hop are mutual regulators of their respective genes. Since CHOP10 is most often a negative regulator of transcription, it may serve as a feedback regulator of <italic>Hop</italic> expression. The importance of these cis-binding elements in regulating <italic>Hop</italic> expression in the lens and the basis of CHOP10 regulation by Hop will have to be evaluated in future experiments.</p><p>Examination of EST databases and staining with specific antibodies showed that, in addition to the cardiac and pulmonary systems, Hop is expressed in many tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>]. However, other than in the heart and lungs, no defects have been described in <italic>Hop</italic> knockout mice. We observed no obvious phenotype in the lenses of <italic>Hop</italic> null mice. <italic>Hop</italic> null lenses were clear and of normal size and their cellular morphology appeared normal. Fiber cells lacking <italic>Hop</italic> fused with their neighbors and degraded their nuclei in a manner that was morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type lenses. Although <italic>Hop</italic> does not appear to have an essential function in maturing lens fiber cells, it may be possible to use <italic>Hop</italic> regulatory sequences to target the expression of exogenous genes to fiber cells at the stage just before they fuse and degrade their nuclei.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Eric Olson, Department of Molecular Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas for providing the <italic>Hop</italic> knockout mice, Dr. Rashmi Hegde, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, for confirmation that the secondary structure of Hop conformed to that of the consensus homeodomain, Dr. Steven Bassnett for the gift of the TgN(GFPU)5Nagy mice, and Cheryl Shomo for generating <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>.
