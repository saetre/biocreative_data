However, the role of B cells in inflammatory granuloma development is not yet fully understood. We report here that B cell function is required for <italic>S. japonicum</italic> egg-induced granuloma pathology in early infection. Both OBF-1 knockout mice and &#x000b5;MT mice develop severely reduced hepatic granulomas at five weeks post-infection compared to their wild-type counterparts. In contrast, they display no significant difference in granuloma pathology at eight weeks post-infection. Moreover, we find that B cells and antibodies accumulate in the granulomas of wild-type mice early in the infection, indicating a contribution of the B cell response to the granulomatous inflammation. Furthermore, defects in B cell function markedly reduce liver egg burden. These results suggest an important role for B cells in early granuloma pathology. Surprisingly, we found that the <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection destroys the structure of the lymphoid follicles. This disruptive effect is correlated with a severely impaired T cell-dependent antibody response upon challenge with ovalbumin. Thus, these findings reveal a novel aspect of the interaction between <italic>Schistosoma</italic> and the host immune system.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schistosomiasis, prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas, is a disease caused by parasitic worms.

Thus, these results delineate a previously unrecognized mechanism for host B cell function in the dynamic development of granulomas during <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection.</p><p>B cells function in the immune response through both antibody-dependent and antibody-independent mechanisms.
