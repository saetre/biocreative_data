Given the low penetrance of BMPRII mutations, abnormalities in other converging signaling pathways may be necessary for disease development. We hypothesized that BMPRII supports normal PAEC function by recruiting Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathways to promote proliferation, survival, and motility. In this study, we report that BMP-2, via BMPRII-mediated inhibition of GSK3-&#x003b2;, induces &#x003b2;-catenin (&#x003b2;-C) accumulation and transcriptional activity necessary for PAEC survival and proliferation. At the same time, BMP-2 mediates phosphorylated Smad1 (pSmad1) or, with loss of BMPRII, pSmad3-dependent recruitment of Disheveled (Dvl) to promote RhoA&#x02013;Rac1 signaling necessary for motility. Finally, using an angiogenesis assay in severe combined immunodeficient mice, we demonstrate that both &#x003b2;-C&#x02013; and Dvl-mediated RhoA&#x02013;Rac1 activation are necessary for vascular growth in vivo. These findings suggest that the recruitment of both canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways is required in BMP-2&#x02013;mediated angiogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: ActR, activin receptor; &#x003b2;-C, &#x003b2;-catenin; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; BMPR, BMP receptor; Dvl, Disheveled; EC, endothelial cell; ERK, extracellular receptor-dependent kinase; hPAEC, human PAEC; IPAH, idiopathic PAH; LEF, lymphoid enhancer binding factor; LIMK, LIM domain kinase; NLK, NEMO-like kinase; PAEC, pulmonary artery EC; PAH, pulmonary arterial hypertension; pERK, phosphorylated ERK; pSmad, phosphorylated Smad; SCID, severe combined immunodeficient; SMC, smooth muscle cell; TCF, T cell&#x02013;specific transcription factor; Wnt, Wingless; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily of proteins that coordinate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attisano and Wrana, 2002</xref>). BMP-2, -4, and -7 exert their biological effects by interacting with serine/threonine kinase receptors BMP receptor IA (BMPRIA; ALK3) or BMPRIB (ALK6) and their coreceptor, BMPRII. Downstream signaling events include the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, interaction with comediator Smad4, nuclear translocation, and gene transcription. Although many of the biological effects of the BMPs have been related to the Smad-dependent pathways, Smad-independent MAPK pathways (JNK, p38, and extracellular receptor-dependent kinase 1/2 [ERK1/2]) also play an active role in BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Massague, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Given the range of biological functions controlled by BMP signaling, much effort has been directed at understanding how dysfunction in this pathway contributes to the development of disease. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH [IPAH]) is a disease linked to aberrant BMPRII function. Different heterozygous loss of function mutations in BMPRII are observed in 25% of sporadic and 70% of familial cases of IPAH in which the penetrance is only 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thomson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Machado et al., 2001</xref>). However, reduced BMPRII expression is observed in patients with IPAH without a BMPRII mutation and with the more common acquired forms of PAH, e.g., related to a congenital heart defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>IPAH is a rare condition (one to two newly diagnosed cases per million people per year) with a predilection for young women (female/male ratio of 2.3:1) and a median age at diagnosis of 36.4 yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rich et al., 1987</xref>). In the absence of treatment, IPAH patients have a mean survival of 2.8 yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Massague, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Humbert et al., 2004a</xref>). Both IPAH and the more common acquired forms of PAH are characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, attributed to the loss of small peripheral pulmonary arteries resulting from apoptosis of endothelial cells (ECs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teichert-Kuliszewska et al., 2006</xref>) and occlusion of larger proximal pulmonary arteries resulting from the proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and deposition of the extracellular matrix. In the late stages of the disease, in and around some of these occluded vessels, aberrant EC channels can be found reflecting the expansion of apoptosis-resistant EC populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tuder and Voelkel, 2002</xref>) that may arise from endogenous or circulating progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asosingh et al., 2008</xref>). Current therapies include oral and intravenous agents with vasodilatory properties that improve symptoms but do not reverse or consistently prevent the progression of the disease, leaving lung transplantation, with its inherent high mortality and morbidity, as the only choice for patients with the end-stage disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humbert et al., 2004b</xref>).</p><p>Work in transgenic animals has facilitated our understanding of the link between aberrant BMP signaling and pulmonary vascular pathology. Homozygous deletion of BMPRII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beppu et al., 2000</xref>) and BMPRIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mishina et al., 1995</xref>) results in lethality during gastrulation, whereas mice heterozygous for BMPRII are relatively normal but can develop more severe pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling when exposed to high levels of serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Long et al., 2006</xref>) or when injected with lipoxygenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Experiments performed in human pulmonary artery ECs (PAECs [hPAECs]) show that the loss of BMPRII by RNAi impairs the ability of BMP-2 to enhance PAEC survival under proapoptotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teichert-Kuliszewska et al., 2006</xref>). However, hPAECs cultured from patients with IPAH and documented BMPRII mutations exhibit enhanced proliferation compared with ECs from healthy donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masri et al., 2007</xref>), and this may account for the aberrant angiogenesis within the lumen and the adventitia of the vessels with plexogenic obstructive arteriopathy observed in advanced IPAH. However, cells from the IPAH patients are impaired in their ability to form tubelike structures in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masri et al., 2007</xref>), and this may be responsible for their inability to reconstitute the lost distal pulmonary vascular bed. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of normal regulation of EC function by BMPRII signaling is a necessary first step in appreciating how abnormalities lead to disease.</p><p>An interaction between BMPs and members of the Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway is implicated in embryonic lung development, as both BMP and Wnt signaling cascades coordinate stem cell fate determination and commitment to lung branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). In other organs, BMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deckers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langenfeld and Langenfeld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raida et al., 2005</xref>) and Wnts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishikawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masckauchan et al., 2005</xref>) participate in angiogenesis associated with development and disease.</p><p>Wnts can signal through a canonical &#x003b2;-catenin (&#x003b2;-C)&#x02013;dependent pathway via interaction with a receptor complex composed of a Frizzled protein and low density lipoprotein receptor&#x02013;related protein family member (LRP5 or 6). The cytoplasmic protein Disheveled (Dvl) is recruited, facilitating inhibition of GSK3-&#x003b2;. This protects &#x003b2;-C from ubiquitination and allows it to accumulate in the cytoplasm and shuttle to the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcription factors and activates genes involved in cellular maintenance, proliferation, and survival such as c-myc, cyclin D1, VEGF, survivin, and axin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bain et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rawadi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Logan and Nusse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Wnts can also activate noncanonical (i.e., non &#x003b2;-C dependent) signaling, the best studied of which is the Wnt&#x02013;RhoA&#x02013;Rac1 pathway involved in tissue polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelrod and McNeill, 2002</xref>) and in coordinated cell movement during embryological development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habas et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that BMP-2 recruits canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways to promote PAEC proliferation, survival, and migration. Canonical &#x003b2;-C&#x02013;mediated signals require BMP-2 activation of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) to mediate GSK3-&#x003b2; inactivation, whereas noncanonical signaling involves BMP-2 activation of phosphorylated Smad1 (pSmad1) to recruit Dvl and activate RhoA and Rac1. The canonical pathway depends on BMP-2&#x02013;BMPRII interaction, whereas in the absence of BMPRII, BMP-2 can still promote motility by signaling through activin receptor IIa (ActRIIa) to mediate pSmad3 recruitment of Dvl to the RhoA&#x02013;Rac1 pathway. Finally, we extend our observations to an in vivo model of angiogenesis and show, using a Matrigel plug assay in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skovseth et al., 2007</xref>), that BMP-2 stimulates angiogenesis in a &#x003b2;-C&#x02013; and Dvl-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>BMP-2 and Wnt3a induce proliferation, migration, and survival of hPAECs</title><p>Based on a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langenfeld and Langenfeld, 2004</xref>), we chose to use BMP-2 as a ligand to investigate BMPRII signaling in hPAECs. Endogenous production of Wnt1, -2, -3a, -4, -9a, and -16 in PAECs was documented using a semiquantitative RT-PCR to screen for all 19 Wnt family members (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806049/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806049/DC1</ext-link>). Our decision to use Wnt3a in our experiments was based on its ability to activate both canonical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nusse and Varmus, 1992</xref>) and noncanonical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endo et al., 2005</xref>) signaling pathways. We first starved hPAECs for 24 h in 0.1% serum, added 10 ng/ml BMP-2 or 100 ng/ml Wnt3a, and measured cell counts after 24 h. 50 ng/ml VEGF-treated cells and cells exposed to 0.1% serum were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Both BMP-2 and Wnt3a significantly increased hPAEC cell counts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To test the effect of the same ligands on hPAEC survival, cells were serum starved for 24 h and exposed for a further 24 h to serum-free conditions in the presence or absence of BMP-2 or Wnt3a. Caspase 3/7 assays indicate that both BMP-2 and Wnt3a reduce apoptosis when compared with vehicle-treated controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To investigate whether BMP-2 or Wnt3a also stimulates hPAEC migration, cells were seeded onto Cytodex 3 carrier beads and embedded in vitronectin gels in the presence of BMP-2 or Wnt3a for 48 h. Both BMP-2 and Wnt3a promoted hPAEC migration in a manner similar to that seen with VEGF, the positive control, judged by the distance migrated from the beads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>BMP-2 and Wnt3a promote proliferation, migration, and survival of hPAECs while increasing &#x003b2;-C transcriptional activity and target genes.</bold> (A) Cell count, caspase 3/7 apoptosis, and microcarrier bead migration assays of hPAECs in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml BMP-2 or 100 ng/ml Wnt3a.

Immunoblots using an antibody that recognizes the active nonphosphorylated form of &#x003b2;-C were performed on lysates from hPAECs stimulated for 6 or 8 h with BMP-2 or Wnt3a. We observed that both agonists induce a significant increase in the level of active &#x003b2;-C within 10&#x02013;30 min of stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Using confocal microscopy, increased levels of nuclear &#x003b2;-C were demonstrated in BMP-2&#x02013;stimulated hPAECs within 1 h (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806049/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806049/DC1</ext-link>). To relate the observed increase in active &#x003b2;-C to changes in target gene transcription, we nucleofected cells with the lymphoid enhancer binding factor (LEF)/T cell&#x02013;specific transcription factor (TCF) promoter-reporter construct (TOPflash) or with the negative control plasmid (FOPflash) followed by measurement of luciferase. After 6 h of stimulation, luciferase was significantly elevated in TOPflash-transfected hPAECs stimulated with either BMP-2 or Wnt3a when compared with unstimulated or FOPflash-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we related the Wnt3a- and BMP-2&#x02013;induced increase in &#x003b2;-C transcriptional activity to downstream gene targets that could be implicated in the functional changes observed.

Previous studies have linked the loss of BMPRII to the development of IPAH and to the propensity of ECs to apoptose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teichert-Kuliszewska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masri et al., 2007</xref>). Our study looks into why that occurs and whether the same mechanisms might explain other features necessary for vascular regeneration, i.e., proliferation and migration. In this study, we report for the first time to our knowledge that a BMPRII ligand recruits a canonical Wnt signaling pathway to promote hPAEC survival and proliferation by activating ERK1/2 and stimulates a Dvl-mediated noncanonical RhoA&#x02013;Rac1 pathway to induce migration by activating Smad1. Beyond uncovering mechanisms that relate to the loss of vessels in patients with IPAH, these findings may help better understand aberrant angiogenesis in disorders such as malignancy and may lead to new opportunities to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels in disease and in tissue regeneration.</p><p>The loss of ECs in larger arteries has been linked to the stimulation of SMC proliferation through the release of active TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sakao et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, the emergence of apoptosis-resistant ECs that proliferate and migrate much more robustly than ECs of healthy donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masri et al., 2007</xref>) may account for the aberrant angiogenesis within the lumen and the adventitia of the vessels with plexogenic obstructive arteriopathy observed in advanced IPAH. However, cells from the IPAH patients are impaired in their ability to form tubelike structures in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Date et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masri et al., 2007</xref>), and this may account for their inability to reconstitute the lost distal pulmonary vascular bed. In unpublished data, we have evidence that these apoptosis-resistant ECs may have constitutive signaling via &#x003b2;-C, as occurs with oncogenic &#x003b2;-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peifer, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Although our study shows that pERK1/2, and not pSmad1/5/8 or pSmad2/3, is necessary for &#x003b2;-C accumulation, it does not exclude the possibility that other signaling molecules activated or inhibited by BMPs might also play a role in mediating &#x003b2;-C accumulation. Besides pERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2005</xref>), BMPs can trigger Smad-independent signaling using kinase pathways such as JNK, which could also target GSK3-&#x003b2; for inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moule et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen and Frame, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2005</xref>). BMP signaling has also been shown to activate the MAPK TAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamaguchi et al., 1995</xref>) that targets NEMO-like kinase (NLK), an endogenous inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling that acts by interfering with DNA binding of the &#x003b2;-C&#x02013;TCF transcriptional complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishitani et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2003</xref>). Although our results support the ability of BMP-2 to enhance &#x003b2;-C activity in hPAECs, it may be possible that the BMP-TAK1-NLK axis may act to modulate transcriptional responses to prevent excessive gene expression and fine-tune biological effects. Further studies should be directed at investigating the extent to which kinases other than MAPK or regulation of the NLK-TAK1 axis can modulate the BMP-2&#x02013;mediated activation of canonical Wnt signaling.</p><p>Previous work on BMP signaling has focused on the pSmad-dependent transcription of genes such as Indian hedgehog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seki and Hata, 2004</xref>), Tlx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tang et al., 1998</xref>), and inhibitor of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002</xref>) that are involved in the regulation of cellular processes related to angiogenesis. The ability to activate &#x003b2;-C suggests that BMPs can induce a wider array of gene targets than previously considered. This is consistent with our finding that both BMP-2 and Wnt3a increase c-myc, VEGF, survivin, and cyclin D1, which are proteins that mediate hPAEC survival and proliferation. It is likely that the interaction between &#x003b2;-C and pSmad1/5/8 and perhaps other BMP-mediated transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor &#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansmann et al., 2007</xref>) regulates the profile of expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labbe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu and Rosenblum, 2005</xref>). It is also possible that there is a codependency between BMP and Wnt to limit the level of expression of gene targets when both agonists are present or to allow gene expression to persist despite loss of function mutations in BMPRII. Thus, haploinsufficiency of BMPRII may become more penetrant when there are concomitant alterations in Wnt signaling.</p><p>Directed migration is necessary for ECs to converge at sites where vessels need to be formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Alitalo, 2007</xref>). Previous studies show that BMP-2 induces endothelial migration and vascular tube formation but without further investigation of the mechanisms involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deckers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langenfeld and Langenfeld, 2004</xref>). Recent studies describing interactions between the cytoplasmic tail of BMPRII and proteins involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics such as LIMK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foletta et al., 2003</xref>) and Tctex-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Machado et al., 2003</xref>) suggest a functional link between BMP signaling and cell motility. It would be of interest to investigate in future studies whether the interaction with the cytoskeleton and with LIMK is lost in BMPRII mutants, as no functional studies have yet linked this to changes in cell motility.</p><p>Our experiments showing heightened hPAEC migration in response to both BMP-2 and Wnt3a suggested that both ligands might be using a non&#x02013;&#x003b2;-C&#x02013;dependent Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt3a can recruit Dvl to activate RhoA and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endo et al., 2005</xref>), which are small GTPases that coordinate features of cell motility (i.e., the cytoskeletal rearrangements that permit retraction of the base of the cell and extension of the leading front through the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia).</p><p>This study shows not only that Dvl is recruited by BMP-2 but that this process is pSmad dependent. The highly conserved PDZ and DEP domains in Dvl that were previously identified in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as required for RhoA&#x02013;Rac1 signaling and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Axelrod et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) are necessary for BMP-2 to induce hPAEC migration. Thus, a potential way in which pSmads could modulate the switch between canonical and noncanonical signaling would be through their ability to interact with the DIX domain of Dvl. This would limit the interaction of Dvl with protein partners necessary for &#x003b2;-C activation while exposing the PDZ and DEP domains to facilitate RhoA&#x02013;Rac1 activation and cell motility.</p><p>How Dvl is partitioned between canonical and noncanonical signaling is not currently known, but it is possible that the interaction between Dvl and pSmads occurs in a different subcellular compartment segregating this pool of Dvl from that available for canonical activity. Consistent with this idea is the observation that Dvl accumulates either in vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capelluto et al., 2002</xref>) or associates with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Torres and Nelson, 2000</xref>).</p><p>An unexpected finding was that BMP-2 could control motility despite reduced BMPRII. We found that when BMPRII is lacking, BMP-2, using receptor complexes containing BMPRIA/B and the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily receptor ActRIIa, signals via Smad2/3 to preserve motility in hPAECs. A similar interaction of BMPRIA with ActRIIa was observed with deletion of BMPRII in pulmonary arterial SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2005</xref>), but the functional consequences of the altered signaling were not investigated. Mutations in TGF-&#x003b2; receptors can also contribute to the development of PAH in patients with hemorrhagic hereditary telangiectasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottin et al., 2007</xref>). However, whether mutations in other members of the TGF-&#x003b2; receptor superfamily compound the propensity to PAH when there is BMPRII loss of function is still unclear. In ECs isolated from plexogenic lesions, a reduction in TGF-&#x003b2;-RII was found, suggesting that abnormal signaling via this receptor may contribute to the development of vascular pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yeager et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>It would be of interest to further investigate the role of the planar cell polarity receptors in BMP-2&#x02013; and Wnt3-mediated noncanonical Dvl&#x02013;RhoA&#x02013;Rac1 signaling to assess whether this pathway is important in establishing EC polarity and in recruiting pericytes and whether these particular features are BMPRII dependent. This pathway is critical in convergent extension; i.e., the medial convergence and intercalation of elongated mesenchymal cells along the anteroposterior axis that leads to elongation and narrowing of the body axis. Indeed, the orderly branching morphogenesis observed in normal angiogenesis in the lung and in other tissues strongly suggests that planar cell polarity signaling may be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamalice et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> illustrates our proposed models of how BMP-2 recruits canonical Wnt signaling to promote hPAEC growth and survival (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 A</xref>) and noncanonical signaling to induce motility (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 B</xref>). Our experiments are the first to show how BMPs regulate major EC functions required for normal angiogenesis by recruiting two Wnt signaling pathways. That BMP and Wnt signaling collaborate in angiogenesis is consistent with the observation that deletion of Frizzled 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishikawa et al., 2001</xref>) or targeted endothelial deletion of BMPRIA (unpublished data) result in early embryonic lethality associated with a profound defect in yolk sac vasculature. Although it is known that BMP can suppress Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki et al., 2003</xref>), it now also should be considered that these ligands regulate common pathways fine-tuning gene expression and cellular function.</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Schema illustrating that regulation of proliferation, survival, and migration in hPAECs depends on cross talk between BMP and Wnt pathways.</bold> (A) BMP-2 and Wnt3a promote an increase in &#x003b2;-C&#x02013;mediated transcriptional activity and up-regulate gene targets involved in proliferation and survival.

Filters and light paths were controlled with a filter wheel and shutters (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd.). For GFP visualization, a single band excitation filter for FITC was used in combination with Pinkel&#x00023;1 beam splitter and emission filter (Chroma Technology Corp.). Tissue culture medium without phenol red was kept warm and buffered in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. The stage temperature was kept at 37&#x000b0;C with an automatic thermostat. Images were collected using a charge-coupled device camera (C2400; B&#x00026;W) with on-chip integration and a digital image processor (Argus 20; PerkinElmer). Acquired images were assembled in temporal sequences using Openlab software (PerkinElmer) and saved as QuickTime (Apple, Inc.) videos. The distance traveled by the cells was calculated by recording the position of the nucleus in individual frames using ImageJ software and plotting on an x&#x02013;y axis followed by measurement of distance between each of the individual points. Total distance was obtained from the total sum of these values. Speed was measured by dividing total distance over time (10 h) using the following formula: S &#x0003d; D/t, where S &#x0003d; speed, D &#x0003d; distance and, t &#x0003d; time. A total of four cells was used for each measurement.</p></sec><sec><title>Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in SCID mice</title><p>Animal experiments were approved by Stanford University's Institutional Review Board under the guidelines of the American Physiological Society. Matrigel plugs containing hPAECs were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skovseth et al., 2007</xref>), and 48 h after transfection, &#x0223c;1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells were suspended in chilled 500 &#x003bc;l/plug of Matrigel Growth Factor Reduced solution (BD), to which recombinant BMP-2 diluted to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml or carrier was added. Plugs were implanted in the back of SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories) anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of a ketamine/xylazine cocktail. For each experimental condition, a total of four plugs was implanted in each animal and allowed to remain in place for 14 d. At the end of this period, the animals were humanely killed, and the solid Matrigel plugs were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) sections were prepared. Unstained tissue samples were double labeled with Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;labeled anti&#x02013;human CD31 and Alexa Fluor 555&#x02013;labeled anti&#x02013;mouse CD31 to identify human and murine ECs, respectively, along with DAPI to stain nuclei. 10 images per slide were captured using the 40&#x000d7; objective of an immunofluorescence microscope (DM RA2; Leica) and analyzed via Openlab software. The presence of microvessels (defined as tubes filled with red blood cells) was documented using H&#x00026;E sections, and the number of human and murine cells per condition was quantified using the aforementioned immunofluorescence techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Values from multiple experiments are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SEM. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests unless stated otherwise. A value of P &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant. The number of experiments and the sample number in each group are indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows semiquantitative RT-PCR data for all 19 known Wnt ligands found in hPAECs at baseline. Fig. S2 shows confocal images of hPAECs stimulated with BMP-2 for 1 h and labeled with a primary antibody specific for &#x003b2;-C and an Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;labeled secondary antibody. Fig. S3 shows that hPAECs treated with BMPRII siRNA fail to accumulate &#x003b2;-C when stimulated with BMP-2, an event that correlates with failure to phosphorylate both ERK1/2 and GSK3-&#x003b2;. Fig. S4 shows the loss of BMP-2&#x02013;mediated &#x003b2;-C accumulation and transcriptional activity in the presence of dominant-negative ERK (&#x00394;ERK). Fig. S5 demonstrates both the lack of impact of the Dvl mutant constructs on BMP-mediated &#x003b2;-C accumulation and the peripheral redistribution of Dvl in BMP-2&#x02013; or Wnt3a-stimulated PAECs. Videos 1 and 2 show hPAECs transfected with WT Dvl at baseline (Video 1) and in the presence of BMP-2 (Video 2). Videos 3 and 4 show hPAECs transfected with &#x00394;DEP exposed to the same conditions as described for Videos 1 and 2.
