In order to maintain genome integrity, all living organisms have developed a comprehensive set of DNA repair genes. Many of these genes are induced upon DNA damage through a signal transduction cascade. The SOS regulatory network of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is one of the damage response mechanisms that is understood in considerable detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c2">2</xref>). However, the regulatory network governing DNA damage response appears to be rather different in eukaryotes. The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has been extensively used as a model organism to explore whether eukaryotes possess a regulatory cascade analogous to the prokaryotic SOS system. There are a large number of DNA metabolism-related genes that are expressed at a low level and their expression is activated upon exposure to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c4">4</xref>). The expression of many of these genes appears to be affected by cell-cycle checkpoints through a central kinase cascade represented by Mec1&#x02013;Rad53&#x02013;Dun1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c6">6</xref>), and it has been suggested that this checkpoint pathway may be analogous to the <italic>E.coli</italic> SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c8">8</xref>). Surprisingly, there does not appear to be a common downstream transactivator that controls the expression of a large number of genes. For example, <italic>RNR</italic> genes including <italic>RNR1</italic>, <italic>RNR2</italic>, <italic>RNR3</italic> and <italic>RNR4</italic>, which encode the large and small subunits of ribonucleotide reductase, can be induced by a variety of DNA-damaging and DNA replication-blocking agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c10">10</xref>). The induction is regulated by the Mec1&#x02013;Rad53&#x02013;Dun1 kinases and accomplished by release of a transcriptional repressor, Crt1, from the X-box found in the promoter of <italic>RNR</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c8">8</xref>). The DNA damage induction of the <italic>PHR1</italic> gene, which encodes the apoenzyme for the DNA repair enzyme photolyase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c11">11</xref>), requires Rad53 but neither Dun1 nor Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c12">12</xref>). It is immediately regulated by two repressors Rph1 and Gis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c13">13</xref>). These observations suggest that eukaryotic cells may possess multiple pathways to respond to DNA damage.</p><p><italic>MAG1</italic> encodes a 3-methyladenine (3MeA) DNA glycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c14">14</xref>), which acts in the first step of a multistage base excision repair pathway for the removal of lethal lesions such as 3MeA, and protects yeast cells from killing by DNA-alkylating agents, such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c15">15</xref>). <italic>MAG1</italic> is inducible by a variety of DNA-damaging agents, regardless of whether Mag1 is required for the repair of the type of damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c17">17</xref>). <italic>DDI1</italic> encodes an ubiquitin-related protein and is involved in a DNA-damage cell-cycle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c18">18</xref>). It is located immediately upstream of <italic>MAG1</italic>, transcribed in an opposite direction, and is co-induced with <italic>MAG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c19">19</xref>). Among a number of upstream activating sequences (UASs) and upstream repressing sequences (URSs) defined within the promoter region of <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c20">20</xref>), only an 8 bp tandem repeat designated as UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> is required for the regulation of both <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c19">19</xref>).</p><p>Gene regulation is often achieved by interaction between <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements and sequence-specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory proteins. Indeed, previous studies revealed that UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> binds to a protein from yeast crude cell extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c19">19</xref>), suggesting that UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> is a classical bi-directional UAS element that interacts with a transcriptional activator and directs the downstream gene expression. Hence, it is important to identify the regulatory protein(s) in order to gain a full understanding of how <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic> are co-regulated in response to DNA damage. In this study, a yeast one-hybrid screen was employed to identify the <italic>trans</italic>-acting transcriptional factor(s) that binds to UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>. Our results showed that Pdr3, a transcriptional activator previously characterized as a multidrug-resistance gene product, is required for the basal-level and DNA damage induction of both <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic>. Further investigations into the pathways involved in the above regulation suggest a novel stress-responsive network in eukaryotic cells that coordinately regulates the responses to different environmental stresses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh838tb1">1</xref>.

The <italic>GAL4<sub>AD</sub></italic> fusion yeast genomic library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c27">27</xref>), a gift from Dr D.

The library DNA was transformed into YM4271<sub>DM</sub>; transformants were screened for growth in SD medium without Ura, Leu or His but containing 30 mM 1,2,4-amino triazole (3-AT). After confirmation of 3-AT resistance, the yeast transformants were subjected to a &#x003b2;-gal filter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c28">28</xref>).

Briefly, a 0.5 ml fresh overnight culture of the yeast transformants was used to inoculate 2.5 ml of minimal medium without Leu or without Ura, depending on the selectable marker of the <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion plasmid. Two sets of cells were allowed to grow for another 2 h. MMS was added to one set of cells at the desired concentration, and both sets were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 4 h. One milliliter of cells was used to determine cell titer by optical density at 600 nm. The remaining 2 ml of cells were collected and permeabilized in 1 ml of Buffer Z, and &#x003b2;-gal expression was determined. The specific activity is expressed in Miller units.

After growing 50 ml TN7-87A9 cells to log phase, 1.4 ml of 37% formaldehyde solution was added and the incubation continued for 15 min at room temperature to crosslink proteins to the chromatin.

In order to identify the <italic>trans</italic>-acting protein that interacts with UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>, we performed a one-hybrid screen using the 32 bp UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> as bait (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f1">1</xref>A) against a Gal4<sub>AD</sub>-fusion yeast genomic library. In order to enhance the screening stringency and eliminate false-positive clones, three tandem copies of the UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> elements were inserted upstream of two separate reporter genes, <italic>HIS3</italic> and <italic>lacZ</italic>, which lack their own promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f1">1</xref>A). Furthermore, both reporter genes were integrated into the yeast genome to reduce potential background expression associated with multicopy plasmids. A total of 72 independent transformants formed colonies on the selective plates containing 30 mM 3-AT, among which 18 were also positive in a &#x003b2;-gal filter assay. Upon plasmid recovery and re-transformation into the reporter strain, 12 clones maintained 3-AT<sup>R</sup> and &#x003b2;-gal activity, as shown by a representative clone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f1">1</xref>B, <italic>PDR3</italic>) and thus were considered positive clones. DNA sequencing of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of genomic DNA inserts from each of the positive clones revealed that 9 out of 12 clones contain the full-length <italic>PDR3</italic> gene. No other genes adjacent to <italic>PDR3</italic> are intact in all nine clones. Hence, Pdr3 appears to be the primary candidate that binds to UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> in the one-hybrid assay. Furthermore, DNA sequencing revealed that none of the clones contain proper gene fusion that would produce in-frame Gal4<sub>AD</sub>&#x02013;Pdr3. Hence, we conclude that Pdr3 activates UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> through its own DNA binding and activation domains, that the library simply serves as a yeast multicopy genomic library and that results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f1">1</xref>B served as a promoter&#x02013;reporter gene assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Pdr3 is an <italic>in vivo</italic> transactivator of <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic></title><p><italic>PDR3</italic> encodes a 976 amino acid, 112.5 kDa protein that is an important transcriptional activator involved in multidrug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c35">35</xref>). <italic>PDR3</italic> regulates the expression of several multidrug-resistance genes encoding ABC transporters serving as membrane efflux pumps; the <italic>pdr3</italic> null mutant displays enhanced sensitivity to rhodamine 6G and diazaborine but not to cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c36">36</xref>).

In order to confirm the effect of <italic>PDR3</italic> on the damage induction of <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic>, we examined the expression of <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic> in wild-type and its isogenic <italic>pdr3</italic> null mutant by both northern hybridization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f2">2</xref>A) and using <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion constructs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f2">2</xref>B). Compared with isogenic wild-type cells, the <italic>pdr3</italic> mutation reduced basal-level expression of <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic> by 2.5&#x02013;3-fold and DNA damage induction by up to 8-fold. This result is comparable with our previous observation of the deletion of, and site-specific mutagenesis within, UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c19">19</xref>). In order to further confirm that Pdr3 is acting on UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>, we determined the effects of <italic>pdr3</italic> on <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic> promoters deleted for UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f3">3</xref>, deletion of <italic>PDR3</italic> does not further affect <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic> expression if the UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> is deleted, indicating that UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> is indeed the target of Pdr3 activation. The results are thus consistent with our hypothesis that Pdr3 acts as a transcriptional activator of <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic> through the bi-directional UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> element shared by these two promoters. Furthermore, the good correlation between results of northern hybridization and <italic>lacZ</italic> reporters lends support to our use of the <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion constructs for future quantitative analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Pdr1 contributes to <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>, but does not play a role in <italic>MAG1&#x02013;DDI1</italic> activation</title><p><italic>PDR1</italic> is a structural and functional homolog of <italic>PDR3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c37">37</xref>). Pdr1 and Pdr3 have overlapping functions in the regulation of multidrug-resistance genes, and both transcriptional factors bind to the same consensus palindrome sequence, 5&#x02032;-TCCGCGGA-3&#x02032;, called <underline>p</underline>leiotropic <underline>d</underline>rug <underline>r</underline>esistance <underline>e</underline>lement (PDRE), which is identified in the promoter region of most of their target multidrug-resistance genes. The UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> tandem repeat sequence is rather different from PDRE, and no other PDRE sequence is found in the internal region flanked by the UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> tandem repeats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f1">1</xref>A). In order to establish that Pdr3 and&#x0002f;or Pdr1 indeed bind to UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>, an EMSA was performed by using radioactively labeled UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> as a probe against total yeast cell extracts. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c19">19</xref>) and shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f4">4</xref>, a cell extract from wild-type cells forms two protein&#x02013;DNA complexes with UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> in a dose-dependent manner. Increased concentration of cell extract appears to favor the higher molecular weight complex formation over the lower molecular weight complex. The formation of both complexes was abolished by proteinase K treatment (lane 1), indicating that they are indeed protein&#x02013;DNA complexes. The complexes are deemed DNA sequence-specific, since their formation was inhibited by excess unlabeled UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> (lane 2), but not by excess non-specific DNA such as poly(dI&#x02013;dC) (in all reactions) and other double-stranded DNA (data not shown). The band intensity, especially that of the higher molecular weight band, decreased dramatically with a cell extract from the <italic>pdr3</italic> mutant, but did not show a significant alteration with a cell extract from the <italic>pdr1</italic> mutant. In contrast, the lower molecular weight complex appears to decrease with increasing wild-type cell extract, whereas this complex formation in <italic>pdr1</italic> and <italic>pdr3</italic> mutants is correlated with amount of cell extracts. It is interesting to note that Pdr1 and Pdr3 can form a heterodimer to bind PDRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c38">38</xref>). Nevertheless, the formation of both UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>&#x02013;protein complexes was completely abolished in the <italic>pdr1 pdr3</italic> double mutant. This result indicates that Pdr3 is the major UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>-binding protein in yeast cells, whereas Pdr1 may also be able to bind UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> in the absence of Pdr3.</p><p>The contribution of Pdr1 in the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> in the above EMSA appears to imply that <italic>PDR1</italic> plays a backup or overlap role in the <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation of <italic>MAG1&#x02013;DDI1</italic> expression, as seen in the regulation of <italic>PDR</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c35">35</xref>).

To further address whether this interaction is a result of direct contact between Pdr3 and UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>, we performed an EMSA using bacterial cell extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f6">6</xref>B) and found that cells expressing GST&#x02013;Pdr3 were able to form a specific Pdr3&#x02013;UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> complex in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2&#x02013;4), whereas the extract from cells expressing GST alone (lane 5) was unable to form such a complex. The complex is abolished by proteinase K treatment (lane 6), indicating that it is indeed a DNA&#x02013;protein complex.

To determine whether Rpn4 is directly involved in UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> binding <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed the yeast reporter gene assay with a multicopy plasmid containing the <italic>RPN4</italic> gene. Like Pdr3, Rpn4 contains an activation domain and is able to transactivate <italic>RPN</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c41">41</xref>); hence it does not need to be fused to Gal<sub>AD</sub> for the assay. However, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f1">1</xref>B, under the conditions used to isolate and positively identify <italic>PDR3</italic>, overexpression of <italic>RPN4</italic> in YM4271<sub>DM</sub> did not activate UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> or UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>&#x02013;<italic>HIS3</italic>.

This is consistent with the phenotypes observed when UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> is deleted or mutated in the above promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c19">19</xref>), and provides direct evidence that Pdr3 is an <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptional activator of UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>. Given the structural homology and functional overlap of Pdr1 with Pdr3 in the multidrug-resistance pathway, it was anticipated that Pdr1 may also play a role in the regulation of <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic>. However, deletion of <italic>PDR1</italic> in either wild-type or in the <italic>pdr3</italic> mutant does not alter <italic>MAG1&#x02013;DDI1</italic> basal or DNA damage-induced expression, although in the absence of Pdr3, Pdr1 appears to bind UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> in an <italic>in vitro</italic> EMSA assay. The differential effect of <italic>PDR1</italic> and <italic>PDR3</italic> on the target gene is not unprecedented. For example, among ABC transporter genes regulated by <italic>PDR1&#x0002f;PDR3</italic>, the expression of <italic>PDR5</italic> is significantly inhibited in the <italic>pdr1</italic> single mutant, while <italic>SNQ2</italic> transcription is only abolished in the <italic>pdr1 pdr3</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c35">35</xref>). It was also shown that the activation of <italic>PDR5</italic> by mitochondrial defects required the presence of <italic>PDR3</italic> but not <italic>PDR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c44">44</xref>). A recent microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c45">45</xref>) suggests that many yeast genes are differentially regulated by <italic>PDR1</italic> and <italic>PDR3</italic>. Furthermore, <italic>PDR1</italic> and <italic>PDR3</italic> may act as either positive or negative regulators on different target genes.</p><p>Pdr1 and Pdr3 belong to a family of bi-nuclear Gal4-like Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> transcription factors and their target PDRE sequence has been well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c46">46</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that Pdr3, and possibly Pdr1, also recognizes promoter sequences other than PDRE and that Pdr3 is involved in the regulation of genes other than ABC transporter genes. The direct recognition of UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> by Pdr3 is demonstrated by EMSA using yeast cell extracts as well as recombinant GST&#x02013;Pdr3 produced in bacterial cells, and this result is further supported <italic>in vivo</italic> by the ChIP assay. This is reminiscent of the microarray study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c45">45</xref>), which found that only 15 out of the 26 genes positively regulated by <italic>PDR1&#x0002f;PDR3</italic> contain PDRE elements in their promoter regions. It remains to be determined whether there are other Pdr1 and&#x0002f;or Pdr3 binding consensus sequence than PDRE and UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>, or whether these genes are activated by a third transcriptional factor subject to regulation by Pdr1&#x0002f;Pdr3. Recently, it was shown that Pdr1 and&#x0002f;or Pdr3 can activate transcription through a downstream target gene <italic>YRR1</italic>, which also encodes a transcriptional factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c47">47</xref>).</p><p>Rpn4 functions as a transcriptional activator of genes encoding subunits of the 26S proteasome and several other components of the ubiquitination system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c41">41</xref>). Rpn4 binds PACE, a consensus sequence found in the promoter region of 26 out of the 32 proteasomal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c41">41</xref>). The <italic>rpn4</italic> mutation was recently found to affect <italic>MAG1</italic> expression and the effect was attributed to the sequence similarity between PACE and the 8 bp tandem repeats found in the promoter of <italic>MAG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c43">43</xref>). We examined the roles of <italic>RPN4</italic> in the basal-level and damage-induced expression of <italic>MAG1</italic> and <italic>DDI1</italic>, and found that indeed <italic>RPN4</italic> is required for the expression of both genes. Since UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> is the only <italic>cis</italic>-acting element known to function bi-directionally, our observations support the notion that <italic>RPN4</italic> acts via the 8 bp tandem repeat. However, our results do not support UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> as the direct binding site of Rpn4. First, <italic>RPN4</italic> was not identified in a yeast library screen despite repeated isolation of <italic>PDR3</italic>, and overexpression of <italic>RPN4</italic> does not activate UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> reporter genes. Second, although the <italic>RNR2</italic> promoter also contains a sequence with a 7&#x0002f;9 match to PACE and UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic>, its expression was not affected by deletion of <italic>RPN4</italic>.</p><p>In summary, our observation that two distinct stress-responsive pathways (i.e. multidrug resistance and ubiquitination) are involved in DNA damage response suggests that eukaryotic cells may possess a central coordinating system in response to environmental stresses. The notion of cross-talk between stress-responsive pathways is supported by recent reports of interactions between Pdr1&#x0002f;3 and Rpn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c48">48</xref>). This type of general control system appears to differ from bacteria, where a given environmental signal may trigger only a particular regulon with a specific set of genes solely responsible for the stress. It is generally believed that the difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in response to DNA damage is due to their distinct cell cycles. Indeed, the cell-cycle checkpoint genes are involved in the DNA damage induction of almost all the target genes analyzed in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c49">49</xref>), and the phenomenon has been referred to as a eukaryotic SOS response. Interestingly, although these DNA damage-inducible genes share a common regulatory pathway mediated by cell-cycle checkpoints, the effectors are apparently different and strikingly diverse. Among three well-studied cases, the four <italic>RNR</italic> genes are regulated by the repressor Crt1 and two co-repressors, Tup1 and Ssn6; inactivation of any one of these three proteins results in constitutive derepression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c8">8</xref>). In contrast, <italic>PHR1</italic> is regulated by two repressors, Rph1 and Gis1, and either is sufficient for repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c13">13</xref>). We have shown previously that inactivation of any of the above repressors has no effect on <italic>MAG1&#x02013;DDI1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh838c39">39</xref>). Accordingly, this study demonstrates that two transactivators, Pdr3 and Rpn4, are required for the positive regulation of the dually expressed <italic>MAG1&#x02013;DDI1</italic> genes, but are not involved in the regulation of <italic>RNR2</italic> and <italic>PHR1</italic>. A diagram summarizing our current understanding of DNA damage induction in budding yeast is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh838f9">9</xref>. The fact that all three sets of genes studied so far are coordinately regulated by checkpoints, but each has its own effectors, testifies to the complexity of the signal transduction cascade in this simple eukaryote. Why eukaryotic cells evolved this complicated monitoring and regulatory system remains to be illustrated.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh838f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Pdr3 binds and activates UAS<italic><sub>DM</sub></italic> in a one-hybrid assay.
