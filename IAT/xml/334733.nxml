Mutant S20s of interest were synthesized in vitro from the appropriate plasmid templates by coupled transcription and translation. The affinity of S20 produced in vitro for 16S rRNA is 1.2 x 10(7) (M-1) in a gel filtration assay. Removal of as few as 6 residues from the C terminus of S20 results in a sharp loss of binding activity, suggesting the presence of critical residues in this region. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of S20 indicates that these residues may constitute part of a segment of alpha helix. Although S20 is known to autoregulate its own synthesis, we were unable to demonstrate any measurable affinity of S20 for its own mRNA.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0221-a" xlink:role="1006"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0212.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="997"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="998"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="999"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1000"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1001"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0217.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1002"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0218.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1003"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0219.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1004"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0220.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1005"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0221.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1006"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0222.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1007"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0223.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1008"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0224.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1009"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0225.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1010"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
