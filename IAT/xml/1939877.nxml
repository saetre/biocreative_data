Here we show that in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, these and other lifespan-extending conditions, including caloric restriction and osmotic stress, increase the efficiency with which nutrient-depleted cells establish or maintain a cell cycle arrest in G1. Proteins required for efficient G1 arrest and longevity when nutrients are limiting include the DNA replication stress response proteins Mec1 and Rad53. Ectopic expression of <italic>CLN3</italic> encoding a G1 cyclin downregulated during nutrient depletion increases the frequency with which nutrient depleted cells arrest growth in S phase instead of G1. Ectopic expression of <italic>CLN3</italic> also shortens chronological lifespan in concert with age-dependent increases in genome instability and apoptosis. These findings indicate that replication stress is an important determinant of chronological lifespan in budding yeast. Protection from replication stress by growth-inhibitory effects of caloric restriction, osmotic and other stresses may contribute to hormesis effects on lifespan. Replication stress also likely impacts the longevity of higher eukaryotes, including humans.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotic organisms as diverse as yeasts and mice, lifespan is extended by caloric restriction or mutations that inactivate conserved growth signaling pathways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Longo1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Longo2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>).

However, a definitive role for oxidative damage in aging has not yet been established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Balaban1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Lombard1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

It also remains unclear how cellular responses to other stresses might inhibit age-dependent increases in DNA damage and promote longevity.</p><p>The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has proved to be a valuable model organism for investigating conserved pathways regulating lifespan in all eukaryotes. Replicative lifespan in budding yeast is assessed by determining the number of times cells divide in the presence of nutrients before they senesce and die <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Bitterman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> via an apoptotic-like mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Laun1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. An important factor determining replicative lifespan is DNA replication stress&#x02013;i.e., inefficient DNA replication that leads to replication fork stalling&#x02013;which stimulates recombination at a replication fork barrier in the rDNA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Hoopes1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and references therein).</p><p>Chronological lifespan in budding yeast is distinct from replicative lifespan and is measured by assessing the viability of cells driven into a growth-arrested state by nutrient depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Bitterman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The quiescent state of nutrient-depleted budding yeast cells shares features with postmitotic cells in higher eukaryotes, including growth arrest of a large fraction of cells with a G1 content of DNA. Nutrient-depleted budding yeast cells can survive in this quiescent state for an extended time, during which replenishing the medium restores growth. Similar to replicatively aged budding yeast cells, chronologically aged cells eventually die via an apoptotic-like mechanism that includes degradation of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Herker1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Fabrizio3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Most efforts to understand how alterations in nutrient-signaling pathways impact chronological lifespan in budding yeast have focused on changes in nutrient depletion-induced stress resistance, especially resistance to oxidative stress. Stress resistance in this organism is mediated in large part by the &#x0201c;Rim15 regulon&#x0201d;, which is upregulated by the Rim15 kinase in response to depletion of nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Cameroni1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Swinnen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The Rim15 regulon includes a number of genes that, like <italic>RIM15</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Fabrizio2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, promote longevity in the chronological aging model. This includes genes encoding the stress-responsive transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 and genes induced by Msn2 and Msn4, such as <italic>SOD1</italic> and <italic>SOD2</italic> encoding superoxide dismutases that mitigate oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Fabrizio1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In the presence of glucose and other nutrients, Rim15 kinase activity and the induction of stress resistance are inhibited by the Ras-cAMP glucose signaling pathway, the constitutive activation of which shortens lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Fabrizio4">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, nuclear localization of Rim15, which is required for induction of the Rim15 regulon, is negatively regulated by Sch9 in the presence of glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Pedruzzi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition to the G1 arrest induced when medium is depleted of nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Reinders1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, Rim15 is also required for G1 arrest when TOR-dependent nitrogen-signaling pathways are inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Pedruzzi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, Rim15 integrates signals from several nutrient-signaling pathways to arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle during nutrient deprivation, in addition to its induction of oxidative and other stress responses. The possibility that alterations in the Rim15-dependent G1 arrest induced by nutrient deprivation impact chronological lifespan when nutrient signaling pathways are altered has not been investigated previously.</p><p>The shorter lifespan of nutrient-depleted <italic>rim15&#x00394;</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Fabrizio2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> is accompanied by growth arrest throughout the cell cycle, including S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Pedruzzi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

This more efficient G1 arrest would protect against replication stress-induced genome instability and apoptosis by reducing the growth arrest of cells in S phase with incompletely replicated chromosomes. To test this hypothesis, we measured the frequency with which cells arrest in G1 and undergo apoptosis during nutrient depletion under conditions previously shown to alter the chronological lifespan of this organism, including caloric restriction and osmotic stress. We also examined the frequency with which nutrient depletion induces G1 arrest and apoptosis in strains defective in responses to DNA replication stress. The results of these experiments demonstrated that nutrient depletion causes replication stress in cells that fail to enter into or maintain a G1 arrest when deprived of nutrients and instead arrest growth in S phase. They suggest that, in addition to its role in replicative aging in budding yeast, replication stress is an important factor determining chronological lifespan in this organism.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Correlation between lifespan and efficiency of G1 arrest in nutrient-depleted cells</title><p><italic>SCH9</italic> encodes a kinase that promotes glucose and nitrogen signaling in budding yeast in parallel with the Ras-cAMP glucose-sensing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Roosen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and references therein).

In budding yeast, nutrient signaling pathways that respond to glucose, nitrogen and phosphate converge upon Rim15, which is downregulated by signaling through these pathways when nutrients are plentiful. Activation of Rim15 when nutrient signaling is inhibited induces stress response factors (including Msn2 and Msn4) and stress responses mediated by Sod1, Sod2 and other proteins that mitigate oxidative damage and other effects of stresses. Reduced nutrient signaling also downregulates Cln3 and downstream Clns1 and 2, which are required for activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. Inactivation of Cdc28 during nutrient depletion contributes to a G1 arrest that protects against replication stress. Osmotic stress (and perhaps other stresses) also contribute to G1 arrest during nutrient depletion. G1 arrest in response to nutrient depletion and other stresses may be mediated in part by induction of the transcriptional repressor Xbp1, which inhibits Cln transcription. Enhancement of G1 arrest by caloric restriction, osmotic stress or mutational inactivation of nutrient signaling pathways protects against replication stress and promotes longevity in combination with Rim15-dependent responses to oxidative-and other stresses.

In cycling cells, osmotic stress inhibits growth by inducing a G1 arrest accompanied by the downregulation of Clns and Cdc28 activity.

Our results also indicate that nutrient depletion causes DNA replication stress. The induction of replication stress during nutrient depletion is indicated by the finding that cellular responses mediated by Mec1 and Rad53 (which respond to replication stress and DNA damage) are more important to the survival of nutrient-depleted cells than responses mediated by Rad9 (which responds to DNA damage, but not replication stress). At least at initial stages of nutrient depletion, Mec1 mitigates replication stress, most likely by increasing levels of dNTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000748-g003">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000748-g004">4</xref>). This is indicated by the ability of ectopically expressed <italic>RNR1</italic> to suppress the shorter lifespan and increased apoptosis in nutrient-depleted <italic>mec1-21</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000748-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Ectopic expression of <italic>RNR1</italic> would have the effect of increasing dNTP pools that in wild type (but not <italic>mec1-21</italic>) cells are upregulated by Mec1 and Rad53 in response to replication stress. Mec1 and Rad53 upregulate ribonucleotide reductase by a mechanism that leads to destabilization of the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor Sml1. Therefore, replication stress at early stages of nutrient depletion is mostly or entirely a consequence of starvation for dNTPs. Consistent with this possibility, <italic>mec1&#x00394;</italic> cells from which <italic>SML1</italic> has also been deleted (which leads to increased levels of dNTPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Zhao2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>) are phenotypically similar to wild type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000748.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). The absence of effects in <italic>mec1&#x00394; sml1&#x00394;</italic> compared to wild type cells also suggests that the checkpoint function of Mec1, which is separate from its role in regulating dNTP metabolism, does not play a role in regulating chronological lifespan.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>RAD9</italic> also shortens lifespan and accelerates apoptosis, although not to the same extent as the <italic>mec1-21</italic> and <italic>rad53-21</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000748-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, nutrient depletion likely induces DNA damage in addition to replication stress. Nutrient depletion-induced DNA damage is consistent with the age-dependent accumulation of mutations during chronological aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000748-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Fabrizio5">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>). Importantly, the induction of DNA damage or replication stress during nutrient depletion is not inconsistent with our failure to detect a role for Mec1-dependent checkpoint responses in the survival of nutrient-depleted cells. Mec1-dependent pathways are inactivated by superoxide anions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Carter1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, which accumulate during nutrient depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Bonawitz1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Since Mec1-dependent pathways also contribute to the stability of stalled replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Cobb1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>, inactivation of these pathways by superoxide anions at later stages of nutrient depletion might contribute to DNA damage in nutrient-depleted cells undergoing replication stress.</p><p>Although replication stress-induced recombination in the rDNA locus is a major determinant of budding yeast replicative lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Hoopes1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and references therein), replication stress has not been considered a factor in chronological aging in this organism. Most likely this is because during nutrient depletion, most cells appear to arrest without buds and with a G1 content of DNA, which suggests they are not in S phase. It is difficult to detect minor increases in DNA content by flow cytometry, however, and small buds are difficult to detect microscopically. Furthermore, the activation of some, but not all, nutrient signaling pathways may lead to uncoupling of events required for budding from progression past Start. Consequently, although DNA content and bud counts provide useful relative measures of the number of cells that arrest in G1 during nutrient depletion, they likely overestimate the number of G1 cells and underestimate the number of cells that arrest growth while in S phase.</p><p>This view is consistent with a recent report that nutrient depletion leads to the accumulation of a substantial fraction of less dense cells, which includes all the cells that remain budded during nutrient depletion plus many cells that do not appear to have buds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000748-Allen1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. These less-dense cells differentially express a number of genes encoding proteins required for the resolution of stalled DNA replication forks, suggesting they are under replication stress. These cells also more frequently undergo apoptosis compared to denser cells that do not express these genes. These phenotypes are consistent with our proposed role for nutrient depletion-induced replication stress in chronological aging.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>How does nutrient depletion cause replication stress in S phase cells?</title><p>Several factors likely contribute to replication stress in cells that arrest growth in S phase during nutrient depletion.

Deregulated growth signaling and inappropriate entry into, or exit from, the cell cycle in nutrient-starved budding yeast cells provide a new paradigm for investigating how oncogenic activation of growth-regulatory pathways and the induction of replication stress in mammalian cells contribute to cancer and other age-related diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Strain backgrounds employed in this study were DBY746 (MATa leu2-3, 112, his3&#x00394;1 trp1-289, ura3-52, GAL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>); W303-1A (MATa, ade2-1, ura3-1, his3-11, trp1-1, leu2-3, can1-100), JC482 (MAT&#x003b1;, leu2, ura3, his4) and BY4741 (MATa, his3&#x00394;1, leu2&#x00394;0, met15&#x00394;0, ura3&#x00394;0).

To assess the effects of osmotic stress, sorbitol was added to these cultures to a final concentration of 1M. For experiments requiring ectopic expression of <italic>CLN3</italic>, SC medium was pre-depleted by growth of <italic>sch9&#x00394;</italic> cells for 7 days followed by pelleting of cells and filter sterilization of medium. Exponential cultures of DBY746 cells transformed with pCLN3 or a vector control plasmid were seeded into standard SC medium. Beginning 24 hours later, cells were pelleted from medium and resuspended in pre-depleted medium every other day throughout the course of experiments.</p><p>To assess the effects of caloric restriction on chronological lifespan, an equal number of cells from exponentially proliferating cultures were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with fresh medium containing 0.5&#x00025; glucose and then seeded into this latter medium or into fresh medium containing 2&#x00025; glucose.

However, repetition of these experiments in the SC formulation employed in other experiments confirmed that the effects of caloric restriction were the same in both formulations (not shown).</p><p>In all chronological lifespan measurements, aliquots removed from cultures at the indicated times were plated in triplicate on YPD agar to determine survival (as colony forming units). To determine budding indices and DNA content, cells in aliquots taken at each time point were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in water (for determining budding index) or 70&#x00025; ethanol (for flow cytometry). The budding status of at least 500 cells from each aliquot was visually determined using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope with a 40&#x000d7; phase contrast objective. Just before examining cells, cell clumps were dissociated by sonication using a Model 60 Sonic Dismembrator sonicator (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) for 10 seconds at power setting 5. To measure DNA content by flow cytometry, cells suspended in 70&#x00025; ethanol were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 50 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.5) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of this same buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml RNAse. After overnight incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, an additional 0.5 ml. of sodium citrate buffer containing 2 &#x000b5;M SYTOX Green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to each sample. Stained cells were briefly sonicated as described above and DNA content was measured using a FacsCaliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Woburn, MA) at a maximum flow rate of 500 cells/s. Flow cytometry data were processed using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and Flojo (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR) software.

Photomicrographs of stained cells were obtained at 400&#x000d7; magnification with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with an Optronics Magnafire CCD camera. To determine relative amounts of mitochondrial compared to nuclear DNA, total yeast DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme XmnI, which produces a 6.3 kb fragment of nuclear DNA containing the <italic>ACT1</italic> gene and a 10.2 kb fragment of mitochondrial DNA containing sequences encoding 15S ribosomal RNA. XmnI-digested DNA was separated on 1&#x00025; agarose gels and transferred to Duralon hybridization membranes.
