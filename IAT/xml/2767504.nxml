While Ate1 knockout (KO) embryos initially develop normal blood vessels in the process of vasculogenesis, the capillary network formation during subsequent angiogenesis is impaired, leading to defective capillary branching and their premature termination. These defects result in paleness, thin blood vessels, frequent skin edemas, and hemorrhages in the Ate1 KO embryos, and have been previously proposed to underlie the lethality in Ate1 KO mice, however the mechanisms of these defects, and the cells and tissues responsible for the Ate1&#x02212;/&#x02212; angiogenic phenotypes, are unknown.</p><p>Past work from our lab showed that a prominent subset of proteins arginylated in vivo constitutes structural and functional components of the cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007734-Wong1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, with roles in cell migration and cell division &#x02013; the processes that are important during many developmental stages from gametogenesis to organ morphogenesis.

It has also been established by multiple groups that embryonic angiogenesis is driven by endothelial cells that migrate through tissues in the developing organism, forming branches off the existing blood vessels and laying out the mature circulatory system (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007734-Patan1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007734-vanHinsbergh1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>). Taken together, these findings lead to a hypothesis that Ate1-dependent regulation of angiogenesis occurs through regulation of the motility of endothelial cells during tissue remodeling in embryogenesis, and that Ate1 function may also be essential for other cytoskeleton-dependent processes in development. To test this hypothesis, we generated a conditional knockout model (Tek-Ate1), in which Ate1 deletion is driven by the mouse Tek promoter of endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase (also known as Tie2) that is expressed in endothelial cells and the germ line, and studied the phenotype of the resulting Tek-Ate1 mice.</p><p>Contrary to our expectations, Tek-Ate1 mice were viable and had no visible angiogenesis-related phenotypes, suggesting that Ate1 plays no major role in endothelial cells during development. At the same time, these mice showed reproductive defects, with high rates of embryonic lethality in the second generation, at stages much earlier than the complete Ate1 KO strain. Control matings showed that some of the early lethality originated from the subpopulation of embryos with homozygous Tek-Cre transgene, a problem that has not previously been reported for this commercial mouse strain. However, we also found a distinct subpopulation of embryos whose lethality at early post-implantation stages could be explained only by a previously unknown defect in gametogenesis originating from Tek-driven Ate1 deletion in premeiotic germs cells. Further analysis showed that the combined defects of Tek-Ate1 knockout lead to an overall &#x0223c;80&#x00025; embryonic lethality.

Since it is known that in such experiments the developmental rate differs for different mouse strains, two strains were used as a control: B6C3 (a strain known for its good in vitro development) and Ate1-floxed (a mouse strain that matches the CKO in the strain background and handling, while being, for all intents and purposes, a wild type strain). In B6C3 mice (not shown) all embryos reached blastocyst stage by E3.5 in culture (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;40).

Indeed, if CKO mice have endothelial-driven angiogenic defects, such defects may result in a decreased blood supply to the fetus and uterine incompetence and could lead to delayed development and death at early post-implantation stages. In addition, these mice may also exhibit defects in wound healing that heavily rely on the angionenic processes. To test these possibilities, we performed embryo transfer experiments, in which control embryos were transferred into CKO females and vice versa (WT to CKO and CKO to WT, respectively, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007734-g003">Figure 3</xref>), followed by euthanasia and uteri removal at mid-development to observe the size and morphology of the embryos. We found that CKO females were as capable as WT to recover from the surgery preformed during embryo transfer (indicating their normal wound healing abilities), as well as to support pregnancy (80&#x00025; of transferred embryos implanted and reached normal size at E8.5, compared to 60&#x02013;65&#x00025; in the control females) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007734-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This result and the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007734-g001">Figure 1</xref> indicate that CKO females have normal angiogenic-related processes, can support embryonic development until E8.5, and that the embryonic death and developmental delays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007734-g002">Figure 2</xref> are due exclusively to the embryo-specific defects.</p><fig id="pone-0007734-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007734.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>CKO females do not have angiogenic defects that affect pregnancy.</title><p>Embryos from CKO &#x000d7; CKO matings were transferred into WT female recipients (CKO to WT) and vice versa (WT to CKO); as a control, WT embryos were transferred to WT females (WT to WT).

While this lethality rate partially masks the lethality observed in Tek-Ate1, the overall rates of early lethality of the CKO embryos suggest that on top of the homozygous Tek-Cre, CKO mice have an additional reason for lethality, related to Ate1 deletion in tissues other than endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Ate1-dependent early lethality in Tek-Ate1 mice originates from defects in gametogenesis</title><p>As mentioned above, in addition to endothelial cells, leaky Tek-driven Cre expression occurs in hematopoietic cells and the germ line, resulting in the deletion of the loxP-franked alleles in these tissues with unspecified rates. However, since the effect of Ate1 on hematopoetic cells is expected to manifest itself later in development, Ate1 deletion in the hematopoetic cells of the embryos is unlikely to produce the lethality at or before E7.5 as seen in our study. Therefore, it appears likely that the lethality observed here is due to Ate1 deletion in the germ line.</p><p>To address this possibility and to find out how frequently the germ line deletion of Ate1 happens in CKO males and females before and after meiosis, we analyzed the rates of the deletion of Ate1 in female and male germ line by mating CKO and WT males and females in reciprocal combinations (CKO male to WT female and vice versa) and genotyping the fetuses from the resulting matings, collected at E12.5 and E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007734-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Since expression of Cre recombinase does not result in lethality in other conditional mouse strains, and since the Jackson Laboratory currently has another Tek-Cre mouse strain in development, which is stated to be viable as Tek homozygotes, we suggest that this lethality originates from the site of insertion of the Tek-Cre transgene, which may disrupt the function of an essential gene.</p><fig id="pone-0007734-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007734.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Defects in gametogenesis in Tek-Ate1 lead to early embryonic lethality.</title><p>Top, in complete Ate1 knockout, gametes are generated from Ate1 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; germ cells, leading to the formation of normal sperm and oocytes that carry Ate1&#x0002b; and Ate1- alleles.

Homozygous Tek-Cre is expected to occur with 25&#x00025; frequency and result in complete lethality before E7.5, however, in CKO &#x000d7; CKO matings more than 40&#x00025; of embryos die at this stage, suggesting that the remaining &#x0223c;15&#x00025; on top of the Tek-Cre-induced lethality is due to the deletion of the Ate1-floxed allele (denoted &#x00394; in the tables and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007734-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

Such mice likely die after E12.5, similarly to complete Ate1 knockout.</p><p>Since Ate1 &#x00394;/&#x00394; mice die much earlier in development than the previously characterized Ate1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, it is clear that the Ate1 &#x00394;/&#x00394; phenotype is much more severe than Ate1 &#x00394;/&#x02212; or Ate1 &#x02212;/&#x02212;. The only plausible explanation for this difference is that premeiotic Ate1 deletion in the Ate1 &#x00394;/&#x00394;mice affects gametogenesis, resulting in the formation of severely defective gametes that cannot support development past implantation. Indeed, in Ate1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice the gametes carrying the knockout allele develop from Ate1&#x0002b;/&#x02212; precursors, which contain a functional arginyltransferase and have never been found to have any defects. In agreement with this, the first generation CKO progeny of Tek floxed/&#x0002b; mice, whose mothers carry the post-meiotic Ate1 &#x00394; allele, is viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007734-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Combined lethality of Tek homozygous and Ate1 &#x00394;/&#x00394; mice amounts to &#x0223c;40&#x00025;, yet the lethality at term seen in our experiments is much higher (estimated lethality rate over 80&#x00025;, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007734-g001">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that a significant number of embryos (40&#x00025; or more) develop normally past E8.5 but die before birth. Based on the expected genotypes shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007734-t001">Table 1</xref>, it appears likely that these embryos have Ate1 &#x00394;/f genotype, i.e., develop from one defective gamete affected by premeiotic Ate1 deletion and one normal floxed allele. It is possible that in such embryos the effect of the defective Ate1 &#x00394; gamete is combined with the effect of Tek-Cre-driven later-stage deletion of Ate1 in endothelial and/or hematopoetic cells. According to our calculations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007734-t001">Table 1</xref>), an estimated 57&#x00025; of embryos carry the Ate1 &#x00394;/f genotype. If all these embryos could not survive until birth, the rates of lethality in CKO matings would have been close to 100&#x00025;. Therefore, it appears likely that the developmental impact of one defective gamete is variable and some of these embryos can still develop to term.</p><p>It has been previously reported that Tek-Cre is active in the female germ line, but not in the male germ line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007734-deLange1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, however the Jackson Laboratory reports that a small percentage of the male germ line is also expressing the Tek-Cre transgene. In our study 18&#x00025; of fetuses had Ate1 &#x00394; allele of paternal origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007734-g005">Figure 5</xref>). While some of this deletion could originate from the mothers of CKO male mice, it appears likely that at least some of these cases originate from partial Tek-Cre expression in the male germ line. In our study we have addressed the possibility of CKO-related chromosomal defects in the germ cells in the testes and found that these cells have normal karyotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007734.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our data show that embryos from CKO matings that are homozygous for Ate1 &#x00394; allele die before E7.5, much earlier than regular Ate1 KO (Ate1 &#x02212;/&#x02212;), suggesting that Ate1 &#x00394; gametes have severe defects and cannot support normal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007734-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In females, premeiotic Ate1 deletion results in the formation of defective oocytes. In males, depending on whether Tek-cre is activated in the germ line, the deletion of Ate1 allele in the sperm happens either before or during meiosis. In the case of premeiotic deletion, the resulting sperm is expected to have defects similar to those in oocytes. In the case of postmeiotic deletion, such sperm would behave similarly to regular Ate1 knockout. It is possible that germ cell development in the CKO males is affected by Tek-Cre-driven Ate1 deletion in endothelial and/or hematopoietic cells.</p><p>In addition, large part of embryos heterozygous for Ate1&#x00394; die after E12.5, suggesting that the defects in Ate1&#x00394; gametes cannot be completely rescued by an intact floxed allele, and pointing to a possibility that in such embryos Tek-Cre-driven Ate1 deletion in other tissues may contribute to lethality.</p><p>Deletion of Ate1 in premeiotic germ cells could result in significant changes in gametogenesis, leading to the high rates of embryonic lethality seen in our study. Indeed, Ate1 function has been implicated in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and a large subset of identified arginyltransferase substrates (including actin, tubulin, and dynein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007734-Wong1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>) play key roles in cell division, meiotic chromosome segregation and sperm motility (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007734-Wong2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007734-Bement1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> for overview). Impaired arginylation of these proteins at premeiotic stages could cause disregulation of meiosis, leading to abnormal nuclear shaping, impaired cell communication, aneuploidy of oocytes or sperm, and/or abnormal distribution of the essential components in the oocyte cytoplasm. While such germ cells may be able to undergo normal fertilization, the effect of such disregulation, in combination with continuing abnormalities during cell division, would lead to developmental delay, embryo abnormalities, and death at early post-implantation stages as seen in our study. Since identification of proteins arginylated in vivo is only at its initial stages, it is also possible that some of the arginylated proteins, or proteins regulated by arginyltransferase, have additional roles in germ cell development, for example in regulating the epigenetic modifications essential for normal gametogenesis. Studies of the underlying mechanisms that link premeiotic Ate1 function with normal development using germ line-specific Ate1 knockout mouse models constitute an exciting direction of further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse strains used in this study</title><p>For different experiments in this study, the following mouse strains were used: B6.Cg-Tg(Tek-cre)12Flv/J (Tek-Cre, The Jackson Laboratory, stock number 004128); Ate1-floxed and Tek-Ate1 conditional knockout mice (CKO) (see below for the mouse strain generation); Ate1 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007734-Rai2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Animals were maintained and used for the experiments according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pennsylvania.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generation of Ate1-floxed and Tek-Ate1 mice</title><p>Mice with the exons 1-3 of the Ate1 gene flanked by LoxP sites (Ate1-floxed mice) were generated by introducing a targeting construct into the corresponding genome region in a cassette containing the floxed allele of the Ate1 genomic region fused with an frt-flanked Neo gene.
