We used &#x003bb;-Red recombination to precisely and efficiently position PCR-generated DNA targeting cassettes containing a fluorescent protein gene and an antibiotic resistance marker, at the C-termini of the CDSs of interest, creating in-frame fusions under the control of their native promoters. We incorporated cre/loxP and flpe/frt technology to enable multiple rounds of chromosomal tagging events to be performed sequentially with minimal disruption to the target locus, thus allowing sets of proteins to be co-localized within the cell. The visualization of labeled proteins in live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells using fluorescence microscopy revealed a striking variety of distributions including: membrane and nucleoid association, polar foci and diffuse cytoplasmic localization. Fifty of the fifty-two independent targeting experiments performed were successful, and 21 of the 23 selected CDSs could be fluorescently visualized. Our results show that <italic>E. coli</italic> has an organized and dynamic proteome, and demonstrate that this approach is applicable for tagging and (co-) localizing CDSs on a genome-wide scale.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Until relatively recently, it was thought that bacteria lacked much of the complexity and compartmentalization found in eukaryotic cells: essentially being a membranous sack of biomolecules. However, this simplistic view of bacterial cell biology has been dispelled over the past decade or so, largely due to advances in fluorescence labeling and microscopy, and through the global <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of genome sequences. It is now known that many bacteria have dynamic cytoskeletal structures analogous to those formed by the actin and tubulin proteins in eukaryotes, and exhibit high levels of intracellular organization, asymmetry and coordination of activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6">1&#x02013;6</xref>).</p><p>As proteins often form dynamic complexes and perform multiple biological or biochemical roles, establishing a protein's interaction partners and localization patterns is essential in order to understand its full range of functions within the cell. To date, global proteome localization and interaction studies have been conducted most comprehensively in the model eukaryote <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae</italic> through labeling coding DNA sequences (CDSs) with green fluorescence protein (GFP) and epitope tags, and by two hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>). In bacteria, the majority of fluorescent protein tagging and localization studies have been conducted in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>. To date, the most comprehensive large-scale protein analyses performed in <italic>E. coli</italic> have included a tandem affinity tag (TAP)-based protein interaction study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), as well as several biophysical protein fractionation and localization studies e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). Mori and colleagues have recently constructed and studied the properties of a large collection of <italic>E. coli</italic> open reading frames (ORFs) expressed from inducible plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) [GenoBase database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/index.html">http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/index.html</ext-link>] that have been fused to N-terminal hexa-histidine and C-terminal GFP tags. There have also been many other more focused studies, the majority of which have concentrated on proteins related to cell morphology and cytokinesis, DNA replication and repair or chemotaxis and motility [e.g. see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>)]. Various molecular approaches have been used in these investigations, including the use of inducible and native promoters, as well as episomal and chromosome-based copies of the gene of interest fused to the relevant fluorescent protein gene. This has complicated the direct comparison of findings from different studies, as protein-fusions may not have been expressed at levels that are physiologically relevant, or have been functioning in competition with the endogenous un-labeled homolog. With this in mind, we explored the feasibility and utility of conducting a genomic-scale, chromosomal CDS tagging and fluorescent fusion-protein localization study in the model prokaryote <italic>E. coli</italic>. To this end, we designed and implemented a versatile strategy utilizing the efficient &#x003bb;-Red homologous recombination system to efficiently tag CDSs at their C-terminus with fluorescent protein genes, leaving the resultant fusions under the control of their native promoters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Sequence data, gene annotations and associated information were obtained from the PEC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec">http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), Colibri (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genolist.pasteur.fr/Colibri/">http://genolist.pasteur.fr/Colibri/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and EchoBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ecoli-york.org/">http://www.ecoli-york.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) databases.</p><sec><title>Bacterial strains and CDS targeting procedures</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B (F<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>mcrA</italic> &#x00394;(<italic>mrr&#x02013;hsdRMS&#x02013;mcrBC</italic>) &#x003d5;80d<italic>lacZ</italic>&#x00394;M15 &#x00394;<italic>lacX74 deoR recA1 endA1 araD139</italic> &#x00394;(<italic>ara</italic>-<italic>leu</italic>)7649 <italic>galU galK rspL nupG</italic>); DY380 (DH10B [&#x003bb;<italic>cl</italic>857 (<italic>cro&#x02013;bio</italic>A)&#x0003c;&#x0003e;<italic>tet</italic>]); EL250 (DH10B [&#x003bb;<italic>cl</italic>857 (<italic>cro&#x02013;bio</italic>A)&#x0003c;&#x0003e;<italic>ara</italic>C&#x02013;P<sub>BAD</sub><italic>flpe</italic>]; EL350 (DH10B [&#x003bb;<italic>cl</italic>857 (<italic>cro&#x02013;bio</italic>A)&#x0003c;&#x0003e;<italic>ara</italic>C&#x02013;P<sub>BAD</sub><italic>cre</italic>]); DY330 (W3110 &#x00394;lacU169 gal490 [&#x003bb;cl857&#x00394;(cro&#x02013;bioA)])</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid construction and primers used</title><p>See Supplementary Data S1 for primer sequences and details of plasmids used as templates for PCR-amplification of the DNA targeting cassettes.

A schematic illustrating the targeting procedure (as exemplified by the construction of pyrH-EGFP) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. In addition to the &#x003bb;-Red genes, strains EL250 and EL350 also contain arabinose-inducible copies of the <italic>flpE</italic> and <italic>cre</italic> site-specific recombinases, respectively, which enables efficient removal of &#x02018;flirted&#x02019; or &#x02018;floxed&#x02019; Kan or Cm resistance cassettes. This allows additional rounds of CDS-tagging to be performed in the same strain, enabling multiple proteins to be co-localized within the same cell. To confirm that the DNA-targeting cassettes had been accurately inserted (and antibiotic resistance modules removed, when applicable), colonies were screened by PCR, using pairs of primers that flanked the junctions created with the chromosome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Data S1). For each targeting experiment, between 8 and 12 colonies were analyzed. Cells from all the constructed strains were cultured in Luria broth to the log or stationary phase, immobilized on agarose pads on glass slides, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. </p></sec><sec><title>Efficiency of CDS tagging and observed fluorescence patterns in live cells</title><p>All 52 of the independent CDS targeting experiments performed (in DY380, EL250 and EL350) were deemed successful as determined by initial PCR colony screening (i.e. there were &#x0003e;3 individual clones for each constructed strain that produced DNA fragments of the predicted sizes, data not shown). The total number of false positives, i.e. colonies that had antibiotic resistance, but displayed an incorrect pattern upon PCR screening, was low. The majority of these contained a targeting cassette that was correctly inserted at only one end, with the remainder containing an antibiotic cassette that was integrated non-specifically at some other genetic locus. When the recombination-competent cells were transformed with 50&#x02013;200&#x02009;ng of gel-purified DNA targeting cassette, 85% of all recombinant clones (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;430) selected by antibiotic resistance were correctly tagged, as determined by colony PCR (data not shown). When a number of the targeting experiments were repeated with the gel-purification step omitted, the efficiency dropped to 60&#x02013;70% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;120).</p><p>Fluorescence patterns for the C-terminal fusion proteins broadly fell into three non-exclusive categories: (a) diffuse and distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm, (b) concentrated in foci or clusters and (c) associated with the membrane (membrane proximal). Results are summarized in Supplementary Data S1 Table 2, and representative examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. An even cytoplasmic distribution was the most commonly observed protein fluorescence pattern. In strains where the fluorescently tagged protein localized in foci, or was associated with the membrane, there was always also a (variable) proportion of the protein distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Significant cell-to-cell variations in fluorescence intensities and protein localization patterns were often encountered. With the exception of the <italic>ftsZ</italic> strains (discussed below), all the other constructed strains displayed essentially normal growth rates and cell morphologies (see Supplementary Data S1). </p></sec><sec><title>PyrH and MetK formed discrete protein foci within the cell</title><p>PyrH exhibited the most striking and dynamic protein localization patterns (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels 4 and 7 (red fluorescence), 3a and 3b (green fluorescence); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; Supplementary Figures S2&#x02013;S4). It localized diffusely and uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, as well as in 1&#x02013;4 foci (typically 1 or 2) per cell that were often mobile over the timescale of the microscopic observation (tens of seconds to minutes). These foci moved around regions of the cytoplasm in a circular motion, generally spending the majority of their time beside the membrane, especially within the polar regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, panel 1). Sequential confocal microscopic images of the motion of PyrH-EYFP foci are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, top panel. As well as catalyzing the phosphorylation of uridine monophosphate (UMP), PyrH regulates the transcription of carbamoyl phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), and is thought to play a key role in chromosome partitioning and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Immunogold labeling has previously indicated that PyrH localizes predominantly near the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), and a protein fractionation/mass spectrometry analysis has suggested that it is mainly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This may reflect the differences between dynamic <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis and electron microscopy &#x02018;snapshots&#x02019; of cells that have been fixed by a complex procedure, possibly altering the intracellular protein organization. </p><p>The <italic>metK</italic> gene is essential in <italic>E. coli</italic>, with &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; mutants exhibiting slow growth and defects in cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Fluorescent fusions of MetK, which catalyses the synthesis of <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the main intracellular methylation agent, were localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm, as well as in 1&#x02013;4 (typically 1 or 2) apparently static foci (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels 3a, 3b and 5 (red fluorescence); Supplementary Figures S2, S4). Analogous to the localization of PyrH, we found that cells usually contained a mixture of diffuse and punctate forms of MetK: however, some cells contained almost exclusively one or the other. Both the <italic>pyrH</italic> and <italic>metK</italic> genes were tagged with each of the EYFP, EGFP, mRFP1 and DsRed2 fluorescent genes to test whether the different fluorescent fusions exhibited significantly altered protein distribution. Localization patterns for the EYFP, EGFP, DsRed2 and mRFP1 fusions were essentially indistinguishable from one another (see Supplementary Figures S2&#x02013;S4). In addition, we observed little difference in the intensity of red fluorescence for <italic>pyrH</italic> fusions to mRFPmars, mRFP1 and RFP (mRFP1 codon optimized for <italic>E. coli</italic>, data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular distributions of other notable proteins</title><p>In actively dividing cells, mRFP1 and EGFP fusions of the transcription elongation factor NusA were found to co-localize with the nucleoids, predominantly in two &#x02018;loose&#x02019; clusters associated with each nucleoid (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel 6). A very similar finding has been reported for NusA-GFP in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, which during rapid growth, primarily co-localized with RNA polymerase and the ribosomes in transcription foci (TF), revealing the sites of ribosomal RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Our results suggest that in the Gram-negative <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterium, NusA regulates transcriptional pausing and anti-termination with a similar spatial and mechanistic arrangement to that which occurs in the Gram-positive <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p><p>Although distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm in most cells, NadK-EGFP (<italic>yfjB</italic>, NAD kinase) was occasionally found to localize in a number of clusters at various positions within the cytoplasm that were not co-incident with the nucleoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel 4, green fluorescence; Supplementary Data S2, S4). EGFP fusions of the hypothetical protein YgeH localized throughout the cytoplasm, but preferentially at the inner membrane interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel 11). EGFP fusions of another hypothetical protein, YqiK were distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel 9), even though its extreme N-terminus is predicted to be periplasmic (UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot, entry P77306). We could not visualize the mRFP1 fusion of the <italic>yaeL</italic>-encoded inner membrane protease (RseP), and EYFP fusions localized as a mixture of cytoplasmic and membrane-associated forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel 8). This is partially consistent with the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), and suggests that the C-terminus (including the EYFP fusion) may be partially localized within the periplasm, and consequently largely non-fluorescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), with a percentage of the protein possibly mis-localized in the cytoplasm, but fluorescent.</p></sec><sec><title>Dual CDS fluorescent tagging</title><p>To test the practical applicability and efficiency of our methodology for double CDS tagging in <italic>E. coli</italic>, eight pairs of proteins were selected for fluorescent labeling and co-localization (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; Supplementary Data, Table 2; Supplementary Figure S4). PyrH was included in seven of these, to investigate whether there were any significant differences in its observed localization patterns between the strains. Seven of these strains were successfully constructed, and fluorescence was observed for every tagged protein except for NrdB in the DY380 <italic>nrdB</italic>-mRFP1/<italic>pyrH</italic>-EGFP strain. In these doubly tagged strains, the observed localization patterns for the labeled proteins were essentially identical to those found in the corresponding singly labeled strains (see Supplementary Figures S2, S3, S4).</p><p>Whole cell protein extracts from eight representative constructed strains were analyzed by western blotting using a polyclonal anti-GFP (Abcam, #ab290) antibody (see Supplementary Data S1, Supplementary Figure S5), to confirm that the C-terminal fluorescent fusions had been accurately created, and that detectable amounts of the protein were expressed during growth in liquid culture. Using this antibody, it was possible to analyze the expression of EGFP, EYFP and ECFP tagged proteins. With the exception of <italic>ftsZ</italic>, all the strains analyzed specifically expressed one fluorescently tagged protein species with the correct apparent molecular mass, which had not been noticeably degraded (proteolyzed) <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the western blots revealed that the FtsZ-EGFP fusion was not expressed: with only EGFP detectable (<italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub><italic>ca</italic>. 27kDa). Even though DNA fragments of the correct size were produced during the initial PCR screening, chromosomal sequencing of the target loci revealed that two separate single nucleotide deletions were present in the linker regions of all the (independently constructed) clones of the DY380 ftsZ-EGFP and DY30 ftsZ-EGFP/pyrH-mRFP1 strains (see Supplementary Data S1). Both of these deletions encoded for short FtsZ C-terminal extensions of six amino acids and not the intended full-length FtsZ-EGFP fusions, and consequently the strains were renamed ftsZ-C<italic>ext</italic>.

In these strains, (un-tagged) EGFP protein was still expressed, and localized predominantly throughout the cytoplasm, as well as in small membrane-associated clusters in some cells (Supplementary Figure S2).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Experimental rationale and significance of results obtained</title><p>We conducted this pilot study for two main reasons: (1) to establish which protein localization patterns are commonly found in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and by inference, in other similar, symmetrically dividing bacteria; and (2) to determine optimal experimental parameters for future large-scale fluorescent protein localization, or co-localization analyses. We chose the EGFP, EYFP and mRFP1 fluorescent proteins, as these have been the ones used most extensively in localization studies in bacteria, yeast and other higher organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Of the 21 successfully tagged CDSs, 13 were distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm under all conditions employed (Adk, Dxs, Era, Map, MsrA, NrdB, RecG, YaeN, YeaA, YfgK, YgjD, YihA and YqiK); MetK, NusA, NadK, PyrH and TrmE formed foci or clusters; and NadK (YfjB), TrmE, YfjP, YgeH associated with the membrane, in all or a proportion of the cells analyzed. NrdB-EGFP and Era-EGFP fluorescence was barely detectable (although an exhaustive screen of growth conditions, was not performed). Only YaeL(RseP)-mRFP1 and RpoD-EGFP could not be visualized, which may be attributable to sequence errors in the long targeting oligonucleotides: as YaeL-mRFP1 has previously been localized to the membrane in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), and the expression of a C-terminal RpoD-TAP tag fusion has similarly been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The combination of &#x003bb;-Red and cre/loxP or flpe/frt technologies creates a highly efficient yet versatile strategy by which specific genetic modifications may be made on the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome. Although performed on a smaller scale, our success rate compares favorably with those obtained for analogous large-scale studies in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>), and with the TAP-tagging study performed in <italic>E. coli</italic> DY330 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Whilst it is impossible to say with certainty of which 21 successfully tagged CDSs had their function or localization compromised, as 12 of them are putatively essential in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec">http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), this implies that these C-terminal fusion proteins must retain at least a proportion of their native functionality. Only the YaeL-mRFP1/-EYFP and YqiK-EGFP proteins did not exhibit the expected or predicted cellular distributions. This suggests that it may be prudent to verify localization results by constructing N-terminal fusions, or by using other microscopic or proteomic fractionation techniques.</p><p>Our results are to a large extent consistent with the microscopic images obtained by Mori and colleagues, from cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells expressing C-terminal GFP fusions from plasmids (without deletion of the corresponding wild-type CDSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) (GenoBase database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/index.html">http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/index.html</ext-link>). Out of the 21 CDSs visualized here, the localizations of 15 were either entirely or partially consistent with those of Mori <italic>et al</italic>.; 4 were inconsistent (dxs, recG, yqiK, ygeH); 2 were not observed by Mori and co-workers; (yaeL, msrB); and 2 were not localized by us (rpoD, ftsZ). However, at this point in time it is difficult to draw further conclusions, as no articles have been published that describe precisely how these experiments were performed, or that contain a detailed description or analysis of the intracellular protein localization patterns observed.</p><p>For the various <italic>nusA</italic>, <italic>pyrH</italic> and <italic>metK</italic>-fusion strains constructed, there appeared to be no correlation between the type of fluorescent fusion protein used and the proportion of protein that existed condensed in foci or clusters, as opposed to being evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Furthermore, MetK-EGFP, NusA-EGFP and PyrH-EGFP fusions created in <italic>E. coli</italic> DY330 [derived from W3110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>)], had essentially identical distribution patterns as those found in DY380, EL250 and EL350 (data not shown), indicating that the localization patterns were not strain specific.</p></sec><sec><title>The formation and polar localization of MetK and PyrH foci</title><p>In cultures of all the relevant constructed strains, we always observed individual cells that contained almost exclusively either the diffuse or punctate forms of the PyrH and MetK fusion proteins, as well as cells that contained various proportions of both (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels 3a, 3b, 5 and 7). As we were unable to directly observe their inter-conversion, it is difficult to suggest exactly why such different protein distributions exist within the cell, and what the underlying factors or processes may be. However, it is tempting to speculate that the two forms may correspond to distinct activities within the cell. MetK and PyrH are involved in a variety of biochemical and biological processes: ones that are primarily metabolic, and others that are regulatory in nature. Both have activities that are essential for successful cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In the absence of additional evidence, it is hard to say whether their tendency to aggregate or dissipate is a cause, or a result of these different activities within the cell, or is due to some environmental or growth-related factor.</p><p>Intriguingly, when present within the cell, PyrH and MetK foci tended to localize preferentially within the polar regions of the cell, particularly at the mature cell pole, i.e. the cell pole not formed at the last cell division event (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, panel 1; supplementary Figures S2, S3, S4 for images). Butland <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) found that the C-terminal &#x02018;TAP-tagged&#x02019; PyrH and MetK proteins co-purified with 47 and 26 other protein species, respectively in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The interacting proteins have a variety of reported or predicted intracellular localizations (e.g. see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>); GenoBase, EchoBase and UniprotKB/Swiss-prot databases), and are involved a diverse range of functions. Consequently, it is difficult to speculate exactly which protein interactions (if any) may be involved in the observed distribution patterns. In addition, the solubility of PyrH (&#x0003c;0.1&#x02009;mg/ml at pH 7.4) is enhanced significantly by the presence of Mg-UTP, as well as by acidic/alkaline pH conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), which suggests that there may be other physical factors underlying the formation/dissipation of foci. Also, we cannot discount the possibility that these foci may correspond to non-functional protein aggregates or inclusion bodies within the cell.</p><p>The dynamic, targeted localization of proteins to one or both of the cell poles has been demonstrated to occur in a number of Gram-negative and -positive bacterial species, which undergo symmetrical as well as differential cell division (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). A number of general mechanisms have been postulated to explain this type of behavior, including: specific polar targeting and membrane insertion; &#x02018;diffusion and capture&#x02019; by a membrane-anchored protein; and localized or spatially specific proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50 B51 B52">50&#x02013;52</xref>). Furthermore, proteins associated with the repair, transcription, replication or partitioning of chromosomal and episomal DNA, are often dynamically and asymmetrically located within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). The preferential localization at the old pole may also reflect general physical or morphological differences in the peptidoglycan, or membrane composition of the new and old poles, or could be due to aging or oxidative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55 B56 B57 B58">55&#x02013;58</xref>). It is also possible that the two daughter cells are not &#x02018;programmed&#x02019; to perform identical overall functions, and may have corresponding differences in protein and RNA composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of PyrH foci at sites of potential cell division</title><p>In the filamentous DY380 <italic>ftsZ</italic>-C<italic>ext</italic>/<italic>pyrH</italic>-mRFP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, panels 2 and 3), the PyrH protein localized predominantly in foci that were separated by approximately one cell length, and contained regularly spaced nucleoids. This localization pattern was highly reminiscent of that found for the actin filament nucleation protein IcsA, in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells that had been rendered filamentous through inhibition of the septum-specific cell wall transpeptidase FtsI by treatment with aztreonam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Under these conditions, IcsA located to the points of potential cell division (septation zones), as well as the cell poles. As noted earlier, the observed cell morphology is consistent with the short C-terminal extension interfering with FtsZ polymerization, or disrupting the association of the ZipA or FtsA cell division proteins to their normal binding sites in the short, highly conserved C-terminal peptide domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). This greatly inhibits efficient Z-ring formation, resulting in cell filamentation: somewhat analogous to treatment with aztreonam. As western blotting (Supplementary Data S1, Supplementary Figure S5) indicates that it is not specifically proteolyzed within the cell, the fluorescent images suggest that the PyrH protein may have an affinity for some protein and/or structural feature within the septation zones or cell poles (which are derived from the septum during the previous round of cell division).</p></sec><sec><title>Asymmetric segregation of PyrH foci between daughter cells</title><p>Closer examination of labeled-protein fluorescence in actively dividing cells revealed that a variable but significant proportion of single PyrH foci were kept localized near the old cell pole during the division process, and were segregated into only one of the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, bottom panel). This phenomenon has previously been observed in differentiating bacteria such as <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, which divide asymmetrically forming two distinct cell types (e.g. see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) and references contained therein). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the asymmetrical segregation of a predominantly cytoplasmic protein focus or cluster has been directly demonstrated to occur in a symmetrically dividing bacterium. It must be noted however, that the segregation of a PyrH focus into one daughter cell does not correspond to an exclusive division of all the PyrH protein present within the parent cell, as there is still a proportion distributed diffusely within the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary of tagging and microscopy results</title><p>We believe that the <italic>Aequorea</italic>-derived EGFP and EYFP, or the <italic>Discosoma</italic>-derived mRFP1 proteins, would be the best choice for a general large-scale (single CDS) fluorescent localization study in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The mRFP1 fusion may be preferable for proteins that are predicted to be integrated into the membrane or translocated to the periplasm, as GFP fusions are often non-fluorescent when localized outside the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). For straightforward double CDS co-visualization experiments, mRFP1 and EGFP/EYFP-fusions may be individually excited and observed.

Furthermore, we show that such an investigation would prove highly revealing in this symmetrically dividing bacteria, as even within this limited subset of proteins we have observed significant variation, dynamism and polarity in the observed protein localization patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The microscopic visualization of fluorescently tagged proteins in live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells revealed a surprising variation in localization patterns. Intracellular protein distributions fall into three general, non-mutually exclusive categories: diffuse cytoplasmic, concentrated in foci or clusters, and membrane associated. Most notably, fluorescent fusions of the PyrH protein formed mobile foci within the cytoplasm that tended to localize at the mature cell pole or points of potential septation, and which were asymmetrically segregated between daughter cells during cell division. It remains to be seen whether the formation of (dynamic) protein foci and preferential polar localization are phenomena commonly found within bacteria. The &#x003bb;-Red-based CDS tagging procedure we have used here is efficient and specific enough to be applicable for the fluorescent labeling and (co-) visualization of <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins on a genomic scale. Our investigation has indicated that the future analyses of protein localization patterns in symmetrically dividing bacteria, such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, have a high probability of revealing many interesting and unexpected results.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data is available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by a joint grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) of China and the Research Grant Council (RGC) of Hong Kong (N_HKU712/02) to J.D.H. and D.L., and by a CRCG seed funding grant (University of Hong Kong) to J.D.H.
