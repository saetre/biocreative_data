Although several cytokines such as IL-15 and IL-7 regulate relatively slow homeostatic proliferation of memory T cells during the maintenance phase, it is unknown how memory T cells can proliferate more quickly than na&#x000ef;ve T cells upon antigen stimulation. To examine antigen-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell proliferation in recall responses in vivo, we targeted a model antigen, ovalbumin(OVA), to DEC-205<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) with a CD40 maturation stimulus. This led to the induction of functional memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which showed rapid proliferation and multiple cytokine production (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, TNF-&#x003b1;) during the secondary challenge to DC-targeted antigen. Upon antigen-presentation, IL-18, an IFN-&#x003b3;-inducing factor, accumulated at the DC:T cell synapse. Surprisingly, IFN-&#x003b3; receptors were required to augment IL-18 production from DCs. Mice genetically deficient for IL-18 or IFN-&#x003b3;-receptor 1 also showed delayed expansion of memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in vivo. These results indicate that a positive regulatory loop involving IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-18 signaling contributes to the accelerated memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell proliferation during a recall response to antigen presented by DCs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are an important component of acquired immunity to viruses and other pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002404-Kaech1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002404-Badovinac1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

These effector cells populate peripheral tissues including mucosal tissues (lung, intestinal epithelium) and mucosal associated lymphoid organs (Peyer's patch and mesenteric lymph node) both before and after the secondary response.
