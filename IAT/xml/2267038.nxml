Hexokinase II dissociation from mitochondria triggers apoptosis. The prevailing model postulates that hexokinase II release from its mitochondrial interactor, the voltage-dependent anion channel, prompts outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the ensuing release of apoptogenic proteins, and that these events are inhibited by growth factor signalling. Here we show that a hexokinase II N-terminal peptide selectively detaches hexokinase II from mitochondria and activates apoptosis. These events are abrogated by inhibiting two established permeability transition pore modulators, the adenine nucleotide translocator or cyclophilin D, or in cyclophilin D knock-out cells. Conversely, insulin stimulation or genetic ablation of the voltage-dependent anion channel do not affect cell death induction by the hexokinase II peptide. Therefore, hexokinase II detachment from mitochondria transduces a permeability transition pore opening signal that results in cell death and does not require the voltage-dependent anion channel. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of the pathways of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and their inactivation in tumors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hexokinase (HK) initiates all major pathways of intracellular glucose utilization, and type II HK (HK II) couples glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation by interacting with mitochondria, thus acting as a metabolic sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Wilson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The molecular composition of the PTP is at present unsolved. Nonetheless, pharmacological and genetic evidences identify cyclophilin (CyP-D), a matrix peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerase, and the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), a carrier that exchanges adenine nucleotides across the IMM, as pore regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Baines1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Kokoszka1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, cells were pretreated with the cyclophilin inhibitor MeAla3EtVal4-cyclosporin (Debio 025), selectively targeting CyP-D in mitochondria, and thereby desensitizing the mitochondrial PTP without inhibiting calcineurin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Hansson1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Angelin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, cell death was fully abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001852-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, lower row). We then directly assessed occurrence of PTP opening by measuring the threshold Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> required to open the PTP with the sensitive Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> retention capacity (CRC) test. Permeabilized whole-cells were triggered with trains of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pulses in the presence of a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-sensitive fluorescent probe that does not permeate mitochondria (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> uptake into mitochondria was therefore displayed as a rapid fluorescence drop. When the PTP opened, the ensuing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from mitochondria was assessed as a sudden fluorescence increase. We found that clotrimazole inhibited Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> uptake into mitochondria, <italic>i.e.</italic> the slope of the fluorescence reduction after each pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001852-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), and this same effect was also observed in isolated mitochondria (not shown). We also found that clotrimazole dramatically decreased ADP- and uncoupler-stimulated respiration in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001852-g001">Figure 1D</xref>); similar results were obtained if succinate (in the presence of rotenone) rather than glutamate/malate was used as a substrate (not shown). Note that respiration and mitochondrial CRC experiments were performed in organelles from liver, and hepatocytes have virtually no HK II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Mathupala1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, clotrimazole inhibited respiration by binding to a molecular target other than HK II, and it appears to be toxic to mitochondria independently of its activity on HK II and/or PTP. As dissecting the pharmacology of clotrimazole was beyond the scope of this study, we achieved HK II detachment from mitochondria with a different strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>A HK II peptide specifically detaches HK II from mitochondria and induces cell death</title><p>Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal hydrophobic domain of HK were shown to effectively displace it from VDAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Majewski1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Pastorino3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that the latter is required for HK binding to mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Mathupala1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-AzoulayZohar1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Robey1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. We reasoned that this approach could avoid the unspecific toxic effects observed with clotrimazole. The commercially available fusion protein Antennapedia-HK II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Pastorino3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> was not suitable for our experiments since it has been recently demonstrated that the internalization domain of the Antennapedia homeoprotein itself exhibits confounding effects on the mitochondrial permeability transition ROS threshold in cardiac myocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Juhaszova2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore linked the N-terminal 15 amino acids of HK II to a HIV-1 TAT sequence to allow its entry into the cell. Treatment of HeLa cells with this oligopeptide, called TAT-HK, efficiently displaced HK II from mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001852-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and induced cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (cyt <italic>c</italic>) release into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001852-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), a hallmark of mitochondrial apoptosis. TAT-HK also disrupted the interaction between HK II and its reported binding partner on the OMM, VDAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001852-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However, in keeping with a previous work in which cyclosporin A was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Machida1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that the HK II/VDAC binding could also be abrogated by Debio 025, irrespective of the presence of the TAT-HK peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001852-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We excluded the possibility that this effect of Debio 025 was due to inhibition of cytosolic CyP-A, as this protein was not detectable in our mitochondrial preparations (not shown). TAT-HK caused a concentration-dependent apoptosis, whereas a peptide obtained by linking an unrelated sequence to the same TAT motif was totally ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001852-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, upper row). Debio 025 abrogated TAT-HK-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001852-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lower row), indicating that this apoptosis was dependent on PTP opening. Moreover, this treatment elicited PTP opening in permeabilized HeLa cells, as assessed by the reduction of the number of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pulses in CRC assays, without affecting the rate of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> uptake into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001852-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). To extend these results, the activity of the PTP was assessed in a model of excitable cells with high metabolic demand expressing mostly HK II, <italic>i.e.</italic> freshly isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Postic1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

This is of pivotal importance in cancer, because neoplastic cells display an aberrant hyper-activation of growth factor-induced metabolic pathways; the related overexpression and activation of HK II on mitochondria confers a competitive edge to the most aggressive cancers by increasing their glycolytic metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Warburg1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and thus supporting cell proliferation when the tumour mass outgrows the surrounding blood vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Mathupala1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore crucial for anti-neoplastic strategies to dissect in detail the mechanisms by which HK II controls the death/survival rheostat of cells.</p><p>In this report, we have confirmed that HK II dissociation from mitochondria is a strong pro-apoptotic stimulus, and established that this form of apoptosis requires opening of the mitochondrial PTP independently of VDAC. This observation has conceptual and therapeutical implications. Loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity constitutes a point of no-return in cell commitment to death. Critical effector mechanisms include loss of ATP production and the eventual release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space of proteins with key functions in cell dismantling. The size of these proteins entails specific forms of OMM permeabilization for their release, whose molecular mechanisms remain controversial. One possibility is the direct formation of large channels on the OMM, composed either by proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, or by association of these proteins with mitochondrial membrane channels; proteins might also be funnelled through lipidic pores. Alternatively, opening of the PTP in the IMM could indirectly induce ruptures in the OMM that are large enough to allow release of apoptogenic protein (reviewed in 16,34). The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. For instance, cristae remodelling could be required as a PTP-dependent first step to trigger channel opening on the OMM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Scorrano1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>; and differences in the mode of OMM permeabilization could depend on the cell type, the stress stimulus and the energetic conditions of the cell.</p><p>Our data indicate that HK release from the OMM prompts a death stimulus that requires PTP opening. The detailed mechanism cannot be defined at present, as the molecular composition of the PTP remains an unsolved riddle. In fact, all suspected pore components, <italic>i.e.</italic> CyP-D, VDAC and ANT, underwent a rigorous analysis based on the ablation of their coding genes followed by investigation of PTP properties, and none of them turned out to be part of the pore, even if ANT and CyP-D are PTP regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Baines1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Kokoszka1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Baines2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Krauskopf1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we found that both ANT and CyP-D are key regulators of apoptosis induced by mitochondrial HK II displacement. Treatment with the TAT-HK peptide disrupts the interaction between ANT and CyP-D, suggesting that HK II partitioning away from mitochondria propagates a conformational change directed from molecules associated to the OMM towards structures of the inner membrane, where the PTP resides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Bernardi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This might trigger PTP opening, resulting in the release of apoptogenic proteins and in cell death.</p><p>Our results challenge the view that VDAC is the mitochondrial determinant of cell survival or death, acting as a hub that binds either anti- or pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members depending on the presence or absence of HK II, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Mathupala1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here we demonstrate that HK II/VDAC binding is also disrupted in conditions that do not promote cell death, <italic>i.e.</italic> following treatment with Debio 025. More importantly, in cells lacking both VDAC1 and VDAC3, no binding between HK II and the residual VDAC2 could be detected, yet displacement of HK II from mitochondria prompted massive cell death. In addition, the interaction between VDAC and HK II was reported to be inhibited by GSK3&#x003b2;-mediated VDAC phosphorylation, and stimulated by Akt-dependent inactivation of GSK3&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001852-Pastorino2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and this would protect from cell death. However, we found that treating cells with insulin, a powerful Akt activator, cells were not protected from apoptosis elicited by mitochondrial HK II displacement. Again, these results argue against a mandatory cell survival role of a transduction pathway that should convey signals to VDAC. Thus, VDAC appears to be dispensable for cell death elicited by HK II detachment from mitochondria, while resistance to cell death in highly glycolytic tumors appears to be critically dependent on preventing opening of the mitochondrial PTP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Chemicals, antibodies and cells</title><p>FITC-conjugated Annexin-V was from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN); Calcium Green-5N and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); the caspase inhibitor Z.VAD-fluoro-methyl-ketone (Z.VAD-fmk) was from Bachem (Subendorf, Switzerland); all other chemicals were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
