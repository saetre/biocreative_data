Endogenously, RNA interference triggers are created from small noncoding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs). RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) in human cells can be programmed by exogenously introduced siRNA or endogenously expressed miRNA. siRNA-programmed RISC (siRISC) silences expression by cleaving a perfectly complementary target mRNA, whereas miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISC) inhibits translation by binding imperfectly matched sequences in the 3&#x02032; UTR of target mRNA. Both RISCs contain Argonaute2 (Ago2), which catalyzes target mRNA cleavage by siRISC and localizes to cytoplasmic mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies). Here, we show that RCK/p54, a DEAD box helicase, interacts with argonaute proteins, Ago1 and Ago2, in affinity-purified active siRISC or miRISC from human cells; directly interacts with Ago1 and Ago2 in vivo, facilitates formation of P-bodies, and is a general repressor of translation. Disrupting P-bodies by depleting Lsm1 did not affect RCK/p54 interactions with argonaute proteins and its function in miRNA-mediated translation repression. Depletion of RCK/p54 disrupted P-bodies and dispersed Ago2 throughout the cytoplasm but did not significantly affect siRNA-mediated RNA functions of RISC. Depleting RCK/p54 released general, miRNA-induced, and <italic>let</italic>-7-mediated translational repression. Therefore, we propose that translation repression is mediated by miRISC via RCK/p54 and its specificity is dictated by the miRNA sequence binding multiple copies of miRISC to complementary 3&#x02032; UTR sites in the target mRNA. These studies also suggest that translation suppression by miRISC does not require P-body structures, and location of miRISC to P-bodies is the consequence of translation repression. </p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>RCK/p54 plays a critical role in translational repression mediated by miRISC; translation repression by miRISC does not require P-body structures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Small non-coding RNAs play important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of genes that code for diverse biological functions, e.g., in most metazoan organisms from nematodes to mammals &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b001">1</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

These vectors were co-expressed in HeLa cells with Myc-tagged Ago2 and immunopurified using anti-Myc antibodies. The protein composition of isolated complexes was analyzed by immunoblot using antibodies against green fluorescent protein (GFP) or Myc. When total cell extracts (TCE) were analyzed to determine the protein expression efficiencies of the vectors used in these experiments ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, TCE lane), all YFP- and Myc-tagged proteins were expressed.

Analysis of immunopurified complexes showed that Ago1 and RCK/p54 interactions with Myc-Ago2 were not affected by RNase treatment, whereas the amounts of Dcp2 and eIF4E protein that co-purified with Myc-Ago2 decreased significantly ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, anti-Myc lane).

Moreover, only moderate energy transfer efficiency (6.41&#x00025; &#x000b1; 1.96&#x00025;) was seen when YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago1 were used in FRET experiments, suggesting that this donor: acceptor pair was not as ideally oriented for an efficient energy transfer as the pair CFP-Ago1 and YFP-Ago2.

To address this question, we disrupted P-body structures by using RNAi against Lsm1, which is a P-body protein that does not associate with RISC as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA against Lsm1, harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection, and TCEs were analyzed by immunoblot. The results show an efficient knockdown of Lsm1 without changing the levels of RCK/p54, Ago2, and GAPDH ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). We next visualized Lsm1 and Ago2 by immunofluorescence using antibodies against Lsm1 and Myc tag and found that Lsm1 and Ago2 co-localized in P-bodies ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). To determine the status of P-body structures and RISC localization in cells after Lsm1 knockdown, Lsm1-depleted cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence.

TCEs and anti-Myc immunoprecipitation products were analyzed by immunoblot using anti-Myc, anti-RCK/p54, and anti-Lsm1 antibodies. Lsm1 siRNA treatment efficiently depleted Lsm1 protein levels without affecting Myc-Ago2 and RCK/p54 levels ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).

P-bodies were disrupted in HeLa cells by transfecting them with siRNA against Lsm1, and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared 48 h post-transfection. These HeLa cell extracts were incubated with magnetic protein A beads coupled with rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-Ago2, or rabbit anti-RCK/p54 antibodies to purify miRISC associated with RCK/p54 or Ago2.

A homolog of the P-body protein GW182 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> is the developmental timing regulator AIN-1, which also interacts with miRISCs and may target argonaute proteins to P-bodies &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;. To dissect and understand the relationship between RNAi function and P-bodies, we affinity-purified RISC using Myc-Ago2 and expression vectors of the YFP-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E. Ago2 interacted with these various P-body components in ways that were RNA-dependent or RNA-independent ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Ago1 and RCK/p54 immunoprecipitated with Ago2 after RNase A treatment of HeLa cell extracts, suggesting that these proteins directly interact with Ago2. Interestingly, RCK/p54, Ago1, and Ago2 were also identified as a component of active RISC programmed with siRNA or miRNA and purified by biotin affinity to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g003">3</xref>). We examined the P-body localization of Ago2 with Lsm1 and RCK/p54 by co-expressing YFP-tagged Lsm1 and RCK/p54 with CFP-Ago2. Interestingly, overexpressing YFP-RCK/p54 in HeLa cells increased the number of P-bodies (from &#x0223c; 8 to &#x0223c; 20 foci/cell). The number of P-bodies containing CFP-Ago2 also increased ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). These results suggested a functional relationship between RCK/p54-Ago interactions and their localization to P-bodies. To visualize protein&#x02013;protein interactions in vivo, we used FRET as a probe. In cells expressing YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2, the FRET efficiency was 21.07&#x00025; &#x000b1; 2.52&#x00025; ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g001">1</xref>D). We also observed an efficient FRET between YFP-Ago1 and CFP-Ago2; however, FRET between RCK/p54 and Ago1 was moderate (6.41&#x00025; &#x000b1; 1.96&#x00025;). Since FRET is quite sensitive to the orientation of the donor: acceptor pair, it is possible that CFP and YFP in Ago1 and RCK/p54 are not suitably positioned for efficient energy transfer. Nonetheless, the FRET efficiency between Ago1 and RCK/p54 was significantly above the 0.9&#x00025; background. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Ago1, Ago2, and RCK/p54 directly interact in vivo. </p><p>Where in the cell does this physical interaction between RISC and RCK/p54 take place and does it require P-body structures? To address these questions, we disrupted P-bodies in cells by depleting Lsm1 and immunopurified endogenous miRISC, and analyzed its ability to cleave a target mRNA with perfect complementarity to <italic>let</italic>-7 miRNA ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We observed no significant difference in miRISC activities purified from Lsm1-depleted and non-depleted cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g005">5</xref>) even though the P-body structures were disrupted and the total number of P-bodies per cell had significantly decreased. These results show that RCK/p54 association with RISC does not require P-bodies and suggest that localization of RISC to P-bodies is the outcome of translation repression by miRISC. </p><p>Having established the physical interactions of RCK/p54 with RISC, we questioned the functional relevance of these interactions in the RNAi pathway and how they could facilitate RISC activity. To that end, we depleted RCK/p54 in HeLa cells and analyzed RNAi activities in vivo and in vitro ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Depletion of RCK/p54 clearly disrupted the P-body structures and dispersed Ago2 localization throughout the cytoplasm ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Surprisingly, depleting RCK/p54 did not significantly affect siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Similar results showing the lack of P-body involvement in RNAi have been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. In that system, depletion of the P-body proteins, GW182 or Dcp1:Dcp2 decapping complex, showed that these proteins were required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing <italic>,</italic> but RNAi efficiency was not affected, suggesting that these two gene-silencing mechanisms were independent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, two recent studies reported that mammalian GW182 interacts with Ago2 and plays a role in miRNA function &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; and in siRNA-mediated RNAi &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, depleting GW182 disrupted cytoplasmic foci and interfered with RNAi activity &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. It is possible that GW182 is directly involved in human RISC function and does not spatially require P-bodies for its function. As an alternative approach to disrupting P-bodies, we treated HeLa cells with the translation inhibitor, cycloheximide, which did not significantly affect RNAi activities in vivo and in vitro (unpublished data). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that functional siRISC is assembled before locating to P-bodies, and P-bodies are not prerequisite sites for siRNA-mediated gene silencing. </p><p>To determine the role of RCK/p54 in miRNA-mediated translation repression, we used a CXCR4 reporter system &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;, in which siRNA- or miRNA-reporter constructs harbor 1 &#x000d7; perfectly matched or 4 &#x000d7; bulged CXCR4 siRNA target sites, respectively in the 3&#x02032; UTR of RL mRNA &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. In this system, perfectly matched sequences are cleaved via siRISC and bulge-containing sequences are targets for translation suppression by miRISC. We observed that depletion of RCK/p54 released only miRNA-mediated gene suppression and had no effect on siRNA-mediated gene silencing ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Depletion of GW182, an argonaute-interacting P-body protein, released gene suppression by miRNA and moderately affected reporter constructs containing perfectly matched target sequences, consistent with previous findings &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b039">39</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Ago2 depletion significantly released siRNA-mediated gene silencing and moderately affected reporters containing 4 &#x000d7; bulged sequences. Knockdown of Lsm1 had no significant effect on either miRNA- or siRNA-mediated gene silencing. These results show that RCK/p54 depletion releases miRNA-mediated translation suppression of reporter genes and that this function of RCK/p54 was not significantly affected when P-bodies were disrupted by depleting Lsm1. </p><p>To test our hypothesis that RCK/p54 mediates the translational repression of endogenous miRNA targets in P-bodies, we examined RAS protein levels in RCK/p54-depleted cells. We chose RAS because it is an endogenous target of <italic>let</italic>-7 <italic>,</italic> and 3&#x02032; UTRs of human <italic>RAS</italic> genes contain multiple complementary sites for <italic>let</italic>-7 to bind and regulate RAS expression levels &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

Depleting RCK/p54 in HeLa cells up-regulated RAS protein, and this increase in RAS levels was higher than that in general translation of control actin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), suggesting that multiple sites of <italic>let</italic>-7 miRISC binding to target 3&#x02032; UTR dictate the potency and specificity of translation suppression. </p><p>RCK/p54, the human homolog of yeast Dhh1p, is a member of the ATP-dependent DEAD box helicase family and was originally identified as a proto-oncogene &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.

Dhh1p and RCK/p54 also inhibit the mRNA translation driven by internal ribosomal entry sites in vitro, suggesting that this protein is a general translational repressor that may not require a cap structure for its function &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the in vivo function of Dhh1p required translational initiation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.

Recently, Petersen et al. reported an intriguing study showing that miRNA represses translation after initiation by a ribosome drop-off mechanism &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, it is possible that RCK/p54 interacts with miRISC and blocks translation elongation by binding to its multiple target sites with high affinity and creates a barrier for elongating ribosomes (see below). </p><p>We therefore propose that the function of RISC assemblies in cells can be described by a model with two independent pathways, depending on whether RNAi is programmed by the guide strand of siRNA or miRNA. In the first pathway, the RISC recognizes a perfectly matched target mRNA and functions as siRISC ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g008">Figure 8</xref>) by cleaving its target mRNA. This target mRNA cleavage activity and rapid turnover of siRISC induce the subsequent target mRNA degradation by exonucleases and does not require P-bodies. In the second pathway, the RISC recognizes the imperfectly matched target and functions as miRISC ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040210-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Multiple copies of miRISC containing RCK/p54 could initiate an oligomerization event that sequesters the whole RNP and transports it to the P-bodies. This sequestration could also explain the cooperative effects of RISC function that enhance translation repression &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Once in P-bodies, translationally repressed mRNA could stay in oligomeric structures for storage or it could form a complex with decapping enzymes and cap binding proteins that would lead to the mRNA decay pathway. In other words, the miRNA in RISC could provide the sequence specificity and RCK/p54 could be the effector molecule that shuttles the target mRNA toward the fate of storage or processing in P-bodies. Since P-bodies are not a prerequisite for RCK/p54 to assemble into RISC or to function, it is possible that miRISC blocks protein synthesis by enhancing the ribosome drop-off during elongation of translation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040210-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. We propose that miRISC localization to P-bodies is the outcome of translation repression and not a prerequisite for miRISC function. Stored mRNA in P-bodies could reenter the active translation or mRNA decay pathway depending upon cellular conditions or stimuli that are presently unknown. How long mRNA translation can be repressed in the cytoplasm and which factors trigger mRNA transport to P-bodies are exciting areas for future research. </p><p>Our results on the interactions between RCK/p54 and the RNAi machinery suggest an intriguing role for miRNA function in development and carcinogenesis.

Our results have identified RCK/p54 as an essential component of miRISC-mediated translation repression and provide a functional link between miRISC and P-bodies. In the context of spatially and temporally restricted miRNA expression, this system allows for exquisite regulation of protein expression by target mRNA. Therefore, perturbations of either miRNA or RCK/p54 expression levels can have deleterious consequences for the cell. What determines the balance between active translation and repression of mRNAs targeted by miRISC, and how cells control the specificity of this repression are key directions for future investigation. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Expression vectors.</title><p>Ago1 and Ago2 expression vectors with N-terminal YFP- or CFP-epitope tags were generated by PCR amplification of <italic>Ago</italic>1 and <italic>Ago</italic>2 coding sequences from pMyc-Ago1 and pMyc-Ago2 followed by cloning into the <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>EcoR</italic>I sites of pEYFP-C1 and pECFP-C1 (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, California, United States).

GFP fluorescence was detected in cell lysates by exciting at 488 nm and recording emissions from 504&#x02013;514 nm. The spectrum peak at 509 nm represents the fluorescence intensity of GFP. RFP fluorescence was detected in the same cell lysates by exciting at 558 nm and recording emissions from 578&#x02013;588 nm. The spectrum peak at 583 nm represents the fluorescence intensity of RFP. The fluorescence intensity ratio of target (GFP) to control (RFP) fluorophores was determined in the presence of siRNA duplexes and normalized to the emissions measured in mock-treated cells. Normalized ratios &#x0003c; 1.0 indicated specific RNA interference.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Incorporation of &#x0005b; <sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine. </title><p>HeLa cells cultured in 6-well plates were transfected with siRNAs against RCK/p54 or CDK9 mismatch as a scramble control. 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated for 1 h in culture medium lacking methionine and cysteine, and metabolically labeled by incubating in culture medium containing 100 &#x003bc;Ci/ml Tran <sup>35</sup>S-label (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, California, United States).
