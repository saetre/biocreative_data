Using module-based analysis coupled with rigorous mathematical comparisons, we propose that in analogy to control engineering architectures, the complexity of cellular systems and the presence of hierarchical modular structures can be attributed to the necessity of achieving robustness. We employ the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> heat shock response system, a strongly conserved cellular mechanism, as an example to explore the design principles of such modular architectures. In the heat shock response system, the sigma-factor &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> is a central regulator that integrates multiple feedforward and feedback modules. Each of these modules provides a different type of robustness with its inherent tradeoffs in terms of transient response and efficiency. We demonstrate how the overall architecture of the system balances such tradeoffs. An extensive mathematical exploration nevertheless points to the existence of an array of alternative strategies for the existing heat shock response that could exhibit similar behavior. We therefore deduce that the evolutionary constraints facing the system might have steered its architecture toward one of many robustly functional solutions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Biological systems maintain phenotypic stability in the face of various perturbations arising from environmental changes, stochastic fluctuations, and genetic variations. This robustness, which seems to be an inherent property of such systems, is still poorly understood at the molecular level. At the same time, systems approaches that were used with great success in the study and design of complex engineered systems provide a unique opportunity for investigating the basic tenants of robustness in cellular mechanisms. This is motivated by the fact that at the system level, biology and engineering seem to have a large number of common features despite their extremely different physical implementations. The heat shock response is one such robust cellular system, which interestingly achieves its seemingly simple objective of refolding or eliminating heat-denatured proteins through a complicated set of interactions.

The main catalyst behind the renewed mainstream interest in the application of such approaches to the study of biological systems is their undeniable successes in the study of engineering systems. Indeed, systems-level design has consistently been at the core of modern engineering, motivating its most sophisticated theories in controls, computation, and information. While biological systems seem to employ feedback and feedforward loops of a similar nature to those present in engineering systems, they still possess subtle differences that need to be elucidated.</p><p>Whether applied to manmade or naturally occurring systems, the hallmark of a systems approach resides in the identification of distinct functional modules and protocols, i.e., the laws used to manage the connections between the different modules. In this context, two questions are of primary importance. What architectural aspects of biological modules make them similar or different from manmade machines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;?

A close scrutiny of both types of systems shows that in many instances, minimal designs are sufficient to generate nominal functionality. However, these minimal designs often fail to provide crucial aspects of robustness and performance necessary for competitive survival in challenging environments. Examples from technological sciences are abundant, while examples from natural sciences are still emerging &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b010">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b011"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. In either case, a broad spectrum of strategies has evolved to generate such robustness and maintain internal conditions in the presence of both internal and external disturbances.</p><p>The heat shock response is one such robust system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Heat shock causes unfolding, misfolding, or aggregation of proteins at the cellular level on the order of seconds, compromising cellular function. Cells overcome the heat stress by initiating the production of heat-shock proteins (hsps) that act as chaperones to refold denatured proteins into their native states, or proteases that degrade them. Although the objective of the heat shock response seems simple, its implementation involves complicated interactions. In <italic>E. coli,</italic> these interactions are centered on regulating the synthesis, degradation, and activity of the &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> transcription factor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. These interactions result in chaperone-mediated and protease-mediated feedback loops, and a feedforward loop for translation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Chaperone-mediated feedback measures the quantity of unfolded proteins and modulates the activity of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>, whereas protease-mediated feedback modulates the stability of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>. At the same time, the feedforward control senses temperature changes directly and instantaneously induces &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> translation, thereby regulating &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> synthesis.</p><p>Using a dynamic model of the heat shock response, we have previously analyzed the function of these feedback and feedforward regulators in terms of robustness &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The analysis presented in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; mostly focused on local robustness properties corresponding to a particular choice of plausible parameter values. Here we explore instead a large space of relevant kinetic parameters and study the performance of the system in terms of newly defined mathematical criteria such as the efficiency and yield of the time response. These criteria are used to enable mathematical comparisons between the dynamics of wild-type and virtual knockout mutants that lack specific regulators. To interpret our results, we decompose the architecture of the system into hierarchical modules, and introduce the notion of a mechanistic protocol that dictates the way by which these modules are assembled.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Modular Architecture in the Heat Shock Response System</title><p>The biochemical map of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> heat shock response can be decomposed into functional modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and flux modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The functional decomposition is carried out in analogy to engineering control systems block diagrams. Specifically, if we define the protein-folding task as the process to be regulated or controlled, then the quantity that drives this process is the actuation signal. The actuator module in the heat shock system comprises the high-gain processes of transcription and translation that produce cellular chaperones. Such synthesis of chaperones uses a modest control input, the number of free &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>, and amplifies it to produce a large chaperone actuation signal that drives the folding plant. This control signal is itself the output of a &#x0201c;computational&#x0201d; or a &#x0201c;controller&#x0201d; unit which, based on the sensed folding state of the cell, modulates the number of the &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> molecules to generate an appropriate control signal. Finally, the folding state of the cell is sensed through the binding of the unfolded proteins to the chaperones. For example, when the number of unfolded proteins increases, the number of free chaperones decreases. The &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> computational unit then assesses this measured signal. The information content of this signal leads, through both the degradation of the &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> factor and the amount of sequestered &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>, to an adequate control action. The integration of the molecular modules into these defined functional modules is pictorially shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

Although our description of these fluxes will be mainly qualitative, the components of the fluxes can be easily identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g002">Figure 2</xref> or through the equations describing the simplified heat shock model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020059-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). It turns out that the identified roles of these fluxes are in close correspondence with different experimentally identified aspects of the regulation scheme of the heat shock response. First, we identify the FF flux module through which heat shock directly increases the translation rate for &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> in a feedforward manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). This flux affects the time response to a heat disturbance. Second, we identify the main feedback flux (SEQ-FB module), which acts through the interaction of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> with the chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The sequestration of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> is controlled by the folding state of the cell, and therefore the sequestration flux encompasses the folding machinery that dictates the number of free chaperones, and accordingly the number of free &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> that are capable of binding to the RNA polymerase (RNAP) and initiating transcription of the hsps. Therefore, the function of this flux seems to be the regulation of the activity of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>. The third flux module that we identify in the heat shock system is the degradation flux (DEG-FB module) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). The molecules involved in this flux are the free &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> factors that, as a result of their sequestration by the chaperones, are susceptible to degradation by the FtsH protease. This flux essentially controls the stability of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>. Finally, the fourth flux module is an &#x0201c;amplifier flux&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). The amplifier flux depicts the sequence of reactions that &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> undergoes, in addition to its different encounters with other molecules from its synthesis to its degradation by FtsH. In the full model, the differential equations, Equations 20 and 21 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020059-t001">Table 1</xref>, describe the amplifier flux module, where the first term of Equation 21 describes the FF flux module. Equations 22 and 23 and Equations 24 and 25 (in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020059-t001">Table 1</xref>) correspond to the SEQ-FB and DEG-FB flux modules, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Speed, Yield, and Efficiency of the Heat Shock Response and Its In Silico Mutants</title><p>Having identified the modular structure of the heat shock response system and constructed the mathematical model, we now analyze the dynamic behavior of the three flux modules: SEQ-FB, DEG-FB, and FF. The main objective of the heat shock regulatory system is to refold denatured proteins upon exposure of the cells to heat shock. The response of the system is required to be fast, efficient, and robust. To capture these properties of the system, here we introduce the criteria for analysis: yield, efficiency, and response time (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). Robustness and its connection to these criteria are analyzed in the next section. The yield is defined as the fraction of folded proteins in a pool of total proteins and the efficiency as the ratio of chaperones (DnaK) that are actively involved in refolding proteins to the total amount of chaperones. Both high efficiency and yield would indicate that unfolded proteins are being efficiently refolded with an appropriate number of hsps, a highly desirable feature. The speed of the response to increases in temperature also constitutes a crucial performance criterion in the heat shock system since proteins denatured for extended periods of time tend to form aggregates. We therefore define the response time as the time required for refolding 90&#x00025; of the total folded proteins after heat shock and use it as a performance criterion.</p><p>To characterize the behavior of the system in terms of these performance criteria, we base our analysis on mathematical comparisons between wild-type and virtual mutants where various flux modules are disabled. The &#x0201c;virtual&#x0201d; mutants employed in this paper are distinct from ordinary gene knockout mutants. Genetic mutations alter the structure of the system while leaving all kinetic parameters not related to the mutation intact. Our virtual mathematical mutants, however, compensate for the mutation by readjusting the kinetic parameter values so as to conserve such properties of the wild-type as yield and efficiency. This allows for the direct comparison between architectures that generate an equivalent output, a difficult task in the wet lab. Mathematically, we carry out these mathematical mutations by looking at the structural blueprint of the heat shock response system and removing the terms in the differential equations model that contribute to the targeted mechanism. These virtual mutants include a system where FF is the only regulator (SEQ-FB and DEG-FB double knockout mutant), a system where sequestration is the only response regulator (FF and DEG-FB double knockout mutant), a system where sequestration is augmented with degradation feedback (FF knockout mutant), and a wild-type system possessing the three types of control. The kinetic parameters for the wild-type are determined from the heat shock literature. The kinetic parameters used in all mutant models are chosen to produce a value of the yield equal to 0.99 at both low and high temperature and an efficiency value greater than 0.9 at low temperature. We carry out the comparison between wild-type and mutants at high temperature. There are evidently multiple parameter sets that give a yield value equal to 0.99. We use these different sets to further study the dependence of the transient response on the kinetic parameters.</p><table-wrap id="pcbi-0020059-t002" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Components Used in the Detailed Mechanistic Model of the Heat Shock Response</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.0020059.t002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="pcbi-0020059-t003" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Kinetic Parameters Used in the Detailed Mechanistic Model of the Heat Shock Response</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.0020059.t003"/></table-wrap><p>The corresponding time courses for wild-type and various mutants are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g003">Figure 3</xref>. The level of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> for the wild-type in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g003">Figure 3</xref>A increases rapidly at heat shock, achieves a sharp peak, and then reduces to a new steady state. This behavior corresponds to a time course characteristic of a typical heat shock response. The FF knockout mutant model also produces a peak of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>, albeit much smaller than in wild-type. This peak is due to the transient stabilization of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> by the DEG-FB module. In contrast, the system possessing only FF (the SEQ-FB/DEG-FB knockout double mutant) exhibits an over-damped response and does not show any peaks in the level of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> upon heat shock. The slow rise in &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> is due to increased translation at high temperature. When the only form of regulation is through the SEQ-FB (the DEG-FB/FF double knockout mutant), the level of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> decreases slightly after heat shock as the abundant free &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> at the onset of heat shock competes with the housekeeping &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor to bind RNAP. As a result, the production of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>, which is governed by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, is slightly suppressed. It is therefore apparent that DEG-FB contributes greatly to the characteristic peak of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>. Our model does not take into account the fact that &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> is also transcribed by the sigma factor &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>. This transcription is negligible at 30 &#x000b0;C and increases at 42 &#x000b0;C. Further, transcription of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> increases after heat shock since &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> has a heat shock promoter. Overall, this contributed in part to the experimentally observed increase in &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> levels upon heat shock induction.

The level of DnaK for the wild-type system increases upon heat shock, achieves a small peak, and then declines to a new steady state.

The figure indicates that the level of folded proteins in all four systems was satisfactorily restored to its pre-shock value at the end of the response. The response in the FF mutant and DEG-FB/FF double mutant was slightly delayed, while the delay in the SEQ-FB/DEG-FB double mutant was about 100 min. These results show that FF alone is not sufficient to achieve the fast response observed in the wild-type heat shock. Alternatively, the FF, SEQ-FB, and DEG-FB modules orchestrate their functions and work additively to implement a fast response.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g003">Figure 3</xref>D shows the efficiency time course that characterizes the transient response of folded proteins after heat shock. Upon temperature up-shift, the efficiency increases sharply as heat-denatured proteins accumulate and bind to DnaK. In all the cases considered, except for the SEQ-FB/DEG-FB double mutant, the efficiency undergoes an under-damped transient and finally reaches a new steady state. The shape of the transient is negatively correlated with that of the DnaK concentration, as expected from the definition of the efficiency measure. As the DnaK level overshoots slightly, an excess of DnaK is produced, generating disproportionate increases in the total number of DnaK molecules as compared with the DnaK level bound to unfolded proteins, therefore reducing the efficiency. Comparison of the yield and efficiency plots points to a fundamental tradeoff that underlies the operation of the heat shock response system. While overexpression of DnaK increases the yield, it simultaneously decreases the efficiency, which necessitates the existence of a balance that establishes acceptable values for both.</p><p>We now quantify more accurately some of our previous observations. Specifically, we focus on the FF and DEG-FB loops, since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g003">Figure 3</xref>CD indicates that they greatly influence the adaptation time of the yield and efficiency. For the DEG-FB/FF double mutant, the FF mutant, the SEQ-FB/DEG-FB double mutant, and the wild-type models, we compute both the response time and low temperature &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> concentration for values of the 2-D parameter space (corresponding to the transcription rate constant of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> and the association constant between DnaK and &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>) that achieve a yield greater than 0.9 and an efficiency greater than 0.85. The result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g004">Figure 4</xref>. For the SEQ-FB/DEG-FB double mutant (FF-alone system), the response time was 80 min. It was difficult to obtain a fast response under the provided constraints of the yield and efficiency. However, the addition of FF to the closed loop feedback system substantially reduced the response time. For the values of the parameters that achieve low &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> concentrations, the addition of DEG-FB to SEQ-FB dramatically reduced the response time, an effect further enhanced by the addition of FF. However, the response time in the three cases was comparable at high &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> concentrations.

Specifically, we focus on the sensitivity of the total chaperone level to the transcription rate constant of DnaK. A large sensitivity of the number of chaperones to crucial parameters is undesirable as it produces a variable and unpredictable folding of proteins, both at low and high temperature. We again compare the various mutants and the wild-type. For the SEQ-FB/DEG-FB double mutant, we search the 2-D parameter space corresponding to the translational efficiency of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> (parameter <italic>&#x003b7;</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020059-t003">Table 3</xref>) and the transcription rate constant of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> (parameter <italic>km&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020059-t003">Table 3</xref>). We isolate the values of these parameters that produce acceptable values of yield and efficiency at low and high temperature (set again to values greater than 0.9 and 0.85, respectively). For such values of the parameters, we determine the sensitivity of DnaK to its transcription rate (parameter <italic>km&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020059-t003">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, the SEQ-FB/DEG-FB double mutant exhibited only one set of parameter values that were able to reproduce the desired yield and efficiency. Obviously, the sensitivity of the DnaK level to its transcription rate in the SEQ-FB/DEG-FB double mutant is one since all parametric perturbations are directly transmitted to the output of the system in the absence of feedback loops. However, in addition to large sensitivity, these results indicate that the absence of feedback limits the kinetic range where the system can operate efficiently.</p><p>We repeat the same exercise for the other virtual mutants. For the various cases considered, we search the 2-D parameter space corresponding to the binding between &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> and DnaK (<italic>K&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020059-t003">Table 3</xref>) and transcription rate of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> (<italic>km&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020059-t003">Table 3</xref>), and isolate regions that simultaneously produce values of yield greater than 0.9 and values of efficiency greater than 0.85 at both low and high temperatures. For these parameter regions, we determine the sensitivity of DnaK to its transcription rate during low-temperature growth. The FF control operating alone in open loop is characterized by a high sensitivity of the total DnaK to the transcription rate constant for DnaK (unpublished data). This result is expected, as lack of robustness is an inherent property of open loop systems. By contrast, a system implementing SEQ-FB is characterized by small sensitivity, demonstrating that SEQ-FB plays a major role in enhancing robustness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Interestingly, the addition of DEG-FB to SEQ-FB shifts the parameter region where the desired yield and efficiency can be achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g005">Figure 5</xref>AB). In fact, the increased synthesis of FtsH at high temperature suppresses the level of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>, resulting in decreased yield as compared with the mutant where SEQ-FB is the only control mechanism available. For parameters lying in the desired yield and efficiency region, the sensitivity is slightly higher than in the system implementing SEQ-FB alone. The addition of the FF loop to DEG-FB and SEQ-FB increases the size of the parameter space where yield and efficiency can be achieved, but does not contribute to the decreased sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020059-g005">Figure 5</xref>BC). This effect is the outcome of the ability of FF to generate high values for the yield at elevated temperatures. The sensitivities in these three cases did not significantly depend on the &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> concentration (unpublished data), differing from the case of transient response.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020059-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Sensitivity of the Total DnaK to the Change in the Transcription Rate Constant for DnaK at Low Temperature</title><p>The plot reports the sensitivity computed for the parameters values that satisfy the required yield and efficiency (yield &#x0003e; 0.9 and efficiency &#x0003e; 0.85 at low and high temperature).

Following this modular architecture, we found that mathematical mutations closely corresponded to the deletion of specific flux modules. The mathematical comparison between wild-type and the virtual mutants that lack flux modules proved to be very useful for assigning a function to the deleted components. To perform unbiased comparisons between wild-type and mutants, the mathematical models were constrained by the requirement of achieving the same values of appropriately defined yield and efficiency measures. Using a combination of analytical results, careful simulations, and searches in the relevant parameter space, we investigated the functions of each module in terms of performance criteria such as transient response, steady-state sensitivity and noise rejection characteristics. FF was identified as a powerful strategy that allows for the adaptation to elevated temperatures but that cannot implement a robust response if used by itself in open loop. Negative feedback loops increased the robustness of the system in the presence of parametric uncertainty and internal fluctuations, but limited the yield for production of hsps and hence the folding of heat-denatured proteins. Furthermore, the use of degradation feedback implemented a faster response to a heat disturbance and reduced the effects of biochemical noise &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Despite extremely different physical implementations, these regulatory strategies are widely used both in engineering and in biological systems. The electronic amplifier is an example of an engineering system that utilizes feedback to create robustness to parameter variations. In the absence of feedback, an open-loop amplifier has a wildly varying gain due to its sensitive dependence on its parameters and external environment. By closing the loop with the appropriate feedback, the system attains robustness to various uncertainties, making it a reliable amplification device that is used across a wide range of engineering applications. One often finds more than one layer of feedback control in engineering systems. For example, a feedback amplifier may itself be used in a feedback loop to control the motion of a mechanical device such as a motor. Feedforward control is also frequently employed in engineering systems to speed up the systems rejection of external disturbances. Once measured, these disturbances can be compensated for directly at the system input before they lead to large deviations in the output. Even though such deviations eventually get sensed and corrected by the feedback loop, the response time and effort needed for correction will be larger in the absence of feedforward. One engineering domain where feedforward is in common use is process control. As an example, a stirred tank with a heat exchanger is often used to maintain the reactants within the tank at a desired temperature. A feedback loop that adjusts the heat flow rate based on temperature measurement in the tank can be used for that purpose. If, in addition, the highly variable temperature of the feed material entering into the tank (disturbance) is also measured, this signal can be used in a feedforward fashion to adjust the heat flow rate in a way that cancels, or almost cancels, its anticipated effect on the tank temperature. Any residual differences between the actual and desired temperature is sensed by the feedback sensors and is corrected via the feedback loop. The result is a faster response and improved performance over feedback control alone.</p><p>As a result of this analysis, we propose that the use of complex regulation strategies in the heat shock system is likely to be a specifically designed solution to different aspects and requirements of heat remediation rather than the result of evolutionary accidents that gave birth to redundant regulatory loops. To the contrary, the regulatory structures in the heat shock response seem to be crucial elements whose function is orchestrated to address the numerous, and sometimes contradictory, performance and design issues. These regulatory structures in turn impose new tradeoffs and costs that can be identified in the heat shock system. The SEQ-FB, for example, causes the yield of the response to decrease. Furthermore, the DEG-FB module implements a futile synthesis/degradation cycle that generates a fast response and high feedback gain despite the expense of constant utilization of mass and energy. At the same time, the use of complex regulation strategies generates new fragilities that are then compensated by other modules. For example, an FtsH knockout causes &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> to increase explosively in our model; DnaK would be overproduced to dangerous levels if there were no SEQ-FB module. Redundant protease flux modules (HslVU, ClpAP, Lon) appear to be fine-tuning for the level of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>, but they do not fully compensate for mutations in FtsH since FtsH null mutants have very high levels of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> and a half life of 40&#x02013;60 min &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, our mathematical analysis indicates that a system implementing SEQ-FB with FF (with no DEG-FB) is able to reproduce these characteristics, albeit at the expense of a much higher level of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> concentration. Indeed, in <italic>Proteus mirabilis,</italic> a &#x003b3;-proteobacteria closely related to <italic>E. coli,</italic> control of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> is implemented by SEQ-FB with FF but no DEG-FB.

These variations raise questions about how the DEG-FB strategy might have evolved, and the evolutionary constraints that led to its existence in the cytoplasmic heat shock response.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Connections of Modularity and Protocols to Evolvability</title><p>Engineering sciences constantly exploit the properties of modular designs to rapidly advance technology. The basic mechanical or electrical strategies that form the functional core of a plane, a car, or a computer change only in rare instances. It is often the superimposition of new modules and their correct interface with older modules through standardized protocols that generate increased speed, reliability, safety, and robustness. Modularity guarantees that the complexity of a design is hidden in &#x0201c;black boxes&#x0201d; that possess well-defined inputs, outputs, and functionality. At the same time, standardized interfaces guarantee the plug-and-play addition of other modules, without the need for extensive fine adjustment to achieve coordination with the existing modules. Therefore, modularity and protocols are often prerequisites for smooth evolvability, and as such may also have been extensively used in the evolution of complex gene regulatory networks. For example, in the heat shock response system, &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> acts as a hub that integrates various flux modules (FF, SEQ-FB, DEG-FB) in interconnected loops (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020059-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Such architecture leaves room for evolvability in a simple manner. Imagine for instance that at some point in the evolutionary past of the heat shock system, FtsH synthesis was not controlled by &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>. Such a system, where the degradation of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> is not negatively regulated by a member of the &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> regulon, would have experienced large stochastic variability, necessitating the evolution of a mechanism for noise attenuation. One possible scheme would have been to evolve an independent controller that stabilizes the levels of FtsH tightly around its desired value. Perhaps a more straightforward solution to the problem is to employ an interconnected loop whereby the FtsH module is evolved just by fusing a promoter for binding of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> to the FtsH gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020059-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Other proteases such as HslVU, ClpAP, and Lon are linked similarly to the &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> molecular module, although these proteases seem to play little or no role in vivo in the degradation of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

For DEG-FB, the FtsH-mediated degradation rate constant for &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> (<italic>kx&#x0005b;1&#x0005d; &#x0003d; kx&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</italic>), the transcription rate constant for &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> (<italic>km&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</italic>), and the association constant between FtsH and &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> (<italic>K&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; &#x0003d; K&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</italic>) are employed. For FF, the critical factor is considered to be the translation efficiency (<italic>&#x003b7;)</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi-0020059-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Mathematical Functional Decomposition of the Reduced Order Heat Shock System</title><p>(75 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.0020059.sg001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi-0020059-sg002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Connection of Flux Modules to the Differential Equations Describing the Reduced Qualitative Model</title><p>(61 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.0020059.sg002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi-0020059-sg003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><title>Time Evolution of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> (<italic>S<sub>t</sub></italic>) for a Reduced Qualitative Model of the Heat Shock Response</title><p>(83 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.0020059.sg003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi-0020059-sg004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><title>Definition of Interconnected Feedback Loops</title><p>(65 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.0020059.sg004.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi-0020059-sg005"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><title>Protocol for Interconnected Feedback Loops</title><p>Evolution of the DEG-FB loop is used an example.</p><p>(70 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.0020059.sg005.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi-0020059-sg006"><label>Figure S6</label><caption><title>Time Evolution of &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup> and DnaK for a Detailed Mechanistic Model in Wild-Type and Mutants</title><p>(70 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.0020059.sg006.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi-0020059-sd001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><title>Derivation of the Sensitivity Equation from the Reduced Qualitative Model</title><p>(60 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.0020059.sd001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi-0020059-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Reduced Qualitative Model of the Heat Shock Response</title><p>(A) Mathematical equations.</p><p>(B) Lists of components and kinetic parameters (see also &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020059-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>(61 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.0020059.st001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="ack1"><title/><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> HK, HES, HO, JCD, CAG, and MK conceived and designed the experiments.
