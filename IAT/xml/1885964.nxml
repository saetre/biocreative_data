Given the important role of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the regulation of fat oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis, we examined AMPK activity in young and old&#x000a0;rats and found that acute stimulation of AMPK-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> activity by 5&#x02032;-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-&#x003b2;-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) and exercise was blunted in skeletal muscle of old rats. Furthermore, mitochondrial biogenesis in response to chronic activation of AMPK with &#x003b2;-guanidinopropionic acid (&#x003b2;-GPA) feeding was also diminished in old rats. These results suggest that aging-associated reductions in AMPK activity may be an important contributing factor in the reduced mitochondrial function and dysregulated intracellular lipid metabolism associated with aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HUMDISEASE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is emerging as a chief regulator of whole-body energy balance (<xref rid="bib2 bib8 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib16 bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Bolster et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Holmes et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Kahn et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Kimura et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Krause et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Terada et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Winder&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 1997, 2000</xref>). In skeletal muscle, once AMPK becomes activated, it exerts control in part by regulating fatty-acid oxidation through the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) and mitochondrial biogenesis through increasing the expression of proteins vital for proper mitochondrial function such as citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase (<xref rid="bib1 bib13 bib18 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Bergeron et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Merrill et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Winder et&#x000a0;al., 1997, 2000; Zong et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Reductions in mitochondrial oxidative-phosphorylation activity, which contribute to dysregulated intracellular lipid metabolism, have recently been implicated in the increased incidence of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes that occurs with aging (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).

When bound to AMPK, AMP or ZMP induces a conformational change that makes AMPK a better substrate for activation by the upstream kinase LKB1 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Hawley et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). In vivo AICAR infusions in 3-month-old (&#x0201c;young&#x0201d;) and 28-month-old (&#x0201c;old&#x0201d;) Fisher 344 male rats increased AMPK-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> activity by 44% in the extensor digitalis longus (EDL) muscles of the young AICAR-treated rats versus young saline-treated (control) rats (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). In contrast, AICAR infusions did not increase AMPK-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> activity in the old rats, demonstrating reduced AMPK activation with aging. Furthermore, AMPK phosphorylation of one of its key substrates in skeletal muscle, ACC2, at serine 79 (Ser79) was increased by 120% in the young AICAR-treated rats, whereas there was no difference in the old AICAR-treated rats (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B).</p><p>AMPK activity is regulated by the phosphorylation of threonine 172 (Thr172) on the catalytic &#x003b1; subunit of the enzyme (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Hawley et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>), and studies in tissue-specific mouse knockouts suggest that LKB1 is the major upstream kinase in skeletal muscle, at least for &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). The reduced AICAR-stimulated AMPK-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> activity could be attributed to reduced phosphorylation since Thr172 phosphorylation increased by 162% in the young AICAR-treated rats and was unaltered in the old AICAR-treated rats (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). These aging-associated differences in AMPK-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> activity and Thr172 phosphorylation between AICAR-treated and saline-treated rats were independent of any changes in AMPK-&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> activity or in the expression of the AMPK-&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> subunits (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> available with this article online).

Groups of young and old Fisher 344 male rats that had been exercise trained for 5 days completed a 5-day treadmill exercise regimen that resulted in a 110% increase in AMPK-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> activity in the young rats. In contrast, the old rats displayed severely blunted AMPK-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> activity in response to exercise (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A).

To investigate how aging impacts AMPK-stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis, we chronically fed young and old rats a diet with 1% &#x003b2;-guanidinopropionic acid (&#x003b2;-GPA) for 8 weeks. Since &#x003b2;-GPA has a lower K<sub>M</sub> for creatine kinase than creatine, its presence results in lower intramyocellular concentrations of ATP and phosphocreatine and thus chronically stimulates AMPK activity. Accordingly, AMPK-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A) increased 146% in the EDL muscles of the young rats fed the &#x003b2;-GPA diet.

A performance test to determine the maximum running capacity for each rat was performed on the fifth day by running the rats for 10 min at 10 m/min and then increasing the speed 1 m/min every minute until exhaustion. The young rats' maximum capacity was determined to be 38&#x000a0;m/min, and the old rats' maximum capacity was 20 m/min. The speed at which all of the rats reached exhaustion was noted, and the rats were run at 85% of that speed for 5 more days after a 2 day break for 30 min each day. Thus, the young rats were run at 32 m/min, and the old rats were run at 17 m/min. On the fifth day, immediately after exercise, the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the skeletal muscle was rapidly excised and freeze clamped in liquid nitrogen.
