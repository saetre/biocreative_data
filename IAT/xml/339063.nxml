Sequences homologous to this element were detected on Southern blots of restricted genomic DNAs from mouse, man, lizard, frog, and carp. No hybridization was observed with Drosophila, yeast, or Escherichia coli DNA. In human DNA, sequences homologous to this element were located at the 5' end of the c-myb gene, i.e. in the same position as in the chicken and mouse genes. Several lines of evidence suggest that the element is not a coding exon of a gene overlapping the c-myb gene. It may be of importance that one of the DNase I-sensitive sites and several c-myb mRNA cap sites localized recently in the mouse c-myb gene (3,4) lie within this region. It is suggested that this evolutionarily conserved element is involved in the regulation of myb proto-oncogene expression in vertebrates.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0135-a" xlink:role="11527"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0136-a" xlink:role="11528"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11521"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11522"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11523"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11524"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11525"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11526"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11527"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11528"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11529"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00166-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11530"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
