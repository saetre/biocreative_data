Our studies identified an immediate early gene that is strongly induced in response to IL-2 in mouse T cells which we named cysteine- serine-rich nuclear protein-1 (CSRNP-1). The human ortholog was previously identified as an AXIN1 induced gene (AXUD1). The protein does not contain sequence defined domains or motifs annotated in public databases, however the gene is a member of a family of three mammalian genes that share conserved regions, including cysteine- and serine-rich regions and a basic domain, they encode nuclear proteins, possess transcriptional activation domain and bind the sequence AGAGTG. Consequently we propose the nomenclature of CSRNP-1, -2 and -3 for the family. To elucidate the physiological functions of CSRNP-1, -2 and -3, we generated mice deficient for each of these genes by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Although the CSRNP proteins have the hallmark of transcription factors and CSRNP-1 expression is highly induced by IL-2, deletion of the individual genes had no obvious consequences on normal mouse development, hematopoiesis or T cell functions. However, combined deficiencies cause partial neonatal lethality suggesting that the genes have redundant functions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The differentiation and functions of T cells are regulated by many cytokines, including the family of interleukins (IL) sharing the common cytokine receptor &#x003b3; chain (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21).

Consequently, we propose the nomenclature CSRNP-1, -2 and -3 for the family. To explore the physiological functions of the family members, we generated mice deficient for each of the genes. Remarkably, none of the deletion of the individual genes resulted in a detectable phenotypic change. Deletion of all three family members resulted in neonatal lethality within the first few days of age, suggesting that the genes have redundant functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of a novel IL-2 induced gene</title><p>To characterize the mechanisms of IL-2-induced T cell proliferation we sought to identify new IL-2 target genes using an Affymetrix array chip (Mu19K).

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000808-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, there is sequence similarity across the amino-terminal region of the proteins and includes similarities in the serine- and cysteine-rich domains as well as the basic regions. The most striking similarity was within the cysteine-rich regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000808-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) which includes 10 positionally conserved cysteine residues. At the protein level, CSRNP-1 is approximately 40&#x00025; identical to CSRNP-2 and CSRNP-3. Fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) analysis confirms the sequence maps localization for the CSRNP-1, CSRNP-2 and CSRNP-3 genes to mouse chromosome 9 band F3-4, chromosome 15 band F1-3 and chromosome 2 band C1.3-2 respectively (data not shown). In addition to the mouse genome, searching of other genomic databases identified three CSRNP genes in humans and in most vertebrates, while single genes are present in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (CG4272, also termed BcDNA:GH09817) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (C41D11.3, also termed 1E998 and YK1057). As with the mouse genes, the CSRNP genes of other species were most similar within the cysteine-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000808-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Since AXUD1 induction is not unique to AXIN1 and, as indicated below, AXUD1 is a member of a structurally related family of proteins, we propose the more descriptive name of cysteine- and serine-rich nuclear proteins (CSRNP) for the gene family.</p><p>Northern blot analyses of the expression in various tissues of the three genes are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000808-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. CSRNP-3 was the most restricted in its expression with expression of a 2.2 kb transcript primarily in the brain with lower levels of expression in kidney and ovary. CSRNP-2 was expressed as a 4.1 kb transcript that was detected in a number of tissues, especially in thymus, brain and ovary. Lastly, a CSRNP-1 transcript of 3.2 kb was detected in all tissues examined. The highest levels of expression were in the thymus and lung. It should be noted that we detected shorter transcripts (of approximate 2 kb) for each gene in testes although the nature of these transcripts was not determined. Since our interest was the potential role of CSRNP-1 in T cells, we also compared the expression levels of the family members in T cells by quantitative RT-PCR. In naive T cells, low levels of transcripts were detected for CSRNP-1 and &#x02013;2, while CSRNP-3 was undetectable.

In contrast, CSRNP-2 and CSRNP-3 yielded single bands, migrating at apparent molecular weights of 80 and 95 kDa respectively, again larger than the predicted sizes (58.5 kDa and 66 kDa, respectively). The slower than anticipated migration is likely to be due to the acidic nature of the proteins.

All three genes have similar structures and the exon-intron boundaries are at corresponding positions in the proteins. Because of the lack of information about functionally important domains, we sought to delete the most conserved, amino-terminal, portions of the proteins by replacing genomic sequences with a neomycin resistance cassette. Because the CSRNP-3 gene spanned over 180 Kbp, a smaller deletion was used. In all cases the conserved cysteine-rich domain was deleted. Proper targeting and transmission of the allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000808-g005">Fig 5D&#x02013;F</xref>). To determine if the targeting strategies produced null alleles, we raised antisera against peptides derived from the CRSNP-1, -2 and -3 protein sequences. Affinity purified antibodies were used to probe western blots of lysates from wild type and CSRNP deficient tissues. In each case, specific bands were detected in wild type tissues but not in tissues from each deficient strain, again the endogenous proteins migrated much slower than their predicted molecular weight but slightly faster than the corresponding flag-tagged versions owning to the presence of the tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000808-g005">Fig. 5G&#x02013;I</xref>).

All are nuclear proteins with considerable similarity in their DNA sequence preference for binding to DNA.

Based on the strong induction of CSRNP-1 in peripheral T cells in response to IL-2, we focused primarily on mice deficient in this gene. As detailed, there were no changes in T cell development, the ability to proliferate in response to IL-2, in cytokine production or in the ability to undergo antigen-induced cell death. We also examined the ability of the CSRNP-1 deficient mice to respond to influenza virus infections without observing any changes (data not shown). Although not induced by IL-2, CSRNP-2 is also expressed at low levels in peripheral T cells and consequently similar studies have been done with CSRNP-2 deficient and CSRNP-1/-2 double deficient mice to explore potential functional redundancy. Preliminary studies indicate that CSRNP-2 deficient mice were more susceptible to influenza infection (data not shown), but it appears that it does not affect the generation of influenza virus-specific T cells. The increased susceptibility is still under investigation. A mutant allele of AXUD1/CSRNP-1, generated by gene trapping was recently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000808-Schmahl1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, it is associated with a 20&#x00025; post-natal lethality and a weakly penetrant reduction of PDGFR&#x003b1;-dependent skeletal structures. We have analyzed over 300 offspring at weaning from interbreeding of heterozygote CSRNP-1 mice and obtained exact mendelian ratios and no evidence of post-natal lethality. We also did not observed skeletal defects, therefore our knockout does not support the phenotypes reported.</p><p>Deficiencies in both CSRNP-2/-3 or in all family members produced a partial neonatal lethality within the first 48 hours of birth. However we have been unable to determine the basis for the lethality but it may be associated with a reduced vigor or failure to compete for material support. Histological analysis failed to identify phenotypic differences consequently the basis for the partial neonatal lethality is unknown. Therefore the contribution of CSRNP-1-/- to the phenotype will only be definitively addressed once the mechanisms of action of the CSRNP proteins are identified. Also crossing the mutant mice on pure strains might increase the penetrance of this phenotype and help to identify the defect.</p><p>The lack of any phenotypic consequences of deleting CSRNP-1, CSRNP-2 or both genes in T cells can be interpreted in several ways. One possibility is that the genes have critical functions, but their functions are redundant. Normally redundancy is considered between family members, however in the case of CSRNP-1 our studies clearly demonstrate that, if redundancy is the basis for lack of any consequences of deleting the genes on T cells, the redundancy must be with gene(s) unrelated to the CSRNP family of genes. Alternatively, the CSRNP genes may be essential for a cellular response to a specific set of conditions or factors.</p><p>A number of studies have identified AXUD1/CSRNP-1 as a gene that is down-regulated in a variety of cancer, thus implicating the gene as a potential tumor suppressor gene, often considered related to reduced apoptosis. However, deficiencies of the individual family members failed to show any increase in cancers. Moreover, in studies of T cells and hematopoietic cells, we did not detect any reduction in apoptosis as a consequence of deficiencies of the genes for the individual family members. Irrespective, as global approaches to gene expression continue to implicate members of the CSRNP family of genes in various physiological responses, the availability of strains of mice lacking the genes will be invaluable to critically assess their physiological role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>T cells assays</title><p>Spleens, thymi, or lymph nodes were crushed into single cell suspensions in PBS containing 2&#x00025; fetal bovin serum (FBS) through a 70-&#x000b5;m-pore-size nylon mesh.
