It is widely known that central nervous system (CNS) neurons fail to regenerate after injury. This question has attracted intense investigation at both the preclinical and clinical levels. Regeneration failure has been attributed in part to proteins associated with CNS myelin and the scar that forms at an injury site. Furthermore, an ON trauma model can also be used as experimental research model to study CNS injury.</p><p>Nogo-A, Nogo-B, and Nogo-C are major protein species in oligodendrocytes and expressed in ON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Among them, Nogo-A is the principal protein that prevents axonal outgrowth. A 66-amino loop structure located between two transmembrane domains named Nogo-66, which is common to all Nogo forms, is the main contributor to this inhibitory effect. Nogo-66 is expressed on the surface of oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>] and functions by binding to an axonal Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Nogo-66 is somewhat &#x0201c;fastidious&#x0201d; as regards to which environment it will express, as it is expressed in the myelin of a sciatic nerve transplant to the CNS but not in those to the peripheral nervous system (PNS). This feature, together with its in vitro activities, has confirmed Nogo-66 as a myelin-derived inhibitor to the axonal regeneration after injury.</p><p>Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>] found that corticospinal axons of young adult Nogo-A knockout mice sprout extensively rostral to a transection after spinal cord injury. In this study we investigated axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury in young adult Nogo-A/B/C knockout mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Sodium pentobarbital, paraformaldehyde (Shanghai Biologic Company, Shanghai, China), Vectashield mounting medium (H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), GAP-43 antibody (Serotec, Raleigh, NC), DMEM medium and B-27 medium (Gibco, Burlington, CA), Hanks solution (Hyclone, Logan, UT), papain (Worthington, Lakewood, New Jersey), poly-lysine, bovine serum albumin, DNAase, Thy1.1 antibody, phosphate buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 5% goat serum (Zhongshan Company, Beijing, China), SABC (Boster Company, Wuhan, China).</p></sec><sec><title>Equipment</title><p>Equipment included: surgical microscope (OMS-110, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan), 40 g power ON forceps (Martins Instruments, Tullingen, Germany, donated by Professor Gu Zhao-bin, Gifu University of Japan), anatomical microscope (SZ-PT, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), fluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus), optic microscope (Olympus), CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (BB16HF, Heal Force, Hong Kong, China), ultraclean work table (D8C-010; Heal Force), incubation plate (Coster Company, Cambridge, MA).</p></sec><sec><title>Generation and maintenance of Nogo-A/B/C knockout mutant mice</title><p>A Nogo-targeted embryonic stem cell clone was identified from the Omnibank sequence Tag database. Omnibank mutations were created, using insertional mutagenesis based on retroviral-based gene trap methodology. Heterozygotic mice harboring the disrupted allele were bred to C57Bl/6 mice for expansion in our animal housing facility and intercrossed to maintain the Nogo-A/B/C mutation on a hybrid 129SvEvBrd_C57Bl/6 background. The heterozygotic mice (9 or 12-week-old) were donated by Professor Xiulan Xu. The mice were raised in the laminar air flow cage rack (Suzhou Experimental Equipment Company, Suzhou, China). In the present study, animals were backcrossed to C57Bl/6 for three to six generations, and 7&#x02013;14-week-old Nogo-A/B/C<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;/-</sup> littermates were used as controls for all experiments. The present investigation adhered to the principles regarding the care and use of animals according to the American Physiologic Society, the Society for Neuroscience, and the ARVO Statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal grouping</title><p>The present study used 20 Nogo-A/B/C knockout mice (8 or 12-week-old) in the experimental group, and 20 C 57BL/6 control mice(8 or 12-week-old) in the control group. To depict the axonal growth at successive time points, both groups were further divided into three subgroups representing the first day (n=7), third day (n=7), and seventh day (n=7) outcomes, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Prior to ON crush, general anesthesia was induced in each animal with an intraperitoneal injection of 1% sodium pentobarbital solution (50&#x000a0;mg/kg bodyweight). A surgical microscope was used to visualize the ON, which was exposed through a superior temporal approach. A 1&#x02013;1.5 cm incision was made in the skin above the right orbit. The dural sheath of the ON was opened longitudinally, from which the ON was then gently detached before it was crushed at 1&#x000a0;mm distal to the eyeball by an ON forceps with 40 g pressure for 9 s. Injury to the ophthalmic artery was carefully avoided during the procedure. Nerve injury was verified by the appearance of a clearing at the crush site; the vascular integrity of the retina was verified by funduscopic examination after dilating the pupil with atropine. The left ON was crushed in both groups, but the right ON was left untouched in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation for pathological and immunohistochemistry examinations</title><p>Seven days after ON crush, thoracotomy was performed. The animals were perfused through the heart with heparin saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, including diethypyrocarbonate (DEPC) for in situ hybridization. Eyes with ON segments up to the optic chiasm were postfixed overnight, and transferred to a 30% sucrose solution overnight (4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and including DEPC for in situ hybridization overnight (4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). Frozen sections (15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) were cut longitudinally on a cryostat, thaw mounted onto coated glass slides, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until further use.</p><p>Digoxygenin-labeled sense and antisense RNA probes were generated as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>].

Briefly, the retinal tissue was dissociated into single cells in Eagle's minimum essential medium that contained 15 U/ml papain and 70 U/ml collagenase. The cell suspension was incubated successively in a polypropylene tube coated with a monoclonal anti-rat macrophage IgG to remove macrophages, and then in another one coated with a monoclonal anti-rat Thy 1.1 IgG. Finally, the tube was gently washed five times with PBS. RGCs were collected by centrifugation at 700xg for 5 min and then cultured at a concentration of 6x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in DMEM that contained 100 U/ml penicillin, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml gentamicin, and B-27. Cells were then seeded into poly-lysine coated 24-well plates and incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> ventilation.

An extracellular segment composed of 66 amino acid residues between two transmembrane domains, known as Nogo-66, is the major functional domain of this protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>].</p><p>A neutralizing monoclonal antibody, neurite outgrowth inhibitor 1 (IN-1), has recently been confirmed to target the N-terminal domain of Nogo-A encoded by exon 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. When IN-1 is applied to several CNS injury models, including spinal cord lesions and cortical lesions, there is notable neuroanatomical and behavioral recovery compared with controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. These results suggest that the Nogo-NgR system is accountable for, to a large degree, the inhibitory activity that is responsible for the prevention of CNS axonal regeneration after injury.</p><p>Increased expression of Nogo-A in RGCs after ON injury indicates that Nogo-A may play an inhibitory role in axonal regeneration after ON injury.</p><p>The expressed GAP-43 is located in the growth cone of the regenerating axon.

Nogo is important inhibitor for regeneration after CNS injury. Knockout of Nogo-A/B/C gene can lead to regeneration after optic nerve injury in this study. The results indicate that Nogo-A/B/C plays an important role in the inhibition of axonal regeneration after ON injury.</p><p>The significant difference in the length of axons regenerated in vitro between the experimental and control groups on the third and seventh postoperative days suggests that Nogo-A/B/C elimination is effective in enhancing axonal regeneration of RGCs in at least in vitro experiments.</p><p>The analysis on mice with various degrees of gene disruption targeted at Nogo isoforms has been reported by three groups. Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] observed significant corticospinal tract fiber sprouting in young Nogo-A/B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with wild-type and Nogo-A/B<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Simonen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] noted moderate corticospinal tract fiber regeneration in Nogo-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. However, Zheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] saw no significant regeneration in either Nogo-A/B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> line or Nogo-A/B/C<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> line mice above that of wild type. It is believed that the varying degrees of regenerative capacity after Nogo elimination can be attributed to the differences in genetic backgrounds of the mice used in the experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>].</p><p>Increased expression of Nogo-A in RGCs after ON injury indicates that Nogo-A may play an inhibitory role in axonal regeneration after ON injury.</p><p>There was a significant difference in the area of ON stained positive for GAP-43 between the experimental group and the control group in this study.

Further investigation of NgR may reveal whether NgR gene knockout enhances axonal regeneration after ON injury even more effectively.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We
