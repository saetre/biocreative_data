We found that HDC<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that lack histamine are resistant to the induction of CM during infection with <italic>Pb</italic> ANKA. In this mouse model, we found that the absence of histamine prevents leukocyte adhesion and sequestration of infected erythrocytes to the brain vasculature, and decreases the expression of ICAM-1 by brain vascular endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Beghdadi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the predominant expression in the central nervous system of the H3R, one of the four identified histamine receptors, the possibility exists that signaling through this particular histamine receptor may control the development of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-associated brain pathology. We investigated the role of H3R in the onset of CM, using mice with non-functional H3R gene. We observed a significantly earlier emergence of clinical signs of CM with more rapid death in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice as compared to identically infected wild type C57BL/6 mice. Although higher parasitemia was observed at day 4 and 5 in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice as compared to wild-type mice, it is unlikely that a causative relationship exists between parasitemia levels and pathology. Indeed, high parasitemia levels could be elicited in histamine-deficient HDC<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Beghdadi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (personal observation) without any disease expression. The accelerated death of H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is associated with an earlier and more pronounced loss of BBB integrity than in infected C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006004-g002">Fig 2</xref>). These findings are consistent with an uncontrolled histamine release by histaminergic neurons in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Indeed, histamine release by these neurons is tightly regulated by H3R, which act as inhibitory autoreceptors for the synthesis and release of histamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Schwartz2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Schwartz3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and as H3 heteroreceptors to inhibit the release of other neurotransmitters including dopamine, &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and serotonin in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Schlicker1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Estimating neuronal histamine levels in the brain, by measuring the histamine metabolite t-MeHA as an index, confirmed that neuronal histamine activity is significantly higher in naive H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice than in C57BL/6 mice. However, following infection, <italic>tele</italic>-methylhistamine levels in the brain dropped sharply below constitutive levels in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice while in C57BL/6 mice this decrease was not obvious. This observation is consistent with a tighter control exerted by the H3R on histamine release from neuronal cells in C57BL/6 mice, which is absent in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This decrease could be due either to a down-regulation of the HDC gene expression or an up-regulation of the HMT expression in response to the infection. We found that the catabolism pathway was not affected since the expression of HMT, which converts histamine into the biologically inactive compound <italic>tele</italic>-methylhistamine, was not altered throughout the infection period (data not shown). In na&#x000ef;ve mice the biosynthetic pathway as determined by HDC mRNA expression indicates that expression in the brain was 3-fold higher in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice than in C57BL/6 mice, a finding consistent with the control of histamine synthesis by H3 autoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Schwartz2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Schwartz3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. After infection with <italic>Pb</italic> ANKA, the regulation of HDC mRNA expression showed distinct patterns in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and in C57BL/6 mice. It appears that while the expression of HDC increased in both mouse genotypes, at day 6 post-infection a down-regulation occurred only in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. A possible explanation for the earlier loss of BBB integrity in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice consists of a surge in histamine available in the brain. This histamine likely binds to H1R and H2R which may then alter the permeability of brain capillaries resulting in the loss of BBB integrity. Our data show that the expression of clinical signs is associated with decreases in <italic>tele</italic>-methylhistamine levels, and HDC mRNA expression in the brain. However, it remains unclear by which mechanism these decreases occur in an accelerated manner in infected H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Because histamine neuron activity is involved in the regulation of body temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Schwartz2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> the earlier down-regulations observed in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice might result as an effect of hypothermia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Herwig1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Barone1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> known to occur during CM and just prior death. As part of the established neuroprotective effect of hypothermia, it was also reported very recently that hypothermia induced increased concentrations in the brain of galanin, a neuropeptide known to be co-localized with histamine in rodent histaminergic neurons and to modulate their activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Theodorsson1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, an up-regulation of the neuropeptide galanin could provide a possible explanation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Airaksinen1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Arrang1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Stevens1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, we could not detect differences in either the expression of galanin or in the drop of body temperature between H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and C57BL/6 mice (data not shown). Given the complexity of the physiological regulations of a vast array of neurotransmitters by histamine via H3R signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Theodorsson1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, future studies will explore if and how these neurotransmitters are modulated during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection in wild-type mice and in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>In CM pathogenesis, it has been well established that a major effector is CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells which sequester within cerebral blood vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Belnoue2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> along with parasitized red blood cells.

We examined whether the higher susceptibility of H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was reflected by a differential recruitment of these cells as compared to wild type C57BL/C mice. Analysis of brain-associated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells after infection with <italic>Pb</italic> ANKA parasites displayed a constant rise in T cells with similar kinetics in both genotypes until day 5 where a higher number of cells was detected in the brains from H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Considering the fact that other inflammatory cells such as neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Senaldi1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Chen1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> and monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Pais1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> contribute to CM pathogenesis, we evaluated and observed, as for T cells, a sequestration of a higher number of cells in the brains of infected H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Furthermore, T cell sequestration was dominated by CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Looking at a possible difference in terms of peripheral T cell response, the splenocytes from the mouse strains, challenged ex-vivo with <italic>Pb</italic> ANKA lysate, produced variable amounts of IL-10, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; with different kinetics between the two genotypes ultimately ending with an immunosuppression at day 5 post-infection occurring in both mouse strains. This immune suppression is consistent with earlier data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Nie1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, further suggesting that inhibition of the T cell proliferation and cytokine production was under the control of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T regulatory cells elicited during <italic>Pb</italic> ANKA infection. One exception for this immune suppression is TNF-&#x003b1; whose production by splenocytes from H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was less affected. The sustained TNF&#x02212;&#x003b1; production by splenocytes combined with a sequestration of a higher number of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain may account for the more severe disease developed by H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>A critical and consistent difference between the two mouse genotypes is the earlier disruption of the BBB and the concomitant hemorrhagic lesions in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at day 3 post-infection, a time when no clinical sign had manifested.</p><p>Histamine is implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and its animal models, collectively termed EAE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Teuscher1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings are in agreement with a recently published report on EAE showing that, compared with wild-type animals, H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop a more severe disease and neuroinflammation along with dysregulated BBB permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Teuscher1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Typically, the increased clinical disease observed during the early phase of EAE in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was associated with earlier and more severe inflammatory infiltrates. Also, the degree of the BBB permeability was significantly higher in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared with C57BL/6 mice. As for EAE, two opposite, although not exclusive hypotheses, may account for the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the disease expression during experimental CM. The immune-based hypothesis which contends that parasite-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells exert their effector functions within brain capillaries, and the alternative hypothesis that emphasizes the brain tissue-initiated inflammatory response, which represents the primary pathological event leading to disease progression. Disruption of H3R reveals that during <italic>Pb</italic> ANKA infection, the ability of this receptor to normalize histamine release within the brain tissue is important for limiting immunopathology and supporting a positive outcome. Subsequent to the brain-initiated inflammatory events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006004-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006004-g003">3</xref>), CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and inflammatory cells adhere to brain capillaries leading to their detrimental effect. In this regard, we propose a similar chronological pattern of pathogenetic events as in EAE and as discussed by Teuscher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Teuscher1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Uncontrolled histamine release in various immunopathological conditions where the brain tissue represents the site of pathogenetic events may support the utility of pharmacological targeting of H3R via receptor agonists to prevent the development of tissue lesions either in multiple sclerosis or during CM. Our data support this pharmacological approach since the use of (R)-alpha-methylhistamine, a standard H3R agonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Schwartz2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Schwartz3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, was demonstrated to be effective in reducing progression to CM. Although, such class of drug is not available yet for a therapeutic use in humans, our work provides a rational basis for a future use of H3R agonists, alone or in combination with H1R or H2R inhibitors, as they become available. The single use, however, of an H1R inhibitor Levocetirizine or an H2R inhibitor Cimetidine when H3R is functional appears to be promising since both drugs were effective in preventing the development of clinical signs and mortality due to CM. This therapeutic effect was translated at the molecular level at least in part by the down-regulation of inflammatory response-associated genes such as IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;. Hence, the beneficial role of H3R in limiting disease expression by controlling histamine release and metabolism is highlighted by the higher therapeutic effectiveness and better control of inflammatory gene expression exerted by H1R and H2R inhibitors when H3R is functional. The compensatory protective effect provided by Cimetidine and to a lesser extent by Levocetirizine in H3R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice suggest that expression of a functional H3R constitutes a minimal condition that helps slow the development of severe disease. Once the infection was established, we found that only Levocetirizine significantly increased survival to CM. Furtheremore, Levocetirizine appeared to be more efficient when delivered as a preventive treatment than when it was administered therapeutically. This argues for a preferential use of H1R and H2R inhibitors as a preventive therapy. This would be more feasible in areas where malaria transmission is seasonal. In the absence of any impact or alteration of parasite development, our data are not consistent with previous findings showing that Astemizole, an H1R inhibitor, directly interferes with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite metabolism, thus altering its development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006004-Chong1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the 7/4 antigen can also be expressed by inflammatory monocytes as shown in S1D with a key difference in that inflammatory monocytes express less GR1 and 7/4 antigen than neutrophils. We further examined these cells which were sorted using a cell-sorter (5 days post-infection) as shown in annex 1B (purity 96&#x00025; based on GR1High/7/4 expression) and which morphologically resemble activated neutrophils as observed by electron microscopy (S1C). These cells were also shown to release myeloperoxydase upon phorbol myristate acetate stimulation.</p><p>(1.10 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006004.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006004.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Treatments with histamine receptors inhibitors have no therapeutic effect when administered at the time of CM neurological symptoms.
