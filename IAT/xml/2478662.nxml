Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) suggest that Dpy-30L1 interferes with the binding of MTF-1 to its cognate MRE binding site. Dpy-30L1 is expressed in the larval brain, gonads, imaginal discs, salivary glands and in the brain, testes, ovaries and salivary glands of adult flies. Expression of the second interactor, Dpy-30L2 (CG11591), is restricted to larval male gonads, and to the testes of adult males.

A general interaction analysis of <italic>Drosophila </italic>proteins by means of the yeast two-hybrid system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] revealed two closely related proteins as potential interaction partners of MTF-1 (see below). These interaction proteins were encoded by genes designated CG6444 and CG11591 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Both belong to a protein family that is conserved from yeast to humans and whose founding member was described in the nematode <italic>C. elegans </italic>as Dumpy-30 (Dpy-30), a protein involved in dosage compensation of sex chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Dpy-30 is required for sex-specific association of Dpy-27, a chromosome condensation protein homolog, with the hermaphrodite's X chromosomes. Besides causing XX-specific lethality, the <italic>dpy-30 </italic>mutation in XO animals causes developmental delay, small body size, inability to mate and abnormal tail morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These phenotypes suggest an involvement of Dpy-30 also in processes other than dosage compensation. The yeast homolog of <italic>C. elegans </italic>Dpy-30, Sdc1, was identified as an important component of the eight-member complex (SET1C protein complex), which functions as a histone 3 lysine 4 (H3-K4) methyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The loss of individual SET1 protein complex subunits differentially affects SET1 stability, complex integrity and the distribution of H3K4 methylation along active genes. Such mutations cause defects in maintenance of telomere length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and in DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Dpy-30 and its close relatives contain a short motif related to the dimerization motif in the regulatory subunit of Protein Kinase A. This motif consists of two &#x003b1;-helices that form a special type of four-helix bundle during dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Until recently no data were available on one of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>homologs, CG6444, while the other, CG11591, was shown to be expressed in testes by genome-wide microarray analysis of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned, the interaction partner of Dpy-30-like proteins in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>interaction study was identified as metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1). MTF-1 is a key regulator of heavy metal homeostasis and detoxification in higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In mammals, MTF-1 controls a number of genes for metal homeostasis and is also essential for embryonic liver development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>MTF-1 binds via its zinc fingers to metal-responsive elements (MREs) in the promoter/enhancer region of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and activates their transcription. Metallothioneins are the best characterized target genes of MTF-1; they encode small, cysteine-rich proteins with an ability to scavenge excess heavy metal ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>Drosophilae </italic>mutant for dMTF-1, the homolog of mammalian MTF-1, are viable but more sensitive to elevated concentrations of heavy metals, as well as to copper scarcity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Upon copper starvation, dMTF-1 activates transcription of the gene encoding Ctr1B, a high affinity copper importer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Recently several additional target genes of MTF-1 in mammals and in <italic>Drosophila </italic>were identified and characterized in our laboratory by microarray and specific transcript analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] but little is known to date about proteins interacting with and/or regulating <italic>Drosophila </italic>MTF-1 function.</p><p>Here we show that transgenes of both <italic>Drosophila </italic>Dpy-30 orthologs, CG6444 and CG11591, hereafter termed Dpy-30-like 1 (Dpy-30L1) and Dpy-30-like 2 (Dpy-30L2), respectively, inhibit MTF-1-dependent reporter gene expression in cell culture. Constitutive expression of a Dpy-30L1 transgene in flies results in elevated sensitivity to Cd(II) and Zn(II), while Dpy-30L2 overexpression has no such effect. Consistent with metal resistance, only the Dpy-30L1 transgene inhibited dMTF-1 activity in flies. Gene knockout by homologous recombination revealed that <italic>dpy-30L1 </italic>null mutant flies are viable and fertile and maintain a seemingly normal metal homeostasis, while knockout of the male-specific <italic>dpy-30L2 </italic>results in male sterility. Sperm motility in <italic>dpy-30L2 </italic>mutants is impaired and drastically decreases with age. After mating mutant sperm is transferred to the uterus but does not accumulate in the seminal receptacle and spermathecae, making successful fertilization impossible. These findings reveal a major role of Dpy-30 proteins in male fertility and sperm motility.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inhibition of MTF-1-dependent reporter expression in <italic>Drosophila </italic>Schneider S2 cells</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila </italic>interactome study of Giot <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] had revealed three proteins that display very good (Dpy-30L1), good (Dpy-30L2), and weak (CG11061) interaction with dMTF-1.

The third protein reported to interact with dMTF-1 only weakly, CG11061, was listed as a protein putatively involved in Golgi organization and biogenesis, mitosis and protein targeting.

The effect on the synthetic MRE promoter was more pronounced, suggesting that Dpy-30L1 and Dpy-30L2 indeed interact with dMTF-1 and thereby interfere with its activity, as MTF-1 is the only factor known to bind MREs. This inhibitory effect could also be shown in the whole organism expressing an YFP reporter gene driven by the metallothionein (MtnA) promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Here, the response (YFP expression) to copper, and especially to cadmium, was strongly reduced, whereas under copper starvation conditions no difference was observed.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of Dpy-30L1 overexpression on MTF-1 dependent reporters in cell culture and <italic>in vivo</italic></bold>.

However, it appears that the antagonistic interaction between MTF-1 and Dpy-30 family members is specific to <italic>Drosophila </italic>MTF-1: mammalian MTF-1 was not affected by Dpy-30-type proteins, irrespective of whether the test was done in <italic>Drosophila </italic>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) or mammalian cells (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibitory effect of Dpy-30L1, Dpy-30L2 and their mammalian orthologs is restricted to <italic>Drosophila </italic>MTF-1</bold>.

Flies overexpressing Dpy-30L1 were raised during their entire development on normal food, or food supplemented with different heavy metals. They did not show a phenotype when kept on standard food but were much more sensitive to heavy metal load, especially to cadmium and zinc, while sensitivity to copper was only marginally affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The sensitivity to cadmium and zinc could be rescued by co-overexpression of an MTF-1 transgene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This shows that the metal sensitivity of organisms expressing transgenic Dpy-30L1 was not merely reflecting a generally lower resistance to stress but rather a disturbed metal-specific stress response. This point was corroborated by raising flies in excess iron, a metal that is handled by a pathway different from the MTF-1/metallothionein system. Neither an increased sensitivity nor a rescue effect could be observed upon overexpression of Dpy-30L1 and/or dMTF-1 (data not shown). Although both Dpy-30L1 and Dpy-30L2 overexpression inhibited MTF-1 function in cell culture, only Dpy-30L1 was effective in a transgenic fly. This leads to the conclusion that there are functional differences between the two related proteins that become evident only in whole-organism studies.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Sensitivity of <italic>Drosophila </italic>to heavy metal load</bold>.

The expression pattern of the two genes was quite distinct: The <italic>dpy-30L1 </italic>regulatory region induced expression in multiple larval tissues, notably brain, gonads, imaginal discs and salivary glands. In adult flies, expression was seen in the brain, testes, ovaries and salivary glands. In contrast, the expression of Dpy-30L2-YFP was confined exclusively to male gonads in larvae, and to the testes in adult flies. Further dissection of the expression pattern of Dpy-30L2-YFP during spermatogenesis revealed that Dpy-30L2-YFP is expressed in elongated spermatids at the "canoe-like" stage but not during the early stages of spermatogenesis or in mature sperm (not shown), which is also consistent with the online <italic>Drosophila </italic>testis gene expression database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

Somewhat unexpectedly, <italic>dpy-30L1 </italic>knockout flies turned out to be viable and fertile under laboratory conditions and did not show any obvious alterations in metal resistance/sensitivity phenotypes (data not shown). In the mutated locus, the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and SV40 polyadenylation/termination sequence was followed, out-of-frame, by a truncated Dpy-30L1 coding sequence (for details, see Materials &#x00026; Methods). Though unlikely, we cannot rule out the possibility that the residual Dpy-30L1 sequence was expressed by re-initiation of transcription and translation from an internal site in the coding region, thus producing a hypomorph, rather than a null mutation. In contrast, disruption of the male-specific <italic>dpy-30L2 </italic>gene resulted in complete male sterility. Combination of the two mutations did not reveal any additional phenotypic features, i.e., male flies were again sterile but otherwise normal under laboratory conditions.</p><p>We attempted to identify more precisely the defects in the reproductive system of <italic>dpy-30L2 </italic>knockout males. A dissection of <italic>dpy-30L2</italic><sup>6-1 </sup>males revealed apparently normal testes that contained sperm. In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Dpy-30 is known to be involved in dosage compensation, a process that equalizes the expression of X-chromosomes in XX and XO animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and in yeast it methylates histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Dpy-30L2 is specifically expressed in the spermatid stage where transcription is repressed in germ cells and histones are removed from DNA to be replaced by protamines. Thus we wondered whether in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, loss of Dpy-30L2 distorts chromatin structure at this critical stage. However, loss of histone H2A variant D (H2AvD) expression, a hallmark of the transition to the protamine-loaded sperm, was not affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), and also the protamine B-eGFP distribution pattern was not disturbed. Furthermore, the marker Mst77F-eGFP was inconspicuous in that it was associated with DNA at the appropriate stage of spermatogenesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

Since from these latter sites sperm are used to fertilize eggs, this mislocalization could, in part or completely, explain the sterility of mutant males. A possible reason for mislocalization of dpy-30L2 mutant sperm in females could be impaired or uncoordinated motility of sperm.

Consistent with such an inhibition, transgenic flies were sensitive to cadmium or zinc load, while copper sensitivity was only marginally affected. The increased metal sensitivity could be rescued by co-overexpression of dMTF-1. An EMSA assay revealed a weakened binding of MTF-1 to MRE DNA in the presence of Dpy-30L1. Taken together, these results suggest that for detoxification of Cd(II) or Zn(II) a higher level of MTF-1 is required than for Cu(II) detoxification. Studies with partial inactivation mutants of dMTF-1 are in agreement with such a notion (A.V., H. Yepiskoposyan and W.S., unpublished). Unexpectedly, only MTF-1 of insect origin responded to Dpy-30 type proteins: while the human and mouse Dpy-30 members also inhibited <italic>Drosophila </italic>MTF-1 across species boundaries, activity of human MTF-1 was unchanged in the presence of either <italic>Drosophila </italic>or mammalian Dpy-30 members. This indicates some degree of functional divergence between <italic>Drosophila </italic>and mammalian MTF-1 during evolution, in spite of a conserved role in heavy metal homeostasis and detoxification. We consider the Dpy-30-dMTF-1 interactions observed in the interactome study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] relevant because (i) the two major interactors Dpy-30L1 and L2 are members of the same protein family; (ii) a (negative) functional interaction with dMTF-1 was seen with both of them, and with their mammalian Dpy-30 homolog, in transfected cells; (iii) Dpy-30L1, the stronger interactor, also produced an effect <italic>in vivo</italic>, and (iv) it inhibited the binding of dMTF-1 to its cognate DNA sequence.</p><p>As a complement to transgenic expression of Dpy-30L1 and Dpy-30L2, we also tested a loss of function of the two proteins. Disruption of short genes in <italic>Drosophila </italic>has been a great challenge since small targets are rarely hit by random mutagenesis. To circumvent this problem, we eliminated Dpy-30L1 and L2 function separately by homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Somewhat unexpectedly, knockout of neither Dpy-30L1 nor Dpy-30L2 affected metal handling under the conditions tested, but Dpy-30L2 which is specifically expressed in male gonads, turned out to be essential for male fertility.</p><p>Sdc1, the yeast homolog of Dpy-30, is a component of SET1C, also called COMPASS (<italic>com</italic>plex <italic>p</italic>roteins <italic>ass</italic>ociated with SET1 protein). SET1C methylates histone H3 at lysine residue 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Yeast strains mutant for SET1, although viable, display defects in cell growth, rDNA silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and silencing of telomeres and mating type loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the dosage compensation complex (DCC), which among other proteins includes Dpy-30, represses X-chromosomal transcription in cells of XX animals. The complex binds preferentially to promoter regions and seems to be required for the early steps of dosage compensation, not for its maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The SET1C complex has also been shown to activate some specific genes, notably for DNA repair genes. This activation is however an indirect one, via repression of a signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Direct activation of target genes is also possible, at least in mammals: a human homolog of SET1C, the MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) complex which also has methyltransferase activity and is ivolved in tumor cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], positively regulates Hox gene expression through binding to promoter sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Recent investigations have shown that the human MLL2/ALR complex contains the human ortholog of Dpy-30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Taken together, these data indicate a conserved role of Dpy-30 family members in the modulation of chromatin structure and transcription.</p><p>However, there are clear differences as well. The <italic>Drosophila </italic>trithorax complex, the homolog of yeast SET1C, is essential for viability. Our findings suggest that flies lacking both Dpy-30L1 and Dpy-30L2 are viable and that Dpy-30 orthologs of <italic>Drosophila </italic>are not obligatory components of the trithorax complex. The only mutant phenotype we observed was male sterility in the absence of Dpy-30L2. A hallmark of spermatogenesis, the replacement of histones by protamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] is not affected in the Dpy-30L2 mutant. Because transcriptional silencing of the spermatid genome seems to occur independently of protamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], it appears still possible that Dpy-30L2 is required for proper gene silencing during spermatogenesis.</p><p>In yeast, <italic>C. elegans </italic>and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Dpy-30 members serve different but important functions, perhaps converging, in metazoans, on sex-specific gene expression programs, compatible with the fact that the single Dpy-30 ortholog of the mouse is strongly expressed in testes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dumpy-30 (Dpy-30) type proteins are conserved from yeast to humans but their function in higher eukaryotes is only partially understood. Here we have characterized the two Dpy-30 familiy members in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Strong expression of Dpy-30L1 can inhibit the activity of MTF-1 (metal-responsive transcription factor 1), resulting in elevated sensitivity of flies to cadmium and zinc load. The second member, Dpy-30L2, is only expressed in the male genital tract; targeted gene disruption of <italic>dpy-30L2 </italic>results in male sterility associated with reduced motility of sperm and failure to be transferred to the female's seminal receptacles. Like Drosophila Dpy-30L2, the mouse Dpy-30 homolog is strongly expressed in testes, from where the expressed sequence tag (EST) was obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Thus Dpy-30 family members may well be required for male fertility also in mammals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Database searches and computer analysis of the sequences</title><p>Blast searches for mammalian and yeast orthologs were performed using the NCBI BLAST service.
