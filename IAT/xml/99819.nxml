Rad23 homologs have an unusual structure in which the N-terminal end, referred to as UbL for ubiquitin-like, is similar to ubiquitin, the small 76 amino acid long protein that serves as a signal for degradation of proteins by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c4">4</xref>). The Rad23 homologs also have a central and a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. UBA domains are highly conserved structural motifs containing about 50 amino acids, originally identified in proteins that participate in the ubiquitin pathway and whose function has not been clearly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c8">8</xref>).</p><p>Studies of <italic>rad23</italic> mutations in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> first indicated a role for this gene in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of UV-damaged DNA since <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells are moderately sensitive to UV light due to a deficiency in this type of repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c3">3</xref>). The Rad23 protein binds to Rad4 and other NER factors. Furthermore, the Rad23&#x02013;Rad4 complex binds preferentially to UV-damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c10">10</xref>) as part of the NER process. The UbL domain of Rad23 plays a role in NER since deletion of this region causes UV sensitivity intermediate between the levels demonstrated by a wild-type and a <italic>rad23</italic> deletion strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c3">3</xref>). The interaction of this UbL domain with the proteasome suggested that proteolysis is important for NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c11">11</xref>). However, using both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches, Russell <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c12">12</xref>) found that the interaction with the proteasome but not proteolysis <italic>per se</italic> was essential for the role of Rad23 in NER. These studies suggested that the UbL domain of Rad23 is important for the assembly of protein complexes required for efficient NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c12">12</xref>).</p><p>One of the human homologs of Rad23, HHR23B, was originally identified in a complex with XP-C. The latter protein is a human homolog of budding yeast Rad4 and represents one of the eight complementation groups for the genetic disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c13">13</xref>). Patients with XP are highly sensitive to UV and demonstrate a greatly increased frequency of skin cancer due to defective NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c13">13</xref>). While <italic>HHR23B</italic> and <italic>HHR23A</italic>, a second human homolog of <italic>RAD23</italic>, are not XP genes and no naturally occurring mutations have yet been identified in them, studies with <italic>in vitro</italic> systems indicate that NER takes place without the two encoded proteins. However, either HHR23A or HHR23B activates XP-C for its required function in NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c14">14</xref>). Thus, Rad23 homologs in both <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and humans appear to play a role in NER as part of complexes with Rad4 homologs and other NER factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c9">9</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their well-established role in NER, some evidence suggests involvement of Rad23 homologs in other cellular processes. For example, only a fraction of HHR23B is complexed with XP-C and HHR23A is not found in a complex with XP-C in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c2">2</xref>), raising the possibility that these free forms function in processes other than NER. Since the UbL domain of Rad23 and HHR23A&#x0002f;B interacts with the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c15">15</xref>), Rad23 homologs are thought to participate in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c16">16</xref>). This possibility was supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with the human homologs and by studies of budding yeast strains with mutations in both <italic>rad23</italic> and <italic>rpn10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c17">17</xref>). Rad23 homologs may also be involved in cell cycle regulation since they are degraded during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c18">18</xref>), spindle pole body duplication is defective in a budding yeast strain with mutations in both <italic>rad23</italic> and <italic>dsk2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c19">19</xref>) and HHR23A interacts with the HIV-1 Vpr protein known to induce G<sub>2</sub> arrest in both human and fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c22">22</xref>).</p><p>To help better define these putative multiple functions of Rad23, we isolated and characterized the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> homolog. In addition to its expected role in NER, as indicated by the UV sensitivity of an <italic>rhp23</italic> deletion mutant, we find that <italic>S.pombe</italic> Rhp23 also plays a role in the cell cycle and the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome pathway. Moreover, the involvement of Rhp23 in cell cycle control seems to be a common feature of the Rad23 homologs, as both <italic>HHR23A</italic> and <italic>RAD23</italic> complement the cell cycle defect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and media</title><p>Genotypes and sources of <italic>S.pombe</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf120tb1">1</xref>.

The cDNA for this putative <italic>HHR23A</italic> homolog was amplified from a wild-type <italic>S.pombe</italic> SP223 cDNA library using PCR and cloned into the fission yeast expression vector pYZ1N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c25">25</xref>). Cloning of the cDNA was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire insert. As <italic>HHR23A</italic> is known to be a functional homolog of the budding yeast <italic>RAD23</italic> gene, the newly identified fission yeast gene was named <italic>rhp23</italic> (rad homolog of pombe 23; GenBank accession no.

Consistent with the sequence analysis found in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> database, the <italic>rhp23</italic> gene has four introns and encodes a protein containing 368 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of &#x0223c;41 kDa. Comparison of the predicted <italic>S.pombe</italic> Rhp23 protein sequence with sequences of 12 other Rad23 homologs isolated from various eukaryotes indicated a high degree of similarity (32&#x02013;45&#x00025; identical, 50&#x02013;63&#x00025; similar). Rhp23 also has the structural characteristics of HHR23A and other Rad23 homologs since a UbL domain at the N-terminus and two UBA domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c8">8</xref>) in the C-terminal portion are present (see Supplementary Material).</p></sec><sec><title>An <italic>rhp23</italic>::<italic>ura4</italic> mutation causes UV sensitivity</title><p>A <italic>rhp23</italic> deletion was created in <italic>S.pombe</italic> by replacing part of the <italic>rhp23</italic> gene with <italic>ura4</italic> using a PCR-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c33">33</xref>).

The <italic>rhp23</italic>::<italic>ura4</italic> strain was tested for resistance to UV as well as ionizing radiation and HU, the latter two of which induce DNA strand breaks and block DNA synthesis, respectively. In comparison to a <italic>S.pombe rad9-192</italic> strain, which is highly sensitive to UV light, ionizing radiation and HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c36">36</xref>), the <italic>rhp23</italic>::<italic>ura4</italic> strain is moderately sensitive to UV light but demonstrates near wild-type levels of resistance to the other agents, except possibly at very high doses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f1">1</xref>A&#x02013;C). This possible difference at high doses of ionizing radiation or HU may be due to strain differences between the wild-type and <italic>rhp23</italic>::<italic>ura4</italic> deletion strains since introducing the <italic>rhp23</italic> cDNA into mutant cells had no effect on sensitivity to ionizing radiation or HU. In contrast, the <italic>rhp23</italic> cDNA fully complements the UV sensitivity of the mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f1">1</xref>A). This pattern of sensitivity is consistent with Rhp23 playing a role in NER, as is found for Rad23 and HHR23B in budding yeast and human cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c14">14</xref>).

In contrast, even though some of the GFP&#x02013;Rhp23 fusion protein is present in the cytoplasm, most is located in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f4">4</xref>A, bottom). This predominantly nuclear localization is similar to that reported for budding yeast Rad23 and human HHR23A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c3">3</xref>).</p><p>The levels of both budding yeast Rad23 and human HHR23A are cell cycle dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c18">18</xref>). To determine whether Rhp23 levels are also cell cycle dependent, wild-type fission yeast SP223 cells were synchronized in S phase by treatment with HU for 4 h as described (http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.bio.uva.nl&#x0002f;pombe&#x0002f;handbook&#x0002f;section3&#x0002f;section3-3.html). After removing the drug, protein extracts were prepared every 30 min for up to 7 h to allow approximately two rounds of cell division. Progression through the cell cycle was monitored by the septation index, which measures the fraction of cells containing the septum that forms between dividing cells shortly after mitosis around the time of S phase in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c34">34</xref>). In the HU synchronized cultures, peaks of septation were found around 0, 2.5 and 5.5 h. The levels of Rhp23 protein, measured by immunoblot analysis and standardized to the levels of &#x003b1;-tubulin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f4">4</xref>B), oscillated with the cell cycle. Rhp23 abundance was lowest at 0, 2.5 and 5.5&#x02013;6 h, corresponding to S phase, and highest at 2 and 5 h, corresponding to passage through mitosis. Thus, the levels for all three Rad23 protein homologs are lowest near S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c18">18</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the cellular distribution of Rhp23 protein is cell cycle dependent, a GFP&#x02013;Rhp23 fusion was followed in live cells in a time series of fluorescent microscopy images.

In contrast, for the upper cell, in which the nucleus divided during the experiment, the amount of GFP&#x02013;Rhp23 in the nucleus decreased around the time of nuclear division. Thus, at about the time the lowest levels of Rhp23 are seen in a synchronous culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f4">4</xref>B), the amount of GFP&#x02013;Rhp23 in the nucleus decreases relative to the amount in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f4">4</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of <italic>rhp23</italic> induces a large increase in ubiquitinated proteins</title><p>The correlation of cell cycle phase with Rhp23 levels, and the presence of a UbL and two UBA domains in Rhp23, raises the possibility that the abundance of Rhp23 is regulated by ubiquitination and degradation. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>A shows that Rhp23 is ubiquitinated at low levels. Cell extracts from a wild-type (SP1208) and a <italic>mts2</italic> mutant strain (SP1212), which has a temperature-sensitive mutation in a subunit of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c41">41</xref>), were probed with anti-Rad23 antibodies. For cell extracts from the wild-type strain incubated at 25&#x000b0;C or incubated for 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C, only Rhp23 without added ubiquitin was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, in the <italic>mts2</italic> mutant strain, higher molecular weight ubiquitinated forms of Rhp23 were detectable at the permissive temperature of 25&#x000b0;C and increased amounts were seen at the restrictive temperature of 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4). The <italic>mts2</italic> mutation is in a subunit of the proteasome and inactivation of the proteasome at the restrictive temperature leads to accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c41">41</xref>). Thus, the detection of ubiquitinated forms of Rhp23 only in the <italic>mts2</italic> strain indicates that Rhp23 is ubiquitinated at a low level.</p><p>While ubiquitination of Rhp23 was being examined, we found that overexpression of <italic>rhp23</italic> leads to a large increase in the abundance of other ubiquitinated proteins. One of these experiments is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>B, where HA-tagged Rhp23 protein was used in an immunoprecipitation experiment. Equal amounts of extracts from cells with or without a plasmid carrying the HA&#x02013;<italic>rhp23</italic> fusion were used in an anti-HA immunoprecipitation and immunoprecipitated proteins were probed with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>B). Expression of HA&#x02013;Rhp23 in the pull-down extracts was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-Rad23 antibodies (bottom). No higher molecular weight forms of HA&#x02013;Rhp23 were seen in the immunoprecipitate with the anti-ubiquitin antibody, indicating that the levels of ubiquitinated HA&#x02013;Rhp23 in these extracts from wild-type cells are too low to be detected by this method. Interestingly, however, strong anti-ubiquitin signals were detected in the original extract from cells overproducing HA&#x02013;Rhp23 (lane 4) compared with those not synthesizing large amounts of this protein (lane 3). Thus, overproduction of HA&#x02013;Rhp23 leads to a large increase in ubiquitinated proteins even though ubiquitination of HA&#x02013;Rhp23 itself remains undetectable.</p><p>To confirm that overexpression of <italic>rhp23</italic> promotes ubiquitination of other cellular proteins, extracts from <italic>rhp23</italic>::<italic>ura4</italic> mutant cells overexpressing <italic>S.pombe rhp23</italic>, <italic>S.cerevisiae RAD23</italic>, human <italic>HHR23A</italic> or cells containing a pYZ1N vector control with no insert were probed with anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>C, left upper). Consistent with the results for HA&#x02013;Rhp23, much stronger anti-ubiquitin signals were detected throughout the lane only when the <italic>rhp23</italic> gene was induced &#x0005b;lane 1 compared to lanes 4 (uninduced) and 9 (induced vector control)&#x0005d;. A series of dilutions (lanes 1&#x02013;3) indicate that ubiquitinated protein abundance increases &#x0223c;10-fold when <italic>rhp23</italic> is overexpressed. This increased ubiquitination does not prevent colony formation on plates or growth in liquid media, but it may slow growth, since the doubling time after overexpression of <italic>rhp23</italic> increases to 5.2 h, compared with 2.8 h for a strain carrying only the vector. In contrast to the results with <italic>rhp23</italic>, no significant increase in anti-ubiquitin signals was observed when human <italic>HHR23A</italic> (lanes 7 and 8) or budding yeast <italic>RAD23</italic> was overexpressed (lanes 5 and 6), even though high levels of Rad23 were produced (bottom, lane 5). Thus, only overexpression of fission yeast <italic>rhp23</italic> leads to a large accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p><p>To determine whether the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is due to decreased rates of degradation, a cycloheximide (Chx) experiment was performed. This inhibitor prevents the synthesis of new proteins so that the stability of proteins can be observed. When Chx is added to cultures overexpressing <italic>rhp23</italic>, the amount of ubiquitinated proteins and of Rhp23 remains stable for 2 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>C, right), indicating that under these conditions they are not rapidly degraded. Since ubiquitinated proteins are ordinarily rapidly degraded through the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c4">4</xref>), this stability of the ubiquitinated proteins indicates that overexpression of <italic>rhp23</italic> most likely inhibits degradation of ubiquitinated proteins by the proteasome. Similar to the results from the immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>B, upper), no larger forms of Rhp23 are seen after overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>C, lower right), indicating that there is no detectable accumulation of ubiquitinated Rhp23. Thus, even though ubiquitination of Rhp23 itself remains undetectable, overproduction of Rhp23 leads to a large increase in ubiquitinated proteins, probably because proteasome activity is inhibited.</p></sec><sec><title>Rhp23 binds ubiquitin</title><p>The yeast two-hybrid system (ClonTech, CA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c42">42</xref>) was used to screen for proteins capable of interacting with Rhp23, and ubiquitin was the most frequently identified protein in this screen (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf120tb2">2</xref>). Starting with 10<sup>5</sup> transformants from a <italic>S.pombe</italic> cDNA library, 480 colonies were found to be his<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and to have &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity, indicating that the cDNA encoded a protein interacting with Rhp23.

All four of these genes give approximately the same signal in a plate assay for the strength of interaction in the two-hybrid system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f6">6</xref>A). The <italic>ubi1</italic>, <italic>ubi2</italic> and <italic>ubi3</italic> genes have not been characterized previously in fission yeast. The <italic>dph1</italic> gene, which is a fission yeast homolog of the budding yeast <italic>DSK2</italic> gene, encodes a protein with a UbL at the N-terminal end and a UBA domain at the C-terminal end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c43">43</xref>).

Protein sequence alignment of these four Rhp23-binding proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f6">6</xref>B) indicated that the only common feature is the ubiquitin sequence in the first 76 amino acids, suggesting that Rhp23 binds specifically to ubiquitin.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Fission yeast <italic>S.pombe</italic> Rhp23 plays a role in promoting resistance to UV light, most likely by participation in NER, since budding yeast Rad23 and human HHR23 function in this DNA repair pathway. A specific role for Rhp23 in NER is further supported by our observations that a <italic>rhp23</italic> deletion causes moderate UV sensitivity but does not affect resistance to HU or ionizing radiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f1">1</xref>). Indeed, an independent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c44">44</xref>) showed that fission yeast <italic>rhp23</italic> partially complements the NER defect in a budding yeast <italic>rad23</italic> deletion strain and that Rhp23 is required for both transcription-dependent and transcription-independent NER in fission yeast. We show here that <italic>RAD23</italic> and <italic>HHR23A</italic> also complement the UV sensitivity of a <italic>S.pombe rhp23</italic> mutant, although <italic>HHR23A</italic> needs to be expressed at high levels for full restoration of resistance to wild-type levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f2">2</xref>). This complementation provides further support for functional conservation of the Rad23 homologs with respect to NER. There are other similarities among these three Rad23 homologs in that all three show a nuclear localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f4">4</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c3">3</xref>), that the amounts of these proteins are cell cycle dependent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f4">4</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c18">18</xref>) and that they are ubiquitinated at low levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c18">18</xref>). These similarities suggest a high degree of functional conservation for Rad23 homologs.</p><p>Besides these similar properties of the Rad23 homologs, there is evidence that they may also play a role in cell cycle G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f3">3</xref>). However, <italic>S.pombe</italic> Rhp23 clearly differs from budding yeast Rad23 in its role in the cell cycle. <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> with a <italic>rhp23</italic> mutation shows a G<sub>2</sub> delay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f3">3</xref>). In contrast, <italic>S.cerevisiae rad23</italic> deletion mutants have a normal cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c19">19</xref>), although combinations of the <italic>rad23</italic> deletion with other mutations can affect the cell cycle in budding yeast (see below). A potential role for Rad23 in cell cycle control is suggested by our observation that <italic>RAD23</italic> partially complements the cell cycle defect in a <italic>rhp23</italic> mutant <italic>S.pombe</italic> strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f3">3</xref>B). Cells with mutations in <italic>RAD23</italic> homologs are available only in these two yeasts and no human cells with mutations in <italic>HHR23A</italic> or <italic>HHR23B</italic> have been reported, so the role of these genes in the human cell cycle cannot currently be determined directly. However, <italic>HHR23A</italic> fully complements the cell cycle defect of the <italic>S.pombe rhp23</italic> mutant even at low levels of expression, suggesting that <italic>HHR23A</italic> plays an equivalent role in the human cell cycle. Thus, complementation of the cell cycle defect in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> mutant strain by all of the Rad23 homologs suggests that they play a role in controlling the cell cycle of their respective organisms.</p><p>Rhp23 also plays a role in the ubiquitination&#x02013;proteasome pathway since overexpression leads to a large increase in the abundance of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>B and C). This increase in ubiquitinated proteins is most likely due to inhibition of proteasome activity since the level of ubiquitinated proteins is not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>C, right upper). There are two simple models based on the properties of Rad23 homologs that might explain the increase in ubiquitinated proteins. The first model is based on the binding of Rad23 homologs to ubiquitin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c45">45</xref>). By interacting with ubiquitin, Rhp23 may inhibit degradation through the proteasome, by preventing either the assembly of multi-ubiquitin chains, as suggested by Ortolan <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c17">17</xref>), or their recognition by the proteasome. While the ubiquitin-binding property of Rad23 homologs may be part of the reason for the increase in ubiquitinated proteins after <italic>rhp23</italic> overexpression, it seems unlikely to be a complete explanation, since overexpression of <italic>RAD23</italic> or <italic>HHR23A</italic> did not lead to an increase in ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f5">5</xref>C, left upper). The second model is based on an interaction between the proteasome and the UbL domain of Rad23 homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c46">46</xref>). If the interaction with Rhp23 inhibits proteasome activity and this interaction is species specific, this would explain why in fission yeast only overexpression of <italic>rhp23</italic> leads to an increase in ubiquitinated proteins. Clearly, further work is required to resolve the roles of ubiquitin binding and the UbL interaction with the proteasome in the increased ubiquitination seen after <italic>rhp23</italic> is overexpressed.</p><p>The relationships between the NER-, cell cycle- and ubiquitin&#x02013;proteolysis-related roles of Rad23 homologs remain to be clearly established, but their function in NER and the cell cycle are likely to be independent. First, the G<sub>2</sub> delay seen in the <italic>rhp23</italic> deletion is unique to this gene and is not characteristic of mutations in NER genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c9">9</xref>). Specifically, the <italic>rad9</italic> strain, which is much more sensitive to UV than the <italic>rhp23</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f1">1</xref>), does not show any unusually long cells (data not shown). Second, expression of <italic>HHR23A</italic> at a low level fully complements the cell cycle defect of the <italic>rhp23</italic> deletion strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f3">3</xref>) but complements UV sensitivity weakly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf120f2">2</xref>).</p><p>There are a number of reasons, however, to think that the roles of Rhp23 in the cell cycle and in ubiquitin&#x02013;proteolysis are related. One reason is that a double <italic>rad23 rpn10</italic> mutation in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (the latter gene encodes a subunit of the proteasome) caused a pronounced G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c16">16</xref>). Another double mutation combining alterations in <italic>rad23</italic> and <italic>dsk2</italic>, a gene that like <italic>RAD23</italic> homologs contains UbL and UBA domains, also causes a G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c19">19</xref>). Both of these double mutation combinations suggest that Rad23 plays a role in the cell cycle of budding yeast, but that this cell cycle function overlaps with activities of other budding yeast genes. Also, since the other gene (<italic>rpn10</italic> and <italic>dsk2</italic>) in both cases has some connection to the ubiquitination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c48">48</xref>), these results with budding yeast Rad23 suggest that the cell cycle function is related to the ubiquitination pathway. A second reason for thinking that the cell cycle and ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome functions of Rhp23 are related is that ubiquitination is known to have a number of roles in the cell cycle. For example, degradation of the cell cycle regulator Cdc25 through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis affects the cell cycle in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf120c41">41</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that the cell cycle and ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome functions of Rad23 homologs will turn out to be related in some way.</p><p>In summary, <italic>S.pombe rhp23</italic> has a role in NER but also functions in the cell cycle and the ubiquitination pathway. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD23</italic> and human <italic>HHR23A</italic> complement the UV sensitivity and cell cycle defects of the <italic>rhp23</italic> deletion mutant, suggesting that these are common features of Rad23 homologs. However, only overexpression of <italic>rhp23</italic> leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, indicating that some aspect of this effect is species specific. As <italic>S.pombe</italic> Rhp23 plays roles in NER, the cell cycle and ubiquitination, this organism serves as an excellent model system for defining the relationships and mechanisms underlying these multiple roles of Rad23 homologs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_30_2_581__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_30_2_581__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf120f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The <italic>rhp23</italic>::<italic>ura4</italic> mutant is sensitive to UV light but not ionizing radiation or HU.
