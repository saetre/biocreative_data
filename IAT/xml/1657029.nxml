Ninety percent of congenital NDI are linked to the X-chromosome and are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the arginine vasopressin type 2 receptor (AVPR2) gene. Since human AVPR2 gene was cloned successfully in 1992, more than 190 distinct disease-causing mutations in AVPR2 gene have been identified in X-linked congenital NDI families[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The mutations consist of missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, insertion, and deletion mutations. These mutations are not concentrated on one domain of the receptor, but are scattered throughout the protein, except for the part coding of the N- and C-terminal tails of the receptor. The phenomenon of so many mutations in AVPR2 gene in NDI patients indicates that this disease is highly heterogeneous at the molecular level. Among these mutations, the vast majority result in single amino acid substitutions (missense mutations) or receptor truncations caused by nonsense or frameshift mutations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition to these mutations, there were some reports describing the total deletion of the AVPR2 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], however, the precise identification of the breakpoints of the fragment deletion was done in only three reports[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we ascertained two patients suffering from congenital NDI in a Chinese family caused by a 5,995-bp genomic fragment deletion and 3-bp insertion at Xq28, and this deletion encompassed a complete loss of the AVPR2 gene and the last exon (exon 22) of the C1 gene, which is adjacent closely to the AVPR2 gene locus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The two patients in this Chinese NDI family showed normal statures, the proband (III-1) was 174 cm height and 80 kg weight, and his young cousin (III-2) was 170 cm height and 70 kg weight, respectively. Neither of them had any evidence of mental retardation or significant diseases other than NDI. All chemical laboratory tests were performed using standard clinical laboratory assays. The chemical laboratory tests including blood glucose, liver function, renal function, triglyceride, total cholesterol, blood electrolyte (potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus), coagulation parameters (prothrombin time, partial-throboplastin time) and hemotology (red blood cell count, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count) were all within reference range (data not shown). There were no abnormality of electrocardiographic measurements and no abnormality of pituitary by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations, and the ultrasonographic examinations of urinary system revealed that there were normalities in size and structure of kidney, ureter and urinary bladder.</p><p>Genomic DNAs from the NDI patients and the related family members were prepared and subjected to PCR amplification (five overlapping DNA segments) of the entire coding regions of AVPR2 gene (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_000054">NM_000054</ext-link>). PCRs with all five primer pairs within the AVPR2 locus yielded five specific fragments of the expected sizes (422 bp, 480 bp, 450 bp, 476 bp, and 470 bp) for the control subjects, the sequences of these five fragments were the same as those from GenBank (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, no corresponding PCR product yielded with these five primer pairs was observed in the two patients. In addition, we performed PCR for the PCK1 gene and detected the expected product in all NDI patients, indicating that PCR amplification was effective and reliable in every sample (data not shown) and the entire AVPR2 gene may be deleted in these two patients.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>PCR amplification of the coding region of the AVPR2 gene</bold>. Five specific fragments covering the AVPR2 gene were amplified (see Methods). One example of the different PCR products, which was emplified by the primer pair 1F/1R, is shown exemplarily. Only in the control subjects (I-1, I-2, II-1, II-2, II-3, II-4, II-5 and III-3) the specific fragments were detected.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-7-53-1"/></fig><p>In order to map the deletion breakpoint, we investigated the presence or absence of several different fragments around the AVPR2 locus step by step. In these two patients, with primer pair 7F/7R but not 6F/6R a PCR product was amplified, suggesting the 5' breakpoint in the region between primers 6R and 7R. Using the similar strategy, the 3' breakpoint was suspected to be located in region between sequences of primers 8F and 9F in the AVPR2 gene. The deletion junction was finally amplified with the primer pair 7F/9R, giving an approximately 1.1 kb PCR product. The 1.1 kb PCR product, which contained the deletion breakpoint, was then sequenced in both directions. The sequence alignment revealed that a genomic fragment of 5995-bp was deleted and three bases (GAG) were inserted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2-A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2-B</xref>). Therefore, the 5' breakpoint was located within intergenic region between L1CAM gene (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U52112">U52112</ext-link>) and AVPR2 gene, while the 3' breakpoint was located within intron 21 of the C1 gene (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_001666">NM_001666</ext-link>). The deletion region contained the entire AVPR2 gene and the part of the C1 gene from intron 21 to exon 22 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The sequence analysis of the deletion breakpoints in two patients</bold>.

Copy number variation is associated with many normal phenotypic variations and diseases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Most copy number variations involved diseases are originally found in Mendelian diseases. In the present study, we have identified a novel type mutation of 5,995-bp deletion and 3-bp insertion, which leaded to a complete loss of the AVPR2 gene and the last exon (exon 22) of the C1 gene, in an X-linked congenital NDI family.</p><p>The AVPR2 receptor, which is composed of 371 amino acids, consists of seven transmembrane domains, four extracellular domains and four cytoplasmic domains, and belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On binding to AVP, the receptor activates the Gs/adenylate cyclase, and this leads to increased level of the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The elevated cAMP activates protein kinase A and starts a phosphorylation cascade that promotes the translocation of the water channel, aquaporin 2, to the apical membrane of the renal tubules and collecting tubules. This results in increasing water resorption[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, the person will present polyuria if he has abnormal function or loss-of-function of AVPR2. In our study, the two patients suffered from NDI were caused by the complete deletion of AVPR2 gene. The cause of this genomic fragment deletion on chromosome may be the abundant repetitive DNA in the human genome, which is commonly suggested that microdeletions arise through mispairing of large duplicated sequences[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In our report, besides the entire loss of the AVPR2 gene, the last exon (exon 22) and part of intron 21 of the C1 gene were also deleted in these two patients. The C1 gene is in close proximity to the AVPR2 locus and is orientated in opposite direction to the reading frame of the AVPR2 gene. The C1 gene, being highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, encodes a protein that appears to represent a member of the increasingly large group of signaling proteins involved in regulation of small GTP binding proteins of ras superfamily[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Based on the domain and functional data, it is suggested that the protein encoded by C1 gene acts as a Rho-GTPase-activating protein (ARHGAP4)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], belonging to the large superfamily of GTPase-activating proteins. The genomic defect in the C1 gene in our study locates the C-terminal portion of ARHGAP4, which includes consensus sites of transcription termination (polyadenylation signals) and consensus sites for mRNA stability. This, at least theoretically, in a new C terminus due to a frameshift[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Consequently, it was reasonable to suppose that ARHGAP4 expression and function might be altered in these two patients. However, the two patients in our study did not present any major abnormalities besides clearly defined NDI symptoms caused by deletion of the entire AVPR2 gene. Their electrocardiographic measurements, various laboratory tests in clinical chemistry and hematology were repeatedly normal. Coagulation parameters were also within the reference ranges. These clinical data were similar to the patients described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The reason was postulated that the lack of ARHGAP4 function was most likely compensated by other members of the GAP family[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition to the mentioned above, the two patients in our study showed normal statures and intelligence and had normal size and structure in kidney, ureter and bladder, while one patient reported by Schoneberg T showed mental retardation, reducing reading and writing skills[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and the other patient reported by Schulz et al. presented an enlarged bladder and ureter dilatation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The difference between them might be associated with the degree of polyuria and hypernatremic dehydration.</p><p>As to the female carriers, they are usually phenotypically normal because of possessing two X chromosomes. However, approximately 1% of females heterozygous for an AVPR2 gene mutation may display variable degrees of polyuria and polydipsia, which has been explained by a preferential inactivation (skewing) of the X chromosome bearing the normal AVPR2 allele. Three heterozygote females in this kindred of NDI have no symptom of polyuria and polydipsia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified a novel type of 5,995-bp deletion and 3-bp (GAG) insertion at Xq28 in two Chinese patients with NDI, which including the complete loss of the AVPR2 gene and the last exon (exon 22) of the C1 gene, leading to NDI without other symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients Profile</title><p>The pedigree of this Chinese family with congenital NDI is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>.

Amplification reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 &#x003bc;l containing 0.3 &#x003bc;M of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 40 mM Tricine-KOH (pH 8.7 at 25&#x000b0;C), 15 mM KOAc, 3.5 mM Mg(Oac)<sub>2</sub>, 3.75 &#x003bc;g/ml BSA, 0.005% Tween 20, 0.005% Nonidet-P40, 5 &#x003bc;M of each primer, 80 ng of DNA and 1&#x000d7; advantage&#x02122; 2 Polymerase (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA). Cycling conditions were as follows: 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30s, 64&#x000b0;C for 40s and 68&#x000b0;C for 80 seconds, followed by 68&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Long-PCR products were purified by shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) and exonuclease I (Exon I)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and then sequenced in both directions on ABI 3700 DNA automated sequencer according to the Big-Dye chemistry reaction protocol (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YD participated in the design of the study and performed PCR, sequencing, data analysis and manuscript preparation.
