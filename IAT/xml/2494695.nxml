This effect was associated with the capacity of GW501516 to impede LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation.

Thus, models of diet-induced and genetic obesity show increased adipose tissue expression and content of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; &#x0005b;TNF-&#x003b1;&#x0005d;, interleukin &#x0005b;IL&#x0005d; 1, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 &#x0005b;MCP-1&#x0005d;, and IL-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Of these cytokines, IL-6 correlates most strongly with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>); its plasma levels are increased two- to threefold in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes compared with lean control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). At the cellular level, insulin resistance and enhanced expression of these cytokines by adipose tissue during obesity and also under a high-fat diet have been linked to activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). This nuclear factor is activated by surface proteins that recognize foreign substances, the so-called pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). This receptor is expressed on virtually all human cells and binds a wide spectrum of exogenous and endogenous ligands, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). In the presence of LPS, the TLR4 complex (including CD-14 and an accessory protein, MD-2), recruits the adaptor protein, myeloid differentiation factor-88, which in turn recruits IL-1 receptor&#x02013;associated kinase, leading to NF-&#x003ba;B activation and enhanced expression of several inflammatory mediators (including IL-6 and MCP-1). Of note, NF-&#x003ba;B activation by LPS requires mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)&#x02013;extracellular signal&#x02013;related kinase (ERK)1/2 (MEK1/2) activation, because inhibition of this pathway reduces LPS-induced cytokine production in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that inflammatory processes induced by obesity and high-fat diet cause systemic insulin resistance via a mechanism involving TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). For instance, saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) activate TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling in adipocytes and macrophages, and this effect is blunted in the absence of this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). These observations indicate that enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis observed in insulin-resistant states may release the endogenous ligand for TLR4 to induce inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). In addition, it has been demonstrated that high-fat diets augment plasma LPS to a concentration sufficient to increase body weight, fasting glycemia and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Furthermore, LPS receptor&#x02013;deleted mice (CD14 mutants) are hypersensitive to insulin, and the development of insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes in this animal model is delayed in response to a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor &#x003b2;/&#x003b4; (PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;) activation has been proposed as a potential treatment for insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). PPARs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. They form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and bind to consensus DNA sites composed of direct repeats of hexameric DNA sequences separated by 1 bp (DR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Ligand binding induces a conformational change in PPAR-RXR complexes, thereby releasing corepressors in exchange for coactivators, which leads to the recruitment of the basal transcription machinery and enhanced gene expression. In addition, PPARs may suppress inflammation through diverse mechanisms, such as reduced release of inflammatory factors or stabilization of repressive complexes at inflammatory gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Of the three PPAR isotypes found in mammals, PPAR&#x003b1; (NR1C1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>) and PPAR&#x003b3; (NR1C3) are the targets for hypolipidemic (fibrates) and antidiabetic (thiazolidinediones) drugs, respectively. Finally, activation of the third isotype, PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; (NR1C2) by high-affinity ligands (including GW501516) enhances fatty acid catabolism in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, thereby delaying weight gain (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). However, there is no information available on whether PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; ligands prevent inflammation in adipocytes. Here, we examined whether PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activation by GW501516 prevents LPS-induced inflammation in adipocytes. We found that this drug prevented LPS-induced IL-6 expression and secretion by adipocytes. This effect was associated with the capacity of the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; ligand to prevent LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Consistent with the role of PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; in blocking NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;induced IL-6 expression, a genetic model of obesity and insulin resistance, the ZDF rat, showed reduced PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; expression and DNA-binding activity and enhanced IL-6 expression and NF-&#x003ba;B DNA-binding activity in white adipose tissue. Likewise, IL-6 expression and NF-&#x003ba;B DNA-binding activity was higher in this tissue in PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;-null mice than in wild-type mice. Because MEK1/2 is involved in NF-&#x003ba;B activation in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>), we explored whether PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; blocked NF-&#x003ba;B activation by inhibiting this pathway. In agreement with this possibility, GW501516 prevented ERK1/2 phosphorylation by LPS. In contrast, animal models showing increased NF-&#x003ba;B activity in white adipose tissue, the ZDF rat and the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;-null mice, showed enhanced phospho-ERK1/2 levels. Overall, on the basis of our findings, we propose that PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activation be considered a molecular target to prevent inflammation of adipose tissue and the metabolic alterations associated with this process, such as insulin resistance.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; ligand GW501516 was from Biomol Research Labs (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

Therefore, we selected this longer exposure to the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; ligand in further experiments. No changes were observed either in the expression of well-known PPAR&#x003b3;-target genes (i.e., <italic>Ob</italic>: data not shown), confirming that the drug treatment was selective for PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;, or in the expression of markers of adipocyte differentiation (i.e., Pref-1; data not shown), indicating that this latter process was unaffected. After a 96 h-incubation with GW501516, cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml LPS for 24 h to induce inflammation. LPS activates NF-&#x003ba;B through TLRs in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>) and induces insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). When we evaluated the mRNA levels of <italic>Mcp-1</italic> and IL-6, two genes that are under the control of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B, we observed that LPS treatment strongly increased the former (22-fold induction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), whereas cells co-incubated with GW501516 showed a significant reduction (51&#x00025; reduction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 vs. LPS-exposed cells) (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Furthermore, when LPS-exposed cells were co-incubated with 10 &#x003bc;mol/l parthenolide, which specifically inhibits the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>), the effect of LPS was suppressed. Treatment with LPS also led to enhanced IL-6 mRNA levels (4.2-fold induction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), but this increase was blocked in the presence of GW501516 and parthenolide (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Likewise, incubation with LPS for 24 h caused a 4.2-fold increase in the levels of IL-6 protein secreted into the culture media (control 10.5 &#x000b1; 3.7 vs. LPS 55 &#x000b1; 11 ng/ml; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>), whereas pretreatment with GW501516 (56&#x00025; reduction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and parthenolide (32&#x00025; reduction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) significantly reduced the secretion of this cytokine. Several cytokines, including IL-6, stimulate <italic>Socs-3</italic> expression in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>), a protein that inhibits insulin signaling in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). The elevated levels of mRNA encoding <italic>Socs-3</italic> and the increase in Stat-3 phosphorylation (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>) suggested that the increase in IL-6 release caused by LPS treatment might have local actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Interestingly, GW501516 treatment prevented the increase in Socs-3 expression and Stat-3 phosphorylation, a fact that is consistent with the reduction in IL-6 levels after drug treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activation prevents LPS-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</title><p>Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B plays a crucial role in IL-6 production in adipocytes, as demonstrated by the effects of parthenolide. To test whether GW501516 prevented LPS-induced IL-6 expression by reducing NF-&#x003ba;B activity, we performed EMSA. NF-&#x003ba;B formed three complexes with nuclear proteins (complexes I&#x02013;III) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). The specificity of the three DNA-binding complexes was assessed in competition experiments by adding an excess of unlabeled NF-&#x003ba;B oligonucleotide. NF-&#x003ba;B binding activity, mainly of specific complex II, increased in nuclear extracts from LPS-treated cells (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, in the presence of LPS and the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; ligand, the binding activity of NF-&#x003ba;B was reduced (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Addition of antibody against the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B completely supershifted complex II, thereby indicating that this band comprised mainly this subunit (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activity and enhanced IL-6 expression in white adipose tissue of an animal model of obesity and insulin resistance.</title><p>We hypothesized that a reduction in PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activity and the consequent increase in NF-&#x003ba;B activity is responsible, at least in part, for the enhanced expression of IL-6 in white adipose tissue of animal models of obesity and insulin resistance. To check this hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; and its activity in white adipose tissue of ZDF (<italic>fa/fa</italic>) rats. Male ZDF and lean rats were killed at 12 weeks of age. By this age, ZDF rats presented established diabetes compared with lean animals, as demonstrated by increased plasma levels of glucose (505 &#x000b1; 67 vs. 167 &#x000b1; 37 mg/dl, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), triglycerides (649 &#x000b1; 298 vs. 92 &#x000b1; 31 mg/dl, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), nonesterified fatty acids (0.62 &#x000b1; 0.17 vs. 0.26 &#x000b1; 0.09 mEq/l, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and insulin (19.3 &#x000b1; 7.9 vs. 10.4 &#x000b1; 2.0 ng/ml, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). White adipose tissue of ZDF rats showed a significant reduction in <italic>Ppar&#x003b2;/</italic>&#x003b4; transcripts (50&#x00025; reduction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similarly, the mRNA levels of its target gene, <italic>Pdk4</italic>, were also reduced (41&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), suggesting that the activity of this PPAR isotype was reduced. In contrast, the expression of IL-6 was significantly enhanced (60&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). EMSA showed that the DNA-binding activity of PPAR was reduced in white adipose tissue from ZDF rats compared with lean animals (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). In contrast, NF-&#x003ba;B DNA-binding activity was increased in ZDF rats compared with lean animals (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>). These data suggest that the low-grade chronic systemic inflammatory associated with the development of obesity and insulin resistance involves a decreased PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activity and the subsequent activation of NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>To clearly demonstrate the involvement of PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; in the control of NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated <italic>Il-6</italic> expression in white adipose tissue, we used the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;-null mice. The absence of <italic>Ppar&#x003b2;/</italic>&#x003b4; in white adipose tissue (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>) was associated with a reduction in the mRNA levels of <italic>Pdk4</italic> (65&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>) compared with wild-type mice, whereas IL-6 expression was enhanced (fourfold induction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). In agreement with the enhanced expression of IL-6 in white adipose tissue of PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;-null mice, NF-&#x003ba;B binding activity was higher in this tissue compared with that of wild-type mice (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; regulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in adipocytes.</title><p>Next, we attempted to determine the molecular mechanism by which PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activation inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B. Although it has been reported that PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activation prevents LPS-induced degradation of inhibitor of &#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;), thus suppressing LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>), we did not observe changes in the protein levels of this NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor (data not shown) after GW501516 treatment. On the other hand, ERK1/2 activation leads to NF-&#x003ba;B activation in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, the adipose tissue of ZDF rats showed enhanced phospho-ERK1/2 levels in the adipose tissue of ZDF rats compared with lean rats (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). This observation supports a potential relationship between activation of ERK1/2 and NF-&#x003ba;B. To demonstrate the involvement of the ERK-MAPK cascade in LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation in adipocytes, we used U0126, a potent and specific ERK1/2 inhibitor, which binds to MEK, thereby inhibiting its catalytic activity and phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Cells exposed to LPS showed increased mRNA levels of both <italic>Mcp-1</italic> (31-fold induction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and IL-6 (fourfold induction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas co-incubation with U0126 caused a 35&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and 72&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) reduction in the LPS-mediated induction of these two genes, respectively (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). As a control, we verified that U0126 treatment inhibited LPS-induced ERK1/2 activation (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>Finally, we examined whether the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; ligand prevented LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation by reducing ERK1/2 phosphorylation in adipocytes. Immunoblotting detection of total and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>E</italic></xref>) revealed that LPS treatment activated this pathway, whereas in the presence of the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; agonist, this pathway was blocked. These observations suggest that activation of this transcription factor prevents NF-&#x003ba;B activation by inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation. To demonstrate that PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; regulates the ERK1/2 pathway, we explored the expression of this kinase in adipose tissue of the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;-null mice. These mice showed enhanced phospho-ERK1/2 protein levels compared with wild-type mice (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>F</italic></xref>), indicating that PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; regulates this pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes are closely associated with low grade of chronic inflammation characterized by abnormal cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). The adipocyte plays a crucial role in this process, because this cell is a source of cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and MCP-1), which are secreted as a result of the activation of several signaling cascades involved in obesity-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). A number of studies have implicated chronic activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B as one of these signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>) that links inflammation with obesity and type-2 diabetes. For instance, overexpression of the NF-&#x003ba;B activator IKK&#x003b2; in mice results in increased inflammatory cytokine production and the onset of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). Furthermore, in human adipose tissue, inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B suppresses the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B can be achieved by either LPS or FFAs through TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). Several studies have proposed that LPS participates in initiating the subclinical inflammation observed in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Thus, circulating LPS levels are higher in type 2 diabetic patients than in lean healthy subjects, and LPS stimulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate for the first time that PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activation in adipocytes inhibits LPS-induced cytokine expression and secretion by preventing NF-&#x003ba;B activation. We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>) have previously proposed that PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activation inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B activation in cardiac cells either by promoting a protein-protein interaction between PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; and the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B or by increasing the expression levels of the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. In adipocytes, we did not observe changes either in the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;-p65 interaction (data not shown) or in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; protein levels after GW501516 treatment. These observations suggest that these mechanisms are not involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of this drug in adipocytes. In contrast, it has been previously reported that ERK1/2 activation is crucial for the induction of inflammatory changes in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>) and leads to enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). In agreement with this role of ERK1/2 in inflammation in adipocytes, we observed a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in these cells when exposed to LPS in the presence of the MAPK pathway inhibitor, U0126. This finding is consistent with previous studies reporting reduced cytokine expression levels in the presence of this inhibitor in human adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). These data demonstrate that ERK1/2 inhibition prevents NF-&#x003ba;B activation and the subsequent increase in cytokine expression. In addition, we demonstrate that PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activation inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is consistent with the reduction in NF-&#x003ba;B activation after GW501516 treatment. Furthermore, the increase in phospho-ERK1/2 levels observed in white adipose tissue from PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;-null mice is consistent with enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B activity. The involvement of PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; in ERK1/2 regulation has been previously reported in other cell types. In fact, Burdick et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>) recently reported that the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; agonist GW0742 reduces phospho-ERK1/2 levels in human keratinocytes. In addition, phospho-ERK1/2 levels are higher in the skin of PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;-null mice treated with 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate than in the skin of wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). Overall, these data confirm that PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; regulates phospho-ERK1/2 levels in several tissues. Additional studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; controls ERK-1/2 activation.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate a correlation between enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation in the white adipose tissue of a genetic model of obesity and diabetes, the ZDF rat. Given the low level of Ppar&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; in the white adipose tissue of these animals, we hypothesize that a decrease in the expression of this nuclear receptor is one of the underlying mechanisms of this correlation. On the basis of our data, we propose that in this animal model, PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; downregulation leads to enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which in turn activates NF-&#x003ba;B in white adipose tissue and, as a result, induces pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that white adipose tissue from the PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;-null mice shows increased phospho-ERK1/2 levels and NF-&#x003ba;B activity and higher expression of IL-6 compared with wild-type mice. Although further studies are required to demonstrate this relationship between PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; and NF-&#x003ba;B in white adipose tissue, our data provide further insight into the role of obesity-related insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation.</p><p>In summary, on the basis of our findings in adipocytes, we propose that PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; activation prevents LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation via ERK1/2, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the development of insulin resistance. This action of PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; may contribute to preventing obesity-induced insulin resistance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>R.R.-C. has received a grant from the Fundaci&#x000f3;n Ram&#x000f3;n Areces.
