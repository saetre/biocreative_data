PPAR&#x003b3; has been identified as a potential target for breast cancer therapy based on the fact that its activation by synthetic ligands affects the differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of cancer cells. However, the controversial nature of current studies and disappointing results from clinical trials raise questions about the contribution of PPAR&#x003b3; signaling in breast cancer development in the absence of stimulation by exogenous ligands. Recent reports from both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies are inconsistent and suggest that endogenous activation of PPAR&#x003b3; plays a much more complex role in initiation and progression of cancer than previously thought.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that an increase in expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells is driven by a tumor-specific promoter. Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) was identified as a transcriptional mediator of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression in these cells. In this study, using RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression directly or via down-regulation of MAZ, we report for the first time that a decrease in PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression results in reduced cellular proliferation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these changes in proliferation are associated with a significant decrease in cell transition from G<sub>1 </sub>to the S phase. Using a dominant-negative mutant of PPAR&#x003b3;1, &#x00394;462, we confirmed that PPAR&#x003b3;1 acts as a pro-survival factor and showed that this phenomenon is not limited to MCF-7 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression leads to an induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, confirmed by analyzing Bcl-2 expression and PARP-1 cleavage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Thus, these findings suggest that an increase in PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling observed in breast cancer contributes to an imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis, and may be an important hallmark of breast tumorigenesis.

Despite of the fact that recent research efforts have significantly improved the outcome of breast cancer, the complexity and heterogeneity of this disease still urges the necessity to explore new and more specific drug targets. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x003b3;), a member of the nuclear-hormone receptor family, has shown potential as a therapeutic target for prevention and treatment of breast cancer. PPAR&#x003b3; is a ligand-activated transcription factor. There are two isoforms of PPAR&#x003b3; protein, PPAR&#x003b3;1 and PPAR&#x003b3;2, the latter of which has the addition of 30 N'-terminal amino acids as a result of the usage of a different promoter and alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. PPAR&#x003b3; plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation, insulin sensitivity, energy metabolism, immune response, and the development of the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is predominantly expressed in adipose tissues; although, it is also detected in various tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscle, intestine, vascular smooth muscle, lung, breast, colon, and prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Some polyunsaturated fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and arachidonic acid metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] are considered to be the natural ligands of PPAR&#x003b3;. Synthetic ligands of PPAR&#x003b3; include the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic drugs (TZDs) such as rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, troglitazone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and non-thiazolidinedione tyrosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, a ligand-independent mechanism of PPAR&#x003b3; activation has also been observed due to altered phosphorylation status of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Recently, PPAR&#x003b3; has emerged as a promising target for cancer therapy based on the fact that its activation by synthetic ligands such as TZDs have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and differentiation in many human malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated that PPAR&#x003b3; activation by agonists can promote growth inhibition and apoptosis in both primary and metastatic breast malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition to the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects, PPAR&#x003b3; ligands have also been reported to inhibit invasion and metastasis of human breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, these results were questioned by several studies that demonstrated the ability of PPAR&#x003b3; ligands to elicit anti-tumor effects via PPAR&#x003b3;-independent pathways and in the absence of PPAR&#x003b3; receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Moreover, there is a debate that the concentrations of PPAR&#x003b3; ligands used in many studies are above the saturation level of the receptor. In fact, Roziglitazone, a widely studied PPAR&#x003b3; agonist, has shown to induce opposing effects when used in low versus high doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, PPAR&#x003b3; antagonists have also shown anticancer effects in a wide range of epithelial cancer cell lines, usually with greater potency than agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Existing data from <italic>in vivo </italic>studies is also controversial. Recent animal studies have demonstrated that PPAR&#x003b3; agonists can prevent mammary carcinogenesis and reduce the development of tumors in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In contrast, another study has demonstrated an increase in the number of tumors when PPAR&#x003b3; ligand was administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To clarify the controversy arising from the use of pharmacological approaches, several animal studies utilized techniques that allowed evaluation of the consequences of PPAR&#x003b3; transactivation in breast cancer independent of exogenous stimulation. Studies which employed a genetic approach to explore the intrinsic role of PPAR&#x003b3; signaling have demonstrated that an increase in PPAR&#x003b3; signaling accelerates mammary gland tumor development and constitutive over-expression of PPAR&#x003b3; increases incidence of breast cancer in mice already susceptible to the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This group has also shown that mice heterozygous for a null PPAR&#x003b3; mutation develop tumors with the same kinetics as those that carry two functional copies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, the ablation of PPAR&#x003b3; expression in the mouse mammary gland using a Cre- Lox recombination system has demonstrated that no tumors developed in mammary glands lacking PPAR&#x003b3; suggesting that PPAR&#x003b3; is not a tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In summary, these observations suggest that reduced PPAR&#x003b3; expression does not contribute to the initiation of breast cancer; however, acceleration of PPAR&#x003b3; signaling after tumor initiation markedly promotes breast cancer development.</p><p>In this study, we have begun to elucidate the functional significance of endogenous PPAR&#x003b3; activation in breast cancer using an <italic>in vitro </italic>model. We have previously reported that PPAR&#x003b3;1, not PPAR&#x003b3;2, is expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our lab and others have also demonstrated that the level of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression is significantly higher in breast cancer cell lines as compared to normal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition, we have shown that a distinct promoter regulates PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression in MCF-7 cells and that <italic>promoter switching </italic>mediates differential PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression levels between normal and cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) has been identified as a transcriptional mediator of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in MCF-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. MAZ is a transcriptional factor that controls the expression of various genes through interactions between GC-rich DNA binding sites within the promoter sequence of target genes and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger motifs of MAZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that an increase in expression and endogenous transactivation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells enhances cell proliferation by accelerating cell transition from G<sub>1 </sub>to the S phase. This data was confirmed using a dominant-negative PPAR&#x003b3;1 mutant as an alternative approach to inhibit endogenous activity of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in two different cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D. We also found that in the absence of exogenous stimulation high expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 significantly inhibits apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PPAR&#x003b3;1 is highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines</title><p>Our previous studies revealed that MAZ is a critical transcriptional regulator of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We also showed that both PPAR&#x003b3;1 and MAZ are highly expressed in MCF-7 cells as compared to normal mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) and tumor-specific expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 is MAZ dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. To evaluate expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 within other breast cancer cell lines, whole cell lysates from a panel of eight different breast cancer cell lines originated from heterogeneous tumors (ranging from adenocarcinoma to metastatic ductal carcinoma) were examined by Western blot analysis. HMEC cells were used as a control. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> shows the representative immunoblot for PPAR&#x003b3;1. To demonstrate the reproducibility of these data, statistical analysis of three Western blots was performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The results showed that PPAR&#x003b3;1 is expressed at significantly higher level in cancer cell lines as compared to HMEC.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>PPAR&#x003b3;1 is over-expressed in various breast cancer cell lines as compared to HMEC</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

The mechanism of PPAR&#x003b3;1 activation during cancer development and the functional role of this event in tumorigenesis still remain unclear. To address these questions and elucidate the role of PPAR&#x003b3;1 activation in cancer, we utilized the advantages of shRNA techniques. A set of five shRNAs for each of PPAR&#x003b3; or MAZ gene was purchased from The RNAi Consortium (TRC). Each shRNA was evaluated using Western blot analysis (data is not shown). The most efficient shRNA for each gene was chosen for further investigation. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with PPAR&#x003b3; and MAZ shRNAs, as well as with a scrambled shRNA as control. MCF-7 cells treated only with the transfection reagent were also used as a control. To evaluate the specificity of shRNAs to their target genes and the extent of PPAR&#x003b3;1 down-regulation when either PPAR&#x003b3; or MAZ shRNA were applied to MCF-7 cells, Real-time PCR, Western blot analysis and Luciferase assay were performed. Real-time PCR data revealed that both PPAR&#x003b3; and MAZ shRNAs are highly specific to their targets and their application to the cells leads to a significant decrease in PPAR&#x003b3;1 or MAZ mRNA levels respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We also tested whether the observed changes in PPAR&#x003b3;1 or MAZ mRNA lead to changes in PPAR&#x003b3;1 protein expression. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> shows the representative immunoblot for PPAR&#x003b3;1 and demonstrates the level of PPAR&#x003b3;1 down-regulation by both PPAR&#x003b3; and MAZ shRNAs as compared to controls. The statistical evaluation of three different Western blots showed that the direct inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3;1 by PPAR&#x003b3; shRNA resulted in an average 50 percent decrease in PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression. A lower level of inhibition was observed when PPAR&#x003b3;1 knocked-down was achieved via down-regulation of MAZ expression. This was anticipated since we believe transcription factors other than MAZ are involved in regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in cancer cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of PPAR&#x003b3; and MAZ shRNAs applications on down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression and activity in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

To confirm that shRNAs-mediated down-regulation not only affects expression but also activity of PPAR&#x003b3;1, a PPRE functional response was measured. MCF-7 cells were transfected with a 3XPPRE-mTK-pGL3 reporter plasmid and then co-transfected with scrambled, PPAR&#x003b3;, or MAZ shRNA expression plasmids. Following transfection, cells were treated with 10 &#x003bc;M Rosiglitazone (Rosi), a well known PPAR&#x003b3; agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Cells were lysed 24 hours after the second transfection and a Luciferase assay was performed. Data demonstrated that direct down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression by PPAR&#x003b3; shRNA led to a significant decrease in PPRE-mediated reporter activity in both Rosi treated and untreated MCF-7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This confirms that PPAR&#x003b3; shRNA is specific and efficient for the inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression and activity. Moreover, the fact that PPRE activity falls below the control level when PPAR&#x003b3; shRNA is applied to the cells is additional evidence for endogenous transactivation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in breast cancer cells. Although we observed a decrease in reporter activation when MAZ shRNA was transfected to the cells, these changes were not statistically significant, suggesting the complexity of PPAR&#x003b3; transcriptional regulation and that the knock-down of MAZ seen in transient transfection assays is not sufficient to block PPRE-mediated reporter activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression by PPAR&#x003b3; or MAZ shRNA decreases proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells</title><p>Since one of the most important characteristics of tumor development is enhanced cell growth, we tested whether inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression affects cellular proliferation in breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with scrambled, PPAR&#x003b3;, or MAZ shRNA and the rate of BrdU incorporation during DNA synthesis was assessed by using the BrdU proliferation assay (Roche). The results revealed that down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 by both PPAR&#x003b3; and MAZ shRNAs significantly decreased cellular proliferation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). To confirm these results, we used a different approach to inhibit endogenous activity of PPAR&#x003b3;1. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with a vector driving the expression of a dominant-negative mutant of PPAR&#x003b3;, &#x00394;462, or an empty vector as control, and then a BrdU proliferation assay was performed. Inhibition of endogenous PPAR&#x003b3;1 activity using the &#x00394;462 mutant caused a decrease in cellular proliferation in MCF-7 cancer cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). To test whether endogenous activation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 plays a similar role in other types of breast cancer cells, the same experiment was performed using the breast cancer cell line, T47D. The level of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression in this cell line was evaluated using Western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). T47D cancer cells were transiently transfected with either a control vector or a &#x00394;462 expression vector and then a BrdU proliferation assay was performed. Inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3;1 activity in these cells also led to a significant decrease in cellular proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). To confirm that the observed changes in cellular proliferation in both MCF-7 and T47D cell lines are indeed in response to the inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3;1 activity in a dominant-negative manner by &#x00394;462, a Luciferase assay was performed. Cells were transfected with 3XPPRE-mTK-pGL3 reporter plasmid and then co-transfected with control or &#x00394;462 expression plasmids. Following transfection, cells were treated with 10 &#x003bc;M Rosi. In Rosi treated and untreated cells, application of a &#x00394;462 mutant resulted in a significantly lower level of PPRE-mediated reporter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), thus, demonstrating that &#x00394;462 efficiently inhibits endogenous activity of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in MCF-7 and T47D cancer cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Decreased PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression is associated with a less proliferative phenotype for MCF-7 cells</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Approximately 25 percent fewer cells entered the S-phase when PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression was suppressed directly or indirectly. This is consistent with data from the BrdU proliferation assay. Therefore, these results confirm our hypothesis and demonstrate that an increase in PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression and its endogenous transactivation play an important functional role in promoting cellular proliferation in breast cancer cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 or expression of MAZ prevents S-phase entry in MCF-7 breast cancer cells</bold>.

MCF-7 cells were transfected with scrambled, PPAR&#x003b3;, or MAZ shRNA using the same transfection protocol and time points as for the proliferation assay, FACS, and protein analysis. The results showed no significant difference in necrotic cell death between PPAR&#x003b3; knock-down and control cells (data not shown). However, inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression in MCF-7 cells using PPAR&#x003b3; or MAZ shRNA resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis as compared to control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Interestingly, changes caused by down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 directly by using PPAR&#x003b3; shRNA were more dramatic than through knock-down of MAZ. This suggests that MAZ probably contributes to regulation of apoptosis mostly through its mediation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling in cancer cells. To confirm that down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression induces apoptosis, the expression of Bcl2, an anti-apoptotic protein, which has been shown to promote the survival of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] was evaluated. Statistical analysis of densitometry for four Western blots demonstrated that Bcl2 expression was significantly higher in control and MCF-7 cells transfected with scrambled shRNA versus cells transfected with PPAR&#x003b3; or MAZ shRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). We also assessed changes in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, PARP-1, cleavage in cells transfected with PPAR&#x003b3; or MAZ shRNA as compared to controls. PARP-1 cleavage by caspases is a well-known marker for apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Statistical evaluation of densitometry for three Western blots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) showed a significant increase in an 89 kDa C-terminal fragment, the product of PARP-1 proteolysis, when PPAR&#x003b3; shRNA was applied to MCF-7 cells. This data suggests that an increase in PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression followed by transactivation during cancer development may be an important factor that contributes not only to acceleration of cellular proliferation but also to cell evasion from apoptosis.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 increases apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

High expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 has also been reported in human breast cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However, questions about the mechanism and role of endogenous transactivation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 during development of breast cancer still remain unanswered. We have previously shown that the increase in expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 from normal human mammary epithelia to breast cancer is due to the recruitment of a distal, tumor-specific promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We identified MAZ as a transcription factor that directly binds to this promoter and drives expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our results also indicated that MAZ is highly expressed in MCF-7 cells as compared to HMEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In this study, statistical analysis of three different Western Blots demonstrated an increase in PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression in a panel of different breast cancer lines and confirmed that it is a feature attributed not only to MCF-7 cells but also to other tested breast cancer cell lines. This observation suggests that the proposed model of endogenous PPAR&#x003b3;1 transactivation may apply not only to a particular cell line, but also to breast cancer in general. Currently this hypothesis is being tested in the lab using pathological sections from normal and breast cancer specimens.</p><p>In efforts to explore the role of PPAR&#x003b3; activation in cancer, most of the recent studies employed pharmacological approaches. The anti-cancer activity of PPAR&#x003b3; ligands, such as TZDs, demonstrated in multiple <italic>in vitro </italic>studies, has raised discussion about the possibility of using PPAR&#x003b3; receptors as a target for breast cancer therapy. However, the "off target" effects of PPAR&#x003b3; agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], the dual role that some ligands play when they are applied to the cells at different concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and the paradoxical anti-cancer effect of PPAR&#x003b3; antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] necessitated the use of other approaches to evaluate the consequences of PPAR&#x003b3; transactivation in cancer. For the first time, using an <italic>in vitro </italic>model, we have addressed questions about the role that endogenous transactivation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 plays in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Using RNAi techniques to inhibit PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression we demonstrated that an increase in PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling can significantly affect proliferation and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. It is widely accepted that the dysfunctional balance between cellular proliferation and apoptosis can contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. Here, we demonstrated that down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1, directly or indirectly via knock-down of its transcriptional regulator MAZ, leads to a decrease in cellular proliferation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Interestingly, changes in cellular proliferation caused by direct PPAR&#x003b3;1 inhibition by PPAR&#x003b3; shRNA were analogous to changes in PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression when inhibited via down-regulation of MAZ. This suggests that in addition to its role as a mediator of tumor-specific expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1, MAZ may also be involved in the regulation of other growth control genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The ongoing project in our lab is to further investigate the role of MAZ in breast cancer development.</p><p>The observed pro-survival effect of PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling in MCF-7 cancer cells was also confirmed by using a different approach to inhibit endogenous activity of PPAR&#x003b3;1. We took advantage of a PPAR&#x003b3;1 mutant, &#x00394;462, which lacks helix12, critical for ligand binding and co-activators recruitment. Thus, &#x00394;462 functions in a dominant-negative manner. Data from BrdU proliferation assays demonstrated that inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3;1 activity using &#x00394;462 decreases cell proliferation not only in MCF-7 cells but in another widely studied breast cancer cell line, T47D. In our previous study, we have shown that the T47D cell line also has a functional peroxisomal response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Here, using Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that T47D cancer cells as well as MCF-7cells have high level of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression as compared to HMEC. However, the direct comparison of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression in MCF-7 and T47D cells showed the lower level of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in a latter cell line. The differential expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in these cell lines can explain the more prominent changes in cellular proliferation in MCF-7 cells compare to T47D cells when &#x00394;462 are applied to the cells. The specificity of &#x00394;462 in the inhibition of endogenous PPAR&#x003b3;1 activity was confirmed using Luciferase assay. We measured PPRE-mediated reporter activity when either MCF-7 or T47D cells were transfected with &#x00394;462 or control plasmids and then treated with10 &#x003bc;M Rosi. Data revealed that PPRE reporter activity is significantly lower in cells transfected with the &#x00394;462 expression plasmid compared to control, thus, providing the evidence that this mutant acts in dominant-negative manner, decreasing activity of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in MCF-7 and T47D cancer cells. Moreover, a similar effect was observed with Rosi, confirming the specificity of &#x00394;462 action in these cell lines. In summary, these results suggest that PPAR&#x003b3;1 transactivation enhances cell growth in breast cancer cells and that this phenomenon is not specific to MCF-7 cells.</p><p>To further investigate the mechanism by which PPAR&#x003b3;1 regulates cell growth, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cell cycle distribution analysis confirmed results from the BrdU proliferation assay and demonstrated that an increase in PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling accelerates the transition of cells from G<sub>1</sub>-phase to S-phase and, thus, increases cellular proliferation.</p><p>Blockage of apoptosis is a likely requirement for cancer maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In fact, FACS analysis revealed that the number of cells which undergo apoptosis is much higher in MCF-7 cells with decreased PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression. This observation was tested and confirmed by measuring DNA fragmentation in control and PPAR&#x003b3; or MAZ shRNA transfected cells. The data demonstrated that down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression in MCF-7 cells leads to a significant increase in apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis in cells with PPAR&#x003b3;1 or MAZ knockdown was also confirmed by analyzing the expression of Bcl2, a protein that is known to block cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and by evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, a widely accepted marker for apoptosis. The results showed that inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3;1 leads to down-regulation of Bcl2 which may in turn favor re-activation of signaling pathways to induce apoptosis. The increase in PARP-1 cleavage in MCF-7 cells, which have a decreased level of PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression, verified the induction of apoptosis as well. Together these results suggest that accelerated PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling can interfere with apoptotic pathways and promote cancer cell survival during breast tumor development. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive these events are not known and will be the subject of future investigation in the lab.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that the increase in PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression observed in breast cancer results in an increase in PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling that in turn promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis and thus, may significantly contribute to the progression of disease to a more malignant stage. Our findings are consistent with results from a study that evaluated the consequences of intrinsic PPAR&#x003b3;1 activation using transgenic mice. This study demonstrated that constitutive over-expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in mice, which were predisposed to breast cancer, leads to a greater number of tumors and higher mortality in both male and female animals, thus suggesting that increased PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling serves as a tumor promoter in the mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Since constitutive PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling did not affect mammary gland differentiation or function when introduced in wild-type mice, the authors emphasized that consequences of PPAR&#x003b3;1 transactivation are different in normal and transformed cells. This observation is consistent with our previous data, which demonstrated different mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in breast cancer cells as compared to HMEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides insight into the functional significance of increased PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression and endogenous transactivation in breast cancer in an <italic>in vitro </italic>model. The results suggest that increased PPAR&#x003b3; signaling can act as a pro-survival factor by enhancing cancer cell proliferation and blocking the ability of the cell to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, modulation of the PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling pathway remains a promising tool for breast cancer therapy. The findings presented in this paper warrant further investigation regarding the use of PPAR&#x003b3;1 ligands, such as TZDs, in patients who are predisposed or already diagnosed with breast cancer. However, more broad and detailed studies are required to evaluate the impact of PPAR&#x003b3;1 signaling in breast cancer progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).
