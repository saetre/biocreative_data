Two of these genes code for subunits, Gyc&#x003b1;-99B and Gyc&#x003b2;-100B, which form a conventional NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase and the other three code for atypical subunits, Gyc-88E, Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db. The properties and distribution of Gyc-88E and Gyc-89Db have previously been described and here Gyc-89Da is described. Gyc-89Da only forms an active guanylyl cyclase when co-expressed with Gyc-88E. The three atypical subunits probably form two different heterodimers <italic>in vivo</italic>: Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db. Both of these heterodimers were slightly stimulated by NO donors and Gyc-88E/89Da showed a greater activation by Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, with an increase in <italic>Vmax</italic> and a decrease in <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>, compared to Gyc-88E/89Db. Both Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db were expressed in neurons in both the peripheral and central nervous system. Although all three heterodimeric soluble guanylyl cyclases in D. melanogaster can be activated by NO and inhibited by ODQ, the atypical enzymes can be distinguished from the conventional soluble guanylyl cyclase by their sensitivity to the NO-independent activators YC-1 and BAY 41-2272, which will only activate the conventional enzyme.</p><p><def-list><term-head>Abbreviation:</term-head><def-head/><def-item><term>ORF</term><def><p>open reading frame</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UTR</term><def><p>untranslated region</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BAY 41-2272</kwd><kwd>cyclic GMP</kwd><kwd>enteroendocrine cells</kwd><kwd>nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>YC-1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conventional soluble guanylyl cyclases are heterodimeric heme-proteins containing an &#x003b1; and a &#x003b2; subunit that are activated by the gaseous messenger nitric oxide (NO) (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-lucas1" ref-type="bibr">Lucas et al. 2000</xref>).

The Gyc-89Da ORF was then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) using the XbaI and HindIII restriction sites.

Given the sequence similarity between Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db, it was possible that some of this apparent overlap was due to each probe recognizing both Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db transcripts. In an attempt to overcome this problem digoxygenin-labeled RNA probes were generated complementary to the 5&#x02032; UTR of each gene. There is no sequence similarity between the genes in this region. There is, however, less than 300 bp of 5&#x02032; UTR for each gene and probes made to these sequences failed to reveal any specific staining, probably due to a lack of sensitivity using shorter probes (data not shown). Thus, with the available tools it was not possible to determine whether Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db were expressed in a separate set of cells or whether they were co-localized in the same cells. Gyc-89Da was also expressed in cells in the CNS and although it is not possible to determine whether any of the subunits are co-localized in the CNS, a similar pattern of staining was seen with Gyc-89Da compared to Gyc-88E and Gyc-89Db (data not shown).</p><p>There are two specific regions where staining for all three probes are not co-localized. We had previously shown that Gyc-89Db stained cells in both the terminal and dorsal ganglia of the head, whereas Gyc-88E only stained cells in the terminal ganglion. Gyc-89Da was similar to Gyc-89Db in that it also stained cells in both the terminal and dorsal ganglia <xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-f06" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 6B)</xref>. As cells in the dorsal ganglion do not appear to express Gyc-88E, we predict that Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db do not form an active guanylyl cyclase in these cells. In a similar fashion, one area where Gyc-88E was expressed, but Gyc-89Db was not, was in the embryonic gut <xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-f06" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 6H, I)</xref>, where apparently randomly distributed cells were detected in the midgut epithelium when hybridized to a probe for Gyc-88E <xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-f06" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 6I)</xref>, but no cells were seen when hybridized to a probe for either Gyc-89Da <xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-f06" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 6H)</xref> or Gyc-89Db (data not shown). In this case, as Gyc-88E forms an active guanylyl cyclase in the absence of additional subunits it would be expected that this expression represents a functional enzyme.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Multiple distinct soluble guanylyl cyclase isoforms in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content></title><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> genome contains 5 genes predicted to code for soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-morton5" ref-type="bibr">Morton and Hudson 2002</xref>).

Gyc-88E can form an active guanylyl cyclase in the absence of additional subunits (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-langlais1" ref-type="bibr">Langlais et al. 2004</xref>), presumably forming homodimers in a manner similar to the orthologue in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. sexta</named-content> (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-morton3" ref-type="bibr">Morton and Anderson 2003</xref>). Gyc-89Db forms an active enzyme only when co-expressed with Gyc-88E, presumably forming a heterodimer (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-langlais1" ref-type="bibr">Langlais et al. 2004</xref>). Both Gyc-88E and Gyc-88E/89Db enzymes are slightly activated by some NO donors, but are stimulated no more than 2&#x02013;3 fold compared to at least 20 fold activation seen for the Gyc&#x003b1;-99B/&#x003b2;-100B conventional guanylyl cyclase (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-langlais1" ref-type="bibr">Langlais et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>The present study describes an additional subunit, Gyc-89Da, with very similar properties to Gyc-89Db. Both Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db only form an active guanylyl cyclase when co-expressed with Gyc-88E and both heterodimers are only slightly activated by NO donors. The present study also shows that both Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db heterodimers are more sensitive to NO donors than the homodimeric Gyc-88E. This property, in addition to the finding that both Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db appear to be frequently co-expressed with Gyc-88E <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggests that the native enzymes are most often heterodimers. If this prediction is correct, there are three distinct heterodimeric soluble guanylyl cyclase isoforms in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>. The conventional cyclase, Gyc&#x003b1;99B/&#x003b2;-100B is potently activated by NO whereas the atypical cyclases, Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db, are only slightly activated by NO. In the midgut epithelial cells, as Gyc-88E was apparently expressed in the absence of either Gyc-89Da or Gyc-89Db, it is possible that the homodimeric form also exists <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is likely that exogenously applied NO or NO donors will activate all of these enzymes <italic>in vivo</italic> making it difficult to unambiguously determine which guanylyl cyclase is being activated. This is compounded by the finding that the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ, is effective at blocking the NO-stimulation of all forms of the soluble guanylyl cyclases. A useful reagent for distinguishing between the two classes of guanylyl cyclases is likely to be the NO-independent activator BAY 41-2272 that potently activates Gyc&#x003b1;99B/&#x003b2;-100B but has no effect on the atypical guanylyl cyclase.</p><p>As the expression patterns of Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db were very similar to each other the question is raised as to whether they are fully interchangeable. There were some subtle differences between the biochemical properties of Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db. One difference was the response to the NO donor, DEA-NONOate. Although Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db responded in a similar fashion to the NO donors, SNAP and NOC-12, only Gyc-88E/89Db responded to DEA-NONOate, showing a pronounced bell-shaped response with maximal activation at about 1&#x003bc;M DEA-NONOate. The reduced activation at higher concentrations of DEA-NONOate could reflect rapid inactivation kinetics as is seen with the mammalian atypical guanylyl cyclase &#x003b2;2 subunit (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-gibb1" ref-type="bibr">Gibb et al. 2003</xref>). A more pronounced difference was seen in the kinetic parameters in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> compared to Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Gyc-88E/89Da showed a stronger activation in Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> than Gyc-88E/89Db with a larger increase in <italic>Vmax</italic> and a larger decrease in <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>. This might reflect differences in the activation of these two enzymes by the natural ligand. It is not known what this natural ligand is, but the recent finding that an atypical soluble guanylyl cyclase in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> binds oxygen (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-gray1" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 2004</xref>) raises the possibility that a gaseous messenger other than NO, possibly oxygen or carbon monoxide, could regulate either of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> atypical guanylyl cyclases. Although the endogenous ligand for the three soluble guanylyl cyclases might differ, it is likely that the mechanism of activation is similar: binding a small ligand to the heme group for activation. A critical residue for binding heme and NO activation of conventional soluble guanylyl cyclases is a histidine residue (His-105 in the mammalian &#x003b2;1 subunit) that acts as the axial ligand for binding heme and is displaced upon NO binding (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-zhao1" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 1998</xref>). Other critical residues are Tyr-135 and Arg-139 (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al. 2004</xref>) Gyc-88E, <italic>Gyc-89Da</italic> and <italic>Gyc-89Db</italic> all have these three residues at the equivalent positions (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-morton5" ref-type="bibr">Morton and Hudson 2002</xref>). In addition, all of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> soluble guanylyl cyclases are sensitive to ODQ, which acts by oxidizing the heme group (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-garthwaite1" ref-type="bibr">Garthwaite et al. 1995</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-zhao2" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2000</xref>), again suggesting a common mechanism of activation.</p><p>The suggestion that most of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> guanylyl cyclases primarily exist as heterodimers is based on the increased sensitivity to NO donors of the heterodimers compared to the homodimer and the finding that Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db are frequently co-expressed with Gyc-88E <italic>in vivo</italic>. This model might also extend to other atypical soluble guanylyl cyclases.

The genomes of other insects including the mosquito, honeybee and silk moth all appear to contain sequences with similarity to Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db in addition to Gyc-88E (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-morton5" ref-type="bibr">Morton and Hudson 2002</xref>; DB Morton, unpublished observations), suggesting that <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. sexta</named-content> also has more than one atypical guanylyl cyclase subunit. <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> has seven soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits, all of which appear to be members of the atypical subunit family (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-morton4" ref-type="bibr">Morton et al. 1999</xref>) and modeling suggests that they all can form heterodimers (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-morton1" ref-type="bibr">Morton 2004a</xref>).

Is there any functional significance for the expression of all three subunits in the same cells? Their biochemical properties when expressed in heterologous cells show that they function in a very similar manner, suggesting a redundancy between Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db. In <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> five of the seven soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits are also co-expressed in the same four cells (see <xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-morton1" ref-type="bibr">Morton 2004a</xref>). Deletions of the genes coding for two of these subunits, GCY-35 and GCY-36, disrupt social feeding behaviors whereas deletions for two of the other three did not generate the same phenotype (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-cheung1" ref-type="bibr">Cheung et al. 2004</xref>). This suggests that there is not complete functional redundancy between all these subunits. No mutant phenotypes are known for any of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> atypical subunits. A genetic analysis of such mutants when they become available should help resolve this issue.</p><p>In addition, Gyc-88E was expressed in an additional population of cells, a subset of epithelial cells in the gut, which did not express either Gyc-89Da or Gyc-89Db. The positions and numbers of the labeled cells in the gut epithelia suggest that they are enteroendocrine cells, which have been shown in several insect species to contain a variety of peptide hormones (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-zitnan1" ref-type="bibr">Zitnan et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-veenstra1" ref-type="bibr">Veenstra et al. 1995</xref>). Peptides released from these cells have been suggested to regulate gut contractility and/or the release of digestive enzymes in response to feeding (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-zitnan1" ref-type="bibr">Zitnan et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-veenstra1" ref-type="bibr">Veenstra et al. 1995</xref>). Although a role for cGMP in these cells is unknown, it is possible that increases in cGMP could mediate the release of these peptides. An increase in the levels of cGMP in the epitracheal glands and in a subset of peptidergic neurons in the CNS has been implicated in the release of peptide hormones in another insect, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. sexta</named-content> (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-kingan1" ref-type="bibr">Kingan et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-kingan2" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-gammie1" ref-type="bibr">Gammie and Truman 1997</xref>). As Gyc-88E forms a functional guanylyl cyclase when expressed in heterologous cells in the absence of additional subunits, it is likely that this expression represents the formation of an active homodimer in the midgut cells. By contrast, in the dorsal ganglion Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db appear to be expressed in the absence of Gyc-88E. Based on the properties of these subunits in heterologous cells, these are likely to represent non-functional guanylyl cyclases. It is possible that at a later stage in development these cells begin to express Gyc-88E and thus form a functional enzyme.</p><p>In summary, we have presented evidence that suggests that there are multiple isoforms of soluble guanylyl cyclase in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>. Gyc&#x003b1;-99B/&#x003b2;-100B represents the conventional NO-sensitive cyclase and Gyc-88E, Gyc-88E/89Da and Gyc-88E/89Db are atypical enzymes. The atypical guanylyl cyclases are slightly activated by NO, but can be distinguished from the conventional NO-sensitive enzymes by their insensitivity to the NO-independent activators YC-1 and BAY 41-2272. Gyc-88E/89Db and Gyc-88E/ 89Da are expressed in neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems and Gyc-88E is expressed in gut epithelia, possibly in enteroendocrine cells. A major question remains which is to determine the endogenous activator of these and other atypical soluble guanylyl cyclases. The recent finding that an atypical soluble guanylyl cyclase in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> mediates oxygen sensing behaviors (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-gray1" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 2004</xref>) suggests that other gaseous ligands such oxygen or carbon monoxide are prime candidates. In support of this idea, we have recently shown that when expressed in COS-7 cells, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> atypical guanylyl cyclases are stimulated by anoxia and inhibited by oxygen (<xref rid="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-morton2" ref-type="bibr">Morton 2004b</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Ms. Caitlin Anderson and Leah Maier for technical assistance and helpful discussions.

The upper line shows the relative positions of all 5 genes on the right arm of the third chromosome. The region containing Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db is expanded showing their proximity to each other (separated by about 2 kb) and their similar intron/exon structure. The coding region of both genes is contained in a single exon (grey box) that is preceded by a intron and a non-coding 5&#x02032; exon (open box). There are two splice variants of Gyc-89Da that differ in the splice site between the first exon and first intron &#x02013; one variant containing an additional 14 bp in the first exon. The first exon/intron boundary for each splice variant is shown with upper case letters representing the sequence of the exon. The 3&#x02032; UTR of Gyc-89Da was not determined but gene prediction software predicted the poly-A signal 84 bp 3&#x02032; of the stop codon (not shown). The 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;UTRs of Gyc-89Db were included in the expressed sequence tag obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-f01"/></fig><fig id="i1536-2442-005-12-0001-f02" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content><italic>Gyc-89Da</italic> forms an active guanylyl cyclase when co-expressed with <italic>Gyc-88EL</italic>.
