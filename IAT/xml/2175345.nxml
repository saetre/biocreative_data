To understand regulatory mechanisms governing human <italic>BORIS</italic> expression, we characterized its 5&#x02032;-flanking region. Using 5&#x02032; RACE, we identified three promoters, designated A, B and C, corresponding to transcription start sites at &#x02212;1447, &#x02212;899 and &#x02212;658 bp upstream of the first ATG. Alternative promoter usage generated at least five alternatively spliced <italic>BORIS</italic> mRNAs with different half-lives determined by varying 5&#x02032;-UTRs. In normal testis, <italic>BORIS</italic> is transcribed from all three promoters, but 84% of the 30 cancer cell lines tested used only promoter(s) A and/or C while the others utilized primarily promoters B and C. The differences in promoter usage between normal and cancer cells suggested that they were subject to differential regulation. We found that DNA methylation and functional p53 contributes to the negative regulation of each promoter. Moreover, reduction of CTCF in normally BORIS-negative human fibroblasts resulted in derepression of <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding cancer-related associations between haploinsufficiency of <italic>CTCF</italic> and <italic>BORIS</italic> derepression, and between the lack of functional p53 and aberrant activation of <italic>BORIS</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>BORIS</italic> (Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites), also designated <italic>CTCFL</italic> (CTCF-like), is the mammalian paralog of a highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), multi-functional chromatin factor encoded by a candidate tumor suppressor gene, <italic>CTCF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>). Loukinov <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) showed that in humans and mice, these two genes encode polypeptides of similar size that share a centrally positioned nearly identical DNA-binding domain (DBD). The DBD is composed of 11 Zn-fingers (11ZF), including ten of the classic DNA-binding C2H2-class and one (ZF 11) of the C2HC-class capable of binding both single-strand DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). It is noteworthy that the 11 ZF DBD regions in BORIS and CTCF are encoded by genomic sequences, which display an accurate duplication of a region containing all ZF-coding exons of the <italic>CTCF</italic> gene from an early mammal. The accuracy of this duplication in the human genome was maintained to the extent that genomic nucleotide similarities between <italic>CTCF</italic> and <italic>BORIS</italic> at individual intron&#x02013;exon junctions approach 100% identity at the single nucleotide level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>By virtue of this shared DNA-recognition domain, BORIS can bind specifically to the same DNA target sequences that interact with CTCF. However, the consequences of BORIS or CTCF bound to the same site would be expected to be different. This is because the amino- and carboxy-termini of BORIS and CTCF are totally unrelated such that cofactors associated with one would not partner with the other. Thus, there would be different functional outcomes depending on which one of the two paralogs occupies a CTCF/BORIS-11ZF-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Once bound to DNA, CTCF may function as a versatile component of transcriptional chromatin insulators, hormone-dependent silencers and promoter repressors or activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>). CTCF-binding sites have been mapped in differentially methylated domains of imprinting control regions (ICR) that regulate a parent-of-origin-dependent mono-allelic expression within clusters of imprinted genes: <italic>IGF2/H19</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>), <italic>Rasgrf-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) <italic>DLK1/GTL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), <italic>AWT1/WT1-AS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and <italic>KvDMR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) loci. In addition, several functionally distinct, important, methylation-sensitive CTCF/BORIS-binding sites involved in random and/or imprinted X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) choice have been mapped at the X-inactivation center (Xic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21 B22">18&#x02013;22</xref>).</p><p>Finally, a novel class of methylation-insensitive, but CpG-containing CTCF/BORIS-target sites was found and characterized in promoter regions of genes encoding the X-linked cancer-testis antigens (CTA) <italic>MAGE-A1, NY-ESO-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and <italic>SPAN-X</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Promoters of CTA genes are methylated and repressed in normal somatic cells that express <italic>CTCF</italic> and not <italic>BORIS</italic>, but are specifically demethylated and activated in testicular germ cells and in cancer cells that express <italic>BORIS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Vatolin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and Hong <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) have documented co-expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> with other CTA genes in the majority of cancer cell lines and primary breast, prostate, colorectal and lung tumors tested. They also showed that conditionally expressed BORIS can outcompete CTCF <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> for binding to normally methylated 11ZF-target sites present in the silenced <italic>MAGE-A1</italic> and <italic>NY-ESO-1</italic> promoters. In addition, within three days of BORIS expression in normal cells, they observed both demethylation and activation of these two genes. It was also demonstrated that while CTCF is bound to the repressed/methylated <italic>MAGE-A1</italic> and <italic>NY-ESO-1</italic> promoters in normal human fibroblasts, activation of the same promoters in cancer cell lines is associated with <italic>in vivo</italic> occupancy by BORIS of methylation-insensitive 11ZF-target sites. Moreover, 12 other CTA genes that are normally co-expressed in testis with <italic>BORIS</italic> but not in somatic cells with <italic>CTCF</italic> were activated by ectopic expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> in normal primary human fibroblasts. In contrast, promoters of genes regulated by methylation but not normally co-expressed with BORIS in male germ cells failed to respond to ectopic expression of BORIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Similar findings on the important roles of CTCF/BORIS-binding sites in regulation of the germ cell specific <italic>ALF</italic> and <italic>SPAN-X</italic> genes, have been reported by DeJong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and Larionov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) laboratories, respectively.</p><p>Importantly, during male germ cell development, CTA-expressing cells are also engaged in the process of re-establishing paternal gene imprinting marks. This suggests that binding of BORIS in place of CTCF to shared targets, may be responsible for two effects. The first is activation of CTA gene promoters in testis. The second is re-setting of paternal ICR marks by remethylation in mature differentiating testicular germ cells after erasure of all gene imprinting marks in primordial germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Indeed, data from a recent publication have provided strong support for the concept of BORIS-mediated epigenetic regulation of paternal ICR re-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results strongly support the hypotheses that CTCF and BORIS act successively to govern epigenetic states in normal male germ cell development, while rivalry in binding to the same spectrum of DNA sites caused by aberrant activation of BORIS in somatic cells may be associated with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>While the mechanisms governing regulation of <italic>CTCF</italic> by its promoter have been explored by Klenova <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), data on <italic>BORIS</italic> promoter regulation has not been described. This prompted us to investigate patterns of <italic>BORIS</italic> expression in normal testicular germ cells, in cancer cell lines, and in primary tumor tissues. We characterized the 5&#x02032;-flanking noncoding region of the gene with expected regulatory (promoter) function. We mapped three alternative promoters producing five alternatively spliced 5&#x02032;-UTR and analyzed promoter usage in different cell types and tissues. We also showed that activity of these promoters is negatively regulated by DNA methylation and by CTCF and p53.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and tissue samples</title><p>A total of 293 human embryonic kidney cells; normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) (Cambrex, Rockland, MD, USA), normal foreskin fibroblasts BJ and 31 tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were used in this study. The majority of tumor cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 1% PSN Antibiotic Mixture (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 0.5% fungizone (Invitrogen). The 293, HeLa and Co115 cell lines were grown in DMEM with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 1% PSN and 0.5% fungizone. Normal cells were grown in the media recommended by the ATCC and NHDF in the media recommended by Cambrex. K562 cells stably transfected with the temperature-sensitive p53<sup>Val135</sup> mutant, which adopts a wild-type conformation at 32&#x000b0;C, were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> H1299 parental cell line and the H1299 p53wt cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) were a generous gift from Dr Peter M. Chumakov (Department of Molecular Genetics Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, USA). Demethylation studies were performed with NHDF treated with 1 &#x003bc;M 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were harvested at different times after treatment and medium containing 5-aza-dC was replaced with the fresh medium every 48 h. <table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table

The 5&#x02032; RLM-RACE method has a major advantage over other methods for mapping of transcription start sites (e.g. primer extension, nuclease protection assays or traditional 5&#x02032; RACE) in that it only detects authentic capped 5&#x02032; ends of mRNAs. The technique is based on RNA ligase-mediated (RLM-RACE) and oligo-capping rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and results in the selective ligation of an RNA oligonucleotide to the 5&#x02032; ends of decapped mRNA. This method allowed the amplification of only truly full-length transcripts via elimination of truncated messages. The 5&#x02032; RLM-RACE assays were performed on total RNA extracted from normal testis tissue, and from the NCCIT tumor cell line. Two PCR products (&#x0223c;700 bp and &#x0223c;1500 bp) were obtained and, after cloning and sequencing, the first two start sites were identified at &#x02212;658 and &#x02212;899 bp from the ATG translational start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Using the GC-Rich PCR system and nested primers upstream of the first transcription start site, a &#x0223c;200 bp PCR product was generated. This new site mapped to &#x02212;1447 bp upstream of the ATG translation start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Identification and activity of three <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters. <bold>(A)</bold> Nucleotide sequence of the 5&#x02032;-upstream region of the human <italic>BORIS</italic> gene is shown together with a portion of the coding region.

Transfection assays were carried out with the NCCIT, OVCAR-3 and HeLa cell lines. Two reporter constructs were used to study transcriptional regulation by promoter A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The larger construct (&#x02212;2071 to &#x02212;1276) showed substantial transcriptional activity in all three cell lines, whereas the 5&#x02032; truncated construct (&#x02212;1413 to &#x02212;1276) showed only low activity. The activity of promoter A was significantly higher in NCCIT than in OVCAR-3 or HeLa cells. These results suggested that transcriptional activity of promoter A could be cell type-specific. To study transcriptional regulation by promoter B, three reporter constructs were generated. The construct containing nucleotides &#x02212;1370 to &#x02212;861 of the promoter B region produced an activity that was 23&#x02013;40% of that generated by the SV40 promoter. A construct truncated to contain nucleotides &#x02212;1106 to &#x02212;861 was more active, yielding between 38% and 50% of SV40 levels, whereas the transcriptional activity of the smallest construct (&#x02212;996 to &#x02212;861) was very low. These results suggest that the sequences located between &#x02212;1106 and &#x02212;996 to the ATG translational start site defined the minimal <italic>BORIS</italic> promoter B. Promoter C is located very close to promoter B and is quite small. To study promoter C, we generated a construct containing nucleotides &#x02212;821 to &#x02212;622 upstream of the start site. This construct produced relatively low activity in comparison with promoters A and B. The transcriptional activity of promoter C was observed to be higher in HeLa cells corresponding to 18% of SV40 promoter activity, suggesting that promoter C may also be tissue specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>Analyses of the <italic>BORIS</italic> promoter region sequences using the MatInspector program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomatix.de/index.html">http://www.genomatix.de/index.html</ext-link>) identified several consensus sequences for transcription factor binding sites. In addition, promoters B and C are situated in a CpG island.

Indeed, we identified five major transcripts that differed in their 5&#x02032; noncoding regions but encoded the same protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The <italic>BORIS A1</italic> and <italic>BORIS A3</italic> isoforms are expressed from promoter A and have first 180 and 548 bp noncoding exons Ea and Ea+Ea1+Eb, respectively that splice directly to the first 530 bp coding exon, E1. The <italic>BORIS A2</italic> splice variant also originates from promoter A, but has two more noncoding exons, Ea1 and Eb, than the <italic>BORIS A1</italic> isoform. The <italic>BORIS</italic> variant that comes from promoter B contains a first 80 bp noncoding exon, Eb, which splices to first 530 bp coding exon, E1. The <italic>BORIS C1</italic> isoform is expressed from promoter C and is transcribed as an unspliced first 1190 bp coding exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). To investigate whether the alternative 5&#x02032; UTRs affect mRNA stability, we blocked RNA synthesis by treating cells with ActD. Two cell lines were used in those experiments: K562 cells that express all five alternative 5&#x02032; UTRs and Ovcar-8 cells that express only two of five. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (panel B), the half-lives of <italic>BORIS, BORIS A1, BORIS A2, BORIS A3</italic> and <italic>BORIS C1</italic> transcripts in K562 cells were 4.7, 7.4, 6.9, 7.9 and 6.4 h, respectively, indicating that BORIS mRNAs in cultured cells are relatively stable and long-lived. The alternative transcript expressed from promoter B, <italic>BORIS</italic>, was 1.5-fold less stable than <italic>BORIS</italic> transcripts expressed from promoters A and C. The relative turnover of the three alternative 5&#x02032; UTRs expressed from promoter A&#x02014;<italic>BORIS A1, BORIS A2</italic> and <italic>BORIS A3&#x02014;</italic>was comparable and the rates of degradation were approximately 1.2-fold slower than for the <italic>BORIS C1</italic> transcript expressed from promoter C. Similar half-lives of <italic>BORIS</italic> (4.7 h) and <italic>BORIS C1</italic> (6.6 h) were obtained in Ovcar-8 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).

As expected from previous studies, testis was the only normal tissue to express <italic>BORIS</italic> (data not shown). The relative percent of expression from each promoter was then calculated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A shows that in normal testis, expression comes from all three promoters.

Only 5 cell lines showed transcriptional activity promoter B and these were assigned to a subset designated as group B. Activity in all the other cell lines came only from promoters A or/and C. These 26 cell lines were assigned to one of three groups, based on their utilization of these two promoters. Group A is comprised of cell lines that expressed <italic>BORIS</italic> primarily from promoter A. Group C includes a series of cell lines that expresses <italic>BORIS</italic> primarily from promoter C. Cell lines in the group designated A/C use both promoters more or less equally. The patterns of promoter utilization in the cancer cell lines are distinct from that observed in normal testis. However, it must be recognized that testis tissue contains germ cells at various stages of spermatogenesis which could utilize the different promoters in a cell type-specific manner or might use all three at each stage. Moreover, based on known features of the 31 cell lines, preferential promoter utilization could not be correlated with tissue origin or with genomic characteristics that might be thought to influence <italic>BORIS</italic> expression&#x02014;loss of the <italic>CTCF</italic>-containing chromosome 16; gain of chromosome 20 or amplification of 20q13 that contains the <italic>BORIS</italic> locus. In addition, there was no obvious relation between promoter utilization and patterns of p53 expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).

To examine this possibility, we used siRNA to suppress CTCF expression in NHDF and then tested the cells for expression of <italic>CTCF</italic> and <italic>BORIS</italic> by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). We observed that the level of <italic>CTCF</italic> transcript was reduced more than 4-fold in cells expressing the siRNA while the levels of <italic>BORIS</italic> transcripts in the same cells were increased at least 8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). To evaluate the contribution of each promoter to expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> in the siRNA-treated cells, we performed qPCR with primers and probes specific for each of the spliced isoforms.

It is known that CTCF binding can be sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) or insensitive to methylation of its target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In order to see if CTCF binding within <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters was sensitive to DNA methylation, all fragments positive for CTCF binding were methylated <italic>in vitro</italic> using <italic>Sss</italic>I DNA methylase. EMSA analysis showed that binding of the CTCF 11ZF DNA-binding domain to fragments 2, 3, 4 (promoter A), 5 and 6 (promoter B) was similar whether the fragments were methylated or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). In contrast, no binding was observed to methylated fragments 8, 9 and 10 that are located in the CpG island shared by promoters B and C. The degree of probe methylation, tested using the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease AciI for the <italic>BORIS</italic> promoter and BstUI for ICR4 as a positive control, showed that the extent of methylation was nearly 100%. This experiment showed that some CTCF-binding sites within BORIS promoters were methylation-sensitive and others were methylation-insensitive.</p><p>To investigate CTCF binding to <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed ChIP assays in normal BJ fibroblasts, in Ovcar-8, using mostly promoter B, and in Ovcar-3, using mostly promoters A. We analyzed the promoter regions of <italic>BORIS</italic> and site N from the <italic>c-MYC</italic> locus, a well-characterized CTCF-binding site that functions as a 5&#x02032; chromatin insulator for the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C showed that site N was occupied by CTCF in all three lines while the non-binding target used as negative control was not. In the BJ cell line, occupancy of all three promoters by CTCF correlated well with the transcriptionally repressed state of all three in this cell line. In Ovcar-8, CTCF occupancy was found only on promoter A and C. No CTCF binding was found in promoter B, which correlates with expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> coming only from promoter B in this cell line (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, CTCF binding in Ovcar-3 was identified in promoter B but not in promoter C. CTCF binding in promoter A was not significant, showing only a 2.2-fold enrichment. These results also correlate with <italic>BORIS</italic> expression coming from promoters A and C, but not from promoter B.

This prompted us to ask if p53 might be involved in regulating <italic>BORIS</italic> expression. To examine this possibility, we transfected K562 cells that are p53 negative with luciferase reporters for each of the three <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters together with expression plasmids for wild-type or mutant p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The results of these studies showed that the luciferase activity of all three <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters was significantly reduced in cells transfected with wild-type p53 versus mutant p53. With wild-type p53, the activity of promoters A and B was downregulated about 3.3- and 4.6-fold, respectively, and the activity of promoter C was repressed about 1.5-fold. We then performed northern blot analysis of K562 cells transfected with a vector encoding temperature-sensitive alleles of wild-type and mutant p53. The results showed that over-expression of the mutant p53 had no effect on the levels of either <italic>BORIS</italic> or <italic>CTCF</italic> transcripts. In contrast, activation of wild-type p53 was associated with a great reduction in expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> while expression of <italic>CTCF</italic> was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). To further examine the impact of p53 on <italic>BORIS</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared p53-negative H1299 parental cells with H1299 cells stably infected with a virus expressing wild-type p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).

The fact that promoters B and C co-localize within a CpG island raised the possibility that their activities might be affected by methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). DNA samples from 2 cell lines, 24 human normal tissue samples and 26 tumor tissue samples were extracted and analyzed by methylation-sensitive single-strand conformation analysis (MS-SSCA) and methylation-sensitive dot blot assay (MS-DBA) after sodium bisulfite modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The CpG island was found to be completely methylated in samples of all normal tissues with the exception of testis, the tissue in which <italic>BORIS</italic> is normally expressed. Studies of the CpG island in tumors revealed demethylation in testicular tumors (6/6), ovarian tumors (1/3), breast cancers (1/6) and endometrial tumors (1/3) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Representative examples of results from studies of the cell lines and tissues are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A. The partial methylation observed in normal testis tissue is likely to be due to the presence of both germ cells and non-germ cells in this tissue. As might be expected, <italic>BORIS</italic> was expressed in almost all the tumors and cell lines that contained a hypomethylated CpG island. Moreover, it has been shown that demethylation of <italic>BORIS</italic> promoter B in tumor tissues, versus methylated <italic>BORIS</italic> promoter B in normal tissues, is correlated with the expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> in tumors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). However, among the 26 cell lines which belong to group A/C, only 2 showed partial demethylation of promoters B and C. Full methylation of these promoters in all the other lines was correlated with inhibition of <italic>BORIS</italic> transcription from promoter B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In the case of cell lines from group B, promoters B and C were found to be unmethylated or partially methylated in the case of COLO-205. Nine out of 32 CpGs within promoters B and C were analyzed by genomic bisulfite sequencing in NHDF, 2 cell lines from group A/C (NCCIT and Ovcar-3) and 2 cell lines from group B (Ovcar-8 and K562) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). In normal fibroblasts, 98% of the CpGs analyzed were found to be methylated and <italic>BORIS</italic> expression could not be detected. In NCCIT and Ovcar-3, 98% and 96% of CpGs were methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). In these cells, <italic>BORIS</italic> was expressed primarily from promoter A, in association with minimal expression from promoter C and no expression from promoter B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Treatment resulted in demethylation of the CpG island and strong activation of <italic>BORIS</italic> expression in both lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Moreover, the real-time PCR analyses showed that <italic>BORIS</italic> expression detected before 5-aza-dC treatment was coming from promoters A and C, but after 5-aza-dC treatment the <italic>BORIS</italic> expression switched to promoter B in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). The decrease of expression from promoters A and C after 5-aza-dC treatment might be explained by the effect of 5-aza-dC itself on other transcriptional factors that could also in their turn downregulate <italic>BORIS</italic> expression through promoters A and C. Expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> in normal cells was also induced after treatment with 5-aza-dC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C and D) with <italic>BORIS</italic> transcripts originating from all three promoters. qPCR analyses showed that <italic>BORIS</italic> transcripts from promoter B were readily detected in cells treated for just 6 h and that transcripts from all three promoters could be detected in cells treated for 24 h with promoter B being the strongest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). Remarkably, we were not able to detect any demethylation of the CpG island at the 24 h time point, suggesting that a mechanism other than demethylation was responsible for the effects of 5-aza-dC on the <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Effect of demethylating agent on <italic>BORIS</italic> expression in cancer cell lines and normal fibroblasts.

In some cancers, <italic>BORIS</italic> is the most frequently activated CTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Moreover, it has been suggested that expression of BORIS may have diagnostic implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), and recent work has identified BORIS as an attractive candidate target for anti-cancer immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The present study significantly extends these foundations by developing molecular understandings of the mechanisms that tightly restrict <italic>BORIS</italic> expression in normal tissues but are permissive for expression in many malignancies.</p><p>Here, we first identified three transcriptional start sites at &#x02212;1447, &#x02212;899 and &#x02212;658 bp upstream of the first ATG of the <italic>BORIS</italic> ORF. Regions upstream of those putative transcriptional starts were tested in reporter assays and were shown to exhibit promoter activities. These three promoters designated A, B and C in association with the start sites at &#x02212;1447, &#x02212;899 and &#x02212;658, respectively induced the synthesis of five transcripts that are different from one another in their 5&#x02032;-noncoding regions. Numerous studies have documented the importance of 5&#x02032;-noncoding regions for both mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>) and translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), as well as for having an impact on the specificity of tissue expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47 B48 B49">47&#x02013;49</xref>). Moreover, promoter regions and 5&#x02032;-UTRs may determine alternative splicing of downstream exons, thus influencing the function of resulting products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). We suggest that similar regulatory mechanisms might well be involved in the regulation of <italic>BORIS</italic> expression. In our study, we estimated the half-life of <italic>BORIS</italic> transcripts with alternative 5&#x02032; UTRs and found that the stability of the mRNAs differed significantly. The variance ranged from 4.7 to 7.9 h, with the <italic>BORIS</italic> transcript having the shortest half-life and the <italic>BORIS A3</italic> transcript the longest. mRNA stability plays a major role in gene expression in mammalian cells, affecting the rates at which mRNAs disappear following transcriptional repression and accumulate following transcription induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Thus, expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> alternative transcripts with different stabilities in testis and cancer cells suggests that these isoforms may have unique physiological functions, possibly related to different stages of spermatogenesis or events involved in cancer development and progression.</p><p>To understand these three promoters in greater depth, we first analyzed their utilization in a panel of normal tissues and in 31 cancer cell lines representing different types of human tumors. We demonstrated that the extent to which the promoters are employed is very different for normal testis and the cancer cell lines. In testis, all three promoters are expressed but to differing extents. Further studies will be required to determine if this pattern is common to all expressing germ cells or if promoter utilization varies depending on the state of differentiation with all being used at one point or another. In contrast, the patterns of promoter utilization in BORIS-positive cancer cell lines indicated that the lines fell into two main subsets: group B, comprising 16% of the lines, in which activity came primarily from promoter B; and group A/C, with 84% of the cases, in which activities come from promoters A and/or C. These results suggest that the normally stringent restriction of <italic>BORIS</italic> expression to testis requires repression of all three promoters in somatic cells. These data also demonstrate that release of BORIS expression in cancers does not reflect relaxation of promoter control to a state like that in testis but occurs in a more selective mode of promoter deregulation. Understanding if there are specific functional consequences to selective regulation of each promoter and variant transcript is a subject on ongoing studies.</p><p>As <italic>CTCF</italic> appears to be expressed in a complementary fashion with <italic>BORIS</italic> during spermatogenesis, we evaluated a potential inhibitory role for CTCF in <italic>BORIS</italic> transcription. We demonstrated that downregulation of CTCF by siRNA results in upregulation of <italic>BORIS</italic> in NHDF. We also showed that all three <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters contain CTCF-binding sites, suggesting that CTCF acts directly to regulate the <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters. The demonstration that CTCF is involved in the negative regulation of <italic>BORIS</italic> expression is likely to be important for understanding the uniform expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> in normal rat cells transformed due to a retroviral disruption of one <italic>CTCF</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) and in tumors of mice heterozygous for a null allele of CTCF (unpublished data).</p><p>Previous research convincingly demonstrated that binding of CTCF to many of its targets is sensitive to CpG methylation. This is exemplified by studies of the <italic>IGF2/H19</italic> ICR, which showed that CTCF binds to the unmethylated maternal allele but not the methylated paternal allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). We thus hypothesized that regulation of <italic>BORIS</italic> transcription would be dependent on the methylation status of CTCF target sites in the promoters. Consistent with this suggestion, <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters B and C were found to be located in a shared CpG island. We therefore proceeded to determine how methylation status would affect the activities of these promoters. EMSAs performed using <italic>Sss</italic>I methylated probes showed that CTCF-binding sites in promoter A were insensitive to methylation. In promoter B, however, CTCF binding is insensitive to methylation outside of the CpG island, but sensitive within the island. Likely, CTCF binding in promoter C was sensitive to methylation. In addition, ChIP studies showed a reverse correlation between CTCF binding and expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> from promoter B. Indeed, CTCF did not bind in promoter B in Ovcar-8 cells that expressed <italic>BORIS</italic> from promoter B. In contrast, CTCF bound strongly in promoter B in Ovcar-3 cells that expressed <italic>BORIS</italic> from promoter A. Analyses of methylation status of the CpG island in the Ovcar-3 and BJ cell lines showed that promoters B and C were fully methylated, although CTCF binding was found in both promoters <italic>in vivo</italic>. It seems likely that these results can be explained by the limitations of ChIP resolution as promoter B also contains CTCF sites insensitive to methylation and promoters B and C are only &#x0223c;250 bp apart. However, the possibility of indirect CTCF recruitment by another factor that can bind these methylated sequences cannot be formally excluded. Analyses of normal cells, tumor tissues and tumor cell lines showed that the activity of promoter B is downregulated by DNA methylation. Regulation of <italic>BORIS</italic> transcriptional activity by methylation was suggested but not conclusively demonstrated by other recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). As shown here, treatment of cancer cell lines that express <italic>BORIS</italic> at low levels with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-dC, resulted in demethylation of the promoter CpG island and substantial increases in <italic>BORIS</italic> transcription. However, treatment of BORIS-negative normal fibroblasts with 5-aza-dC also activated <italic>BORIS</italic> transcription, this time from all three promoters. The rapidity with which transcription was induced, and the lack of demethylation of the CpG island that contains promoters B and C, indicated that molecular mechanisms by which 5-aza-dC activated expression of <italic>BORIS</italic> in NHDF was very different from that governing activation in the tumor cells. Based on this, we conclude that although the methylation status of <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters is likely to be the determining regulatory feature in many cellular contexts, methylation-insensitive regulatory mechanisms exist that may well be cell type-specific.</p><p>The tumor suppressor protein, p53, is well known as a transcriptional activator of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Activation of transcription by p53 occurs mostly through direct binding to DNA at a consensus target site. Nevertheless, in addition to gene activation through direct binding to DNA, p53 has been shown to repress transcription by indirect interactions with a target promoter through a promoter-bound transcriptional activator as the intermediary. For example, the interaction of p53 with Sp1 inhibits <italic>hTERT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>), <italic>CCNB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>) and <italic>IGF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) promoters, while the interaction of p53 with NF-Y inhibits <italic>CDC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>), <italic>FN1</italic> (fibronectin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>) and <italic>COX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>) promoters. In this study, we showed that expression of wild-type p53 protein resulted in repression of all three <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters, but strongest forcefully for promoters A and B. However, ChIP assays showed that p53 may not bind directly to <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters (data not shown) or that if bound, it may be masked by multiple p53-binding co-factors from interactions with antibodies used in our assay. It is also possible that the strong inhibitory effects of p53 on <italic>BORIS</italic> promoters could be explained by interaction of p53 with the transcription factor Sp1 since consensus-binding sites for Sp1 are present in several copies in each <italic>BORIS</italic> promoter. Additionally, a recent study showed that p53 is required for the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the maintenance of DNA methylation by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>) could contribute to keeping <italic>BORIS</italic> silent.</p><p>In summary, we characterized three promoters for the <italic>BORIS</italic> gene that lead to the transcription of five mRNA differing in their 5&#x02032;-UTRs. All three promoters were involved in <italic>BORIS</italic> expression during normal spermatogenesis; however, promoters A and C are preferentially used upon activation of <italic>BORIS</italic> during tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a few tumors that exhibited no activity from any of these three promoters still expressed <italic>BORIS</italic> transcripts (data not shown), suggesting the possible existence of additional regulatory sequences that act upstream of promoter A. Thus, DNA methylation, and expression of CTCF and p53 represent three mechanisms involved in the negative regulation of <italic>BORIS</italic> transcription, although it seems likely that additional levels of control also exist. These results showed that regulation of <italic>BORIS</italic> activity is complex, being both promoter- and cell type-dependent. Varying promoter usage driving multiple <italic>BORIS</italic> transcripts could influence many aspects of epigenetic reprogramming in normal development and in tumorigenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Dr Herbert C.
