During early anaphase, release of the Cdc14 protein phosphatase from the nucleolus leads to the dephosphorylation of Sli15 and redistribution of this complex from kinetochores to the spindle.

Utp7 associates with and regulates the localization of Sli15 and Cdc14. Before anaphase onset, it prevents the premature nucleolar release of Cdc14 and the premature concentration of Sli15 on the spindle. Furthermore, Utp7 can regulate the localization and phosphorylation status of Sli15 independent of its effect on Cdc14 function. Thus, Utp7 is a multifunctional protein that plays essential roles in the vital cellular processes of ribosome biogenesis, chromosome segregation, and cell cycle control.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HU, hydroxyurea; MEN, mitotic exit network; rRNA, ribosomal RNA; SSU, small subunit.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Ipl1 of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is the founding member of the Aurora family of protein kinases, and it is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan and Botstein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Francisco et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monje-Casas et al., 2007</xref>).

Before anaphase onset, the Sli15 complex is concentrated mostly at kinetochores. Upon anaphase onset, this complex redistributes from kinetochores to the anaphase spindle. The redistribution of the Sli15 complex from kinetochores to the anaphase spindle requires dephosphorylation of Sli15 by the Cdc14 protein phosphatase, and ectopic activation of Cdc14 is sufficient for the redistribution of the Sli15 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pereira and Schiebel, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The nucleolus is the site of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription and processing. The small subunit (SSU) processome (or 90S preribosome), with &#x02265;40 different protein subunits, processes the 35S pre-rRNA to generate the mature 18S rRNA that is needed for the biogenesis of the 40S small ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dragon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>). The nucleolus is also the site where the functions of an increasing number of proteins are regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boisvert et al., 2007</xref>). The Cdc14 phosphatase is essential for mitotic exit. From G1 to metaphase, Cdc14 is sequestered and kept inactive in the nucleolus through its binding to Net1 as part of the RENT complex, which also contains the transcriptional repressor Sir2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Straight et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Visintin et al., 1999</xref>). During early anaphase, activation of the FEAR signaling network leads to the release of a fraction of the total pool of Cdc14 into the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</xref>), where it dephosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) substrates such as Sli15. At the end of M phase, activation of the mitotic exit network (MEN) leads to further release of Cdc14 into the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, and Cdc14 dephosphorylates a key set of Cdk substrates to promote mitotic exit. The Cdc15 kinase and the Mob1&#x02013;Dbf2 kinase complex of the MEN are also required for the redistribution and maintenance of the Sli15 complex on the anaphase spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stoepel et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that Utp7, a subunit of the SSU processome, functions not only in the nucleolus but also at kinetochores. Utp7 is required for proper chromosome segregation in addition to ribosome biogenesis. It associates with and regulates the localization of Sli15, Cdc14 and Net1. Interestingly, the regulation of Sli15 localization by Utp7 does not depend entirely on Cdc14 function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The <italic>utp7-1</italic> mutation is synthetic lethal with <italic>ipl1-2</italic></title><p>We have previously performed a synthetic-lethal genetic screen for <italic>sli</italic> mutations (e.g., <italic>sli15</italic>) that cause <italic>sli ipl1-2</italic> double mutants to grow very slowly or become inviable at 26&#x000b0;C, the permissive growth temperature for <italic>sli</italic> and <italic>ipl1-2</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 1999</xref>). One such <italic>sli</italic> mutation (<italic>utp7-1</italic>) resides within the essential <italic>UTP7</italic> gene, which encodes a WD40 repeat-containing component of the SSU processome that is essential for 35S pre-rRNA processing and 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dragon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>). Utp7 is &#x0223c;40% identical over &#x0223c;480 amino acids to the human <italic>BING4</italic> gene product, which is present in preparations of nucleolus and mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sauer et al., 2005</xref>). The <italic>utp7-1</italic> mutant is partially defective in 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis, whereas <italic>ipl1-2</italic> and <italic>sli15-3</italic> cells are not defective in this process even after a 3-h incubation at the restrictive growth temperature of 37&#x000b0;C (unpublished data). Furthermore, <italic>ipl1-2</italic> does not interact genetically with a number of mutations that compromise 40S (<italic>rps27A</italic>) or 60S (<italic>rai1</italic> or <italic>spb2</italic>) ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Thus, the synthetic-lethal relationship between <italic>utp7-1</italic> and <italic>ipl1-2</italic> is unlikely to be caused by a total failure in ribosome biogenesis in <italic>utp7-1 ipl1-2</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Utp7 associates with Sli15 and is present at kinetochores</title><p>In wild-type cells, Utp7 is present throughout the nucleus, but with especially high concentration in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dragon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, Ipl1 and Sli15 are not concentrated in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggins et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka et al., 2002</xref>). To find out whether Utp7 might also function at kinetochores, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with cells that had Utp7 or one of four other SSU processome subunits (Nan1, Nop1, Rrp5, and Utp10) tagged by the HA epitope. Immunoprecipitation of Utp7-HA but not the other SSU processome subunits tested led to the coprecipitation of centromere (CEN) 16 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The centromere association of Utp7-HA is specific because immunoprecipitation of Utp7-HA did not result in the coprecipitation of a <italic>CIT3</italic> sequence that is located &#x0223c;1 kb from CEN16 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) or sequences from the more centromere-distal <italic>IPL1</italic> and <italic>SLI15</italic> loci (unpublished data). As for most other kinetochore proteins, the centromere association of Utp7-HA is abolished in <italic>ndc10-1<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutant cells that have a defective inner kinetochore (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Because we have not been able to detect cytologically the presence of Utp7 at kinetochores, our positive ChIP results suggested that Utp7 might associate transiently with kinetochores.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Utp7 associates with Sli15, Bir1, and centromere DNA.</bold> Cells were incubated at 26&#x000b0;C or, where indicated, shifted to 37&#x000b0;C for 3 h.

Our results showed that Utp7-HA could be coprecipitated with Sli15-Myc and Bir1-Myc but not with Ipl1-Myc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B&#x02013;D</xref>). Purification of GST-Utp7 also led to the copurification of Sli15 and a very small amount of Ipl1 (that could be detected only after long exposure; unpublished data). Because Sli15 exists in at least two complexes in yeast, one containing Bir1 and the other containing Bir1 and Ipl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheeseman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sandall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Widlund et al., 2006</xref>), our results suggested that Utp7 may associate preferentially with the Sli15 complex that does not contain Ipl1. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the failure to precipitate Utp7-HA with Ipl1-Myc may be caused by technical problems, such as masking of the Myc-epitope on Ipl1 in the presence of Utp7-HA. In spite of the association of Utp7 with Sli15 and Bir1, the centromere association of Utp7-HA is not affected in <italic>sli15-3</italic> or <italic>ipl1-2</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Because the centromere association of Ipl1 and mutant Sli15 is abolished in <italic>sli15-3</italic> cells (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emanuele et al., 2008</xref>), the kinetochore localization of Utp7 does not depend on the kinetochore localization of Sli15 or Ipl1.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>utp7-26</italic> mutant cells missegregate chromosomes</title><p>The <italic>utp7-1</italic> mutant that we identified is partially Cs<sup>&#x02212;</sup> for growth at 13&#x000b0;C, but it does not exhibit any drastic cytological phenotypes. Thus, we generated additional <italic>utp7</italic> mutant alleles that confer a Ts<sup>&#x02212;</sup> growth phenotype at 37&#x000b0;C. We have focused on the analysis of one such allele, <italic>utp7-26</italic>. At 26&#x000b0;C, <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells have a reduced growth rate and are partially defective in 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802085/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802085/DC1</ext-link>). Similar to the <italic>utp7-1</italic> mutation, <italic>utp7-26</italic> is synthetic lethal with <italic>ipl1-2</italic> (and <italic>sli15-3</italic>) at 26&#x000b0;C.</p><p>To study chromosome segregation, we shifted asynchronous cultures of wild-type and <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells from 26 to 37&#x000b0;C. As controls, we also included the <italic>enp1-1</italic> and <italic>krr1-17</italic> SSU processome mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). 3 h after shift, &#x0223c;43% of <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells became unbudded, with the remainder becoming mostly large budded (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Because unbudded cells are known to accumulate upon depletion of Utp7 and other SSU components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein and Baserga, 2004</xref>), the slight enrichment in unbudded <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells might have resulted from the ribosome biogenesis defect of such cells (or it could have resulted from aneuploid cells generated by chromosome missegregation). Staining of microtubules and DNA revealed significant chromosome missegregation in <italic>utp7-26</italic> but not <italic>enp1-1</italic> or <italic>krr1-17</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Approximately 80% of the large-budded <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells were in anaphase and they showed heterogeneous cytological phenotypes, the most common and striking of which is uneven chromosome segregation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, panels c, d, and f). Approximately 68% of cells with separated chromosome masses had this phenotype. Chromosome missegregation was nonrandom, with the mother half of the cell receiving more chromosomal DNA &#x0223c;80% of the time when uneven chromosome segregation occurred. This bias is opposite to that reported for <italic>ipl1-2</italic> and <italic>sli15-3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka et al., 2002</xref>). This unusual bias was not caused by abnormal segregation of the old spindle pole body to the mother half because the spindle pole body marker Spc42-RFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>) segregated properly (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>utp7-26</italic> mutant cells missegregate chromosomes.</bold> (A) Cells growing exponentially at 26&#x000b0;C were shifted to 37&#x000b0;C for 3 h.

The budding index of 100 cells was scored at each time point.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1821099f02"></graphic></fig><p>In wild-type cells, a gap clearly existed between the separated chromosomal masses in cells that had an elongated spindle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, panels a and b).

This result suggested that the segregation of some sister chromatids might have been delayed. This phenotype is not observed in <italic>ipl1-2</italic> or <italic>sli15-3</italic> mutant cells. Similar chromosome segregation defects were observed when <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells presynchronized in G1 by &#x003b1;-factor treatment at 26&#x000b0;C were allowed to enter the cell cycle at 37&#x000b0;C (unpublished data). Under such conditions, all <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells budded and progressed through the first cell cycle. Furthermore, when these G1-arrested cells were allowed to enter the cell cycle at 37&#x000b0;C in the presence of the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole, <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells, unlike wild-type cells, did not arrest as large-budded cells with unseparated chromosome mass (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), thus suggesting that these cells are defective in mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint control.</p><p>Even at 26&#x000b0;C, <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells have greatly reduced amount of mutant Utp7-HA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), which likely is responsible for the partial defect in 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis observed in these cells. Expression of mutant Utp7-HA from a 2&#x003bc; plasmid restored mutant Utp7-HA level to roughly the endogenous wild-type level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) without suppressing the Ts<sup>&#x02212;</sup> phenotype or chromosome segregation defects of <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells (unpublished data). The association between Sli15-Myc and mutant Utp7-HA is temperature sensitive because mutant Utp7-HA was coprecipitated with Sli15-Myc from <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells that were incubated at 26&#x000b0;C, but not from cells that were incubated for 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Thus, loss of association between Utp7 and Sli15 is correlated with chromosome missegregation.</p></sec><sec><title>Perturbation of Utp7 function can lead to chromosome missegregation without affecting ribosome profiles</title><p>Because the <italic>utp7-26</italic> mutant is defective in both ribosome biogenesis and chromosome segregation, it is possible that chromosome missegregation occurs in these cells as a consequence of the failure to synthesize certain proteins that are required for chromosome segregation. We consider this possibility unlikely because expression of GST-Utp7 from the <italic>GAL1/10</italic> promoter for 4 h had little effect on ribosome profiles in wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and yet caused heterogeneous chromosome segregation defects (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Approximately 24% of large-budded GST-Utp7&#x02013;expressing cells had no spindle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, panel a&#x02032;); and &#x0223c;65% of large-budded GST-Utp7&#x02013;expressing cells that had an anaphase spindle segregated chromosomes unevenly to the two poles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, panels b&#x02013;d). This latter phenotype is similar to that exhibited by many <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells.</p><p>Interestingly, expression of GST-Utp7 led to a dramatic reduction in the abundance of Ipl1-HA but not Sli15-Myc (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). This reduction in Ipl1-HA abundance was unlikely to be caused by a defect in the synthesis of Ipl1-HA because the abundance of Ipl1 was also greatly reduced in <italic>sli15-3</italic> cells (which are not defective in ribosome biogenesis) and was not affected in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Metaphase spindles are unusually long in <italic>ipl1</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggins et al., 1999</xref>).

We were surprised to learn that <italic>utp7-26 cdc14-3</italic> cells were similarly defective in 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis (Fig. S1 B). Thus, the slow-growth phenotype of <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells at 26&#x000b0;C is probably caused by a defect that has nothing to do with ribosome biogenesis and <italic>cdc14-3</italic> suppresses this unknown defect of <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. We suspect that a very small amount of Cdc14 might be released prematurely from the nucleolus in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells even at 26&#x000b0;C. Because ectopic activation of Cdc14 before anaphase onset causes inappropriate dephosphorylation of Cdk substrates, including those involved in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloom and Cross, 2007</xref>), reduction of Cdc14 function by the <italic>cdc14-3</italic> mutation would thus suppress the growth defect of <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells.</p><p>The spindles in telophase <italic>cdc14-3</italic> cells appeared relatively short and broken because spindle association of Sli15 is required for spindle stability during anaphase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pereira and Schiebel, 2003</xref>). In contrast, the spindles in telophase <italic>utp7-26 cdc14-3</italic> cells appeared intact and more normal in length, perhaps because the spindle association of Sli15-Myc was restored in these cells. In addition, the chromosome segregation defect (uneven chromosome segregation and lagging/bridging chromosomes) commonly seen in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells was less commonly seen or severe in <italic>utp7-26 cdc14-3</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7 A</xref>). For example, although &#x0223c;68% of <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells with separated chromosome masses exhibited uneven chromosome segregation, only &#x0223c;26% of <italic>utp7-26 cdc4-3</italic> cells with separated chromosome masses exhibited this phenotype. This observation suggests that the abnormal localization and functioning of Cdc14 in the nucleoplasm and at kinetochores of preanaphase <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells contributes to, but is not entirely responsible for, chromosome missegregation in these cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown here that the predominantly nucleolar ribosome biogenesis protein Utp7 associates with Sli15, Bir1, Cdc14, and Net1. It is present at kinetochores and is required for normal organization of kinetochore proteins and proper chromosome segregation. When Utp7 is inactivated, Cdc14 is no longer sequestered in the nucleolus before anaphase onset, and Sli15 becomes concentrated prematurely on preanaphase spindles and on cytoplasmic microtubules. However, premature targeting of Sli15 to the preanaphase spindle of <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells is not caused entirely by the premature nucleolar release and activation of Cdc14.</p><sec><title>Utp7 and nucleolar sequestration of Cdc14</title><p>Cdc14 is sequestered and kept inactive from G1 to metaphase in the nucleolus as part of the RENT complex, which also contains Net1 and Sir2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Straight et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Visintin et al., 1999</xref>). We show here that inactivation of Utp7 in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells leads to perturbation of the organization of Net1 mostly within the nucleolus and release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus through all cell cycle stages. Ribosome biogenesis is defective in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells at 26 as well as 37&#x000b0;C; yet, dramatic failure in the nucleolar sequestration of Cdc14 occurs only at 37&#x000b0;C. Cdc14 nucleolar sequestration defect is apparent as soon as 10 min after shifting <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells to 37&#x000b0;C (unpublished data). The rapid onset of this phenotype is unlikely to be caused indirectly by protein synthesis problems because stopping ribosome biogenesis for 10 min would have only a minor effect on the total ribosome content in a cell. Furthermore, nucleolar sequestration of Cdc14 is not defective in the <italic>enp1-1</italic> and <italic>krr1-17</italic> SSU processome mutants.</p><p>Because Utp7 associates with Cdc14 and Net1, and these proteins are present at roughly similar abundance (&#x0223c;5,800, 8,550, and 1,590 molecules/cell for Utp7, Cdc14, and Net1, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>), Utp7 potentially may function in a stable complex with Net1 and Cdc14, with its continual presence in this complex being essential for sequestering Cdc14 in the nucleolus. We consider this unlikely because the abundance of mutant Utp7 protein in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells is very greatly reduced even at 26&#x000b0;C. Yet, dramatic failure of <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells to sequester Cdc14 occurs only at the restrictive growth temperature of 37&#x000b0;C. Thus, nucleolar sequestration of Cdc14 occurs even when the abundance of Utp7 is much lower than that of Net 1 and Cdc14. Furthermore, extensive mass spectrometric analysis of the purified RENT complex has not identified Utp7 as a stably bound component of this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Straight et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we favor a model in which Utp7 associates somewhat loosely or transiently with the RENT complex to regulate its stability. In <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells, association between Net1 and mutant Utp7 protein is unaffected; whereas the association between Cdc14 and mutant Utp7 is reduced at 26&#x000b0;C and becomes undetectable at 37&#x000b0;C. Thus, the ability of Utp7 to associate with Cdc14 appears to be important for the nucleolar sequestration of Cdc14 by Net1.</p><p>As part of the activation of the FEAR network upon anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</xref>), the sister chromatid&#x02013;separating protease separase associates with and down-regulates the activity of the PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> protein phosphatase toward Net1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>), thus allowing phosphorylation of Net1 by mitotic Cdk and partial nucleolar release of Cdc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzam et al., 2004</xref>). At the end of M phase, activation of the mitotic exit network (MEN) leads to further nucleolar release of Cdc14, probably involving phosphorylation of Cdc14 or Net1 by protein kinases in this network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</xref>). Utp7 potentially may inhibit untimely activation of the FEAR or MEN. However, we have not been able to detect changes in the electrophoretic mobility (and thus phosphorylation state) of Cdc14 and Net1 in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. Furthermore, unlike inactivation of Utp7, ectopic activation of the FEAR network (except by <italic>net1</italic> mutation) does not lead to nucleolar release of Cdc14 in G1 or S phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Visintin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stegmeier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>). It remains to be determined whether untimely nucleolar release of Cdc14 in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells requires functional components of the FEAR or MEN.</p></sec><sec><title>Utp7 and Sli15 localization</title><p>Inactivation of Utp7 in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells affects the localization of Sli15 in two important ways. Sli15 becomes abnormally localized on cytoplasmic microtubules in all cell cycle stages. This abnormal localization potentially can be caused by a defect in the nuclear import or nuclear retention of a fraction of Sli15, which contains a putative nuclear localization signal and binds microtubules in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, the cytoplasmic microtubule localization of Sli15 is dependent on Cdc14 function in telophase but not preanaphase <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. It remains to be determined how Utp7 and Cdc14 prevent cytoplasmic microtubule localization of Sli15.</p><p>Sli15 becomes concentrated on the spindle prematurely before anaphase onset in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. This is not a surprising result because Cdc14 is not sequestered in the nucleolus of these <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells, and ectopic Cdc14 activation and dephosphorylation of Sli15 is known to be sufficient to redistribute Sli15 from kinetochores to the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pereira and Schiebel, 2003</xref>). However, Cdc14 function is not absolutely required for the concentration of Sli15 on the spindle of HU-arrested preanaphase or late-anaphase <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. Thus, Utp7 regulates the spindle localization of Sli15 in two redundant ways, one through its effect on the nucleolar sequestration of Cdc14 and another through a mechanism that is independent of Cdc14 function.</p><p>We have shown that Sli15 is hyper-phosphorylated in HU-arrested preanaphase <italic>cdc14-3</italic> cells. This surprising result suggests that a small amount of active Cdc14 may actually be present outside the nucleolus before anaphase onset, or that Sli15 somehow has access to active nucleolar Cdc14 in wild-type cells. Although Sli15 is undetectable in the nucleolus of yeast cells, the human homologue of Sli15 (INCENP) is present in the nucleolus of interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodriguez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wong et al., 2007</xref>) and in highly purified preparations of nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, Sli15 (Ipl1 and Bir1) may also shuttle transiently through the yeast nucleolus in preanaphase cells.</p><p>Importantly, the phosphorylation state of Sli15 in HU-arrested preanaphase <italic>utp7-26 cdc14-3</italic> cells is intermediate between that of wild-type and <italic>cdc14-3</italic> cells. Thus, Utp7 can regulate Sli15 phosphorylation independent of Cdc14 function, suggesting that Utp7 also negatively regulates another protein phosphatase (APP) that dephosphorylates Sli15 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In this model, APP becomes hyperactive, or active at an inappropriate location or cell cycle stage (e.g., before anaphase onset) in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. When de-regulated, APP dephosphorylates Sli15 at (some of) the Cdk sites normally dephosphorylated by Cdc14, thus leading to the association of Sli15 with the spindle even when Cdc14 is inactive (e.g., in preanaphase <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells or anaphase <italic>utp7-26 cdc14-3</italic> cells). Interestingly, Glc7, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1, is concentrated in the nucleolus where Utp7 is concentrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloecher and Tatchell, 2000</xref>), and we have shown previously that Glc7 counteracts Ipl1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Francisco et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tung et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, Glc7 is a potential regulatory target of Utp7. In an alternative model, Utp7 may positively regulate an unknown kinase that phosphorylates Sli15.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for the regulation of Sli15 phosphorylation and localization by Utp7.</bold> APP &#x0003d; another protein phosphatase.

This severe perturbation of kinetochore structure almost certainly contributes to chromosome missegregation in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. The premature nucleolar release of Cdc14, which is known to cause Sli15 to redistribute from kinetochores to the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pereira and Schiebel, 2003</xref>), potentially explains the reduced centromere association for Sli15 in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. Because the centromere association of Bim1, Dam1, Kip1, Ndc80, and Sli15 is abolished or reduced in <italic>sli15-3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emanuele et al., 2008</xref>), the reduced centromere association of Sli15 in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells would in turn lead to the reduced centromere association of Bim1, Dam1, Kip1, and Ndc80 in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. However, the centromere association of Ctf19 is totally abolished in <italic>utp7-26</italic> but is unaffected in <italic>sli15-3</italic> cells, and the centromere association of Ipl1 is totally abolished in <italic>sli15-3</italic> but is unaffected in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. Thus, the effect of the <italic>utp7-26</italic> mutation on kinetochore organization does not act entirely through Sli15. It is possible that the premature nucleolar release and centromere association of Cdc14 in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells directly contributes to the loss of centromere association for Ctf19 (and possibly other kinetochore proteins). Premature nucleolar release of Cdc14 may also contribute to chromosome missegregation by affecting microtubule dynamics through its action on spindle-associated proteins such as Fin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Higuchi and Uhlmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woodbury and Morgan, 2007</xref>).</p><p>For four reasons, we think that the chromosome segregation defects observed in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells are unlikely to be caused entirely by the untimely activation of Cdc14 in these cells. First, inactivation of Cdc14 by the <italic>cdc14-3</italic> mutation only partially suppresses the chromosome segregation defects of <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. Second, inactivation of Cdc14 by the <italic>cdc14-3</italic> mutation only partially restores the centromere association of Sli15 in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells. Third, ectopic activation of Cdc14 by the <italic>CDC14-TAB6</italic> mutation does not lead noticeably to chromosome missegregation (unpublished data). Fourth, Utp7 itself associates with kinetochores. Thus, Utp7 most likely also regulates chromosome segregation through a mechanism that is independent of untimely Cdc14 activation. Because Utp7 associates with Sli15 and Bir1, and expression of GST-Utp7 reduces abundance of Ipl1, Utp7 may compete with Ipl1 for binding to Sli15 and thus directly regulates Sli15 complex function at kinetochores. In addition, overexpression of Glc7 causes severe chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Francisco et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tung et al., 1995</xref>). If Utp7 negatively regulates Glc7 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), de-regulated Glc7 in <italic>utp7-26</italic> cells also would contribute to chromosome missegregation in these cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Ribosome biogenesis and other cellular processes</title><p>Ribosome biogenesis is an extremely energy-intensive process, consuming up to 80% of the energy of a rapidly growing eukaryotic cell.

In this context, the physical and functional interactions between Utp7, the Sli15/INCENP and RENT complexes suggest a potential functional link of ribosome biogenesis to the processes of chromosome segregation and cell cycle control. Because Utp7, Sli15, and Cdc14 are conserved from yeast to humans, this potential functional link may extend to other organisms.
