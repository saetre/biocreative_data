Arg catabolism produces ornithine (Orn) inside mitochondria, which was discussed controversially as a precursor for Pro biosynthesis, alternative to glutamate (Glu).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show here that ornithine-&#x003b4;-aminotransferase (&#x003b4;OAT, At5g46180), the enzyme converting Orn to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), is localised in mitochondria and is essential for Arg catabolism. Wildtype plants could readily catabolise supplied Arg and Orn and were able to use these amino acids as the only nitrogen source. Deletion mutants of &#x003b4;<italic>OAT</italic>, however, accumulated urea cycle intermediates when fed with Arg or Orn and were not able to utilize nitrogen provided as Arg or Orn. Utilisation of urea and stress induced Pro accumulation were not affected in T-DNA insertion mutants with a complete loss of &#x003b4;<italic>OAT </italic>expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings indicate that &#x003b4;OAT feeds P5C exclusively into the catabolic branch of Pro metabolism, which yields Glu as an end product. Conversion of Orn to Glu is an essential route for recovery of nitrogen stored or transported as Arg. Pro biosynthesis occurs predominantly or exclusively via the Glu pathway in Arabidopsis and does not depend on Glu produced by Arg and Orn catabolism.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Amino acids are required for protein biosynthesis, but have also additional functions like nitrogen storage and transport. Proline (Pro) and the non-proteinogenic &#x003b3;-aminobutyrate are also used as compatible osmolytes that are accumulated by many plant species in response to water deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Arginine (Arg) and Arg-rich proteins serve as an important storage form of organic nitrogen in many plants, especially in seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Additionally, Arg or ornithine (Orn) are the precursors for the synthesis of spermine, spermidine and related polyamines, which are essential for sexual reproduction and additionally play important roles in stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Therefore, biosynthesis and degradation of amino acids is embedded in a complex metabolic and regulatory network that allows the plant to serve all the requirements of growth and environmental adaptation.</p><p>The primary pathways for amino acid biosynthesis and degradation in plants were mainly deduced by identifying genes or enzyme activities homologous to prokaryotic or fungal model systems. However, the localisation of metabolic pathways in different compartments within the plant cell is still not satisfyingly clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additional complications arise from the possibility of substrate channelling in multi-enzyme complexes that could separate individual pathways despite the use of common metabolites.</p><p>Arg biosynthesis seems to be localised predominantly in plastids, with some ambiguous localisation prediction of enzymes in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Arg decarboxylases (ADC1 &#x00026; 2), the committing enzymes for polyamine synthesis in Arabidopsis have a predicted localisation in the cytosol or chloroplast (SubCellular Proteomic Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]), whereas Arg catabolism takes place in mitochondria via arginase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Arginase produces urea, which is further degraded by urease in the cytoplasm, and Orn, which could be exported from mitochondria to re-enter Arg biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Two transporters for basic amino acids that could mediate exchange of Arg and Orn across the mitochondrial inner membrane have been identified by complementation of a yeast Arg11 mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Pro is mainly synthesised in the cytosol from glutamate (Glu) via pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) by the sequential action of P5C synthetase (P5CS) and P5C reductase (P5CR). In Arabidopsis, two isoforms of P5CS are present, with P5CS2 as a housekeeping isoform and P5CS1 being responsible for the accumulation of Pro in response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In response to osmotic stress, P5CS1 becomes re-localised to plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. For degradation, Pro is imported into mitochondria where it is converted back to Glu by Pro-dehydrogenase (ProDH) and P5C-dehydrogenase (P5CDH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. There is also evidence for a pathway of Pro synthesis from Orn, and Orn-&#x003b4;-aminotransferase (&#x003b4;OAT) has been implicated in this pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. &#x003b4;OAT transfers the &#x003b4;-amino group of Orn to &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate or related &#x003b1;-keto acids, thereby forming glutamate-5-semialdehyde (GSA) and Glu. The equilibrium of this reaction was found far on the GSA/Glu side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. GSA is in spontaneous equilibrium with the cyclic P5C, which is the common intermediate in Pro biosynthesis and degradation. Formation of GSA/P5C from Orn was postulated to constitute an alternative pathway of Pro synthesis and accumulation, with Arg or Orn instead of Glu as precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The first gene encoding a plant &#x003b4;OAT was cloned from a moth bean cDNA library by functional complementation of an <italic>E. coli </italic>Pro-auxotroph strain deficient in the conversion of Glu to P5C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Sequence similarity to mammalian and bacterial enzymes strongly suggested that the gene encoded a &#x003b4;OAT rather than an &#x003b1;OAT. Recently, heterologous expression of the moth bean &#x003b4;OAT in <italic>E. coli </italic>revealed that its activity was inhibited by serine, isoleucine and valine, but not Pro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The Arabidopsis <italic>&#x003b4;OAT </italic>gene (At5g46180) was identified by sequence comparison and was found to be upregulated in young seedlings and in response to salt stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, out of eleven prediction programs for subcellular localisation including mitochondria, all strongly predict a targeting of the &#x003b4;OAT protein to mitochondria, with a putative transit peptide cleavage site after Phe16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Targeting &#x003b4;OAT to mitochondria strongly suggests that P5C is fed into the Pro degradation pathway rather than into Pro biosynthesis. Additionally, radiotracer experiments with externally supplied Orn indicated that Pro formed from Orn preserves the &#x003b4;-amino group, whereas the &#x003b1;-amino group is lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The latter results suggested that Orn to Pro conversion proceeds via an &#x003b1;OAT.</p><p>On the other hand, transgenic tobacco and rice plants overexpressing the Arabidopsis <italic>&#x003b4;OAT </italic>gene had increased Pro content and increased stress tolerance, supporting the concept that Orn conversion can contribute to Pro accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Use of gabaculine as a potent inhibitor of &#x003b4;OAT suggested that in radish cotyledons Orn conversion could contribute to salt-induced Pro accumulation, whereas in rice leaves this pathway was probably of minor importance or not at all active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. None of the studies published at present directly investigated the subcellular localisation of &#x003b4;OAT or provided strong evidence for a physiological function of &#x003b4;OAT in Pro synthesis in non-transgenic plants.</p><p>In the present study we have analysed the physiological function of &#x003b4;OAT in Arabidopsis. We provide experimental confirmation of the predicted localisation of &#x003b4;OAT in mitochondria using a &#x003b4;OAT-GFP fusion protein. With the use of loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutants we demonstrate that &#x003b4;OAT is essential for nitrogen recycling from Arg, whereas it does not seem to contribute to Pro biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Ornithine-&#x003b4;-aminotransferase is localised in mitochondria</title><p>As a first step to determine the physiological function of &#x003b4;OAT we determined the subcellular localisation of the enzyme.

Due to the chemical instability of GSA/P5C, an export of this intermediate to the cytosol and thus a contribution to Pro synthesis appears rather unlikely. To obtain direct evidence for the physiological function of &#x003b4;OAT, we identified and characterised loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutants. We found that the T-DNA insertion lines SALK_033541 (<italic>oat1</italic>) and SALK_106295 (<italic>oat3</italic>) carry inverted tandem repeats of the T-DNA in the 1<sup>st </sup>intron and 4<sup>th </sup>exon of <italic>&#x003b4;OAT</italic>, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Segregation analysis confirmed the absence of further T-DNA insertions in <italic>oat1 </italic>and <italic>oat3 </italic>after repeated backcrossing to wildtype Col-0 (data not shown). Plants homozygous for the T-DNA insertions were identified by PCR on genomic DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In both lines, the T-DNA insertion resulted in the complete loss of transcript accumulation as demonstrated by northern blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C&#x02013;D</xref>). The probe used covers 351 bp of the conserved domain of pyridoxal-dependent aminotransferases and did not detect any native or truncated transcripts in both lines, thus excluding the translation of any active protein from the <italic>&#x003b4;OAT </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). In transgenic lines expressing the <italic>&#x003b4;OAT-GFP </italic>fusion construct, the <italic>&#x003b4;OAT </italic>probe detected the native mRNA and a band with higher molecular weight corresponding to the <italic>&#x003b4;OAT-GFP </italic>transcript.

Still, it was important to analyse OAT activity in the <italic>oat1 </italic>and <italic>oat3 </italic>knockout mutants. In whole plant extracts of 2-week-old wildtype seedlings, a weak but significant OAT activity was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). In <italic>oat1 </italic>and <italic>oat3 </italic>extracts, OAT activity was not significantly increased over control values and accounted for maximally 1/10 of the wildtype activity.

Homozygous plants of both <italic>oat1 </italic>and <italic>oat3 </italic>mutant lines showed no obvious phenotypical differences from the wildtype under greenhouse conditions, demonstrating that &#x003b4;OAT-activity is not essential for the normal life cycle of Arabidopsis (data no shown).</p><p>To investigate a potential function of &#x003b4;OAT in stress-induced Pro accumulation, we cultivated wildtype, <italic>oat1 </italic>and <italic>oat3 </italic>in sterile culture on media containing increasing amounts of NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The mutants displayed similar sensitivity towards NaCl as the wildtype and seedling establishment was almost completely blocked in all three genotypes by the addition of more than 100 mM NaCl. Quantification of free Pro content in 3-week-old plants revealed no significant differences between wildtype and <italic>oat </italic>mutants, neither under control conditions nor after salt stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In all three genotypes the content of free Pro was increased approximately 3-fold by the addition of 100 mM NaCl. Similar Fw/Dw ratios in wildtype and <italic>oat </italic>mutants under all salt concentrations further supported an equal stress tolerance in both genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These findings indicate that &#x003b4;OAT does not contribute significantly to stress-induced Pro biosynthesis <italic>in vivo </italic>during salt stress.

Co-localisation with the Arg-breakdown pathway in mitochondria suggested a putative function of &#x003b4;OAT in recycling of nitrogen stored as Arg. To test if &#x003b4;OAT functions in Arg catabolism, we grew wildtype and <italic>oat </italic>mutant seedlings in sterile culture with Arg, Orn or urea as the sole source of nitrogen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

With 10 mM Orn as the only nitrogen source, growth of the wildtype was even more retarded and <italic>oat </italic>mutants were arrested in development at the same stage as on Arg-containing plates. Urea could be used equally well by all three analysed genotypes. These findings demonstrated that <italic>oat </italic>mutants could not use Arg or Orn as nitrogen sources for growth.

As expected, free Gln accumulated in plants cultivated on 10 mM Gln, while most other amino acids were present at similar levels as in plants cultivated on 20 mM mineral nitrogen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, and data not shown).

The most striking differences between the wildtype and the <italic>oat </italic>mutants were observed when Arg or Orn were supplied externally. Under these conditions, <italic>oat </italic>mutants accumulated Orn, citrulline (Cit) and Arg. Cit and Orn levels were 34 to 163-fold higher in <italic>oat </italic>mutants than in the wildtype, whereas Arg was increased 6 to 21-fold. Also for leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and lysine significant, although smaller, increases were observed. Gln, aspartate and Pro were the only amino acids for which significantly lower levels were observed in <italic>oat </italic>mutants cultivated on Orn or Arg. Based on these amino acid profiles, we conclude that &#x003b4;OAT constitutes a major and possibly the only exit route of nitrogen from Orn or Arg. Accumulation of Cit indicated that Orn and Arg were metabolised after uptake, most likely by enzymes of the urea cycle.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acids profiles of <italic>oat </italic>mutants grown on different nitrogen sources</bold>.

However, the exact biochemical pathway and contributing enzymes are subject to controversial debate. While the majority of publications assume that &#x003b4;OAT produces GSA from Orn, which spontaneously forms P5C and is then converted to Pro by P5CR, this hypothesis neglected the localisation of both enzymes to different compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In favour of this concept, transgenic plants overexpressing &#x003b4;OAT had higher Pro contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To date, the exact source of Pro accumulating in these &#x003b4;OAT overexpressors has not been determined. We demonstrated here that two T-DNA insertion mutants lacked detectable <italic>&#x003b4;OAT </italic>expression and showed insignificant P5C production from Orn and &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate in whole seedling protein extracts.

P5C produced by &#x003b4;OAT inside mitochondria is most probably further converted to Glu by mitochondrial P5CDH. Due to the chemical instability of GSA/P5C, export from mitochondria seems unlikely but can currently not be fully excluded. P5C stimulated O<sub>2 </sub>uptake of isolated intact mitochondria, but very little P5C was produced from Orn or Pro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Orn- or Pro-dependent P5C production and P5C-dependent NAD reduction were measurable only after swelling of mitochondria in low osmolarity buffer, which was attributed to the disruption of ProDH-P5CDH and &#x003b4;OAT-P5CDH enzyme complexes. The impact of swelling on the permeability of the mitochondrial membranes for P5C was not analysed. In &#x003b4;OAT overexpressing plants, non-complexed &#x003b4;OAT could indeed lead to the release of P5C from mitochondria and subsequent conversion to Pro by cytosolic P5CR. Alternatively, the use of the Arabidopsis <italic>&#x003b4;OAT </italic>gene for overexpression in tobacco or rice could have resulted in incomplete import into mitochondria and thus cytosolic &#x003b4;OAT-activity.</p><p>Evidence against a role of &#x003b4;OAT in the conversion of Orn to Pro had already come from tracing experiments using differentially labelled <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>3</sup>H-Orn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Only when the &#x003b4;-amino group of Orn was labelled with <sup>3</sup>H, substantial <sup>3</sup>H activity could be recovered in the Pro fraction. These findings are consistent with the activity of a putative &#x003b1;-aminotransferase that would produce pyrroline-2-carboxylate as an intermediate, or an Orn-cyclodeaminase, which would produce Pro directly. However, long incubation times and possible isotope discrimination effects do not allow excluding the participation of &#x003b4;OAT completely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <sup>3</sup>H labelled Pro could have also been formed from <sup>3</sup>H Glu that was formed when &#x003b4;OAT transferred the labelled amino group to &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate. Feeding radioactive Arg or Orn to control or wilted barley leaves indicated that the Orn to Pro conversion was not enhanced by water deficit and that the C-skeleton of Arg contributed maximally 1% of the accumulating Pro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These findings are in line with our observation that &#x003b4;OAT deficient mutants retain unchanged levels of salt stress-induced Pro accumulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We propose that under normal physiological conditions Orn can be converted to Pro only via Glu, while this conversion is not contributing substantially to stress-induced Pro accumulation. In addition, <italic>oat </italic>mutants provide an excellent tool to investigate if mitochondrial Orn (e.g. from Arg degradation) or externally supplied Orn can be converted to Pro by alternative pathways. Absence of significant amounts of colour development in our OAT assay with <italic>oat </italic>mutant extracts indicated that such alternative pathways are not catalysed by soluble proteins or require different substrates and cofactors. Alternatively, the expression could be too low in young seedlings.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b4;OAT constitutes an essential exit route for nitrogen from the urea cycle</title><p>Having dismissed the most popular hypothesis for the physiological function of &#x003b4;OAT, we set out to analyse an alternative function in Arg degradation. Arg is effectively taken up from the medium by Arabidopsis roots and distributed to aboveground organs, presumably via transporters of the LHT rather than AAP subfamilies of broad specificity amino acid permeases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The first step of Arg breakdown is the cleavage into Orn and urea by arginase, which is localised in mitochondria in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Urea can be further degraded by cytosolic urease, and urea supported growth of <italic>oat </italic>mutants and the wildtype equally well (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). No information is currently available on the export of urea from mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, further catabolism of Orn, the second product of arginase, seems to depend on &#x003b4;OAT activity since neither Arg nor Orn supported growth of <italic>oat </italic>mutants. Instead, intermediates of the urea cycle accumulated to high amounts, indicating that &#x003b4;OAT is required for Arg catabolism and nitrogen recycling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Other metabolites that can be produced from Arg are polyamines, but apparently these are not metabolised further or the capacity of this pathway is too low to supply enough nitrogen to meet the demand of growing <italic>oat </italic>mutant seedlings.</p><p>Evaluation of microarray expression data using the BAR eFP-Browser revealed strongest expression of <italic>&#x003b4;OAT </italic>in senescing rosette leaves, floral organs and mature and imbibed seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Within the developing embryo, strong <italic>&#x003b4;OAT </italic>expression was detected in cotyledons. These data further support a function of &#x003b4;OAT in storage mobilisation during early seedling development and in nitrogen recovery during senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Amino acid interconversions and distribution</title><p>Orn was less effective than Arg in supporting growth of wildtype Arabidopsis seedlings, which was reflected in generally lower amino acid contents in plants cultured on Orn as the main nitrogen source (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This difference to Arg supply could arise from lower uptake rates or impaired inter- or intracellular distribution of Orn. Orn is synthesised in plastids, where it is also further converted to Arg, whereas production of Orn during Arg degradation occurs in mitochondria. Thus high rates of intracellular Orn transport and the occurrence of high Orn concentrations in the cytosol are unlikely to happen under natural conditions. Two members of the mitochondrial carrier protein-family, AtBac1 and AtBac2, were shown to mediate transport of Arg and Orn along with other basic amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Both transporters were able to complement a yeast strain deficient in the mitochondrial Orn/Arg transporter Arg11, suggesting mitochondrial localisation also in plants. The high levels of Cit and Arg in <italic>oat </italic>mutants cultivated on Orn suggested import of Orn into plastids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). A reversed reaction of arginase is thermodynamically unfavourable and could not be observed with purified enzyme preparations even in the presence of both Orn and urea in high concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Orn to Cit conversion was previously observed in purified mitochondria and could constitute an alternative pathway to direct Orn import into plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. High levels of Cit after Arg feeding of <italic>oat </italic>mutants indicate that Orn originating from Arg breakdown is terminally converted to Cit inside mitochondria or is transferred from mitochondria to plastids. Substantial production of Cit by reversion of the argininosuccinate synthetase reaction from the Arg biosynthesis pathway is unlikely due to the low pyrophosphate levels in plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Synthesis of Arg from Orn requires two atoms of nitrogen per molecule of Arg, thus requiring net N-input in case of Orn feeding. This is consistent with the extreme Gln depletion of <italic>oat </italic>mutants fed with Orn (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>Irrespective of the nitrogen source provided, <italic>oat </italic>mutants had an increased content in Orn, indicating that catabolism of Arg is constitutively operative in wildtype plants. Surprising were the decreased levels of Arg in <italic>oat </italic>mutants grown on Gln or urea (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Arg biosynthesis is subject to feedback inhibition by the end product at the level of N-acetyl glutamate kinase, which catalyses the key regulatory step of Arg biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Arg mediated inhibition of N-acetyl glutamate kinase can be alleviated by the plastidic PII protein, but the precise role of this interaction in regulating Arg biosynthesis is yet unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The block in mitochondrial Arg catabolism in <italic>oat </italic>mutants potentially leads to an altered C/N ratio in plastids or a localised increase in Arg concentrations, which in turn could reduce the total rate of Arg biosynthesis. Recently a genetically encoded nanosensor for Arg was developed, that can be used to report cytosolic, mitochondrial or plastidic Arg levels in wildtype and <italic>oat </italic>mutants under various nutrition regimes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Also the significant increase in the contents of leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and lysine in Orn-fed, and partially also in Arg-fed, <italic>oat </italic>mutants indicated disturbances of amino acid metabolism. All increased amino acids have high C/N ratios, consistent with a deficiency of <italic>oat </italic>mutants to mobilise nitrogen from Orn and Arg.</p><p>The complete degradation of Arg via arginase, &#x003b4;OAT and P5CDH yields two molecules of Glu per molecule of Arg. Despite the consequential massive differences in mitochondrial Glu production between wildtype and <italic>oat </italic>mutants grown on Arg or Orn, Glu levels were the same in both genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Similar Glu homeostasis was observed in many studies on nitrogen nutrition, environmental stress or mutant analyses and was proposed to indicate a special regulatory function of Glu levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The insensitivity of Glu levels to the deletion of &#x003b4;OAT is presumably the prerequisite for the unchanged capacity of <italic>oat </italic>mutants to accumulate Pro under stress conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Decades of biochemical analyses have produced the basis for our understanding of plant primary metabolism and are now complemented by genomic, proteomic and metabolomic approaches. Still, the compartmentation of metabolic processes to specific organelles or protein supercomplexes is far from being fully uncovered. Determination of the exact role of a specific enzyme in the metabolic and regulatory networks of plant cells still requires careful and thorough gene for gene analysis. We show here that Arg and Pro catabolism are co-localised in mitochondria and converge in the formation of GSA/P5C, which is further metabolised to Glu by P5CDH. The detection of unchanged Pro levels in Arabidopsis <italic>oat </italic>mutants provides strong evidence against a shortcut from Arg catabolism to Pro synthesis that bypasses Glu and cytosolic P5CS activity. It remains to be investigated if other plant species with more than one <italic>P5CDH </italic>or <italic>OAT </italic>gene have differently localised isoforms and thus other metabolic possibilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>(L.)
