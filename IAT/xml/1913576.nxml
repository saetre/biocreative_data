The procedure for generating aqueous C<sub>60</sub> with THF was modified from a previously reported method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ehp0115-001059">Deguchi et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ehp0115-001059">Fortner et al. 2005</xref>) as follows: approximately 12.5 mg of C<sub>60</sub> was added to 500 mL of fresh THF in a 1-L amber bottle and sparged with UHP (ultra high purity) nitrogen to remove oxygen. The resealed amber bottles [THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> and THF&#x02013;water (vehicle control)] were stirred for 24 hr at ambient temperature. Fish water (350 mL) was added to each bottle and sparged with UHP nitrogen for 1 hr, then stirred for 24 hr at room temperature. A B&#x000fc;chi Rotavap system (B&#x000fc;chi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland) was used to remove THF, in the dark, at 65&#x000b0;C, and the resulting solutions (THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> and THF&#x02013;water) were sparged with nitrogen for 2.5 days before use in toxicity tests. Solutions of C<sub>60</sub>&#x02013;water were allowed to settle and were carefully pipetted to avoid resuspension of any visible aggregates before addition of fish water to prepare dilutions for exposures. The THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> stock solution did not have any visible (naked eye) aggregates, and dilutions with highest concentrations of THF C<sub>60</sub> had a visible amber color. Examination of THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> solution with an enhanced dark-field microscopy system (Cytoviva, Auburn, AL) designed to resolve particles &#x0003c; 100 nm, demonstrated particle aggregates approximately equal to 0.5&#x02013;3 times the size of latex nanoparticles of 100 nm examined under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0115-001059">Figure 1A, B</xref>).

At higher concentrations (&#x0003e; 5%) in THF&#x02013;water and THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>, lethal effects were observed within 60 min, and fish typically had arched backs and occasionally had severe yolk-sac and pericardial edema. In concentrations with significant partial mortality (i.e., 5% exposure concentration), surviving fish were lethargic, laterally recumbent, and typically had minor to severe yolk-sac and/or pericardial edema. Swimming movements were limited to abrupt spasms that occurred only when fish were disturbed. Fish exposed to concentrations of 1% appeared more lethargic than control fish but did not have any grossly visible indications of toxicity (e.g., tissue edema, or uncoordinated swimming).

Array data files were uploaded to the Stanford microarray database installed at the University of Tennessee Microarray Database (UT-MD) and are available for public access (UT-MD 2007). Genes not assigned by gene ontology to a biological process, cellular component, or molecular function (unannotated genes) included 40&#x02013;50% of the observed genes that were differentially expressed. Of the 10 genes differentially regulated in C<sub>60</sub>&#x02013;water relative to control, only 2 (both unannotated) were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0115-001059">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Some of the same genes that were differently regulated relative to the control were found in multiple treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0115-001059">Figure 5</xref>).

For the 3 genes that were in common between C<sub>60</sub>&#x02013;water and THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>, only one (Dr.3448.1.S1, Kruppel-like factor 2a, <italic>klf2a</italic>) had a similar change in expression relative to control (&#x02212;1.85-fold, THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>; &#x02212;1.78-fold, C<sub>60</sub>&#x02013;water).

In THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>, 89 genes differed significantly from control but did not differ in THF&#x02013;water compared with control; however, examination of the expression of these 89 genes in THF&#x02013;water indicated that direction of change in expression relative to the that in control was identical to THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ehp0115-001059">Figure 7A</xref>). The magnitude of change in expression for these 89 genes in THF&#x02013;water relative to that in control was &#x0003c; 1.75-fold, and therefore these genes did not meet selection criteria established for statistical analyses. The same pattern was observed for 33 of the 35 genes that were recognized in THF&#x02013;water as different from control, but that did not differ in THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> compared with control (i.e., the magnitude of expression change was &#x0003c; 1.75-fold in THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ehp0115-001059">Figure 7B</xref>).

Mortality of fish in THF treatments was concentration dependent. Analyses of water samples by GC-MS did not detect THF, and the 72-hr acute toxicity of THF determined in the dose&#x02013;response test indicated that THF is of low toxicity in larval zebrafish (LC<sub>50</sub> = 1.73%; ~ 15.4 g/L). Thus, any trace amounts of THF in THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> and THF&#x02013;water treatments did not explain the observed fish mortality. However, use of THF as a vehicle resulted in generation of substances in the water that were detected by GC-MS and could be responsible for toxic effects. Notable among these substances was &#x003b3;-butyrolactone, which was shown to be acutely toxic at low concentrations (72-hr LC<sub>50</sub>, 0.0047%; ~ 47 mg/L based on dilution of analyzed prepared solution) in larval zebrafish in this study. Estimated concentrations of &#x003b3;-butyrolactone (based on dilution of the analyzed prepared solution) at the LC<sub>50</sub> for THF&#x02013;water and THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> treatments were 10 and 5 mg/L, respectively, at the end of exposure.</p><p>&#x003b3;-Butyrolactone is a colorless liquid that is soluble in water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp0115-001059">Ciolino et al. 2001</xref>) and rapidly absorbed in mammals where it is readily converted into the neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) in several steps by enzyme action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp0115-001059">Bernasconi et al. 1999</xref>). In zebrafish, GABA receptors are responsive within 96 hr of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ehp0115-001059">Saint-Amant and Drapeau 2000</xref>) and may be involved in control of ventilatory movements during early larval zebrafish development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ehp0115-001059">Turesson et al. 2006</xref>). The toxicity of &#x003b3;-butyrolactone in zebrafish has not been investigated previously; however, unpublished data indicate acute (48 hr) toxicity in fish (golden orfe <italic>Leuciscus idus</italic>) with LC<sub>50</sub> of 275&#x02013;302 mg/L and in the daphnid <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> with an LC<sub>50</sub> of &#x0003e; 500 mg/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ehp0115-001059">Lyondell Chemical Company 2004</xref>).</p><p>The present research is the first to demonstrate that compounds other than THF or C<sub>60</sub> may be responsible for toxicity observed in treatments in which THF was used as a vehicle for C<sub>60</sub>. Toxic effects of THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> have been observed in largemouth bass <italic>Micropterus salmoides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0115-001059">Oberd&#x000f6;rster 2004</xref>), <italic>D. magna</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp0115-001059">Lovern and Klaper 2006</xref>), and in cultured cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ehp0115-001059">Sayes et al. 2004</xref>). The procedure we used to prepare THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> described here differs from previously published methods in the manner that THF was removed from the sample and assessment of any residual THF. Previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp0115-001059">Lovern and Klaper 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0115-001059">Oberd&#x000f6;rster 2004</xref>) used two sequential rotovaping and water suspension cycles followed by filtration prior to preparation of C<sub>60</sub> dilutions. Complete removal of THF was assumed and analysis for THF or THF degradation products was not performed. In the present method, subsequent to rotovaping, samples were sparged with N<sub>2</sub> for 2.5 days to ensure THF removal. Samples were analyzed with GC-MS and although no residual THF was found, THF degradation products were found. Despite the effectiveness of THF removal, THF degradation products were retained in the sample. Although it is conjectural to make statements about the previously published method because GC-MS was not performed, it is unlikely that all THF products were removed using that method. In the present study we demonstrate that THF degradation products can contribute to toxicity in THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> solutions and previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp0115-001059">Lovern and Klaper 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0115-001059">Oberd&#x000f6;rster 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ehp0115-001059">Sayes et al. 2004</xref>) cannot exclude that THF or THF degradation products did not contribute to toxic effects. It is interesting to note that the particle diameter of C<sub>60</sub> aggregates showed no significant difference between filtered and nonfiltered samples under the same sample preparation technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0115-001059">Cheng et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Most relevant to the present investigation is research in largemouth bass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0115-001059">Oberd&#x000f6;rster 2004</xref>), which indicated oxidative injury in the brain resulted after exposure to THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0115-001059">Oberd&#x000f6;rster (2004)</xref> directly determined lipid peroxidation in the brain by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay for malondialdehyde and found higher peroxidation of lipids in fish exposed to THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>. We did not investigate oxidative injury directly in zebrafish, but analyses of gene expression can provide important insight on organism physiology and be used to deduce affected metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ehp0115-001059">Brazma et al. 2001</xref>). Up-regulation of genes with antioxidant activity (including glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase) in THF&#x02013;water and THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> treatments in the present study is consistent with the hypothesis that fish were responding to defend against oxidative injury resulting from exposure to oxidative chemicals. Oxidative injury in the brains of large-mouth bass observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0115-001059">Oberd&#x000f6;rster (2004)</xref> could have resulted from oxidative substances generated by THF vehicle rather than C<sub>60</sub> directly.</p><p>Changes in global gene expression were nearly identical in THF&#x02013;water and THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> treatments, and these results indicate that fish were responding to similar exposure scenarios in both treatments. Although expression of specific genes that had significant changes in expression could be probed further with additional techniques [e.g., quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)] to clarify how a treatment affects particular genes, changes in expression appear related to the presence of THF or THF degradation products rather than C<sub>60</sub>. Therefore, further pursuit of these genes (e.g., genes listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ehp0115-001059">Table 2</xref>) as bio-markers of exposure to C<sub>60</sub> was not warranted.</p><p>THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> was more toxic than THF&#x02013;water based on larval zebrafish survival (5% concentration) and gene expression patterns (2.5% concentration). The magnitude of the change in gene expression was higher in THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> for 73% of the 182 genes that were in common between THF treatments, and of the 124 genes that differed separately from the control (89 genes THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>, 35 genes THF&#x02013;water) 72% had a higher magnitude of expression change in THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>. These results may be explained by either higher concentrations of &#x003b3;-butyrolactone (or other THF degradation products) in THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>, by presence of C<sub>60</sub>, or possibly by an interaction between the C<sub>60</sub> and &#x003b3;-butyrolactone (or other THF degradation products). The concentration of &#x003b3;-butyrolactone was higher in THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub> (stock solutions after preparation: ~ 158 ppm in THF&#x02013;C<sub>60</sub>; ~ 103 ppm in THF&#x02013;water); this could have resulted from differences in evaporation of water during preparation (particularly during N<sub>2</sub> sparging) or, perhaps, the presence of C<sub>60</sub> enhanced the formation of &#x003b3;-butyrolactone. This investigation was not designed to determine if C<sub>60</sub> could influence formation of &#x003b3;-butyrolactone; however, further investigation into this possibility is warranted.</p><p>Larval zebrafish exposed to C<sub>60</sub> (C<sub>60</sub>&#x02013;water treatment) did not die as a result of exposure, and gene expression changes relative to the control were relatively minimal. Of the 10 genes with altered expression, only 2 genes were up-regulated and the function of these genes was unknown (unannotated). Further investigation is required to determine if these two up-regulated genes indicate exposure to aqueous C<sub>60</sub> aggregates and the physiologic importance of those biochemical pathways. For the 8 down-regulated genes, 3 were related by electronic annotation to a known function. Modulation of the heat-shock gene indicates a general stress response; however, down-regulation of this gene is difficult to interpret. Similarly, down-regulation of the gene that codes for an RNA binding factor and the gene with homology to a Kruppel-like factor (KLF) is difficult to interpret but could suggest a global modulation of transcription in response to C<sub>60</sub> exposure (although changes in global modulation of transcription is not supported by changes in expression in other genes). The KLF family of transcription factors bind to Sp1 sequences, modulations of which have been implicated in growth-related signal transduction pathways as well as apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumorgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ehp0115-001059">Black et al. 2001</xref>). The rather minimal change in global gene expression observed when zebrafish larvae were exposed to C<sub>60</sub>&#x02013;water indicates that the exposure scenario used in this investigation had only minimal effects on the fish. Longer exposures to C<sub>60</sub> or other exposure scenarios (different species, life history stages) may result in different effects. A final point is as that changes in gene expression were investigated after a 72-hr exposure, presumably the expression of these genes (and likely other genes) will be affected differently after different exposure durations and at different zebrafish life history stages.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ehp0115-001059"><citation
