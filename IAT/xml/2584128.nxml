A complex neuroendocrine system underlies this process and regulates energy homeostasis in mammals. In addition to sensing hormonal signals of stored fuels, such as leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>), specific populations of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), and particularly within the hypothalamus, have the ability to sense locally available nutrients, including glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>), fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>), and amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence has highlighted the role of intracellular fuel sensing in the regulation of energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). In particular, the biochemical pathway underlying fatty acid metabolism has been involved in the regulation of both feeding and glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Fatty acid synthase (FAS) catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA to generate long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and FAS are expressed in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>), where malonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>) and LCFA-CoA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>) decrease during fasting and increase after refeeding. Studies using FAS inhibitors and other pharmacological or genetic tools that modify the activity of different enzymes regulating fatty acid metabolism support a role for this pathway in the regulation of feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>).</p><p>Peripheral administration of the natural FAS inhibitor cerulenin (2,3-epoxy-4-oxo-6-dodecadienoylamide) or the synthetic inhibitor C75 (trans-4-carboxy-5-octyl-3-methylenebutyrolactone) causes profound dose-dependent anorexia and weight loss in several rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). Reduced food intake is also observed with central administration of much lower doses of C75, suggesting that the brain is the key site of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Increased hypothalamic malonyl-CoA is necessary for the anorexic and weight-reducing effects of FAS inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). Interestingly, the ability of leptin to reduce food intake depends on increased hypothalamic malonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>) and possibly palmitoyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>), which are achieved through the concomitant inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and activation of ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Therefore, the hypothalamic fatty acid synthesis pathway appears to process different fuel signals and convert them into efferent outputs that prevent further consumption of nutrients.</p><p>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that controls critical aspects of cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). mTOR is a component of at least two multiprotein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which includes raptor, and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which includes rictor. Whereas mTORC2 regulates phosphorylation of Akt, mTORC1 modulates the activity of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and 4E binding protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). Notably, the phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr 389 is one of the markers commonly used to evaluate mTORC1 activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). Insulin, IGF, amino acids, and glucose all activate intracellular cascades that lead to activation of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). We reported that the anorexic action of central leptin and leucine are both dependent on the activation of mTORC1 signaling in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Given the ability of mTORC1 to sense and integrate fuel signals, and the role it plays in controlling food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>), we hypothesized that mTORC1 signaling is involved in monitoring the biochemical changes induced by the modulation of hypothalamic fatty acid metabolism.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals.</title><p>Adult male Long-Evans rats, <italic>S6K1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and their wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>) were used. Mice were 8&#x02013;11 weeks old in the cerulenin study and 7 months old in the C75 study. All animals were housed individually and maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle, standard lab chow (Harlan-Teklad, Indianapolis, IN), and water. All animal procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the University of Cincinnati. Rats were implanted with intracerebroventricular (icv) cannulas as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>) and allowed to recover for a minimum of 7 days.

Samples (70 &#x003bc;g) were loaded on either a 9&#x02013;13&#x00025; (experiment 1) or a 10&#x00025; (experiments 3 and 4) SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>) before overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C with either phosphorylated S6K1 (pS6K1) at Thr 389 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) or phosphorylated S6 (pS6) at Ser 240/244 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology). After washing in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST), the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (goat anti-rabbit; 1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology). After washes in TBST, immunopositive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Lumiglo reagent and peroxide kit; Cell Signaling Technology) using exposure to radiographic films (Denville Scientific, South Plainfield, NJ). After protein detection, membranes were stripped for 15 min at 55&#x000b0;C with a solution containing 62.5 mmol/l Tris-HCl, 100 mmol/l 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2&#x00025; SDS before 2-h blocking in TBST with 5&#x00025; skim milk powder at room temperature and reblotted with either rabbit anti&#x02013;p70-S6K1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:250) or rabbit anti-S6 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology).

There was a trend for an interaction between genotype and drug on feeding at 4 h, which reached significance at 24 h (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 13)</sub> &#x0003d; 15.84, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>) and was also found for weight loss (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 13)</sub> &#x0003d; 10.61, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>). The observation that two different FAS inhibitors modulate hypothalamic mTORC1 and require mTORC1 signaling for their anorexic action makes a strong case for a link between mTORC1 and FAS in the regulation of feeding.</p></sec><sec><title>The actions of C75 on hypothalamic mTORC1 signaling are blunted in ketotic rats.</title><p>We had previously hypothesized that a key signal leading to C75-induced anorexia is derived, at least in part, from its ability to increase CNS glucose utilization, and we demonstrated that C75 does not reduce food intake under ketosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Here, we explored the possibility that this is due to inability to modulate CNS mTORC1 signaling. Blood &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate was significantly elevated in rats given access to saccharin versus sucrose (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). There was a main effect of drug on food intake at 4 h (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,28)</sub> &#x0003d; 12.74, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and at 24 h (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,28)</sub> &#x0003d; 9.33, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Consistent with its effect on chow, C75 reduced caloric intake in rats whose ketosis was prevented by access to sucrose (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and this effect lasted for 24 h. However, the caloric-reducing effect of C75 was blunted in ketotic rats receiving saccharin at 4 (data not shown) and 24 h (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>) and was nearly statistically different from that of rats in the sucrose group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.059; <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). These effects were accompanied by reduced hypothalamic mTORC1 signaling in ketotic rats compared with sucrose rats. There was a main effect of drug on pS6K1 (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,27)</sub> &#x0003d; 5.56, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and pS6 (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> &#x0003d; 27.19; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The effect of diet (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> &#x0003d; 3.89, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.059) and the interaction between drug and diet (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> &#x0003d; 3.92, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.058) nearly reached statistical significance for pS6. C75 was less efficient at increasing pS6 in ketotic rats versus sucrose rats (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>), and it increased pS6K1 only in sucrose rats (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) (sucrose-C75 vs. saccharin-C75, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). Thus, the anorexic action of C75 appears to depend on the rate of neuronal glucose uptake and/or utilization. Moreover, this rate could also affect the ability of C75 to modulate mTORC1 signaling.</p><p>Ketosis is known to induce profound metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>), so we compared sucrose- versus saccharin-treated rats on the same gel. Ketosis had no significant effect on the basal phosphorylation of S6K1 but caused a nonsignificant increase in S6 phosphorylation (Appendix 2, which is available in the online appendix). Rats fed a ketogenic diet have increased leucine levels in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). Given the important role of leucine in regulating mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>), we determined whether the ketogenic diet changes plasma leucine levels. However, we did not find any difference in circulating leucine between the two groups (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Modulation of the FAS pathway represents a therapeutic strategy to produce weight loss and points to the important role of CNS metabolic pathways in regulating energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). Our previous work has demonstrated that activation of mTORC1 signaling in the hypothalamus reduces food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that the ability of FAS inhibitors to modulate hypothalamic mTORC1 signaling is an important mechanism by which they cause anorexia.</p><p>Here, we report that central administration of C75 or cerulenin increases phosphorylation of hypothalamic S6K1 and S6. Furthermore, the ability of these compounds to modulate feeding depended on the activation of CNS mTORC1 signaling. In fact, intracerebroventricular rapamycin dampened the ability of C75 to reduce both feeding and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). We were surprised to observe an effect of rapamycin to reduce feeding in the 1st h after injection, given that we had not seen an effect of this dose in several prior studies (Appendix 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Nonetheless, it is important to point out that this effect on food intake is short-lived, with no effect observed beyond 1 h. Importantly, rapamycin actually resulted in an increase in intake in the presence of C75, which is incompatible with a major effect of rapamycin to reduce food intake.</p><p>Although rapamycin is quite specific in its effect on mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>), pharmacological inhibitors can have drawbacks that limit the interpretation of experimental results. Hence, we further tested our hypothesis in mice lacking <italic>S6K1</italic>, a key component of the mTORC1 pathway. C75 or cerulenin reduced both food intake and body weight in wild-type mice, as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). However, this effect was significantly reduced in <italic>S6K1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Interestingly, the data arising from both the pharmacological and genetic studies indicate that the activity of the mTORC1 pathway critically contributes to the anorexic effects of FAS inhibitors 4 h after drug injection. The time course observed in <italic>S6K1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is a remarkable match for the observation made in rats that activation of mTORC1 remains elevated 6 h after either C75 or cerulenin. Such data underscore the importance of the mTORC1 signaling as one component of a cascade that is essential to the anorexic effects of FAS inhibitors.</p><p>One proposed mechanism by which FAS inhibitors suppress food ingestion is by increasing CNS glucose utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Glucose metabolism is a biochemical index of nutrient status that plays a key role in the control of feeding. Quantitative and temporal changes in glucose concentration are closely monitored and integrated by specific subpopulations of &#x0201c;glucosensing&#x0201d; neurons in the CNS that are crucial to the regulation of feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). A key finding to support the involvement of increased glucose use in mediating the effect of FAS inhibition is that rats on a very low carbohydrate diet, which forces them to produce ketone bodies that neurons use in preference to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>), do not reduce their food intake in response to C75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). In accordance with those previous results, we observed that rats maintained on a ketogenic diet but given sucrose to prevent ketosis responded to C75. In contrast, rats maintained on the ketogenic diet but given saccharin did not significantly reduce their food intake after C75. C75 increased S6 phosphorylation in rats on the ketogenic diet supplemented with sucrose, but this effect is blunted in those on the same diet supplemented with saccharin. This effect is consistent with what has been observed under chow diet. It remains unknown how C75 increases the phosphorylation of S6K1 1 h after injection under a ketogenic diet supplemented with sucrose, whereas this phenomenon happens only at 6 h under a chow diet. This is an issue that we tested several times with multiple time points. In several studies, there was a strong trend for increased pS6K1 at 1 h, but this effect was not consistent across experiments, unlike the reliable effect to increase pS6. There could be a number of possibilities to explain why the time course of C75-induced phosphorylation of S6K1 differs between the two diets. The ketogenic diet induces a wide range of metabolic effects in addition to reducing glucose availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). These differences provide an important rationale for why we used the ketogenic diet supplemented with sucrose instead of a normal chow diet as the control for experiment 4. Nonetheless, these findings not only point to the permissive role played by neuronal glucose metabolism in the FAS inhibitors-induced anorexia, but they also highlight a mechanism through which the inhibition of FAS leads to the modulation of the mTORC1 signaling.</p><p>Kim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>) ascribed the anorexic action of C75 to its ability to inhibit hypothalamic AMPK. Like mTOR, AMPK is a fuel sensor that plays a critical role in integrating signals of energy status in the hypothalamus and regulating food intake. However, in contrast to mTOR, hypothalamic AMPK is activated during negative energy balance, in which case it stimulates feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). The relationship between these two fuel sensors is rather complex and appears to be bidirectional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). Given the highly regulated crosstalk between mTOR and AMPK, the current experiments cannot rule out whether the effects of C75 on the mTORC1 pathway are directly mediated or occur as a result of inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK. Nonetheless, the data of Kim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>) suggest that AMPK activity is involved primarily in the short-term actions of C75 because AMPK activators inhibit the effect of C75 specifically during the 1st h after drug administration, whereas our data suggest that mTORC1 signaling might be critical at later time points.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide evidence that links the FAS pathway to the mTORC1 signaling cascade in the CNS and, although the current experimental design does not allow us to conclude whether the ability of FAS inhibition to reduce food intake is due exclusively to actions in the hypothalamus, the literature would argue that it is the case. Several studies have attributed the hypophagic action of FAS inhibition to direct effects on hypothalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>), and this model has been further supported in the recent study of Chakravarthy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). This group demonstrated that genetic inactivation of FAS in the hypothalamus and &#x003b2;-cells results in anorexia entirely due to inactivation of the enzyme in the hypothalamus. Moreover, nutritional regulation of mTORC1 signaling occurs specifically in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Taking into account that leptin also activates mTORC1 in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>) and reduces food intake through actions on CNS fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>), this suggests that mTORC1 is an important integrator of multiple signals in the CNS. mTORC1 activity can be found in both agouti-related protein&#x02013;and proopiomelanocortin-producing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>), and, thus, increased mTORC1 activity in the CNS may contribute to the similar effects of C75 and leptin on both food intake and hypothalamic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). The current data connect two separate metabolic pathways that have been independently implicated in the CNS regulation of energy balance, thus providing new knowledge on the relationship among key signaling pathways able to affect feeding behavior. Identifying the specific metabolic signals that are integrated by energy-sensing neurons is a crucial scientific question that could give important insights into potential etiologies and therapies for obesity and other metabolic disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db07-1690_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db07-1690_db07-1690[1].suppl.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>R.J.S. and S.C.W. have received National Institutes of Health Grants DK-17844, DK-54890, and DK-056863 and funds from the DoD Biomedical Research Program.
