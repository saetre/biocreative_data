Potential targets of checkpoint-mediated regulation include proteins directly involved in DNA metabolism, such as the cellular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein, replication protein A (RPA). Studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have revealed that the RPA large subunit (Rfa1p) is involved in the G1 and S phase DNA damage checkpoints. We now demonstrate that Rfa1p is phosphorylated in response to various forms of genotoxic stress, including radiation and hydroxyurea exposure, and further show that phosphorylation of Rfa1p is dependent on the central checkpoint regulator Mec1p. Analysis of the requirement for other checkpoint genes indicates that different mechanisms mediate radiation- and hydroxyurea-induced Rfa1p phosphorylation despite the common requirement for functional Mec1p. In addition, experiments with mutants defective in the Cdc13p telomere-binding protein indicate that ssDNA formation is an important signal for Rfa1p phosphorylation. Because Rfa1p contains the major ssDNA binding activity of the RPA heterotrimer and is required for DNA replication, repair and recombination, it is possible that phosphorylation of this subunit is directly involved in modulating RPA activity during the checkpoint response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The importance of cell cycle regulation in maintaining genetic stability is clearly illustrated by the high incidence of cancer in patients with defects in any one of the several &#x02018;checkpoints&#x02019; that operate to delay cell cycle progression upon cellular damage. These regulatory pathways are thought to provide the time necessary for repair processes to occur before genetic alterations are rendered irreversible through cell cycle events such as DNA replication or mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c1">1</xref>). Despite the likelihood that proteins involved in DNA metabolism are important targets of checkpoint-mediated control in humans, molecular mechanisms underlying such regulation have not been characterized. One protein that plays an essential role in DNA replication, repair and recombination and that is also involved in checkpoint processes is replication protein A (RPA), the evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c2">2</xref>).</p><p>The three subunits of RPA have molecular weights of &#x0223c;70, 32 and 14 kDa, and the largest of these contains the major ssDNA binding activity of the protein. In addition to interacting with nucleic acid, the large subunit directly associates with other proteins that are involved in replication, repair and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c2">2</xref>). The large subunit also interacts with various transcription factors, including the tumor suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c4">4</xref>). Direct evidence that RPA is a checkpoint protein has been provided by the generation of a mutant in the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> large subunit (Rfa1p) that exhibits defective cell cycle delay following DNA damage sustained during the G1 or S phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c5">5</xref>). Other studies have shown that Rfa1p is involved in the adaptation to cell cycle arrest that accompanies irreparable DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c6">6</xref>) and that the large subunit of fission yeast RPA is involved in recovery from inhibition of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c7">7</xref>). Therefore, the RPA large subunit appears to play an important role in various cell-cycle regulatory processes.</p><p>The RPA middle subunit is also implicated in cell cycle function, as this polypeptide becomes phosphorylated periodically during the normal cell cycle and in response to genotoxic insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c11">11</xref>). An RPA phosphorylation reaction resembling the cell-cycle-regulated reaction has been shown to occur during SV40 DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c12">12</xref>). Our previous studies demonstrated that this DNA replication-dependent RPA phosphorylation reaction requires the catalytic subunit of DNA-activated protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c13">13</xref>), a nuclear serine&#x0002f;threonine protein kinase that is necessary for DNA double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c14">14</xref>). We also demonstrated that DNA-PKcs-mediated RPA phosphorylation does not affect DNA replication activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, leading to the conclusion that RPA phosphorylation is not directly involved in the mechanics of DNA replication in the SV40 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Experiments with cells from ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients have indicated that a homolog of DNA-PKcs is required for ionizing radiation (IR)-induced phosphorylation of the RPA middle subunit. A-T is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar degeneration, ocular telangiectasia, immune dysfunction, premature aging and cancer susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c15">15</xref>). Despite these disparate disease manifestations, A-T is caused by mutation of a single protein, ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c16">16</xref>), which is similar in primary sequence to DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c17">17</xref>). A-T cells are hypersensitive to killing by ionizing radiation but not ultraviolet (UV) radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c18">18</xref>) and they exhibit a significant delay in IR-induced but not UV-induced RPA middle subunit phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c9">9</xref>). Thus, the ATM protein is specifically required for RPA middle subunit phosphorylation upon IR exposure. A-T cells are defective for checkpoint-mediated cell cycle delay during the G1, S or G2 phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c20">20</xref>) and the G1 checkpoint defect has been linked to a deficiency in accumulation of the tumor suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c21">21</xref>). Recent reports have shown that purified ATM can directly catalyze both p53 and RPA middle subunit phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c23">23</xref>). Therefore, p53 and RPA, which directly interact with each other, both appear to occupy positions downstream of ATM in the DNA damage response. Although these results would suggest that RPA phosphorylation plays a role in the checkpoint response, a strict correlation between RPA middle subunit phosphorylation and checkpoint function has not been observed in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c24">24</xref>).</p><p>As yet, the roles of cell-cycle-regulated and radiation-induced RPA phosphorylation have not been clearly defined. However, RPA from human cells treated with different DNA damaging agents is incapable of supporting SV40 DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that DNA damage-induced RPA phosphorylation could be involved in regulating the relative replication and repair functions of RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c27">27</xref>). Because RPA phosphorylation reactions have been conserved through evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c11">11</xref>), we have turned to the genetically tractable eukaryote <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> to further understand both the mechanisms and the functions of these modification events. Our previous studies demonstrated that Mec1p is required for both cell-cycle-regulated and DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RPA middle subunit (Rfa2p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c11">11</xref>). Mec1p is a key regulator of the DNA damage and DNA replication checkpoints in yeast and, unlike most known eukaryotic checkpoint proteins, is essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c31">31</xref>). The homology of Mec1p to ATM and DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c29">29</xref>) suggests that the mechanisms and functions of RPA middle subunit phosphorylation are similar in human and yeast cells.</p><p>In this report, we demonstrate that the large subunit of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RPA becomes phosphorylated under conditions of genotoxic stress that induce checkpoint-mediated cell cycle delay, such as DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication. As we previously observed for phosphorylation of the middle subunit, Rfa1p phosphorylation is dependent on Mec1p. Examination of the reaction under different stress conditions and in different checkpoint mutants indicates that multiple mechanisms are involved despite the shared Mec1p requirement. In addition, experiments with <italic>cdc13</italic> mutants have provided evidence that Rfa1p phosphorylation is dependent on generation of ssDNA upon DNA damage. These results indicate that the ssDNA binding subunit is a target of checkpoint-mediated modification, providing a possible mechanism for the regulation of RPA activities in response to cellular insult.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, plasmids and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd551tb1">1</xref>) were kindly provided by Drs Ted Weinert (University of Arizona, AZ), David Lydall (University of Manchester, UK) and Heidi Feldmann (University of Munich, Germany).

Specifically, treatment of wild-type <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> with HU, an inhibitor of DNA replication, induces the generation of an Rfa1p isoform with reduced mobility during SDS&#x02013;PAGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f1">1</xref>A). Because phosphorylation of Rfa2p reduces its mobility during SDS&#x02013;PAGE in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c11">11</xref>), we suspected that the modified form of Rfa1p observed under these conditions was a phosphoprotein. Treatment of extract from HU-exposed cells with &#x003bb;PPase abolishes the HU-induced form of Rfa1p and inclusion of the &#x003bb;PPase inhibitor vanadate in the reaction mixture inhibits this demodification (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f1">1</xref>B). Therefore, the reduction in mobility of Rfa1p during SDS&#x02013;PAGE is due to phosphorylation. Unlike Rfa2p phosphorylation, Rfa1p phosphorylation is not observed during the normal cell cycle, but only in response to HU and other genotoxic insults (see below).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>MEC1</italic> and <italic>TEL1</italic> are required for HU-dependent Rfa1p phosphorylation</title><p>Our previous studies indicated that <italic>MEC1</italic> is required to achieve the level of HU-induced Rfa2p phosphorylation observed in wild-type cells. However, the <italic>MEC1</italic> homolog <italic>TEL1,</italic> which is not a bona fide checkpoint gene but functionally overlaps with <italic>MEC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c33">33</xref>), can partially rescue HU-induced Rfa2p phosphorylation in <italic>mec1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c11">11</xref>). Analysis of HU-induced Rfa1p phosphorylation in a series of checkpoint mutants has revealed a specific <italic>MEC1&#x0002f;TEL1</italic> dependence identical to that observed for Rfa2p. While none of the checkpoint mutants tested has a dramatic defect in Rfa1p phosphorylation, the level of phosphorylated Rfa1p is slightly reduced in the <italic>mec1</italic> strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f2">2</xref>A). As previously observed with HU-induced Rfa2p phosphorylation, mutation of both <italic>MEC1</italic> and <italic>TEL1</italic> completely abolishes HU-induced Rfa1p phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f2">2</xref>B). Transformation of the double mutant with episomal <italic>MEC1</italic> or <italic>TEL1</italic> rescues this defect, indicating an overlap in function of these two genes as previously observed for Rfa2p phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA damaging agents induce checkpoint-dependent Rfa1p phosphorylation</title><p>In addition to HU, agents that cause various forms of DNA damage were tested for their capacity to induce phosphorylation of the RPA large subunit. We found that Rfa1p becomes phosphorylated upon exposure of wild-type cells to UV radiation, IR or the alkylating agent methyl methane sulfonate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f3">3</xref> and data not shown). Furthermore, we observed that UV radiation-induced Rfa1p phosphorylation is significantly reduced not only in <italic>mec1</italic> mutant cells, but also in the other three checkpoint-deficient strains that we tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f3">3</xref>). A similar checkpoint-dependent Rfa1p phosphorylation reaction was observed with populations arrested in G1 by alpha mating factor and exposed to either UV radiation or IR. However, the severity of the defects in the G1-arrested checkpoint mutants was difficult to assess because only weak Rfa1p phosphorylation was observed in the wild-type cells under these conditions (data not shown). It is interesting that the checkpoint dependence of Rfa1p phosphorylation is distinct from that of radiation-induced Rfa2p phosphorylation, which requires <italic>MEC1</italic> and <italic>MEC3</italic> but is independent of <italic>RAD9</italic> and <italic>RAD53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c11">11</xref>). Thus, in contrast to the HU-induced phosphorylation reactions described above, RPA phosphorylation in response to DNA damage does not appear to proceed by a single mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Inactivation of Cdc13p induces Mec1p-dependent Rfa1p phosphorylation</title><p>Cdc13p is an ssDNA-binding protein that interacts preferentially with the G-rich strand of telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c38">38</xref>). In the absence of Cdc13p function, long tracts of ssDNA are formed at the ends of the chromosomes and these DNA structures induce the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c40">40</xref>). The checkpoint roles of several genes, including <italic>MEC1</italic>, were originally identified in a synthetic lethality screen employing the temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c28">28</xref>). At the restrictive temperature, checkpoint-proficient cells arrest reversibly with a G2 DNA content, whereas checkpoint-deficient cells progress through the cell cycle and subsequently die.</p><p>RPA phosphorylation was investigated in <italic>cdc13-1</italic> cells at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f4">4</xref>). During normal cell cycle progression (25&#x000b0;C), the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutant exhibits a low level of phosphorylated Rfa1p, suggesting that some DNA damage might be present even at the permissive temperature. However, a marked induction of Rfa1p phosphorylation is observed upon shifting cells to the restrictive temperature (37&#x000b0;C). There is also a detectable induction of Rfa2p phosphorylation, but this increase is more subtle due to the high level of phosphorylated Rfa2p observed during the normal cell cycle. The RPA phosphorylation reactions induced by inactivation of Cdc13p were also analyzed in three mutant alleles of <italic>mec1</italic> that were originally identified in the <italic>cdc13-1</italic>-based synthetic lethality screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c28">28</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f4">4</xref>). At the permissive temperature, the <italic>mec1-1</italic> mutant is devoid of phosphorylated RPA, while <italic>mec1-3</italic> exhibits no detectable phosphorylated Rfa1p but elevated levels of phosphorylated Rfa2p relative to the control <italic>cdc13</italic> strain. Upon temperature shift, <italic>mec1-1</italic> cells are completely defective for induction of either Rfa1p or Rfa2p phosphorylation, while the <italic>mec1-3</italic> mutant exhibits a low level of phosphorylated Rfa1p and a high level of phosphorylated Rfa2p. The <italic>mec1-2</italic> mutant has no apparent defect in phosphorylation of either subunit at either temperature. These data indicate that Mec1p is required for RPA phosphorylation induced upon inactivation of Cdc13p. It is interesting that the severity of the telomere damage-induced RPA phosphorylation deficiency in the <italic>cdc13 mec1</italic> mutants correlates well with the reported phenotypic penetrance of the <italic>mec1</italic> alleles: <italic>mec1-1</italic> cells are hypersensitive to killing by HU, IR and MMS, <italic>mec1-3</italic> cells are hypersensitive to killing by HU and MMS but not IR and <italic>mec1-2</italic> cells are not hypersensitive to killing by any of these agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c28">28</xref>). Nonetheless, we have confirmed that all three <italic>cdc13 mec1</italic> mutants die upon transient Cdc13p inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c28">28</xref>) (data not shown), indicating that the extent of RPA phosphorylation does not correlate with viability under these conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Rfa1p phosphorylation induced by Cdc13p inactivation correlates with ssDNA formation</title><p>There is evidence that certain checkpoint proteins regulate the generation of ssDNA upon inactivation of Cdc13p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c40">40</xref>). In particular, the rate of telomeric ssDNA formation at the restrictive temperature is greater in a <italic>cdc13 rad9</italic> mutant than in a <italic>cdc13</italic> mutant. Conversely, very little ssDNA is generated in cells bearing <italic>cdc13</italic> and <italic>rad24</italic> mutations and a combination of <italic>rad9</italic> and <italic>rad24</italic> with <italic>cdc13</italic> results in a rate of ssDNA formation nearly identical to that observed in the <italic>cdc13 rad24</italic> strain. We examined these mutants and found that Rfa1p phosphorylation is induced upon shift to the restrictive temperature in the <italic>cdc13</italic> and <italic>cdc13 rad9</italic> cells, but is greatly reduced in the <italic>cdc13 rad24</italic> strain and undetectable in <italic>cdc13 rad9 rad24</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f5">5</xref>A). Therefore, Rfa1p phosphorylation resulting from temperature-induced Cdc13p inactivation correlates with the extent of telomeric ssDNA that is generated under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c40">40</xref>). In contrast to Rfa1p phosphorylation, induction of Rfa2p phosphorylation upon temperature shift is not diminished in any of the mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f5">5</xref>A). In fact, the <italic>cdc13 rad9</italic> mutant gives rise to a species of Rfa2p that migrates even slower during SDS&#x02013;PAGE than the previously characterized phosphoprotein. Further analysis has revealed that at least three isomers of Rfa2p are generated under these conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f5">5</xref>B) and treatment with &#x003bb;PPase indicates that these reduced mobility forms are phosphoproteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f5">5</xref>C). The hyperphosphorylation of Rfa2p under these special conditions is reminiscent of the hyperphosphorylation of the human RPA middle subunit that occurs upon exposure of cells to radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c41">41</xref>). As previously demonstrated with RPA from HU-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f1">1</xref>B), the modified form of Rfa1p generated in the <italic>cdc13 rad9</italic> mutant is also a phosphoprotein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f5">5</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA-PKcs catalyzes Rfa2p but not Rfa1p phosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Our previous studies have demonstrated that the DNA-activated protein kinase (DNA-PK) catalyzes phosphorylation of human RPA during cell-free SV40 DNA replication. Because Mec1p is required for yeast RPA phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> and is similar in primary sequence to DNA-PKcs and ATM, it is possible that Mec1p is also an RPA kinase. As yet, purified Mec1p is not available to directly test this hypothesis <italic>in vitro.</italic> However, there is evidence that members of the ATM family of protein kinases have overlapping substrate specificities. For example, purified preparations of DNA-PK, ATM and ATM-related protein (ATR) all catalyze phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c43">43</xref>). Therefore, DNA-PKcs-catalyzed phosphorylation of yeast RPA with purified proteins was investigated as a possible model for Mec1p-dependent catalysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f6">6</xref>, DNA-PKcs can efficiently catalyze Rfa2p phosphorylation in the presence of &#x02018;activated&#x02019; DNA containing both double- and single-strand character. The phosphorylated species of Rfa2p generated through this reaction has reduced mobility during SDS&#x02013;PAGE relative to the unphosphorylated protein (data not shown). Neither the hyperphosphorylated Rfa2p detected in <italic>cdc13 rad9</italic> cells nor phosphorylated Rfa1p appears to be generated to a significant extent under these conditions. A similar pattern of phosphorylation is revealed in the control reaction with human RPA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>As the cellular ssDNA binding protein, RPA plays a central role in the DNA metabolism of eukaryotic cells. Therefore, it is possible that modulation of RPA through post-translational modification could be an important mechanism by which the relative replication, repair and recombination activities within the cell are regulated. In fact, evidence for such control has been provided by studies on the cell-free SV40 DNA replication system and has led to the hypothesis that RPA phosphorylated on the middle subunit in response to UV irradiation is preferentially active in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c10">10</xref>). We now demonstrate that the large subunit of yeast RPA is also a phosphoprotein, suggesting that more than one polypeptide of the RPA heterotrimer could be involved in DNA metabolic regulation.</p><p>Phosphorylation of Rfa1p requires Mec1p and is therefore a reaction in the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> checkpoint response. Unlike the Mec1p-dependent phosphorylation of Rfa2p that we previously reported, Rfa1p phosphorylation does not occur during normal cell cycle progression, but only under genotoxic conditions. Further examination into the genetic requirements of Rfa1p phosphorylation has revealed that the HU-induced reaction is also supported to some extent by Tel1p, another ATM homolog that is not a checkpoint protein but functionally overlaps with Mec1p. This Mec1p&#x0002f;Tel1p dependence is identical to that of HU-induced Rfa2p phosphorylation. In response to radiation, Rfa1p phosphorylation does not involve Tel1p, but does require several checkpoint proteins in addition to Mec1p. While a dependence on Mec3p was also previously observed for radiation-induced Rfa2p phosphorylation, the requirement for functional Rad9p and Rad53p is specific to the large subunit. These results indicate that RPA phosphorylation operates by different mechanisms despite the common requirement for a functional Mec1p checkpoint pathway (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd551tb2">2</xref>).</p><p>The existence of different checkpoint-dependent mechanisms that direct phosphorylation of the two RPA subunits is supported by our studies employing a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>CDC13.</italic> When this mutant is grown at the permissive temperature, it exhibits the expected cell-cycle-regulated Rfa2p phosphorylation and a slight degree of Rfa1p phosphorylation that is presumably due to a low level of telomeric damage resulting from the defective Cdc13p. In a <italic>cdc13 mec1-1</italic> double mutant, both of these phosphorylation reactions are abolished. However, only phosphorylation of Rfa1p is eliminated in <italic>cdc13 mec1-3</italic> at the permissive temperature, demonstrating that the Rfa1p and Rfa2p kinase activities can be separated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f4">4</xref>). Such differences in the behavior of the two RPA subunits are further apparent when <italic>cdc13</italic> is combined with other checkpoint gene mutations. The <italic>cdc13 rad9</italic> double mutant exhibits normal Rfa1p phosphorylation at the restrictive temperature, but a hyperphosphorylation of Rfa2p. In contrast, <italic>cdc13 rad24</italic> exhibits normal Rfa2p phosphorylation, but greatly reduced phosphorylation of Rfa1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f5">5</xref>A). Therefore, distinct Mec1p-dependent sub-pathways operate to direct Rfa1p and Rfa2p phosphorylation. The homology of Mec1p to DNA-PKcs and ATM would suggest that Mec1p is directly involved in catalyzing phosphorylation of the two RPA subunits, but further experimentation will be necessary to define the exact role that Mec1p plays in the two reactions.</p><p>Our analysis of mutants defective in <italic>CDC13</italic> has provided some insight into the biochemistry of Rfa1p phosphorylation. These experiments suggest that ssDNA must be generated for the large subunit to become modified. We have observed that radiation-induced Rfa1p phosphorylation is more robust in cycling cells than in G1-arrested cells (data not shown) and it is possible that ssDNA generated during DNA replication in the proliferating population contributes to this difference in catalytic efficiency. It is interesting that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of the RPA middle subunit in human cells, mediated by members of the ATM family, is greatly stimulated when DNA synthesis is allowed to proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c44">44</xref>). Despite the correlation between Rfa1p phosphorylation and ssDNA formation, the absence of Rfa1p phosphorylation during normal cell cycle progression suggests that ssDNA alone is not sufficient to support the reaction but must be accompanied by genotoxic stress. One possibility is that Mec1p directly catalyzes both Rfa1p and Rfa2p phosphorylation in the presence of ssDNA, but Rfa1p phosphorylation requires a cofactor that is induced by DNA damage. It is also possible that Mec1p specifically catalyzes Rfa2p phosphorylation, but induces a second protein kinase in response to DNA damage that catalyzes Rfa1p phosphorylation in an ssDNA-dependent reaction. Consistent with either scenario, we have found that purified DNA-PKcs, a homolog of Mec1p, can catalyze Rfa2p but not Rfa1p phosphorylation in the presence of DNA containing single-stranded regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f6">6</xref>).</p><p>Both DNA damage and ssDNA generation are required for induction of the SOS response, an adaptive process in prokaryotes that enhances cell survival upon environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c45">45</xref>). An <italic>E.coli</italic> cell incapable of repairing a UV-generated DNA lesion cannot mount an SOS response upon UV treatment unless it is undergoing DNA replication and, therefore, generating ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c47">47</xref>). In contrast, UV repair-proficient cells are capable of SOS induction in the absence of DNA replication because ssDNA is generated through processing of the lesion. A recent study in yeast has demonstrated that the UV-induced Mec1p-dependent phosphorylation of Rad53p, an important checkpoint regulator in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c48">48</xref>), is dependent on DNA replication in mutants that are incapable of excising UV dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c49">49</xref>). Therefore, induction of certain Mec1p-dependent activities, such as phosphorylation of Rad53p and Rfa1p, is remarkably similar to induction of the SOS response. Some members of the yeast DNA damage checkpoint apparatus are involved in UV-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c50">50</xref>), which is an important process of the SOS response in bacterial cells. It will be interesting to determine whether checkpoint-dependent RPA phosphorylation is required for any processes that are characteristic of SOS adaptation.</p><p>The involvement of ssDNA in Rfa1p phosphorylation could explain the broader checkpoint gene requirements for radiation-induced than HU-induced Rfa1p phosphorylation. While HU-arrested yeast cells contain DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c51">51</xref>) and are likely to have extensive regions of unwound DNA due to replication fork stalling, radiation treatment only generates local stretches of ssDNA that are formed once the DNA damage is processed. It is possible that checkpoint proteins other than Mec1p are required in response to radiation to generate sufficient ssDNA template for Rfa1p phosphorylation to occur. Evidence that Mec3p, Rad9p and Rad24p regulate telomeric ssDNA formation upon Cdc13p inactivation by influencing the putative exonuclease activity of Rad17p supports this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c40">40</xref>). The physical association of the phosphorylated forms of Rad9p and Rad53p, which are both generated in a Mec1p-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c56">56</xref>), suggests that Rad53p could also be involved in ssDNA maturation. It should be noted that immunoprecipitates of Rad53p can catalyze protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c57">57</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that Rad53p is an Rfa1p kinase induced by Mec1p upon radiation exposure. However, a low level of radiation-induced Rfa1p phosphorylation is observed in the <italic>rad53</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd551f3">3</xref>), arguing against this possibility. It should also be noted that the roles of checkpoint proteins will vary with cell cycle phase and the nature of the insult, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c59">59</xref>). In fact, the studies presented here provide another striking example of variance in function of Rad9p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c60">60</xref>), which is involved in radiation-induced Rfa1p phosphorylation but is not required for Rfa1p phosphorylation induced by telomeric damage.</p><p>In addition to defining the mechanisms that control RPA phosphorylation, an important direction of our future experiments will be to identify Mec1p-dependent RPA phosphorylation sites so that mutation analyses ideally suited for studies in yeast can be performed. Generation of phosphorylation site mutants will allow for complete functional characterization of RPA phosphorylation in yeast and information gained from these studies is likely to be applicable to higher eukaryotes as well. Although none of the amino acids that become phosphorylated in yeast RPA have been reported, phosphopeptide mapping of the human RPA middle subunit has demonstrated that two serines near the N-terminus are phosphorylated in normal cycling cells and four additional serines and one threonine in this same region become phosphorylated upon UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd551c41">41</xref>). The studies presented here demonstrate that the RPA phosphoproteins generated during the normal cell cycle and in response to DNA damage also differ in yeast and indicate that the large subunit should be considered as a potential regulatory component of RPA.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd551f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> HU induces Rfa1p phosphorylation.
