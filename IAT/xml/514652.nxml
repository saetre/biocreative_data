The lysophospholipid ligands of these receptors are structurally similar, however recognition of these lipids by these receptors is highly selective. A single residue present within the third transmembrane domain (TM) of S1P receptors is thought to determine ligand selectivity; replacement of the naturally occurring glutamic acid with glutamine (present at this position in the LPA receptors) has previously been shown to be sufficient to change the specificity of S1P<sub>1 </sub>from S1P to 18:1 LPA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We tested whether mutation of this "ligand selectivity" residue to glutamine could confer LPA-responsiveness to the related S1P receptor, S1P<sub>4</sub>. This mutation severely affected the response of S1P<sub>4 </sub>to S1P in a [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP&#x003b3;S binding assay, and imparted sensitivity to LPA species in the order 14:0 LPA &#x0003e; 16:0 LPA &#x0003e; 18:1 LPA. These results indicate a length restriction for activation of this receptor and demonstrate the utility of using LPA-responsive S1P receptor mutants to probe binding pocket length using readily available LPA species. Computational modelling of the interactions between these ligands and both wild type and mutant S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptors showed excellent agreement with experimental data, therefore confirming the fundamental role of this residue in ligand recognition by S1P receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Glutamic acid in the third transmembrane domain of the S1P receptors is a general selectivity switch regulating response to S1P over the closely related phospholipids, LPA. Mutation of this residue to glutamine confers LPA responsiveness with preference for short-chain species. The preference for short-chain LPA species indicates a length restriction different from the closely related S1P<sub>1 </sub>receptor.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are phospholipid growth factors which are present in normal serum and plasma. These lipids elicit diverse responses from a wide range of cell types, including enhanced cell survival, cell proliferation, induction of cytoskeletal changes and chemotaxis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Some of these responses reflect activation of G protein-coupled receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene (Edg) family. The Edg receptor family is classified into two clusters based on ligand selectivity: S1P<sub>1/2/3/4/5 </sub>(formerly Edg1/5/3/6/8) specifically respond to S1P whilst LPA<sub>1/2/3 </sub>(formerly Edg2/4/7) respond to LPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Members of the S1P receptor family display higher sequence similarity to each other (approximately 40% identity) than to members of the LPA receptor family (approximately 30% identity). These homologies, coupled with observed differences in the structure of S1P and LPA receptor genes, suggest that these receptor families evolved from distinct ancestral genes. The S1P receptors contain a conserved glutamic acid residue present within the third TM that corresponds to glutamine in the LPA receptors. Interaction between distinct functional groups present on S1P and LPA with this residue was shown for the S1P<sub>1 </sub>and LPA<sub>1 </sub>receptors using computational modelling techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and was demonstrated as the basis for the ligand preference displayed by the receptors. Experimental characterisation confirmed that replacement of glutamic acid with glutamine in S1P<sub>1 </sub>changed ligand specificity from S1P to LPA, and the reciprocal mutation in LPA<sub>1 </sub>resulted in recognition of both LPA and S1P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the role of this residue in determining ligand selectivity for the S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptor was examined. Phylogenetic analysis of the Edg family of receptors indicates that S1P<sub>4 </sub>is more closely related to other S1P receptors than receptors which respond to LPA. However, S1P<sub>4 </sub>lies on the edge of the S1P family cluster and has been shown to bind S1P with lower affinity than other S1P receptors and hence it has been suggested that S1P is not the true endogenous agonist of this receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We therefore decided to investigate whether replacement of this residue (E<sup>3.29(122)</sup>) with glutamine conferred LPA-responsiveness to the S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptor and hence determine the role of this residue in this lower-affinity S1P receptor. To achieve this, we expressed wild type and E<sup>3.29(122)</sup>Q mutant S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptors in CHO-K1 cells and studied responses to lysophospholipids using a [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP&#x003b3;S binding assay. Since CHO-K1 cells respond to LPA, we utilised fusion proteins constructed between the S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptor and a pertussis toxin-insensitive G&#x003b1;<sub>i1</sub>(C<sup>351</sup>I) G protein. Expression of these proteins in CHO-K1 cells followed by treatment with pertussis toxin prior to harvest allowed elimination of any signal due to stimulation of endogenous LPA receptors. Within this study, we also examined how the length of the LPA acyl chain affected potency at the mutant S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptor, using a panel of naturally occurring LPA analogues. Computational models of complexes between the wild type or mutant S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptor and S1P and LPA species were used to provide a molecular interpretation of the experimental findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Human HA-S1P<sub>4 </sub>was mutated at position 122 to replace the naturally occurring glutamic acid with glutamine. The mutant and wild type receptors were stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells as in-frame GPCR-G protein fusions with pertussis toxin-insensitive G&#x003b1;<sub>i1</sub>(C<sup>351</sup>I). Western blotting was used to detect expression of these fusion proteins. Membranes from HA-S1P<sub>4</sub>-G&#x003b1;<sub>i1</sub>(C<sup>351</sup>I)- or HA-S1P<sub>4</sub>(E<sup>3.29(122)</sup>Q)-G&#x003b1;<sub>i1</sub>(C<sup>351</sup>I)-transfected cells contained a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa, which reacted with anti-HA and anti-SG1 antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and was consistent with expression of the GPCR-G protein fusion.

Of particular interest is the observation that the best complexes generated by Autodock for the 18:1 LPA species with wild type S1P<sub>4 </sub>has a very high positive van der Waals interaction energy, &#x0003e; 3000 kcal/mol, compared to values well under 200 kcal/mol for every other complex studied. In the best complexes found for 16:0 LPA and 18:1 LPA in both constructs, the terminal six to eight carbons of the hydrophobic tails fold into L-shaped conformations quite different from the extended conformations observed in the S1P complex with wild type S1P<sub>4 </sub>or the 14:0 LPA complex with the E<sup>3.29(122)</sup>Q S1P<sub>4 </sub>mutant. The terminal carbons in several complexes curl out of the receptor between TM5 and TM6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) due to the restricted length of the binding pocket. These results suggest that the complete lack of S1P<sub>4 </sub>activation in response to 18:1 LPA is likely due to failure to form a complex. The strongest complexes formed, S1P with wild type S1P<sub>4 </sub>and 14:0 LPA with the E<sup>3.29(122)</sup>Q S1P<sub>4 </sub>mutant, have complementary interactions with the residue at position 3.29(122). These strong complexes give the most robust activation. Weak complexes are formed for other combinations due to mismatched interactions with position 3.29(122) or excessive length of the hydrophobic tail. The presence of hydrophobic tails of 16:0 or 18:1 LPA between transmembrane domains may additionally impair the conformational change necessary for full agonist responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Parental CHO-K1 cells respond to LPA in functional assays, reflecting expression of endogenous LPA<sub>1 </sub>(G.

This residue, which is conserved throughout the S1P receptors, has been shown to control ligand specificity for the related S1P<sub>1 </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Introduction of the E<sup>3.29(122)</sup>Q mutation severely affected the response of S1P<sub>4 </sub>to S1P: in dose-response experiments S1P caused minimal stimulation at only the highest concentration of ligand used. This is in agreement with published observations for activation of the equivalent S1P<sub>1 </sub>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. 14:0 LPA was able to induce dose-dependent stimulation of S1P<sub>4</sub>(E<sup>3.29(122)</sup>Q) with an EC<sub>50 </sub>of approximately 3.8 &#x003bc;M but only promoted minimal stimulation of the wild type S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptor. The modelled complexes of 14:0 LPA with E<sup>3.29(122)</sup>Q S1P<sub>4 </sub>and S1P with wild type S1P<sub>4 </sub>demonstrate nearly identical volumes occupied by the two ligands and very similar interactions between these ligands and their respective receptors. Of particular importance are amino acid residues at positions 3.28(121), 3.29(122) and 5.38(202), which either ion pair with the phosphate or interact with the 2-amino or 2-hydroxyl group in S1P and 14:0 LPA, respectively. The importance of interactions with amino acids at positions 3.28 and 3.29 has been previously noted for the S1P<sub>1 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and LPA<sub>1,2,3 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] receptors.</p><p>The S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptor exhibits marked constitutive (agonist-independent) activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) which was unaffected by the introduction of the E<sup>3.29(122)</sup>Q mutation (data not shown). This indicates that the mutation perturbs S1P recognition without affecting the ability of the receptor to spontaneously adopt an active conformation.

Where indicated, cells were treated with 100ng/ml PTx for 24 hours prior to harvesting. PTx treatment of HA-S1P<sub>4</sub>-transfected membranes prevented activation by S1P and also caused a dramatic reduction in basal signalling, indicative of constitutive activity. In contrast, when the HA-S1P<sub>4</sub>-G&#x003b1;<sub>i1 </sub>fusion-expressing membranes were treated with PTx, there was only a slight reduction in basal signalling and the receptor still responded to exogenous S1P, indicating that the receptor signalled via the tethered, PTx-insensitive G protein.

Naturally occurring forms of LPA contain acyl chains of differing lengths, with differing degrees of saturation. Investigations into the effect of the length and degree of saturation of the acyl chain of LPA have been undertaken for the LPA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], but limited SAR information is available for S1P receptors (22). The LPA-responsive E<sup>3.29(122)</sup>Q S1P<sub>4 </sub>mutant facilitates structure activity relationship (SAR) studies due to the greater availability of LPA analogs relative to S1P analogs. Comparison of space-filling models of the structures of S1P and three analogues of LPA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) revealed that 14:0 LPA most closely resembled S1P in terms of apparent length. [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP&#x003b3;S binding assays demonstrated greater agonist activity of 14:0 LPA at the mutant receptor relative to 18:1 or 16:0 LPA. This SAR indicates a length restriction for the S1P<sub>4 </sub>agonist binding site. Model complexes of 16:0 and 18:1 LPA contained alkyl chains that fold at the bottom of the binding pocket, defined by a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids. Three of these differ either in position of sidechain branching or size relative to LPA receptors and the other S1P receptors. Position 2.46, I88 in S1P<sub>4</sub>, is leucine in LPA<sub>1&#x02013;3 </sub>and other S1P receptors. Residue I6.40(256) is larger than the valine found in the other four S1P receptors, LPA<sub>1 </sub>and LPA<sub>3</sub>. Finally, I7.51(305) corresponds to the smaller valine in S1P<sub>2 </sub>and S1P<sub>3 </sub>and the much smaller alanine in LPA<sub>2</sub>. These findings provide a molecular explanation for a similar SAR observed using para-alkyl amide analogs of S1P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. SAR obtained with the S1P<sub>4 </sub>mutant are in contrast to that shown by LPA receptors, which exhibit the general trend of 18:1 &#x02265; 16:0 &#x0003e; 14:0 for potency and maximal stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Since mutation of residue 122 in the S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptor from the naturally occurring glutamic acid to glutamine conferred responsiveness to 14:0 LPA and severely affected responses to S1P, our observations support the hypothesis that this conserved residue in the third transmembrane domain of the S1P receptors is involved in ligand recognition. This is in contrast to a recent paper describing models of several GPCRs, including S1P<sub>4</sub>, which had been generated using novel first principle methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this model of S1P<sub>4</sub>, interactions between S1P and residues T<sup>7.34(127) </sup>and W<sup>7.37(291) </sup>and E<sup>7.30(284) </sup>were observed. Interaction of E<sup>7.30(284) </sup>with the ammonium group of S1P appeared to control ligand selectivity since the other residues appeared to interact with the phosphate group, which is present on both LPA and S1P. It is therefore surprising that none of these residues are conserved throughout the S1P or LPA receptor families. The data presented here support the assertion that glutamic acid residue 3.29 present in the third transmembrane domain of the S1P receptors controls ligand selectivity and suggest that the S1P<sub>4 </sub>model described by Vaidehi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] is inaccurate.</p><p>The current study provides new information for the development of more selective S1P receptor agonists. In particular, an S1P analog with its hydrophobic chain extended by either 2 or 4 carbons would be a very poor agonist of the S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptor. On the other hand, the activation of the S1P<sub>1</sub>-E<sup>3.29(121)</sup>Q mutant by 18:1 LPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] indicates that a chain-extended S1P analog should retain agonist activity at the S1P<sub>1 </sub>receptor. S1P receptor agonists with differing selectivity profiles will be useful tools to more completely map the physiological and pathophysiological roles of these receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These studies confirm that glutamic acid residue 3.29, present in the third transmembrane domain of the S1P receptors is important for the selective recognition of S1P, versus the closely related lipid, LPA. Mutation of E3.29 to glutamine diminished response to S1P and allowed structure activity studies using the diverse available LPA species. The mutant S1P<sub>4 </sub>receptor is stimulated most strongly by LPA 14:0 and is not activated by the longer LPA 18:1, in contrast with a previous report on the analogous S1P<sub>1 </sub>receptor mutant that responded to LPA 18:1.
