Congenital and juvenile cataracts, much less frequent than the senile form, are especially damaging to the visual field because the visual cortex will adapt irreversibly to long-term lack of visual input from the affected eye, a condition referred to as amblyopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. While infections represent an important cause of congenital and juvenile cataracts (particularly in underdeveloped countries), a genetic etiology can be identified in up to 50% of the cases. Although all forms of Mendelian inheritance have been reported, autosomal dominant inheritance is the most common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. An exception is observed in highly consanguineous populations where autosomal recessive forms are relatively more common and may even dominate the genetic landscape of the hereditary forms of congenital and juvenile cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>].</p><p>Crystallins are by far the most abundant lens soluble proteins, and their structure and organization are perfectly suited to their function of maintaining lens transparency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. It is not surprising, therefore, that mutations in this family of proteins can cause cataract. In fact, almost half of hereditary cataracts can be traced to mutations in one of the several crystallin genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Of three classes of crystallins found in vertebrate lenses, &#x003b1;-crystallin is the most abundant. It forms a unique cytoskeletal filament that is a stable complex of both &#x003b1;B- and &#x003b1;A-crystallin as well as lens intermediate filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. &#x003b1;B-crystallin, encoded by <italic>CRYAB</italic>, has an unusually broad tissue distribution profile among the crystallins that are highly enriched in the lens. The expression of <italic>CRYAB</italic> has been observed in the retina as well as in the cardiac, kidney, and skeletal muscles where it likely performs a cellular function beyond the optical transparency it provides in the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Not surprisingly, mutations in <italic>CRYAB</italic> can cause cataract as part of a desmin-related myopathy phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. All previously reported <italic>CRYAB</italic> mutations are dominant, but the exact mutational mechanism is not known.</p><p>In this study, we report linkage data on a family with autosomal recessive juvenile cataract. Not only do we show the underlying genetic defect to be the first reported autosomal recessive mutation in <italic>CRYAB</italic>, but we also document retinal involvement in the oldest affected individual (the mother). This novel mutation has no apparent clinical effect on cardiac or skeletal muscle function and displays variable expressivity. We discuss how this mutation broadens the phenotype associated with <italic>CRYAB</italic> mutations and how it may improve our understanding of the mutational mechanism of previously reported dominant mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human subjects</title><p>A Saudi nuclear family with three affected individuals diagnosed with juvenile cataract was enrolled in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).

Ligated samples were then polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified using primers complementary to the universal adaptor. PCR products were then fragmented and end-labeled with biotinlyated ddATP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase followed by hybridization to the GeneChip Mapping 250K array (Affymetrix).

He had an ophthalmic examination that was appropriate for his age. There was no evidence of significant lens opacity or other ocular abnormality. However, by retinoscopy, clinically insignificant fine opacities in the red reflect could be appreciated.

This mutation was homozygous in the affected mother (I-2) and four of her children (II-1, II-2, II-4, and II-7). The unaffected father (I-1) was heterozygous for the mutation, which explains the pseudo-dominant inheritance pattern observed in this family. This sequence alteration was not found in 150 normal Saudi controls (300 chromosomes).

The recessive nature of the mutation is evident from the clinical assessment, which clearly indicated that only homozygous individuals were affected. In line with previous work showing retinal expression of <italic>CRYAB</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], the oldest affected individuals had retinal involvement. Therefore, several intriguing observations made by the current study are noteworthy. The first observation pertains to the recessive mode of inheritance of the mutation, which will have to be addressed in the context of the nature of this mutation and how it compares to those previously reported. &#x003b1;B-Crystallin is a small heat shock protein (sHSP) that has both structural (through its interaction with &#x003b1;A-crystallin in the lens fiber cells) and functional roles (as a chaperone that stabilizes and prevents aggregation of &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-crystallins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Detailed analysis of its structure revealed the presence of NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-termini as well as an &#x003b1;-core crystallin domain. Intriguingly, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus, which lacks chaperone activity, has recently been shown to interact with Ksp, a kidney-specific cadherin, potentially playing a role in maintaining kidney tissue integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Whether this binding capacity of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus extends to E-, P-, and N-cadherins that are known to be expressed in the lens is currently unknown. Ghosh and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] have elegantly identified sequences that are important for subunit-subunit interactions and those involved in the chaperone activity of the protein. Interestingly, R56 lies almost in the middle of a short dual function sequence that serves both functions. Gain-of-function mutations where the mutant protein tends to self aggregate and dominant negative mutants were reported to result in both cataract as well as desmin-related myopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Taken together, it is conceivable that the current mutation, which substitutes basic arginine for the non-polar tryptophan and thus reduces hydrophilicity, may only be sufficient in the homozygous form to disturb the interaction with &#x003b1;A-crystallin but may not be sufficient to disturb the chaperone activity. This would explain the recessive inheritance of the ophthalmic phenotype. However, this hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain the retinal involvement, which was not observed with any previously reported mutation. Here, we invoke a potential genotype-phenotype correlation as an explanation. It has been shown that <italic>CRYAB</italic> expression in the retina is increased in response to oxidative stress, and it has been postulated that this represents a protective mechanism against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. The latter proposition is based on the observation that &#x003b1;B-crystallin inhibits activation of caspase-3, a critical protease for apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. This result is supported by the finding that in <italic>Cryab</italic> knockout mice, there is increased susceptibility to apoptosis and retinal damage in response to infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that R56W impairs the inhibitory effect of &#x003b1;B-crystallin on caspase-3 and that the observed retinal phenotype may be the result of long-term impaired protection against apoptosis in response to oxidative stress. The fact that the retinal phenotype was only observed in the oldest patient (I-1) supports this hypothesis. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the retinal phenotype in the mother (I-1) was due to another cause unrelated to <italic>CRYAB</italic>.</p><p>We note that in the family studied, there was a six-year-old girl (II-4) who was homozygous for the mutation but was clinically asymptomatic. However, slit-lamp examination revealed discrete visually insignificant lens opacities that were not present in other examined family members who were not homozygous for the mutation. The clinically insignificant fine opacities in the red reflex of II-7 were mostly likely lenticular. Thus, the homozygous mutation in this family may still be fully penetrant but with variable expressivity.</p><p>In summary, we report for the first time an autosomal recessive mutation in <italic>CRYAB</italic>, which results in cataract. We propose an allele-specific effect to explain the highly unusual associated retinal phenotype. Further studies are underway to experimentally test the effect of the mutation on &#x003b1;B-crystallin to enrich our understanding of the function and structure of this protein.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the family for their participation.
