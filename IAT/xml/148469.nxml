The RBDs contain the signatures RDADDA and SWQDLKD found in RBD1 and RBD2 of all typical metazoan SR proteins. srp2 is essential for growth. We have analyzed in vivo the role of the modular domains of Srp2 by testing specific mutations in a conditional strain for complementation. We found that RBD2 is essential for function and determines the specificity of RBD1 in Srp2. Replacement of the first RBD with RBD1 of Srp1 of fission yeast does not change this specificity. The two SR elements in the C-terminus of Srp2 are also essential for function in vivo. Cellular distribution analysis with green fluorescence protein fused to portions of Srp2 revealed that the SR elements are necessary to target Srp2 to the nucleus. Furthermore, overexpression of modular domains of Srp2 and Srp1 show different effects on pre-mRNA splicing activity of the tfIId gene. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the notion that the RBDs of these proteins may be involved in pre-mRNA recognition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
