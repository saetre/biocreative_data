We identified RIL as a frequent methylation target in cancer. In search for factors that influence RIL hypermethylation, we found a 12-bp polymorphic sequence around its transcription start site that creates a long allele. Pyrosequencing of homozygous tumors revealed a 2.1-fold higher methylation for the short alleles (P&#x0003c;0.001). Bisulfite sequencing of cancers heterozygous for RIL showed that the short alleles are 3.1-fold more methylated than the long (P&#x0003c;0.001). The comparison of expression levels between unmethylated long and short EBV-transformed cell lines showed no difference in expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Electrophorectic mobility shift assay showed that the inserted region of the long allele binds Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors, a binding that is absent in the short allele.

Possibilities range from random events selected for to a model whereby an initial drop of transcription rate allows elimination of active chromatin boundaries and spreading of DNA methylation from &#x0201c;DNA methylation centers&#x0201d;- perhaps, repeat elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Issa1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, aberrant methylation might be caused by a repressor binding to the promoter and altering chromatin state to a closed configuration, which eventually causes abnormal methylation via recruitment of DNA methyltransferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Stirzaker1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Leu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, methylation seeding and ongoing transcription as well as possibly transcription factor binding seem to be required for the protection of promoters against methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Clark1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, the details and order of events in these processes remain elusive.</p><p>RIL is a ubiquitously expressed gene, which was originally identified as a candidate tumor suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Kiess1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Human RIL maps to chromosome 5q31.1, a region frequently deleted in the malignant cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Bashirova1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and appears to be a good candidate for one of the tumor-suppressor genes that reside in this area. Using methylated CpG island amplification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Toyota1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> in the K562 cell line, we identified RIL as a novel gene aberrantly methylated in cancer. RIL CpG island is unmethylated in normal tissues, and is one of the most frequent targets for hypermethylation in various cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Hypermethylation of RIL correlates with loss of gene expression, which could be restored in methylated cell lines by 5-aza-dC. Moreover, RIL reexpression leads to a suppression of tumor cell growth and clonogenicity in soft agar as well as sensitization of cells to apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Boumber1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we describe a polymorphism in the RIL promoter that creates an Sp1/Sp3 binding site and protects against methylation in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>In search for causes of aberrant hypermethylation of RIL in cancer, a &#x0223c;500-bp region around the transcription start site of the RIL promoter was sequenced, and a previously unknown polymorphic insertion was identified in the gene. In the population, 2 alleles of RIL exist, long and short, with a polymorphic area near a CGG repeat sequence adjacent to the transcription start site. The long allele is created by insertion of a 12-bp fragment (<named-content content-type="gene">CGGCGGCGGCTC</named-content>) and a substitution of T to G 3 bases upstream of the insertion site in the short allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> analysis identified additional putative binding sites for 3 transcription factors which appear only in the long allele. To more fully characterize this phenomenon and determine the frequency of alleles, a total of 326 normal samples were sequenced, which included 227 normal colon and 99 normal blood samples. In the normal population, 45&#x00025; of people are homozygous for the short allele, 44&#x00025; heterozygous and 11&#x00025; homozygous for the long RIL allele. We have also determined the frequency of the RIL alleles among 240 cancer specimen which included 113 colon cancers, 100 MDS and 27 AML samples. We found that 44&#x00025; of those were homozygous for the short allele, 40&#x00025; heterozygous and 16&#x00025; homozygous for the long RIL allele.</p><fig id="pgen-1000162-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000162.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Identification of RIL Promoter Polymorphism and Preferential Methylation of the Short Allele in Cancer.</title><p>(A) Map of RIL the CpG island.

We initially noticed that methylated heterozygous tumors analyzed by COBRA seem to have preferential methylation of the short allele. After digestion of the COBRA products obtained from several homozygous and heterozygous tumors, we observed that among the 2 allele-specific bands, the predominant one is the lower band, which represents methylated short allele molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000162.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This led us to a suspicion that the short allele is more methylated than the long. For further studies, we decided to use pyrosequencing method, which is more quantitative in detecting methylation. To make sure that no amplification bias exists in detecting methylation, we designed all the assays primers either upstream or downstream of the insertion. We then tested the pyrosequencing assay A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) by studying mixed normal unmethylated with methylated DNA at known ratios, and found no bias in amplifying unmethylated vs. methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000162.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Next, we studied methylation in 48 primary cancer samples (18 homozygous long and 30 homozygous short) which included 44 colon cancer and 4 AML cases with this assay, and found that homozygous short tumors showed mean 51.7&#x00025;&#x0002b;/&#x02212;3.8&#x00025; methylation density vs. mean 24.7&#x00025;&#x0002b;/&#x02212;4.5&#x00025; methylation for homozygous RIL long tumors, and thus had a 2.1 fold increased methylation density (P&#x0003c;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We also studied 34 MDS samples (which included 11 homozygous long and 23 homozygous short) using pyrosequencing assay B (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and found similar results: homozygous short RIL samples showed mean 35.5&#x00025;&#x0002b;/&#x02212;5.4&#x00025; methylation density vs. mean 14.7&#x00025;&#x0002b;/&#x02212;2.4&#x00025; methylation for homozygous RIL long samples, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.001) (a 2.4 fold difference). To confirm the latter observations, we performed bisulfite sequencing of 10 methylated tumors with heterozygous alleles (6 colon cancer and 4 AML). These data showed that in 8 out of 10 samples studied, the short allele is the primary methylation target, whereas the long one is largely unmethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In the case of AML7, both alleles were methylated, and in case C113 there was a mixture of unmethylated and methylated alleles with no difference in methylation. Furthermore, in C140 and AML5 many of the S alleles remain unmethylated; however this finding may well represent contamination from normal tissues in which both L and S alleles are largely unmethylated, or co-existence of unmethylated and methylated tumor cells. However, even in samples C140 and AML5, the number of methylated clones is higher for the S allele. Using methylation of &#x0003e;30&#x00025; of CpG sites within the clone as an arbitrarily chosen cutoff for dense methylation, the short alleles were 3.1 times more methylated than the long alleles (p&#x0003c;0.001 by the Fisher exact test). Quantitatively similar results are obtained if the cutoff is 20&#x00025;, 50&#x00025;, or without using any cutoff (not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate unequivocally preferential methylation of the short alleles even when they coexist with the long alleles within the same tumor.</p><p>We previously found that RIL methylation increases with age in normal colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Boumber1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. To investigate whether this is influenced by the polymorphism, we studied 46 normal colon samples (17 homozygous short, 15 heterozygous and 14 homozygous long, obtained from individuals with comparable age) using 5 pyrosequencing methylation assays, each covering several CpG sites around the transcription start site, as well as exon 1 and intron 1 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000162.s005">Table S1</xref>). We found that homozygous long samples were significantly less methylated compared to homozygous short in all the regions studied, both upstream and downstream of transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Average methylation percent for the upstream region measured by assays A&#x02013;F was 34.3&#x000b1;1.8 for homozygous short cases, 26.8&#x000b1;2.2 for heterozygous, and 19.4&#x000b1;1.1 for homozygous long cases and therefore the short alleles were 1.8 times more methylated in the normal colon. Finally, all samples showed increased methylation with age, independent of allele status (R&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.42, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.09 for homozygous short, R&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.57, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.03 for heterozygous, R&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.69, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.01 for homozygous long cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We were puzzled by the finding of differential allele methylation and thought that one likely explanation for such a difference is lower expression of the short alleles predisposing them to methylation. We therefore investigated whether the expression levels between the alleles are different <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, we obtained and genotyped 96 primary EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines established from normal individuals and found that 42 of those were homozygous short, 42 heterozygous, and 12 homozygous long. We then analyzed 24 cell lines (12 long and 12 short) for methylation status of RIL by pyrosequencing. We found variable levels of methylation among the cell lines, which was higher for short cell lines, although the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Nevertheless, this difference was quantitatively similar to what we saw in normal (non-malignant) colon tissues. We studied RIL expression in these samples by quantitative PCR and found it to correlate well with methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We then excluded 11 cell lines with methylation above 15&#x00025; and compared 8 unmethylated homozygous long with 5 unmethylated homozygous short cell lines and found no difference in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This led us to conclude that there is no difference in expression between the long and short alleles in a physiologic setting.</p><fig id="pgen-1000162-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000162.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Allele-Specific Expression of RIL in Homozygous EBV-Transformed Cell Lines.</title><p>(A) <italic>Left</italic>, Graphic representation of RIL methylation as determined by pyrosequencing with assay A in 12 long (L) and 12 short (S) EBV-transformed cell lines is shown (values represent averages of two independent pyro measurements for each sample). <italic>Right</italic>, average methylation values&#x0002b;/&#x02212;SEM for homozygous long and homozygous short sample groups are shown.

To determine whether nuclear proteins can bind to the polymorphic region of the long or short alleles, we first performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with nuclear extracts from different cell lines using double-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotides that corresponded to bp &#x02212;69 to &#x02212;37 (L) or &#x02212;57 to &#x02212;37 (S) relative to the translation start site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) of the long and short RIL alleles, respectively. We found strong DNA-binding activity for the L probe in 3/4 cell lines tested (PC3, MDA-MB-231, OVCAR5), whereas no detectable DNA binding activity was observed with the S probe using the same nuclear extracts, even at longer exposures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Three major shifted bands were found as a result of this L probe DNA-binding activity. Specificity of those bands was confirmed by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides (not shown). To map the region responsible for binding, we synthesized shorter versions of the L probe of an equal size to the original S probe: L1, corresponding to nucleotides &#x02212;69 to &#x02212;49; L2, nucleotides &#x02212;57 to &#x02212;37; and L3, nucleotides &#x02212;63 to &#x02212;43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). EMSA results with the nuclear extracts from MDA-MB-231 cells indicated that, while probe L2 had a strong DNA-binding activity resulting in appearance of 3 distinct bands, probes L1 and L3 had no detectable DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, first three lanes).</p><fig id="pgen-1000162-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000162.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Identification of an Additional Sp1/Sp3 Binding Site in the Long Allele of RIL.</title><p>(A) Sequences of EMSA probes.

Incubation of the L2 probe with the nuclear extracts in the presence of Sp3 antibody completely abolished the two lower bands and resulted in supershifted bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Incubation of the L probe with the nuclear extracts and both Sp1, Sp3 antibodies resulted in almost complete disappearance of all three bands, whereas an Egr-1 antibody had no effect on the shifts. We confirmed these results using recombinant human Sp1 (data not shown).</p><p>The results of EMSAs strongly suggested that binding of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins occurs in the 3CTC-containing region of the inserted region of the long allele. First, the L1 and L3 probes were unable to show any DNA-binding activity, and both do not have an intact 3CTC region. Second, the S probe which was also not bound by factors in the nuclear extracts, contains a 2CTC repeat, and in fact has only a 2-nucleotide difference with the L2 probe, thus being a naturally occurring mutant of L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

We then competed the L2 probe with a 20-fold excess of various unlabeled competitors. These experiments revealed poor competition capacity of all the probes where the 3CTC repeat is absent (S, Egr1, LM3-LM5, LM7-LM10 probes), and efficient competition by all probes containing an intact 3CTC sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

We initially stably co-transfected unmethylated RIL allele-specific constructs (construct B) with neomycin-containing plasmids into the mammalian cell lines RKO and NIH3T3, and found that those maintained expression over 3 months, and were resistant to <italic>de novo</italic> methylation (data not shown), as previously reported for multiple genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Clark1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, it has been previously shown using GSTP1 gene as a model that aberrant methylation at a given promoter requires pre-existing &#x0201c;seeds&#x0201d; of methylation which trigger silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Clark1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. To trigger silencing in our system, we used methylation &#x0201c;seeding&#x0201d; of allele-specific transgenes using HpaII methylase, which methylates 9.3&#x00025; of the total CpG sites in construct B (13.5&#x00025; of CpGs of the RIL promoter fragment), and co-transfected those with neomycin-containing plasmids into NIH3T3 cells. The plasmid methylation status prior to transfection was validated by HpaII methylation sensitive restriction enzyme digestion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000162.s003">Figure S3</xref>). After neomycin selection, pooled clones were passaged and analyzed for luciferase expression and methylation. We chose to use pooled clones to avoid the problem of insertion site variegation effect of single clones. Moreover, such a strategy is commonly accepted and has been successfully used before in a similar study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Song1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We measured copy number for every time point and adjusted expression levels of each construct accordingly. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, luciferase readings for both plasmids increased initially, concomitant with stable integration and neomycin selection. However, beyond day 36 post-transfection, RIL expression seemed to be stable for long alleles throughout the course of the experiment, but showed rapid declines for the short alleles. A completely independent seeding/transfection experiment with the same cell line showed similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000162.s004">Figure S4</xref>). We then analyzed methylation status of the constructs after stable transfection with bisulfite sequencing using transgene-specific primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). We found that, at day 19 post-transfection, both constructs were equally methylated at HpaII sites with some evidence of spreading (average methylation 20.3&#x00025; and 19.6&#x00025; for long and short construct, respectively). However, at day 57, the RIL short allele construct remained methylated at the HpaII sites, and in addition, showed substantial evidence of methylation spreading (average methylation 28.1&#x00025;). By contrast, the RIL long allele construct was found to have demethylation, at HpaII sites, which coexisted with modest methylation spreading on other sites and showed lower levels of methylation overall (average methylation 11.7&#x00025;). Thus, the short allele construct was methylated 2.4-fold higher than the long allele construct on day 57 (P&#x0003c;0.001 by Fisher exact test). Interestingly, new methylation in the short construct did not seem to be spreading to CpG sites directly adjacent to HpaII-methylated sites, but was rather observed randomly between those sites, a phenomenon that has been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Song1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, to more fully characterize methylation status of the transgenes, we designed plasmid-specific pyrosequencing assays and measured several time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In general, our methylation and expression data agreed well. However, we must point out that the degree of loss of expression observed for the short alleles cannot be fully explained by methylation gains, thus factors other than methylation (i.e. preceding chromatin changes) might have contributed to the decline in luciferase activity, with methylation following this. In summary, the stably integrated RIL long allele construct is protected from methylation and time-dependent silencing, consistent with several previous observations that Sp1 sites confer protection against DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Mummaneni1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have identified a genetic variation in the promoter region of RIL that results from a presumed insertion of 12 bp around transcription start. This naturally occurring insertion results in a significant 1.8-fold lower methylation of the gene in normal samples, and a 2.1-fold to 3.1-fold lower methylation in cancer that we have traced to the creation of a new Sp1/Sp3 binding site. This finding is consistent with previous reports identifying Sp1 sites as regulatory DNA elements protecting CpG islands from methylation during embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Macleod1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Brandeis1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and can now be extended to hypermethylation in aging and cancer. This model is consistent with the concept proposed by Turker and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Turker1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, which suggests that methylation is a non-random process that results in a misbalance between DNA methylation-promoting events (e.g. abnormal spreading of methylation in <italic>cis</italic> from adjacent &#x0201c;methylation centers&#x0201d;, repeat elements; and methylation &#x0201c;seeding&#x0201d;) and DNA methylation preventing events (i.e., Sp1 elements in the promoters as well as other insulator sequences, and proteins bound to those sequences; as well as demethylation). Our study demonstrates that trans-acting factors can affect hypermethylation in aging and cancer, and establish a new concept in gene inactivation whereby genetic polymorphisms in protein binding sites result in variable susceptibility to epigenetic silencing. A relationship between genetic polymorphisms and aberrant methylation was recently described for MSH2 and was named heritable germline epimutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Chan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar relationship has also been described for MGMT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Ogino1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In these cases, the exact mechanism of such predispositions is unknown. It is attractive to think that these heritable epimutations mechanistically represent polymorphisms that influence DNA-binding proteins, as in the case of RIL. It would now be of interest to determine how many genes hypermethylated in cancer are affected by such promoter polymorphisms.</p><p>The mechanism of Sp1/Sp3 protection against silencing remains unclear. Our studies of RIL expression both <italic>in vivo</italic> in EBV-transformed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), using allele-specific reporter gene assays showed no difference in expression levels between the two alleles of RIL. Rather, our results with the in vitro seeding model are generally consistent with the idea that it protects against time-dependent silencing. However, the degree of methylation spreading observed in the short alleles cannot quantitatively explain the observed prominent drop in transcription over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g004">Figure 4B&#x02013;D</xref>), and we suggest that the effects of the additional Sp1/Sp3 site are to create local protection against a repressive chromatin environment (e.g. histone based silencing) which, secondarily, leads to the observed DNA methylation differences. There are also clear limitations to short term in-vitro assays in modeling in-vivo situations. The experiments described attempt to reproduce in a relatively short period of time an in-vivo situation which evolves over decades of human aging. Nevertheless, it provides an experimental validation of the in-vivo situation, and shows that the short alleles are more prone to time dependent silencing.</p><p>Our findings are in line with previous <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies of the APRT gene that suggested that different Sp1 sites might have different functions; some involved in regulation of gene expression, whereas others in protection against DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Mummaneni1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In support of this model, recent data pointed out that Sp1 may have boundary activities and prevent heterochromatin spreading in yeast, which lack Sp1 homologues: targeting of Sp1 to transgenes in yeast cells unexpectedly revealed barrier activity, which was independent of a transactivation domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000162-Ishii1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

No. Hs00184792_m1). All probes were labeled with the 6-carboxyfluorescein fluorophore (6-FAM) and a nonfluorescent MGB quencher. To normalize RIL expression, GAPDH was used as reference standards; to estimate the relative plasmid copy number per cell, murine beta-globin was used as endogenous reference. Primer and probe sequences used in the experiments were as follows: (1) RIL assay, custom-designed and purchased from Applied Biosystems, cat. No. Hs00184792_m1; (2) GAPDH assay, gapdh-284F, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-ATGGAAATCCCATCACCATCTT-3&#x02032;</named-content>; gapdh-340R, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CGCCCCACTTGATTTTGG-3&#x02032;</named-content>; gapdh-307T (MGB probe, FAM fluorophore labeled), <named-content content-type="gene">5-CGCAGTTGGGCACTT-3</named-content>; (3) Luciferase assay, luc-161F, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CACATATCGAGGTGGACATC-3&#x02032;</named-content>; luc-220R, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- GCCAACCGAACGGACATTT-3&#x02032;</named-content>; luc-184T (MGB probe, FAM fluorophore labeled), <named-content content-type="gene">5-CTTACGCTGAGTACTTC-3</named-content>; (4) Murine beta-globin assay, Mu-bglo-239F, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- AGGCCCATGGCAAGAAAGT-3&#x02032;</named-content>, Mu-bglo-306R, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GCCCTTGAGGCTGTCCAA-3&#x02032;</named-content>, Mu-bglo-259T (MGB probe, FAM fluorophore labeled), <named-content content-type="gene">5-ATAACTGCCTTTAACGATG-3</named-content>. All FAM probes were custom synthesized by Applied Biosystems. The primers were used at 900 nM and the probes at 100 nM concentrations. We used the RNA or DNA amount giving the linear range of response, typically CT range of 20&#x02013;30 amplification cycles. We amplified each gene in separate reactions in triplicates, using a protocol recommended by manufacturer. PCR without reverse transcriptase was performed for each sample to control for the possible interference from gDNA contamination. The threshold amplification cycles (CT) at the normalized reporter signal minus the baseline signal level of 0.2 for RIL, GAPDH, Luciferase and murine beta-globin were determined and their differences deltaCT(GAPDH-RIL) and deltaCT(murine beta globin-Luciferase) were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4n"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical differences of bisulfite sequencing data were calculated using Fisher exact test. To analyze methylation levels across the CpG island, we calculated average&#x000b1;standard error of the mean for each region studied, and performed T-test using Microsoft Excel. To estimate correlation between average methylation density (regions A&#x02013;F) and age for each region in normal colon samples, non-parametric two-tail Spearman test (95&#x00025; confidence interval) was used (Graphpad Prizm 4 software). All EMSA experiments were done in triplicates and yielded identical results. Luciferase assays on cells were performed three separate times, and the results were expressed as average&#x000b1;standard error of the mean calculated using Microsoft Excel.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000162.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Differential methylation of RIL alleles in homozygous and heterozygous tumors revealed by COBRA assay. Here, a RIL COBRA gel image for representative colon cancer and paired normal samples, as well as ML-1 cell line is shown. Allele status of samples is indicated on the top of the gel. In the middle of the gel, the upper arrow indicates an allele-specific band, which is seen only if the long allele undergoes methylation, whereas the lower arrow points to the allele-specific band that is seen if the short allele is methylated. In the bottom of the gel, an allele non-specific band is seen, which is always present if RIL is methylated, regardless of allele status. After digestion of the COBRA products obtained from several homozygous and heterozygous tumors, we observed that among the 2 middle allele-specific bands, the predominant one is the lower band, which represents methylated short allele molecules. Note methylation of only the S allele in heterozygous cases C110 and C140. These findings led us to a suspicion that the short allele is more methylated than the long.</p><p>(0.27 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000162.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000162.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Mixing study for pyrosequencing assay A.

Then, pyrosequencing assay A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000162-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) was tested for bias of estimating methylation by studying mixed RKO, which has near 100&#x00025; methylation as determined previously by COBRA, bisulfite sequencing, and pyrosequencing assays. The graph shows pyrosequencing measurement values determined for bisulfite-treated DNA of mixed RKO and normal blood in the ratio shown on the X-axis. Measured values are plotted alongside with expected methylation values, which are in fact very similar. Thus, we conclude that there is no bias in amplifying unmethylated vs. methylated DNA with the assay.</p><p>(0.04 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000162.s002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000162.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>The HpaII seeding of allele-specific construct B was done by HpaII methylase treatment and the plasmid methylation status prior to transfections was validated first by HpaII restriction enzyme (methylation sensitive) digestion.
