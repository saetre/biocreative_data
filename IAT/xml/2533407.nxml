Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also increases TG and cholesteryl ester levels in kidneys. Here we confirm these findings and define potential mechanisms. LPS decreases renal FA oxidation by 40% and the expression of key proteins required for oxidation of FAs, including FA transport protein-2, fatty acyl-CoA synthase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and acyl-CoA oxidase. Similar decreases were observed in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b1; (PPAR&#x003b1;)-deficient mice. LPS also caused a reduction in renal mRNA levels of PPAR&#x003b1; (75% decrease), thyroid hormone receptor &#x003b1; (TR&#x003b1;) (92% decrease), and TR&#x003b2; (84% decrease), whereas PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; and &#x003b3; were not altered. Expression of PGC1 &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, coactivators required for PPARs and TR, was also decreased in kidneys of LPS-treated mice, as were mitochondrial genes regulated by PGC1 (Atp5g1, COX5a, Idh3a, and Ndufs8). Decreased renal FA oxidation could be a by-product of the systemic coordinated host response to increase FAs and TGs available for host defense and/or tissue repair. However, the kidney requires energy to support its transport functions, and the inability to generate energy via FA oxidation might contribute to the renal failure seen in severe sepsis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acute phase</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor</kwd><kwd>PGC1</kwd><kwd>thyroid hormone receptor</kwd><kwd>carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Published, JLR Papers in Press, June 23, 2008.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Infection and inflammation induce an acute-phase response, which results in increases in specific plasma proteins (positive acute-phase proteins) and decreases in other plasma proteins (negative acute-phase proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). In addition to changes in plasma protein levels, there are also marked changes in circulating lipid and lipoprotein levels, with characteristic findings of increases in serum-free FAs and triglyceride (TG) levels and decreases in serum HDL levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Underlying these changes in serum lipid levels are alterations in lipid metabolism, particularly FA metabolism. In adipose tissue, there is enhanced lipolysis and TG mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), whereas in the liver and heart, there is a decrease in FA oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). In the liver, the decrease in FA oxidation is accompanied by an increase in FA synthesis and the enhanced reesterification of FAs into TG, leading to an increase in VLDL production and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying these acute-phase changes in FA and TG metabolism are not fully understood, but recent studies have suggested that decreases in the expression of nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoid X receptors (RXRs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) play a key role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). There are three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms, PPAR&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4;, and PPAR&#x003b3;&#x0003b; all three receptors are activated by FAs and then stimulate the transcription of specific genes that govern various aspects of FA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). PPARs heterodimerize with RXRs, and bind to specific response elements present in the promoters of their target genes. Among these PPARs, PPAR&#x003b1; activates a program of genes involved in FA oxidation, including carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1), medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Moreover, PPAR&#x003b1; also activates the genes that mediate the uptake of FAs, such as FA transport proteins (FATPs), and their initial derivatization for entry into the &#x003b2;-oxidation pathway, fatty acyl-CoA synthase (FACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Consistent with its role in regulating &#x003b2;-oxidation, PPAR&#x003b1; is primarily expressed in the tissues with high mitochondrial and &#x003b2;-oxidation activity, such as liver, heart, muscle, and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). In addition, activation of TR, another nuclear hormone receptor, which forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR), also stimulates FA oxidation by increasing the expression of CPT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies, we have shown that the expression of RXR, PPAR&#x003b1;, and TR&#x003b1; and -&#x003b2; and the key coactivator PGC1 is decreased in both liver and heart following the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). In addition, PPAR&#x003b1; and TR target genes that are involved in FA metabolism in these tissues are also markedly reduced, suggesting that the decrease in these nuclear hormone receptors and coactivators plays an important role in regulating lipid metabolism during the acute-phase response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Similarly, in adipose tissue, RXR and PPAR&#x003b3; expression is decreased during the acute-phase response, which could contribute to the increase in lipolysis and circulating FFAs that characterize the acute-phase response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have shown that LPS administration results in a marked increase in TG concentrations in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In addition, studies have shown that in the kidney, the mRNA levels of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 1 and 2, enzymes required for TG synthesis, were increased in LPS-treated animals, which could contribute to the increase in TG levels in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies by our laboratory have shown that the expression of RXR&#x003b1;, RXR&#x003b2;, LXR&#x003b1;, and FXR is decreased in the kidney following LPS administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Given that our previous studies have suggested that the changes in FA and TG metabolism in the liver, heart, and adipose tissue during the acute-phase response were in part mediated by changes in the expression of PPARs, TRs, and RXR, we hypothesized that LPS treatment would decrease the expression of PPAR&#x003b1;, PGC1, and TRs in mouse kidney, leading to a decrease in FA oxidation, which could then contribute to the renal TG accumulation that occurs with infection and inflammation.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 55:B5) was obtained from Difco and freshly diluted to the desired concentration in pyrogen-free 0.9% saline.

For a typical experiment, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 &#x003bc;g of LPS in saline or with saline alone. The dose of LPS used in this study has significant effects on TG and cholesterol metabolism, but is nonlethal because the half-maximally lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) for LPS in rodents is &#x0223c;30&#x02013;50 mg/kg body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).

The dose of LPS that produces hypertriglyceridemia is similar to that which produces fever, anorexia, and changes in acute-phase proteins, suggesting that the increase in serum TG levels is a very sensitive physiologic response to infection rather than a toxic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In adipose tissue, lipolysis increases and the FFAs are delivered to the liver, where they are reesterified into TG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Hepatic de novo FA synthesis is increased, and FA oxidation is decreased, facilitating the increased incorporation of FAs into TG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). If the production of TG is greater than the ability to secrete TG in VLDL, fatty liver occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). FA binding protein and FATPs are also decreased in heart, muscle, and adipose tissue after LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Moreover, studies have found a decrease in the uptake and oxidation of FAs and an increase in the accumulation of TG in the heart with sepsis and LPS administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which infection and inflammation alter FA and TG metabolism is not completely understood, but recent studies have demonstrated that LPS administration decreases the levels of RXRs, PPARs, and TRs in liver, heart, and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Moreover, several coactivators, including PGC1&#x003b1; and -&#x003b2;, that enhance the transcriptional activity of RXRs, PPARs, and TRs also decrease in liver, heart, and adipose tissue after LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). In the liver and heart, a decrease in RXRs, TRs, and PPAR&#x003b1; and their coactivators could contribute to the decreased FA oxidation, whereas in adipose tissue, the decrease in RXRs and PPAR&#x003b3; and their coactivators could contribute to the increase in lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>).</p><p>Studies by other investigators have shown an increase in renal TG and cholesteryl ester levels in mice treated with LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In the present manuscript, we confirm these findings. Furthermore, in the present manuscript, we demonstrate that FA oxidation is decreased in the kidney of LPS-treated animals and this metabolic change is associated with a reduction in the expression of a number of key proteins that are important in FA oxidation. As previously reported by others, we find a decrease in FATP2 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Additionally, we also demonstrate a decrease in the expression ACS, CPT-1&#x003b1; and -&#x003b2;, MCAD, and ACO. In contrast, the expression of the enzymes required for FA synthesis, acetyl CoA carboxylase and FA synthase, is not altered in the kidney following LPS treatment. We would speculate that the decreased ability to oxidize FAs results in the increased accumulation of FAs, which provides increased substrate for the synthesis of TG and cholesteryl esters. Moreover, this hypothesis is supported by the studies by other investigators, which have shown that LPS treatment increases mRNA levels of DGAT1 and DGAT2, two enzymes that would enhance TG synthesis from FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>The expression of many of the genes involved in FA oxidation and metabolism is regulated by PPAR&#x003b1; and TR. We have previously shown that the levels of LXR&#x003b1;, FXR, and RXR&#x003b1;, the obligate heterodimers partner for both PPARs and TRs, are downregulated in the kidney following LPS administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In the present study, we show that LPS administration markedly suppresses PPAR&#x003b1;, TR&#x003b1;, and TR&#x003b2; expression in mouse kidney. In addition, the expression of two key cofactors, PGC1&#x003b1; and PGC1&#x003b2;, that regulate the ability of PPARs to increase gene transcription, is also decreased in the kidneys of LPS-treated animals. These effects are specific, because the expression of other PPARs (PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; and PPAR&#x003b3;) and other coactivators (SRC1, SRC2, TRAP, and Lipin 1) is not altered in the kidneys of LPS-treated animals. The decrease in PPAR&#x003b1;, TR&#x003b1;, TR&#x003b2;, PGC1&#x003b1;, and PGC1&#x003b2; mRNA levels could contribute to the decrease in mRNA levels of FATP-2, FACS, CPT1&#x003b1;, CPT1&#x003b2;, and ACO and therefore account for the reduction in FA oxidation in the kidney during infection and inflammation. Thus, the changes in the regulation of FA oxidation and the increase in TG accumulation in the kidney parallel the changes observed in the liver and heart and are probably part of a coordinated metabolic response during infection and inflammation.</p><p>Although PPAR&#x003b1; is clearly an important transcription factor in regulating the expression of genes involved in FA oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), our studies in PPAR&#x003b1; knock-out mice clearly demonstrate that multiple factors regulate the expression of genes involved in FA oxidation. For example, CPT1&#x003b2; mRNA levels in the kidney are reduced by approximately 50% in PPAR&#x003b1; knock-out mice, indicating an important role for PPAR&#x003b1; in regulating the expression of this gene. Nevertheless, LPS treatment resulted in a further reduction in CPT1&#x003b2; mRNA levels. It is known that CPT1 expression is regulated by TR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), and LPS decreases TR in both wild-type and PPAR&#x003b1; knock-out mice. Thus, the decrease in the expression of a number of different transcription factors following LPS treatment is likely to regulate gene expression. Additionally, the LPS-induced decrease in key transcription factor coactivators such as PGC1&#x003b1; and PGC1&#x003b2; is likely to also affect the expression of many genes.</p><p>One can only speculate on the potential beneficial effects of increasing serum TG levels and decreasing FA oxidation in key organs such as the heart and kidney during infection and inflammation. However, during infection and inflammation, there is an increase in serum TG-rich lipoproteins, which could provide lipid substrates for other cells that play a crucial role in host defense or tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Studies by our laboratory have shown that LPS stimulates the uptake of TG by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Moreover, studies have shown that TG-rich lipoproteins directly bind toxic bacterial products such as endotoxin and lipotechoic acid and thereby reduce their harmful effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). A decrease in the uptake and oxidation of FAs in heart and kidney could be part of a coordinated systemic metabolic response to make more TG available for host defense and/or tissue repair.</p><p>In addition to the potential beneficial effects, it is likely that the decrease in FA uptake and oxidation in organs such as the heart and kidney could have detrimental effects. The oxidation of FA produces more energy per molecule, as compared with the oxidation of glucose or lactate&#x0003b; therefore, ATP generated from FA oxidation is an important energy source for these metabolically active tissues. The kidney requires considerable energy to support the transport of numerous electrolytes and small compounds in the tubules. During severe sepsis, multi-organ failure, including renal failure, often occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), and one can speculate that the inability to generate energy via FA oxidation might contribute to the development of this abnormality.</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrates that LPS administration increases kidney TG, FFAs, and cholesteryl ester levels. These increases may in part be accounted for by a decrease in FA oxidation due to the decreased expression of key proteins required for the uptake and oxidation of FAs. Finally, key transcription factors that regulate FA oxidation and metabolism, RXR&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b1;, TF&#x003b1;, and TR&#x003b2;, and their key coactivators, PGC1&#x003b1; and PGC1&#x003b2;, are downregulated in the kidney by LPS treatment and might mediate some of the alterations in FA metabolism that occur during infection and inflammation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>ACO, acyl-CoA oxidase</p></list-item><list-item><p>CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase</p></list-item><list-item><p>C<sub>t</sub>, cycle of threshold</p></list-item><list-item><p>DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase</p></list-item><list-item><p>FA, fatty acid</p></list-item><list-item><p>FACS, fatty acyl-CoA synthase</p></list-item><list-item><p>FATP, FA transport protein</p></list-item><list-item><p>LPS, lipopolysaccharide</p></list-item><list-item><p>MCAD, medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase</p></list-item><list-item><p>PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor</p></list-item><list-item><p>RXR, retinoid X receptor</p></list-item><list-item><p>TG, triglyceride</p></list-item><list-item><p>TR, thyroid hormone receptor</p></list-item></list></glossary><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><name><surname>Gabay</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name>, and I.
