This RNA silencing involves small RNAs of 26-30 nucleotides that are mainly produced from the antisense strand and function through the Piwi protein. Piwi belongs to the subclass of the Argonaute family of RNA interference effector proteins, which are expressed in the germline and in surrounding somatic tissues of the reproductive apparatus. In addition to this germ-line expression, Piwi has also been implicated in diverse functions in somatic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Here, we show that two LTR retrotransposons from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix,</italic> are silenced by an RNA silencing pathway that has characteristics of the rasiRNA pathway and that specifically recognizes and destroys the sense-strand RNAs of the retrotransposons. This silencing depends on Piwi in the follicle cells surrounding the oocyte. Interestingly, this silencing is active in all the somatic tissues examined from embryos to adult flies. In these somatic cells, while the silencing still involves the strict recognition of sense-strand transcripts, it displays the marked difference of being independent of the Piwi protein. Finally, we present evidence that in all the tissues examined, the repression is controlled by the heterochromatic COM locus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data shed further light on the silencing mechanism that acts to target <italic>Drosophila</italic> LTR retrotransposons in somatic cells throughout fly development. They demonstrate that different RNA silencing pathways are involved in ovarian versus other somatic tissues, since Piwi is necessary for silencing in the former tissues but is dispensable in the latter. They further demonstrate that these pathways are controlled by the heterochromatic COM locus which ensures the overall protection of Drosophila against the detrimental effects of random retrotransposon mobilization.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome sequencing projects have revealed that eukaryotic genomes contain large numbers of repetitive sequences and mobile genetic elements. Retrotransposons, which are mobile genetic elements that move through an RNA intermediate in a process termed retrotransposition, are highly abundant and comprise nearly half of the human and a third of the Drosophila genome. It is thus essential that eukaryotic cells retain tight control over these potential invaders in order to protect their genomes from the mutational threat that they pose. This control is especially critical in the germline, where retroelement activity can create a mutational burden that is then transmitted to subsequent generations. As numerous metazoan elements display expression that is restricted to the reproductive apparatus, including the germ line and in surrounding somatic tissues, genomes have evolved specific mechanisms to protect these tissues by further restricting the expression of these elements.</p><p>It has become clear in the last few years that RNA interference (RNAi) plays a major role in ensuring this type of protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Kalmykova1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Sarot1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Three main RNA silencing pathways, acting at the post-transcriptional level and involving three distinct populations of small RNAs&#x02013;siRNAs, miRNAs and piRNAs&#x02013;have been reported to date. siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) are derived from processed double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into siRNAs of 20-24 nucleotides (nt) in length. These siRNAs are loaded onto an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) as single-stranded siRNA molecules which then bind and cleave the target RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Lee1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. miRNAs (microRNAs) of 22 nts in length are endonucleolytically processed from endogenous non-coding transcripts. After their production, they bind the miRISC to mediate RNA silencing. miRNAs are developmentally regulated and play an important role in gene silencing throughout development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Ambros1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Du1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Whereas siRNAs and miRNAs are derived from both the sense and antisense strands of their double-stranded precursors, piRNAs (for PIWI-interacting RNAs) are mainly derived from antisense strands and are produced from discrete genomic loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Brennecke1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Gunawardane1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. piRNAs are from 26&#x02013;30 nts in length and have been reported in germline cells of drosophila, mice, rats and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Aravin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Girard1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In mice and human, they are required for male fertility. In Drosophila, a subset of piRNAs, called rasiRNA for repeat associated small interfering RNAs, has been directly implicated in the protection of the fly germ line against selfish genetic elements such as retrotransposons and repetitive sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Plisson1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Vagin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix</italic> are two LTR retrotransposons that are generally silent in the genome of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Desset1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In the vast majority of lines, these elements do not start their replication cycle and no mobilisation is observed. These lines are denoted S (stable) lines. However, in certain lines, called unstable (U) lines, this control has been perturbed and both elements are highly expressed in the ovaries. As a result of this expression, multiple copies of <italic>ZAM</italic> or <italic>Idefix</italic> become integrated into the germ line and are transmitted through successive generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Desset2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Leblanc1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Characterisation of the U line has shown that an active transposon-silencing process that targets <italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix</italic> has been mutated in this line. The mutated locus has been identified and shown to be a heterochromatic locus called COM, which is located at position 20A2-3 on the X-chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Desset1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Analysis of the replication cycles of <italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix</italic> in U and S lines has indicated that <italic>ZAM</italic> transcripts are only present in the posterior follicular cells of the ovaries of U lines, and not in the ovaries of S lines. Similarly, <italic>Idefix</italic> transcripts are detected in the germarium of U line ovaries, but not in S lines. Overall, our previous work indicated that both elements are subjected to two types of control in Drosophila: first, a regulatory pathway silences the elements and prevents them from initiating their replication cycles. Second, if this silencing is lost, another control mechanism that relies on specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences present in the elements themselves restricts their expression to specific somatic cells of the ovaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Meignin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we have carried out an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic regulatory properties of <italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix</italic>, examining the pathways that promote their silencing in the S lines. We show that the control of <italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix</italic> is mediated by a homology-dependent <italic>trans</italic>-silencing pathway that displays characteristics of the rasiRNA pathway. At the same time, it displays three unique features: <italic>i)</italic> in addition to the reproductive apparatus, the silencing is exerted in most if not all of the somatic tissues of flies; <italic>ii)</italic> Piwi is required in cells of the reproductive apparatus, but it does not play a role in other tissues; <italic>iii)</italic> The function of COM is ubiquitous.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The U5 region of the <italic>ZAM</italic> LTR is sufficient for the differential regulation between S and U lines</title><p>We have previously reported that the transgene denoted pZ499, which contains the full-length LTR of <italic>ZAM</italic> and the first 26 bp of its 5&#x02032;UTR (499 bp) fused to a <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene, responds to the two types of control over <italic>ZAM</italic> expression: i) repression, which depends on the fly genotype (U or S); and ii) tissue-specific activation, which drives expression in a very specific group of cells located at the posterior pole of the follicle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Meignin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The LTR is composed of a U3 region spanning nucleotides 1 to 325, a central R region from nucleotides 326 to 347, and a U5 region from nucleotides 348 to 473. The transcription initiation site defines the boundary between the U3 and R regions, and the polyadenylation site corresponds to the boundary between the R and U5 regions. To investigate the specificity of <italic>ZAM</italic> transcription in the different lines and to localise the sequences involved in its regulation, we analysed the expression of two additional transgenes placed in an S or U genetic background. These transgenes, pZ310 and pZ475, contain <italic>ZAM</italic> fragments extending from nucleotides 1 to 310 or 1 to 475, respectively, fused to the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene. We found that pZ475 responds to both the strain- and tissue-specific controls that have been previously described for the full-length LTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Meignin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>: its expression is restricted to the follicle cells of the U line and is absent in the S line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). By contrast, pZ310 which is expressed from a minimal heat shock promoter responds to the tissue-specific control that restricts its expression to the posterior follicle cells, but is insensitive to the line-specific control, since it is expressed in both the U and S genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001526-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001526.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The U5, but not U3, region of the <italic>ZAM</italic> LTR is required for repression.</title><p>The genomic structure of the <italic>ZAM</italic> retrotransposon is depicted at the top.

These transgenes are sensitive to the S or U status of the line as illustrated by the histochemical detection of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in the ovarioles. pZ310 contains the U3 sequence of the element and is expressed from a minimal heat shock promoter (white arrow) so that no sequence homologous to <italic>ZAM</italic> is present within the p310 transcript.

When these transgenes are transcribed, 149 and 173 nucleotides, respectively, of <italic>ZAM</italic> are present at the 5&#x02032; end of the transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, table). By contrast, the <italic>ZAM</italic> promoter is absent in pZ310, and no <italic>ZAM</italic> sequence is transcribed. To determine whether the <italic>ZAM</italic> promoter or the presence of a <italic>ZAM</italic> fragment within a chimeric transcript is responsible for the differential expression of <italic>ZAM</italic> in the S and U lines, we designed constructs in which a GFP reporter gene, driven by the UASt promoter, is fused downstream of its coding sequence and upstream of the polyadenylation site to diverse fragments of <italic>ZAM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g002">Fig 2 A</xref>). Transgenic lines were established and tested for GFP expression in the ovaries. A 720 bp fragment from within the third ORF of <italic>ZAM</italic> was tested. This fragment corresponds to the region encoding the Env protein, spanning nucleotides 6385 to 7105 of the <italic>ZAM</italic> sequence. This <italic>ZAM</italic> fragment was inserted in an orientation such that transcription of the transgene would give rise to mRNA corresponding to the sense-strand fragment of <italic>ZAM</italic>. Furthermore, the <italic>env</italic> fragment was flanked by FRT elements, which are targets for <italic>flp</italic> recombinase. Transgenic lines were established and denoted pGFP-Zenv. The expression of the UASt transgenes was induced by crossing with flies containing a ubiquitous somatic actin-Gal4 driver in the S genetic background.

The genotype of these lines was &#x0005b;S/S; actin-Gal4/CyO; pGFP-Zenv/pGFP-Zenv&#x0005d;. No fluorescence was detected in either of the lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). A number of these flies were subjected to <italic>flp</italic> recombinase action; to do this, they were crossed with flies expressing the <italic>flp</italic> recombinase under the control of a heat-shock promoter. Embryos laid by these females were then exposed to two heat-shocks at 38&#x000b0;C for 1 hr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001526-Ahmad1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In these conditions, the efficiency of recombination between the two FRTs and the consequent deletion of the intervening <italic>env</italic> fragment is near 100&#x00025;. The resulting flies were denoted pGFP-Z&#x00394;env (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Analysis of the expression of the pGFP-Zenv and pGFP-Z&#x00394;env transgenes, activated by the actin-Gal4 driver in the ovaries, showed that whereas GFP is never expressed in the follicle cells when the pGFP-Zenv transgene is present in an S genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), fluorescence was clearly present in the same S background when the <italic>ZAM</italic> fragment was flipped out (pGFP-Z&#x00394;env transgene <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p>In a second series of tests, we compared GFP expression from the pGFP-Zenv construct in the S and U genetic backgrounds. We found that GFP is only expressed in U line flies, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g002">Fig 2C</xref> for a follicle with genotype &#x0005b;U/U; actin-Gal4/CyO; pGFP-Zenv/pGFP-Zenv&#x0005d;. It should be noted that because of the non-functionality of the UASt promoter in germinal cells, the absence of a signal in the nurse cells or the oocyte is not informative in these experiments.</p><p>When GFP expression was compared between the different transgenic lines using the same settings on the confocal microscope, we found that the GFP signals were always lower in the transgenic U lines bearing the pGFP-<italic>ZAM</italic> sensor transgene than they were with the flipped-out transgenes. This suggests that full expression of GFP might not be recovered in U lines, which may only partially release <italic>ZAM</italic> silencing. Alternatively, the pGFP-Zenv transcripts might be less stable than the shorter pGFP-Z&#x00394;env transcripts. Although this latter hypothesis cannot be excluded, results obtained when analyzing expression of these transgenes through northern blot experiments favour the former one (see below).</p><p>In additional assays, 1 kb of the 5&#x02032; UTR of <italic>ZAM</italic> was placed downstream of the GFP gene, in the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; orientation with respect to <italic>ZAM</italic> transcription. Similar tests as those performed with the pGFP-Zenv transgenic lines were performed. The regulation of the GFP gene in the so-called pGFP-ZU transgenic lines gave the same results as for pGFP-Zenv (data not shown).</p><p>We conclude that the silencing of the pGFP-Zenv and pGFP-ZU transgenes is under the control of a transposon silencing pathway that targets endogenous <italic>ZAM</italic> retrotransposons and that is absent in the U line.</p><p>As <italic>Idefix</italic> is also repressed in S lines and is active in U lines, we used P-element transformation to introduce additional constructs containing UASt repeats located upstream of the GFP reporter gene and different fragments of <italic>Idefix</italic> into the genome of S line flies. We tested two different fragments. One corresponded to a non-coding region from the 5&#x02032; UTR of the gene, and the second to a coding region taken from its <italic>gag</italic> gene. Similarly to the pGFPZU and pGFPZenv transgenes, the <italic>Idefix</italic> fragments were inserted in an orientation such that transcription of the transgenes would give rise to mRNA corresponding to the sense-strand fragment of <italic>Idefix</italic>. These constructs were respectively denoted pGFP-IdU and pGFP-Idgag. Expression of the GFP reporter gene under the control of the actin-Gal4 driver was assayed in the ovaries of flies that were homozygous for both the X chromosome of the stable S line and the pGFP-Id transgene. Results obtained when the <italic>gag</italic> gene from nucleotides 1003 to 1422 was placed downstream of GFP are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g002">Figure 2 D, E, and F</xref>. Similar results were obtained with the pGFP-IdU lines (data not shown). No fluorescence was detected in the ovaries of this S line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). This absence of fluorescence depends upon the S status of the line, because fluorescence was clearly observed when the stable X chromosome was replaced by an X chromosome from a U line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). A <italic>flp</italic> recombinase assay was conducted on the transgenic S/S line, as depicted for pGFP-Zenv. When the <italic>gag</italic> fragment of <italic>Idefix</italic> was flipped out with the <italic>flp</italic> recombinase, giving rise to flies denoted pGFP-Id&#x00394;gag, fluorescence was clearly recovered in the ovaries of S line flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g002">Fig 2E</xref>). These assays were performed on four independent transgenic lines for each construct, giving the same results.</p><p>Thus, it appears that both <italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix</italic> are controlled by a common silencing mechanism that has several definable properties. First, it is active in the follicle cells of S lines. Second, it does not function through a specific sequence present within both elements, but can rather target regions all along their lengths, from their 5&#x02032; to the 3&#x02032; ends. Finally, this silencing mechanism is disrupted in the U lines.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sense-strand transcripts of <italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix</italic> are specifically targeted by the silencing machinery</title><p>A next set of experiments was performed with similar sensor GFP transgenes, but in which the fragments of <italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix</italic> were inserted in the opposite orientation. Specifically, the 720 bp fragment within the third ORF of <italic>ZAM</italic> and the 456 bp fragment corresponding to the 5&#x02032; UTR of <italic>Idefix</italic> were tested in these experiments. These transgenes were denoted pGFP-ZenvAS and pGFP-IdUAS, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001526-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). When transcribed, the resulting transgenes gave rise to transcripts which were antisense with respect to the endogenous <italic>ZAM</italic> or <italic>Idefix</italic> genomic RNAs.

Based on their results, they proposed an amplification loop, the &#x0201c;ping-pong&#x0201d; model, to account for piRNA biogenesis. According to this model, sense transcripts from transposons are cleaved by Piwi or Aub RISC loaded with a piRNA guide. The cleaved transcript is not merely degraded but is also used to program Ago3 RISC. This complex, in turn, cleaves the antisense transcripts that originate from master loci such as the 20A locus. Again, the cleaved RNA serves to program Piwi or Aub RISC. Thus sense and antisense transcripts fuel an amplification cycle.

However, if a link exists between the <italic>COM</italic>-derived small RNA and the silencing of <italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix</italic>, it should implicate another protein than Piwi in the soma. Furthermore, an important piece of data originating in our study remains obscure. Although our genetic analysis points to <italic>COM</italic> as a master regulator of <italic>ZAM</italic> and <italic>Idefix</italic> silencing, some sequences from endogenous <italic>ZAM</italic> are absent from the <italic>COM</italic> locus (release 5 and Hadi Quesneville personal communication). For example, none of them is complementary to the 5&#x02032;UTR fragment of <italic>ZAM,</italic> whose sequence has been directly implicated in the silencing of the pGFP-ZU transgene. A direct interaction between rasiRNAs derived from the 20A locus and these targeted transgenes seems thus to be excluded. In the ping-pong model, the need for mutual complementarity keeps the production confined to one pair of complementary piRNAs, preventing piRNA generation from spreading along a primary transcript as allowed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)-mediated amplification. If piRNA emitted from the COM locus cannot spread along primary <italic>ZAM</italic> or <italic>Idefix</italic> transcripts, then an additional step in the piRNA mechanism should exist to ultimately direct destruction of transcripts bearing any fragment of <italic>ZAM</italic> or <italic>Idefix</italic>. More data are then necessary to understand how such piRNA are generated and what their exact role is in the control. Our present data, however, already implicate the ubiquitous activity of COM coupled to different factors in various tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p>The S line <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and the U line Rev were from the collection of the Institut National de la Sant&#x000e9; et de la Recherche m&#x000e9;dicale UMR384.
