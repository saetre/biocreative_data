However, the role of Retnla in Th2-type immunity is unknown. Here, using Retnla<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and three distinct helminth models, we show that Retnla functions as a negative regulator of Th2 responses. Pulmonary granuloma formation induced by the eggs of the helminth parasite <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> is dependent on IL-4 and IL-13 and associated with marked increases in Retnla expression. We found that both primary and secondary pulmonary granuloma formation were exacerbated in the absence of Retlna. The number of granuloma-associated eosinophils and serum IgE titers were also enhanced. Moreover, when chronically infected with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> cercariae, Retnla<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed significant increases in granulomatous inflammation in the liver and the development of fibrosis and progression to hepatosplenic disease was markedly augmented. Finally, Retnla<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice infected with the gastrointestinal (GI) parasite <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> had intensified lung pathology to migrating larvae, reduced fecundity, and accelerated expulsion of adult worms from the intestine, suggesting Th2 immunity was enhanced. When their immune responses were compared, helminth infected Retnla<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice developed stronger Th2 responses, which could be reversed by exogenous rRelm&#x003b1; treatment. Studies with several cytokine knockout mice showed that expression of Retnla was dependent on IL-4 and IL-13 and inhibited by IFN-&#x003b3;, while tissue localization and cell isolation experiments indicated that eosinophils and epithelial cells were the primary producers of Retnla in the liver and lung, respectively. Thus, the Th2-inducible gene Retnla suppresses resistance to GI nematode infection, pulmonary granulomatous inflammation, and fibrosis by negatively regulating Th2-dependent responses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Retnla is a member of a family of cysteine-rich secreted proteins, referred to as &#x02018;resistin-like molecules&#x02019; or &#x02018;found in inflammatory zone&#x02019; that increase in expression during allergic reactions and following infection with a variety of metazoan parasites. Retnla was originally hypothesized to function as an effector molecule during helminth-induced Th2-type immune responses. Studies conducted here with Retnla-deficient mice, however, suggest that Retnla primarily functions as a regulatory molecule during helminth infection. Using three helminth model systems affecting three different organ systems, we show that Retlna is induced by IL-4 and IL-13 as a mechanism to suppress Th2-type immunity. Retnla deficiency increased inflammation in the lung following i.v. challenge with <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> eggs. Retnla deficiency also accelerated the development of liver fibrosis following <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection. This finding was particularly surprising since Retnla was previously shown to activate collagen-producing fibroblasts that induce fibrosis. Thus, Retnla may represent a novel target for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. Finally, resistance to the intestinal nematode parasite <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> was significantly increased in the absence of Retnla. When viewed together, the combined results from all three models establish a critical role for the Th2-inducible gene Retnla (Fizz1/Relm-alpha) in the suppression of helminth-induced Th2-type immunity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Th1 and Th17 cytokines are believed to be proinflammatory, while Th2 cytokines were historically described as regulatory mediators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Abbas1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Bettelli1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nevertheless, whether Retnla is directly involved in the regulation of Th2-dependent pathology or susceptibility to GI nematode infection remains unknown. A recent study showed that the related Retnla family member, Retnlb, could impair the chemosensory activity of the parasite <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Artis1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, these authors suggested that Retnlb serves as a direct Th2-dependent effector molecule (mediator of resistance) during GI nematode infection. Subsequent studies with Retnlb-deficient mice, however, demonstrated that the generation of protective Th2 cytokine responses and resistance to GI nematode infection was not dependent on Retnlb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Nair3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the functional contributions of the Th2 cytokine inducible Relm family during helminth infection and Th2 response development remain unclear.</p><p>To elucidate the physiological function of Retnla, mice with a targeted deletion of <italic>Retlna</italic> and insertion of the reporter LacZ were investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Munitz1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Valenzuela1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs were injected into the lungs to determine whether there were any tissue-specific differences in either the expression or activity of Retnla. Finally, studies were performed with the nematode <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> to determine whether Retnla was required for the development of protective Th2 cytokine responses in the lung and intestine during nematode infection. Our results demonstrate that Retnla is not required for the development of helminth-induced Th2 responses in the lung, liver, or gut. Instead, Th2 dependent pulmonary inflammation, <italic>S. mansoni</italic>-induced liver fibrosis, and GI nematode expulsion were all significantly enhanced in the absence of Retnla. Thus, these studies demonstrate that Retnla, although induced by IL-4/IL-13, functions as a feedback mechanism to suppress Th2 responses. In the case of <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, Retnla deficiency triggered severe inflammation in the lung and liver, leading to the accelerated development of hepatosplenic disease following infection, while in the case of <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, Retnla<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice expelled their parasites more rapidly from the gut.

Consequently, by promoting Th1- and suppressing Th2-driven inflammation, Retnla appears to exhibit divergent activity during Th1- and Th2-polarized immune responses.</p><p>Thus, while Retnla was originally hypothesized to function as an important effector molecule during Th2 polarized immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Wynn1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Liu2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Gordon1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, our studies with Retnla<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice strongly suggest that Retnla primarily functions as a regulatory molecule. Using three separate model systems affecting three different tissues, we show that Retlna is induced by IL-4/IL-13 as feedback mechanism to suppress Th2 immunity. In the case of granuloma formation in the lung, the deficiency in Retnla led to the development of much larger granulomas and enhanced eosinophil and IgE responses. Thus, Retnla regulates several features that are commonly associated with allergic inflammation. Preliminary results with a murine asthma model suggest that Retnla also suppresses the development of AHR, which is consistent with the suppression of IL-13 responses by Retnla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-WillsKarp1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Retnla deficiency also significantly augmented the development of IL-13-dependent fibrosis following <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection. Thus, Retnla may represent a novel target for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, which currently lack effective therapeutics. Finally, Retnla deficiency significantly accelerated the expulsion of <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> from the gut. When viewed together, the combined results from all three models establish a critical immunoregulatory role for Retnla in helminth induced Th2-type immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal work was conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Mice, parasite infections</title><p>The Retnla<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Munitz1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> were generated with Velocigene technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000393-Valenzuela1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and backcrossed to the C57BL/6 background for 10 generations at the NIH.
