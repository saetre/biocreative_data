We report an important role for VCAM-1/VLA-4 interactions in the generation of immune responses during experimental visceral leishmaniasis caused by <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>. Our studies demonstrate that these molecules play no direct role in the recruitment of leukocytes to the infected liver, but instead contribute to IL-12p40-production by splenic CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> dendritic cells (DC). Blockade of VCAM-1/VLA-4 interactions using whole antibody or anti-VCAM-1 Fab&#x02032; fragments reduced IL-12p40 mRNA accumulation by splenic DC 5 hours after <italic>L. donovani</italic> infection. This was associated with reduced anti-parasitic CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell activation in the spleen and lowered hepatic IFN&#x003b3;, TNF and nitric oxide production by 14 days post infection. Importantly, these effects were associated with enhanced parasite growth in the liver in studies with either anti-VCAM-1 or anti-VLA-4 antibodies. These data indicate a role for VCAM-1 and VLA-4 in DC activation during infectious disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>VCAM-1 and its major ligand VLA-4 are adhesion molecules required for the recruitment and movement of leukocytes within tissue. In this study, we have investigated the role of these molecules during an experimental infection with <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>, a protozoan parasite that causes a chronic disease called visceral leishmaniasis. Surprisingly, we showed that VCAM-1 and VLA-4 were not required for leukocyte migration into the liver, a site of acute <italic>L. donovani</italic> infection. Instead, there was a requirement for these molecules to initiate cell-mediated immune responses in the spleen within the first 5 hours of infection. When VCAM-1 was blocked during infection, early dendritic cell production of IL-12p40, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine required for control of <italic>L. donovani</italic>, was suppressed, associated with a reduced parasite-specific T cell response in the spleen, and impaired immunity and parasite clearance in the liver. These results are important because they identify a novel role for VCAM-1 and VLA-4 in the regulation of dendritic cell activation during infectious disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Very late antigen-4 (VLA-4; &#x003b1;4 integrin; CD49d) is expressed on most leukocytes and plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking by interacting with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1; CD106) on endothelial cells to mediate tethering, rolling, firm adhesion and transendothelial migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000158-Alon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000158-Berlin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our data suggest that VLA-4/VCAM-1 interactions play a role in these events. Blockade of VCAM-1 did not affect splenic parasite burden in the first 24 hours of <italic>L. donovani</italic> infection (data not shown), suggesting that VLA-4/VCAM-1 interactions play no role in parasite uptake by macrophages. In addition, the acquisition of parasites by CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC was not prevented by VCAM-1 blockade. Histological examination of spleen tissue indicated that red pulp macrophages were the main VCAM-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell population in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000158-g005">Figures 5A and B</xref>). However, these cells are spatially segregated from the IL-12p40-producing DC found in the MZ and T cell zones. In the MZ, sinus lining endothelial cells and MZ macrophages express VCAM-1, and importantly, are found in close proximity to DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000158-g005">Figures 5C and D</xref>).

Although this result suggests that later cellular interactions might be VCAM-1 dependent, only a small proportion of transferred DC (less than 10&#x00025;) were found in the spleen 24 hours after transfer.

We failed to detect VCAM-1 expression by DC in the spleen either prior to or during infection, thus questioning the potential for VLA-4/VCAM-1 interactions in the SMAC of any IS that formed between DC presenting parasite antigen and <italic>L. donovani</italic>-specific T cells in the spleen after infection. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that physiologically relevant VCAM-1 expression on splenic DC is present, but beyond the detection limits of the histological and FACS methods we have employed. All conventional DC subsets in the spleen are capable of T cell activation, and the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC isolated from <italic>L. donovani</italic>-infected mice 5 hours p.i. promote IL-12/23p40-dependent skewing towards IFN&#x003b3; production by responding CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000158-Maroof1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC are capable of acquiring <italic>L. donovani</italic> amastigotes independent of VCAM-1 early after infection, and these infected cells are able to produce IL-12p40 (Maroof, unpublished). Our data also indicate that VCAM-1/VLA-4 interactions play an important role in the priming of parasite-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.</p><p>Short-term (5 hr) experiments with anti-VCAM-1 Fab&#x02032; fragments suggested that Fc&#x003b3;R ligation on DC was not responsible for the observed reduced DC IL-12p40 production. However, blockade of VCAM-1 and the reduction of DC IL-12p40 with Fab&#x02032; fragments was not as effective as whole mAb, perhaps due to their extremely short half-life and rapid excretion by the kidney due to their low molecular weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000158-Morris1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000158-Macfarlane1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Ideally we would have liked to confirm our results at day 14 with Fab&#x02032; fragments, as well as whole mAb. However, it would not be possible to interpret the results of such long-term experiments accurately due to the limitations discussed above.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that VCAM-1/VLA-4 interactions modulate CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC IL-12p40 production and may play a role in the activation of parasite-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells during disease. Furthermore, our data indicate that VCAM-1 and VLA-4 are not directly involved in cellular recruitment to the liver during VL. These findings advance our understanding of the induction of cell-mediated immune responses following pathogen challenge, and identify a potential target for modulation to either enhance or suppress inflammation during disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>Inbred female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from the Australian Resource Centre (Canning Vale, Western Australia), and maintained under conventional conditions.
