One member of the UCH family, UCH L1, is expressed in a number of malignancies suggesting that this DUB might be involved in oncogenic processes, and increased expression and activity of UCH L1 have been detected in EBV-immortalized cell lines. Here we present an analysis of genes regulated by UCH L1 shown by microarray profiles obtained from cells in which expression of the gene was inhibited by RNAi. Microarray data were verified with subsequent real-time PCR analysis. We found that inhibition of UCH L1 activates genes that control apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and at the same time suppresses expression of genes involved in proliferation and migration pathways. These findings are complemented by biological assays for apoptosis, cell cycle progression and migration that support the data obtained from microarray analysis, and suggest that the multi-functional molecule UCH L1 plays a role in regulating principal pathways involved in oncogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Modification of proteins by ubiquitination is a fundamental mechanism for regulating numerous cellular processes including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, antigen presentation, cell-cell communication, cell differentiation and apoptosis.

In addition, gene-expression profiles after over-expression of UCH L1 in an esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line indicated that expression led to induced expression of plaminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). PAI-1 is associated with cancer growth and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006764-Hibi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine the alterations in global gene expression produced by suppression of UCH L1 levels, we used HEK 293T, SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney cells that grow as an adherent culture, and KR4, an EBV-transformed B-cell line that grows in suspension. These two cell types were chosen in order to identify a broad spectrum of specific gene-expression changes that could result from inhibition of UCH L1 expression. For the analyses, we created stable cell lines expressing GFP and two different UCH L1 siRNAs (UCH L1 siRNA1 and UCH L1 siRNA2) in both cell types. Total RNA extracted from the GFP and the two UCH L1 siRNA-expressing cell lines were used in microarray and QRT-PCR analyses. There was considerable reduction in UCH L1 RNA and protein levels in the 293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006764-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>) and KR4 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006764-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>) expressing UCH L1 but not GFP siRNA. In addition, C33A, an HPV-negative cervical cancer cell line, was transiently transfected with GFP siRNAs and two different UCH L1 siRNA to compare the effects of UCH L1 suppression on a primary cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006764-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). These results demonstrate that both the UCH L1 siRNAs were capable of effectively reducing UCH L1 RNA and protein levels by approximately 70&#x00025; in 293T and KR4 cells. However, in C33A cells under transient transfection conditions (transfection efficiency &#x0223c;70&#x02013;80&#x00025;), suppression of UCH L1 was approximately 40&#x00025;. To avoid off-target effects of siRNA, we employed 2 different siRNAs.</p><fig id="pone-0006764-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006764.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Suppression of UCH L1 expression by RNAi.</title><p>HEK 293T or LCL KR4 cells were transfected with control GFP siRNA or either of two UCH L1 siRNAs in pRS vector and selected with puromycin. C33A cells were transiently transfected with control GFP siRNA or two UCH L1 siRNAs (for 48 h). Total RNA was extracted from control and UCH L1 siRNA-expressing cells and quantitative real-time PCR assays performed with gene-specific primers to determine the UCH L1 RNA levels. Each reaction was performed in triplicate and was normalized to GAPDH as an internal control. Whole-protein lysates were extracted from control and UCH L1 siRNA-expressing cells, and western blot analysis was performed for UCH L1 or GAPDH protein levels with specific antibodies. UCH L1 RNA and protein levels are shown for 293T (A) or KR4 (B) and C33A cells (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006764.g001"/></fig><p>Gene-expression profiles were measured with RNA extracted from UCH L1 siRNA-expressing cells with the use of Agilent Whole Human Genome Array (44K) containing &#x0223c;41,000 unique probes. To strengthen the experimental design, we used UCH L1 siRNA1 and siRNA2 for KR4 and UCH L1 siRNA1 for 293T cells, respectively, to determine changes in gene expression. A dye-swap was performed for both cell types to eliminate dye-bias. Thus, the total number of RNA samples used for hybridization with 44K Agilent arrays was 12; altogether 6 arrays were used. The parameters used to identify significantly altered gene expression included: fold change of 1.5, Student's T test, normalization to the median, quality of 1 and log transformation of data. In addition, the Benjamini and Hochberg method of correction was applied to estimate the false discovery rate with a confidence of 5&#x00025;. By applying these parameters we identified a number of statistically significant genes which were analyzed further for biological consequences of such changes. The quality of data generated was verified with scatter plots, which provide a graphical view of alterations in the control versus UCH L1 siRNA cell lines, for which the log of mean intensity for each pair of replicates was plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006764-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0006764-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006764.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Identification of Statistically Significant Genes.</title><p>Scatter-plots of signal intensity comparisons between GFP siRNA and UCH L1 siRNA.

Box plots for control and UCH L1 siRNA samples demonstrate that the mean and range of signal amplitudes were very similar for all samples (data not shown). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) abridges the task of identifying sources of relative variability in a high dimensional data set by reducing the dimensions, and therefore the complexity, of the data set. PCA was used to determine the variability among the data set. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006764-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>, the UCH L1 siRNA samples differed from their respective controls and were clustered together when plotted according to correlation with the first two principal components. At the same time, the results also show that the two cell types are different.</p><p>Venn diagrams were used to identify the overlapping genes among different samples. We were interested in determining common genes regulated by UCH L1 in the two cell types, so we generated Venn diagrams by combining the separate gene lists obtained from Genesifter analysis after applying the selected parameters and then manually identified the common genes in the two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006764-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). Of the total genes affected, 201 unique genes were up-regulated and 204 were down-regulated, which were common to both cell types. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006764.s004">Table S1</xref> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006764.s004">Table S1</xref></bold>) shows the common gene list assembled from the affected genes. Among these, some genes were identified more than once as they were represented on the microarray by more than one probe set, which provided an additional internal control and increased confidence in the results. In addition, the Spike-In control showed slopes in the range of 0.997 to 0.88 across all the arrays, further increasing confidence in the data set.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Validation of Microarray Data with Quantitative Real Time-PCR</title><p>To validate microarray results, QRT-PCR analysis was performed for 19 genes encoding proteins with known function. Genes selected were affected in both cell types and represented different physiological pathways (proteins involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, proliferation, and migration) and different ranges of fold change. We selected a few genes whose expression was altered only in 293T or in KR4 cells to demonstrate the specificity of the microarray data. We validated microarray data with respect to direction of change of expression (up or down) for 293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006764-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>), KR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006764-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>) and for C33A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006764-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>). We were able to validate some genes detected in only one or either cell type by microarray. Since the suppression of UCH L1 was lower in C33A cells, the extent to which these genes were altered in this cell line was different as compared to the other two cell lines. A comparison between microarray data and QRT-PCR showed good correlation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006764-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). The magnitude of changes for most of the significantly altered genes was larger in QRT-PCR assays than in the microarray data, as is commonly observed. Quantitative differences between the QRT-PCR and microarray results were probably due to variations in efficiency of cDNA synthesis among samples, primer-dimer formations, mispriming, and lower efficiency at later cycles as amplification products compete for DNA polymerase. Also, the normalization method used for microarray and QRT-PCR assays was different, especially in the number of genes used for normalization for microarray versus QRT-PCR.</p><fig id="pone-0006764-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006764.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Validation of Selected Microarray Results by QRT-PCR.</title><p>The same total RNAs isolated from GFP and the 2 UCH L1 siRNA-expressing cells as used in the microarray experiments were reverse-transcribed and quantitative real-time PCR was performed with gene-specific primers.
