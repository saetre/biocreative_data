Knockdown of E2F-4 or Egr-1 inhibited CSE-induced LC3B expression. Knockdown of Egr-1 also inhibited the expression of Atg4B, a critical factor for LC3B conversion.

In our recent comprehensive gene expression analyses, we found a number of genes that were differentially expressed between COPD smokers with and without lung function impairment. Among these, we identified the early growth response-1 (Egr-1) as a gene whose expression changed significantly in COPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Ning1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Egr-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor classified as an immediate-early response protein, which is potentially induced by a variety of cellular stressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Lee1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Egr-1 regulates the expression of many genes, including repair enzyme systems, angiogenic factors, cytokines, apoptotic factors, cell cycle factors, metabolic factors and proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Yan1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of Egr-1 in the pathogenesis of COPD remains incompletely understood.</p><p>Recent studies have implicated other epigenetic factors potentially involved in COPD progression, among which include histone deacetylases (HDAC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Ito1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Narlikar1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Acetylation of core histones leads to changes in chromatin structure that subsequently allow transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to bind to DNA and enhance gene transcription. Conversely, deacetylation of histones is generally associated with the repression of transcription. HDACs can also modulate the acetylation state and activity of major transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Narlikar1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The relationship between HDAC activity and the regulation of Egr-1 is currently unknown.</p><p>Programmed cell death mechanisms may contribute significantly to lung cell death and tissue injury following exposure to cigarette smoke, though their role in COPD pathogenesis remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Henson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent examination of lung tissue from COPD patients reveals the presence of apoptotic cells in greater numbers than in control lungs or those from smokers without COPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Yokohori1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Kasahara1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Apoptotic cells include alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells as well as endothelial cells in the parenchyma. In rodents, induction of endothelial or epithelial apoptosis is accompanied by loss of pulmonary alveoli and pathological evidence of emphysematous changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Petrache1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Blockade of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors caused alveolar cell apoptosis, oxidative stress and emphysema-like disease in both rats and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Kasahara2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This evidence suggests that apoptosis is a crucial step in emphysema and COPD.</p><p>Autophagy is a dynamic process responsible for the turnover of cellular organelles and long-lived proteins. During autophagy, cytosolic proteins and organelles (<italic>e.g.</italic>, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum) are engulfed into double-membrane bound vesicles (autophagosomes or autophagic vacuoles). The outer membrane of the autophagosome subsequently fuses with lysosomes to form autolysosomes in which the engulfed components are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases, regenerating metabolic precursors that are recycled for macromolecular synthesis and ATP generation. Autophagy is induced above basal levels in response to diverse stimuli including nutrient starvation, genotoxic agents, cytokines, and oxidative stress. This process provides an essential function in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and adaptation to adverse environments. Under certain conditions, however, excessive autophagy may promote cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Levine1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Levine2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

The regulation and functional significance of autophagy in human tissues under physiological or pathological conditions remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, nothing is currently known of the possible role of autophagy in emphysema and COPD.</p><p>We report here for the first time that increased autophagy is associated with cigarette smoke-induced lung injury and COPD. We sought to determine the specific relationships between epigenetic factors, such as HDAC activities and Egr-1, which are modulated by cigarette smoke, and their roles in the regulation of autophagy by cigarette smoke. The current study demonstrates that cigarette smoke-dependent decreases in HDAC activity are functionally linked to the induction of autophagy. HDAC inhibition increases the expression of microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3B (LC3B), a key mediator of autophagy. We show that this process involves an HDAC-dependent regulation of E2F and Egr-1 transcription factors, which cooperatively regulate the LC3B promoter. Egr-1 is also essential for the regulation of Atg4B, which regulates the activation state of LC3B. We identify Egr-1 as an important regulator of lung cellular and tissue responses to cigarette smoke exposure. Our results implicate Egr-1 as a key mediator of cigarette smoke-induced autophagy and apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and thereby demonstrate a critical role for Egr-1 in COPD pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Increased autophagy in human COPD lung tissues</title><p>To investigate the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of COPD, lung tissue sections from control or COPD patients were analyzed for the expression of autophagy proteins.

Electron microscopy (EM), a gold-standard method for determination of autophagy, revealed that autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes/autolysosomes) were dramatically increased in COPD lung tissues, whereas little vacuole formation was evident in control tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining indicated that the expression of LC3B was significantly increased in COPD lung tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining of COPD lung tissue indicated that LC3B expression was localized to epithelial cells and macrophages (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Examination of various stages of COPD, according to the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) for classifying disease severity in COPD, revealed elevations of these markers at GOLD0 which were sustained throughout the disease progression (GOLD2-4), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting that autophagy represents a response to cigarette smoke exposure, as well as an early event in the progression of emphysema.

We also examined the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in response to cigarette smoke. We have observed that blockage of autophagy by LC3B-siRNA attenuated CSE-induced epithelial cell apoptosis and consequently increased cell viability, suggesting that autophagy functioned as a mediator of apoptosis in this model. Consistently, autophagy was induced at very low CSE concentrations (as low as 1&#x00025;) and at earlier times (as early as 4 h)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In COPD patients, as early as GOLD0, there was dramatic increase of autophagy and autophagic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g001">Figs. 1A&#x02013;C</xref>) which was evident throughout the disease progression (up to GOLD4), whereas caspase-3 activation occurred only at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). These findings, taken together, suggest that autophagy is an essential and early response to cigarette smoke which mediates apoptosis and eventually promotes cell death, thereby potentially playing an important role in COPD pathogenesis.</p><p>Some limitations exist in the use of CSE to study <italic>in vitro</italic> responses to cigarette smoke, including exclusion of some volatile components present in cigarette smoke, and variations in the preparation method in between individual laboratories. Nevertheless CSE remains a useful model of <italic>in vitro</italic> smoke exposure that has the potential to uncover important biological pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Shapiro1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. It should be mentioned that the CSE concentrations used in our present study appear to be higher than other previous reports by other investigators. In previous work, CSE is typically prepared in serum free medium, and used in cultures preconditioned with serum free media. In our present study, we compose our CSE in complete culture medium to avoid induction of autophagy through the serum starvation pathway. Higher CSE concentrations are apparently required for apoptosis and cell death in complete medium relative to serum free media.</p><p>Epigenetic factors have recently come into focus as possible mechanisms underlying susceptibility to COPD in certain individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Adcock1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Surgically resected lung tissue from nonsmokers or GOLD0-4 smokers, showed significant decreases of HDAC activity in COPD lung tissue relative to nonsmokers whose magnitude correlated with disease severity and inflammatory gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Ito1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to lung tissue, HDAC activity was also decreased in alveolar macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage samples of COPD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Ito1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the expression of HDAC2 mRNA and protein in peripheral lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages, declined as a function of disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Ito1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with these prior studies, we have observed decreased HDAC activity in human COPD lung tissue. Furthermore, we show that the acetylation of major histones was increased in COPD lung tissue. Exposure to CSE dose-dependently decreased HDAC activity in pulmonary epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). While HDAC activity is generally associated with transcriptional repression, through the deacetylation of histones, HDACs may also modulate the acetylation state of major transcription factors, and thus have complex effects on gene regulation. Previously, these activities have been linked to the regulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression in chronic lung diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Adcock1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we have suggested a link between HDAC modulation and the regulation of autophagy, as the HDAC inhibitor TSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g004">Figs. 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g002">2C</xref>) and CSE exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g002">Figs. 2A&#x02013;C</xref>) induced autophagy <italic>in vitro</italic> (formation of LC3 puncta, and increased LC3B expression and conversion). Decreases in HDAC led to increases in complex formation between the transcription factor Egr-1 and its coactivator E2F-4, both which displayed increased binding at the LC3B promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). While HDACs have previously been shown to regulate E2F factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Ferreira1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Lu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, we demonstrate that Egr-1 is also regulated by HDAC, such that increased acetylation of the protein was detected with CSE treatment. Our current findings strongly demonstrated a central role of E2F-4 and Egr-1 in regulation of LC3B expression, and thereby also suggest novel targets for regulating autophagy in mammalian systems.</p><p>We also demonstrate that Egr-1 is essential for the upregulation of Atg4B by cigarette smoke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g005">Fig 5B and C</xref>). Atg4B is essential in the cleavage of pro-LC3B to LC3B-I, as a prerequisite for the conjugation of LC3B-I with phosphatydylethanolamine by Atg3/Atg7 ligases. Atg4 plays a dual role in that it also catalyzes the deconjugation of LC3B-II during late stage autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Yorimitsu1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore we conclude that Egr-1 directly regulates LC3B expression by transcriptional regulation of the gene, and also indirectly regulates LC3B conversion through regulation of Atg4B.</p><p>Egr-1 is expressed in the mouse lung in response to cigarette smoke exposure and also <italic>in vitro</italic> in response to CSE exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g007">7B</xref>). We have shown here that elevated Egr-1 expression is also evident in human clinical samples of COPD at all stages of disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Recent studies from this laboratory have revealed that Egr-1 may play a role in cigarette smoke induced lung pathophysiology by regulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, a candidate molecule in emphysema development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Ning1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We have further shown here that <italic>Egr-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are resistant to the pro-apoptotic and pro-autophagic effects of smoke inhalation, as well as cigarette smoke-induced airspace enlargement as assessed by MLI. However, <italic>Egr-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice basally exhibited airspace enlargement, relative to corresponding wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003316-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Since chronic cigarette smoke exposure did not promote further increases in airspace enlargement in <italic>Egr-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, these mice were apparently resistant to smoke-induced injury. While Egr-1 plays an important role in mediating cigarette smoke-induced autophagy and apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic>, this factor, as suggested by previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003316-Landesberg1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, exerts a dominant role in lung homeostasis and growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, <italic>Egr-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice reach a critical threshold of airspace enlargement under basal conditions such that further histologic changes induced by cigarette smoke are not evident <italic>in vivo</italic>. Examination of the role of Egr-1 in lung development may be worthy of further investigation.</p><p>To demonstrate the pivotal role of autophagy in COPD pathogenesis, further experimentation with autophagy gene knockout mice may be warranted.
