Low birth weight is also associated with an increased risk for certain chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). One proposed explanation linking low birth weight to chronic diseases is the Barker &#x0201c;thrifty phenotype&#x0201d; hypothesis, which postulates that the lack of adequate nutrients in the intrauterine environment &#x0201c;programs&#x0201d; the offspring for survival in a nutrient-poor world. It follows that if the actual postnatal environment is not nutrient poor but instead nutrient rich, metabolic pathways will have been &#x0201c;malprogrammed,&#x0201d; leading to adult-onset metabolic syndrome diseases, including atherosclerosis and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). A great deal of evidence now supports the Barker hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>); therefore, current research in humans and in animal models is focused on specific mechanisms for in utero programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>).</p><p>Many types of maternal stresses in different animal models have been used to produce intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). In the current study, we used two mouse models of IUGR, one using maternal protein restriction to examine increased adiposity and glucose intolerance end points, and one using a high-cholesterol maternal environment in LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to examine cardiovascular end points. Previous work using the rat model has shown that maternal protein restriction results in offspring with IUGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>), low muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), adult-onset glucose intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>), hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>), and early aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Maternal effects of a low-protein diet included a significant decrease in the placental protein 11 &#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, an enzyme that protects the fetus from maternal glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). A concomitant increase in glucocorticoid-inducible enzymes was found in the fetuses of dams on a low-protein diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Studies examining maternal programming for atherosclerosis have found a significant association between maternal hypercholesterolemia and increased atherosclerotic lesions in the offspring in newborn and adult rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>), in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>), and in human fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>) and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). Existing evidence for in utero programming from hypercholesterolemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>) includes increased maternal oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>) and an altered adaptive immune response to oxidized LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Although IUGR itself is associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>), high maternal cholesterol in humans has not been established as causative for IUGR. Using a rabbit model, however, it was shown that a moderate 0.2&#x00025; cholesterol, low-fat chow gestational diet resulted in litters with IUGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). The decreased birth weight was associated with an excessive accumulation of lipids in the placenta, suggesting possible interference with nutrient transport to the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>).</p><p>Because maternal protein restriction and hypercholesterolemia both create an abnormal maternal metabolic environment, we hypothesized that there may be a common disruption of metabolic pathways affecting the offspring. To test the hypothesis, we used two mouse models for in utero conditions leading to IUGR, one of protein restriction and one of hypercholesterolemia. We then looked for commonalities in the experimental dams to identify possible pathways for the developmental origins of metabolic syndrome diseases. In both models, the dams had decreased levels of certain essential amino acids.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animal husbandry.</title><p>This study was approved by the UCLA Animal Research Committee and was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals. FVB/J, C57BL/6J (B6), and LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on a B6 background were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).</p></sec><sec><title>Diets.</title><p>The low-protein diet (D02041002; Research Diets) contained 9&#x00025; protein by weight, was isocaloric, and was formulated to match low-protein diets published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). In the low-protein diet, fat content was 4.4&#x00025; and carbohydrates were 77&#x00025; by weight. The control protein diet (standard chow diet TD 7013; Harlan Teklad) was used to feed control protein dams, foster mothers, LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> chow dams, and weaned offspring from both experiments. The control protein diet contained 19&#x00025; protein, 6.2&#x00025; fat, and 75&#x00025; carbohydrates by weight and contributed 18&#x00025; kcal from fat. The Western diet (TD 88137; Harlan Teklad) contained 42&#x00025; kcal calories from fat and by weight as follows: 21&#x00025; fat, 17&#x00025; protein, 49&#x00025; carbohydrates, and 0.2&#x00025; cholesterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein restriction studies.</title><p>B6 females between 2 and 4.5 months of age were allowed to mate during the last 2 h of the dark cycle with males between 2 and 6 months of age. On detection of a vaginal plug at the end of this 2-h period, designated as day 0 of gestation, females were placed on either a 9&#x00025; protein-restricted diet (low protein) or a control diet containing 19&#x00025; protein. Pregnant females underwent cesarean section on gestational day 19. Females were deeply anesthetized with 2&#x00025; isoflurane, and after cervical dislocation, cesarean section was performed under a heat lamp with aseptic technique. Pups were weighed and cross-fostered to a postpartum FVB/J mother to equalize the postpartum environment of both groups. The pups were delivered by cesarean section because our previous attempts to generate IUGR in mice via protein restriction were unsuccessful secondary to cannibalization of the pups by the mother. The range in age of the dams was from 2 to 4.5 months because the females were old enough to breed at 2 months but not so old that confounders, such as reduced litter size, may have occurred. Because the dams cannibalized many first litters, necessitating the change to cesarean section births and fostering, some of the offspring were from second litters. There were no statistical differences between the birth weights, litter sizes, or adult phenotypes between first and second litters; therefore, we combined the litters with the same in utero exposure. For low-protein birth weight comparisons, seven low-protein and seven control litters were evaluated. At 1 week of age, pups were weighed again, and the litter culled to six. Fostered pups were weaned at 4 weeks of age into cages of four animals, separated by sex and maternal environment (low-protein vs. control). The protein-restricted litters were not measured for atherosclerotic lesion size in adulthood because wild-type C57BL/6 mice do not develop lesions on a chow low-cholesterol diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Hypercholesterolemia studies.</title><p>LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> females were placed on chow diet or high-fat, moderate-cholesterol diet (Western diet) for 6 weeks and subsequently bred with LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> males maintained on chow. LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had plasma cholesterol concentrations of &#x0223c;250 mg/dl on a standard chow diet, which represented the control cholesterol environment. On a Western diet, the LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had cholesterol concentrations up to 1,000 mg/dl, which represented the experimental high-cholesterol environment. The progeny of LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> females on a chow diet or Western diet constituted the LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> control or Western offspring, respectively. Fasting plasma cholesterol concentrations were determined for both sets of LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> females before breeding, and the LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> offspring delivered vaginally were fostered at birth. Four hypercholesterolemia litters and two control litters were evaluated. The pups were weaned and separated by sex and maternal diet at 4 weeks of age. The offspring of both LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> control and Western-diet litters were fed a chow diet on weaning. Initially the LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Western offspring exhibited a very low survival rate (&#x0223c;1 pup in an 8-pup litter survived) compared with LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> control offspring (6&#x02013;7 pups survived per 8-pup litter). However, fostering the pups at birth equalized the survival rates for both groups. An important study by Napoli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>) demonstrated a maternal-diet effect on lesion size at 90 days in LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice offspring. This time point was therefore chosen for the current study. After an overnight fast, LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> adult offspring were deeply anesthetized with 2&#x00025; isoflurane and weighed, blood was collected by retro-orbital sinus puncture, tissues were harvested after cervical dislocation, and gonadal fat pads were dissected and weighed.</p></sec><sec><title>Maternal plasma amino acid analysis.</title><p>Maternal plasma amino acid analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography at Baylor University Medical Center Institute of Metabolic Diseases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.baylorhealth.edu/imd/">http://www.baylorhealth.edu/imd/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). This experiment was repeated to detect possible variation in the amino acid analysis. In the first study, dams were allowed to deliver their pups and were then given anesthesia with 2&#x00025; isoflurane before retro-orbital exsanguinations within 4 h of delivery. This postpregnancy time was chosen to minimize any adverse effect of exsanguinations on the fetus and to maximize the effect of various diets on mothers. In the second study, blood samples were taken from females 1&#x02013;2 weeks postpartum, while maintaining the same diet they were on during pregnancy. We observed similar trends in both experiments and therefore combined our data from the two studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Glucose tolerance tests.</title><p>Glucose tolerance tests were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>) on the low-protein and control offspring at 126 days (4 months) and 210 days (7 months) of age. The mice were weighed, shaved on the hind limbs, and fasted overnight. The following morning, fasting glucose was measured in blood collected from saphenous vein puncture, after which 2 mg/g glucose load was administered intraperitoneally. Serial blood glucose measurements were performed at 0.5-h intervals over the next 2 h from saphenous venipunctures. The One Touch Ultra glucometer (Lifescan) was used to measure whole-blood glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Body composition.</title><p>This was performed in a rodent nuclear magnetic resonance scanner (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA) that was standardized to an internal control provided by the manufacturer. The mice were individually weighed on a scale and then placed in the scanner for measurement of body composition, analyzed as percent fat mass (also referred to as adiposity), percent muscle mass, and percent liquid mass. Total body fat was calculated using the scale weight of each mouse on that day.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma lipid analysis.</title><p>Mice were fasted overnight, and retro-orbital blood was collected under isoflurane anesthesia.

Serial 10-&#x003bc;m-thick cryosections from the middle portion of the left ventricle and the aortic arch were collected and mounted on poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysine&#x02013;coated plates. Sections were stained with the lipid stain oil red O and hematoxylin. The lipid-stained areas were viewed under the light microscope and manually counted by a blinded observer. Scores were determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis.</title><p>All values are expressed as means &#x000b1; SE. A mean litter weight was used to compare birth weights in the protein restriction IUGR model. This was done to avoid a type 1 error, because the actual number of newborn pups was very large and to minimize the effect of within-litter differences. The two-way ANOVA model was used to simultaneously compare independent variables in two groups to assess the effect of sex and maternal environment on the offspring. In LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> litters, the litter sizes and within-litter weights did not vary significantly (6&#x02013;7 pups per litter), and thus, individual pup weights were averaged instead. The <italic>P</italic> values for all group comparisons were assigned using the post hoc Fisher's protected least significant difference correction. One-way ANOVA was used when single-sex comparisons were performed. Statview version 5.0 software was used for analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Protein-restricted mouse model for IUGR.</title><p>In utero growth restriction has been associated with malnourishment during pregnancy leading to adult-onset metabolic disorders. To develop a mouse model of IUGR, we fed C57BL/6J females a low-protein diet beginning on day 0 of gestation.

Amino acid concentrations may vary at different time points, and thus, we repeated these studies in a separate experiment. We observed similar trends in both experiments, and therefore combined our data from the two studies. Particularly noteworthy in the low-protein versus control dams were reduced concentrations of phenylalanine (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01) and the branched chain amino acids leucine (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.03), isoleucine, and valine (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.015).

Our low-protein model mimicked the well-established rat low-protein IUGR model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>) and complemented a previously described protein-restricted IUGR mouse model characterized for lifespan and adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). In our study, the IUGR male offspring of protein-restricted dams became glucose intolerant with increased adiposity compared with controls. IUGR low-protein females did not differ significantly from controls in glucose tolerance and maintained a lower growth curve throughout. In the second arm of the experiment, we used genetically altered LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that are susceptible to atherosclerosis to induce features caused by IUGR that may contribute to atherosclerosis. The offspring of LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> dams fed a Western diet in our study had lower birth weights and more severe atherosclerotic lesions than controls at 90 days of age. Of particular significance, both protein-restricted and hypercholesterolemic dams had decreased plasma concentrations of several essential amino acids.</p><p>The IUGR models in our study differed in a few key areas. First, a sex difference in weight gain and glucose intolerance was seen in the low-protein model. Males, but not females, caught up in weight to the control offspring by the eighth week of age and developed glucose intolerance by 32 weeks of age. This sex difference has been found in other mouse models, including a recent investigation of heterozygous GLUT3-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Also, in a transgenic mouse model of the hypothalamic-expressed regulator for food intake, neuropeptide Y receptor 1, a sex effect was seen. NPYR1 transgenic males, but not females, gained excess weight on a high-fat diet and lost weight with the administration of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). Thus, the sex difference that we saw in weight gain, adiposity, and glucose tolerance in the low-protein group is consistent with other findings and indicates the likely participation of the endocrine system in the etiology of these traits.</p><p>Contrasting with the outcomes for low-protein offspring, LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Western-diet progeny in our study did not catch up with controls in weight or in adiposity by the 90-day time point that was chosen for evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions. Several explanations for this might be considered, including <italic>1</italic>) that these IUGR mice require &#x0003e;3 months to catch up with controls, or <italic>2</italic>) that a combination of a high-fat diet and hypercholesterolemia programmed the offspring differently for metabolism and weight gain in adulthood. A high-fat maternal diet in rats was recently shown to prevent excess weight gain in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). Based on tracking of food intake, this study provided evidence that the high-fat in utero diet likely programmed the offspring to metabolize or use energy less efficiently, preventing them from gaining excess weight in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). Therefore, the absence of excess adiposity and weight gain in the hypercholesterolemia IUGR offspring in the current study could be due to hypothalamic programming via the high-fat maternal diet. Although the LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Western diet IUGR litters may have eventually led to excess weight gain and glucose intolerance at an advanced age, other experiments have shown that the chow diet does not produce these end points in B6 LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice by 90 days of age. Instead, a high-fat diet was necessary to bring about these metabolic syndrome traits in LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at this time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). We purposely used a chow diet in the current study to establish that increased atherosclerosis in the offspring was due to in utero programming. The effect of programming on offspring may extend into the second generation: A recent high-fat diet programming study using mice showed that a high-fat diet leading to obesity during gestation produced glucose intolerance in both the first and second generations of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>).</p><p>Hypoaminoacidemia in our hypercholesterolemic model could possibly have resulted from reduced protein absorption, reduced amino acid availability via altered metabolism in the dams, or reduced protein consumption due to the high caloric content of the Western diet. The Western and control diets used in our study were 17.3 and 18.6&#x00025; by weight protein, a difference that would be unlikely to produce the significant reduction of certain amino acids in the LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Western-diet dams. Reduced food intake because of the higher percentage of calories supplied by fat in the Western (42&#x00025;) versus chow (18&#x00025;) diets could have led to an overall reduction of protein intake. However, if that were the case, all essential amino acids would probably have been reduced on the Western diet, which they were not. Furthermore, the essential amino acid lysine was lower in LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> dams on the Western diet than controls but was higher in the protein-restricted dams compared with controls. Thus, the Western and low-protein diets do not necessarily lead to a reduction of all essential amino acids, indicating other factors besides dietary intake of protein as causative for the hypoaminoacidemia in the dams. The lower urea content in the plasma of low-protein dams was expected because less protein consumption would result in less urea generated as a byproduct of protein catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). The lower urea content in the plasma of hypercholesterolemic dams was another indication of less protein accretion in these animals.</p><p>Previous studies have observed a correlation between high maternal cholesterol concentrations and enhanced lesions of atherosclerosis in the offspring in rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>) and in LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Maternal oxidative stress in a high cholesterol environment may adversely affect the placenta and may directly or indirectly enhance atherosclerotic lesions in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>). Experiments in hypercholesterolemic rabbits have shown that administration of the antioxidant vitamin E during pregnancy resulted in reduced atherosclerotic lesions in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>), indicating that maternal oxidative stress likely plays a role in maternal programming for atherosclerosis. However, given the complexity of metabolic syndrome traits, it is also likely that more than one physiological pathway is involved. The placentas of women who gave birth to IUGR babies were found to have decreased placental leucine transport and decreased placental mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). Similarly, the IUGR litters in our study were associated with reductions in essential maternal amino acids, including leucine; therefore, hypoaminoacidemia in the dams may have resulted in reduced levels of fetal amino acids, resulting in metabolic malprogramming of the fetal hypothalamus. mTOR, a kinase that is upregulated by leucine, regulates cell-cycle progression and growth throughout the body by sensing changes in energy status. Downstream from the leptin receptor, mTOR is also involved in energy homeostasis and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>). Because leucine via mTOR regulation has been shown to participate in muscle formation in fetal sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>) and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function in a cell culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>), downregulation of mTOR by a decrease in leucine, both in hypercholesterolemic and protein-restricted in utero environments, could play a role in IUGR and in malprogramming of the fetal hypothalamus, leading to the previously described &#x0201c;thrifty phenotype.&#x0201d;</p><p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that embryonic and fetal cells have a complex system integrating nutritional signals from their environment to maximize the potential for survival. The association of maternal malnutrition and IUGR leading to adult-onset metabolic disorders, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis, has been demonstrated in several epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>). Our results mimicked population studies in humans where maternal malnutrition and the resultant low birth weight were identified as the common risk factors for adult-onset diseases. In addition, our studies demonstrated that maternal protein restriction and hypercholesterolemia were both associated with maternal hypoaminoacidemia. Therefore, maternal hypoaminoacidemia may be an important antecedent in both models of IUGR and may be an important link in the mechanisms that contribute to adult-onset glucose intolerance, obesity, and atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db07-1530_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="db07-1530_db07-1530[1].suppl.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>K.K.S.B. was supported by the UCLA Intercampus Medical Genetics Training Program (grant T32 GM04083).
