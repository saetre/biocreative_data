The toxin acts by first docking onto specific proteins, called receptors, located on the host cell surface, and it is then taken up into cells where it can act on its cellular substrates. There are two known receptors for the toxin, anthrax toxin receptors 1 and 2 (ANTXR1 and ANTXR2). However, the physiological importance of each receptor in host organisms is not yet understood. To address this issue directly, the authors designed a form of the toxin which binds specifically to ANTXR2 but not to ANTXR1. They show that this ANTXR2-specific form of the toxin is capable of killing rats following intravenous injection. These studies provide direct evidence for the physiological importance of ANTXR2 in anthrax toxin action in a model host organism.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Scobie HM, Wigelsworth DJ, Marlett JM, Thomas D, Rainey GJA, et al.

To test the dependence of ANTXR2-PA binding on PA D683, this residue was replaced with either an asparagine or a lysine. The resultant PA<sup>D683N</sup> and PA<sup>D683K</sup> proteins were tested for their abilities to bind to a soluble human ANTXR2 protein (sANTXR2) and a full-length human ANTXR2&#x02013;enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion protein expressed on PA receptor-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-R1.1 cells. Additionally, cells expressing ANTXR2-EGFP were tested for their ability to be intoxicated with PA<sup>D683N</sup> or PA<sup>D683K</sup> and LF<sub>N</sub>-DTA, a recombinant protein composed of the N-terminal PA-binding portion of LF fused to the catalytic A chain of diphtheria toxin, which kills CHO cells. For control purposes, these experiments were also performed with CHO-R1.1 cells engineered to express a human ANTXR1-EGFP fusion protein.</p><p>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, performed as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, revealed that PA<sup>D683N</sup> binds tightly to the sANTXR2 I domain, <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> &#x0003d; 28 (&#x000b1;1.7) and 17 (&#x000b1;0.68) nM in the presence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, respectively.

We reasoned that the differential abilities of the receptors to bind mutant PA proteins would be due to one or more of these variable amino acids. To test this idea, each of these amino acid substitutions was introduced independently into ANTXR2-EGFP and the altered receptors were expressed in transiently transfected CHO-R1.1 cells. Cell surface expression of the mutant receptors was confirmed by flow cytometry with a polyclonal chicken anti-ANTXR2 serum and AlexaFluor-633&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

Residues G153 and L154 are located in a surface region of ANTXR2 that contacts PA domain 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To further investigate the role of this region in the D683 mutant PA interaction, we made reciprocal exchanges of the residues located between positions 152 and 157 (DGLVPS) in the &#x003b2;4-&#x003b1;4 loop region of the ANTXR2 I domain and the corresponding residues of ANTXR1 (154 to 159; HEDLFF) in the context of ANTXR1-EGFP and ANTXR2-EGFP proteins, respectively. These studies revealed that replacement of both G153 and L154 residues in ANTXR2 with the residues from ANTXR1 was sufficient to make cells completely resistant to PA<sup>D683N</sup> intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Additionally, replacement of ANTXR1 residues 154 to 159 with the corresponding ANTXR2 residues gave rise to a recombinant receptor that could support PA<sup>D683N</sup>-mediated intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>PA<sup>D683K</sup> Supports LF-Mediated Intoxication in Rats</title><p>To address the possible role of ANTXR2 in lethal toxin killing of Fischer 344 rats, we first confirmed that D683 mutant forms of PA can interact with rat ANTXR2 (rANTXR2) but not rat ANTXR1. To this end, we attempted to isolate a full-length rat ANTXR1 cDNA clone but were not successful. However, the rat ANTXR1 I domain differs from that of its human counterpart by only two amino acids (residues K72 and R136 of the human protein are, in the rat protein, arginine and serine, respectively). Therefore, we constructed a rat version of the ANTXR1-EGFP protein (designated as ANTXR1<sup>R72,S136</sup>-EGFP by replacing these two human-specific residues with those of rat ANTXR1. Also, cDNAs encoding the rANTXR2 open reading frame were isolated from rat liver and brain tissue RNAs; both cDNAs had an identical DNA sequence. Comparison with the human ANTXR2 (hANTXR2) revealed that the I domains of these proteins differ by ten amino acid acids, two of which are PA-contact residues: Arg111 and Ser113 in hANTXR2 are alanine and glutamine in rANTXR2, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020111-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

The difference in TTD between the rats treated with 100 &#x003bc;g of PA<sup>D683K</sup> was statistically significant when compared with those injected with 10 &#x003bc;g of PA (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0001) but not from those treated with 20 &#x003bc;g of PA (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.104) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Based on these dosage effects, we conclude that PA<sup>D683K</sup> can mediate anthrax lethal toxin killing of rats, albeit with an approximately 5-fold reduced efficiency compared with wild-type PA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This report demonstrates that D683 mutant forms of PA bind selectively to ANTXR2 and that this selectivity is dependent on amino acid residues of ANTXR2 that contact domain 2 of PA. Moreover, we have shown that a D683K mutant form of PA is capable of mediating lethal toxin killing of rats, implicating an important physiological role for ANTXR2 in this process.</p><p>We have demonstrated that the ability of ANTXR2 to bind PA proteins with mutations at the D683 site maps to the receptor surface region containing residues G153 and L154 that engage PA domain 2. Replacing the ANTXR2 G153, which allows a polypeptide backbone turn, and L154, which participates in hydrophobic interactions with PA, with the negatively charged Glu and Asp residues from ANTXR1 resulted in resistance to cellular intoxication with PA<sup>D683N</sup>. By contrast, exchange of the HEDLFF<sup>154&#x02013;159</sup> sequence from ANTXR1 for the corresponding DGLVPS<sup>152&#x02013;157</sup> sequence from ANTXR2 conferred upon ANTXR1 the ability to support PA<sup>D683N</sup>-mediated intoxication.</p><p>Prior to this report it was unclear if ANTXR2 was important for lethal toxin killing in vivo<italic>.</italic> Our results showing that PA<sup>D683K</sup> supports lethal toxin-mediated killing of rats provides direct evidence for the physiological importance of this receptor in this rodent model system. There are several potential explanations for the reduced efficacy of PA<sup>D683K</sup> in vivo, compared to wild-type PA. First, this result could reflect the slightly reduced levels of PA<sup>D683K</sup> intoxication observed in cultured cells expressing rANTXR2 relative to those expressing hANTXR2. This difference may be due to the combined effects of residue differences at positions 111 and 113 of these proteins. The hANTXR2 R111 residue interacts with a negatively charged environment in PA domain 4, and the S113 residue makes H-bond contacts with PA domain 4 in the crystal structure (unpublished data) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. The rANTXR2 Ala and Gln residues at these respective locations may not be able to participate in these interactions. A second possibility is that cell type&#x02013;specific differences downstream of initial PA binding might dictate different activities of PA proteins with altered residues at the D683 site. Indeed, we observed a 10-fold difference in intoxication activities of the PA<sup>D683N</sup> and PA<sup>D683K</sup> proteins despite similar ANTXR2 binding affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g002">2</xref>E). Third, the reduced activity of the PA<sup>D683K</sup> protein in vivo might be indicative of a role for ANTXR1 in intoxication of rats by wild-type lethal toxin.</p><p>The PA<sup>D683K</sup> protein is the first engineered toxin that can discriminate between the two anthrax toxin receptors, binding specifically to ANTXR2. This ANTXR2-specific form of PA can now be used to study the role of ANTXR2 in mediating the effects of lethal toxin in other cell types, and it can also be engineered into the bacterium to probe the importance of this receptor for various aspects of anthrax disease pathogenesis following infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. anthracis</named-content> spores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>DNA constructs and cell lines.</title><p>The ANTXR2-EGFP, ANTXR1-EGFP, and sANTXR2-mycHis fusion constructs have already been described (CMG2<sup>489</sup>-EGFP, ATR/TEM8 sv2-EGFP, and sCMG2-mycHis, respectively) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

The geometric mean of AlexaFluor-633 fluorescence after staining cells with antibodies (gray bars) is depicted next to the cell viability data for comparison purposes.</p><p>(B) Receptor sequences responsible for contacting PA domain 2 were exchanged between ANTXR1 and ANTXR2 proteins in an analysis similar to (A). Cells expressing ANTXR1<sup>154&#x02013;159</sup> bound anti-ANTXR2 antibodies, suggesting that an epitope for the polyclonal antibody mapped to this site. Saturable binding studies performed with transfected cells and with increasing amounts of an AlexaFluor-633&#x02013;labeled monomeric PA protein confirmed that the mutant 154&#x02013;159 ANTXR1 protein is expressed on the cell surface at levels similar to wild-type ANTXR1 and ANTXR2 (unpublished data).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.0020111.g003"/></fig><fig id="ppat-0020111-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>PA<sup>D683K</sup> Supports Lethal Toxin-Mediated Killing of Rats via rANTXR2</title><p>(A) Triplicate samples of CHO-R1.1 cells transiently expressing the different receptor-EGFP proteins were incubated with 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> M LF<sub>N</sub>-DTA and with either 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M wild-type PA or 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M PA<sup>D683K</sup> or without PA. These amounts of wild-type and mutant PA proteins were used because they gave rise to maximal levels of killing when incubated with cells expressing human ANTXR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).
