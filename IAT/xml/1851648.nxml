This superfamily plays important roles in plant disease resistance, abiotic stress, senescence as well as in some developmental processes. In this study, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> WRKY1 was shown to be involved in the salicylic acid signaling pathway and partially dependent on NPR1; a C-terminal domain of WRKY1, <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C, was constructed for structural studies. Previous investigations showed that DNA binding of the WRKY proteins was localized at the WRKY domains and these domains may define novel zinc-binding motifs. The crystal structure of the <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C determined at 1.6&#x02009;&#x000c5; resolution has revealed that this domain is composed of a globular structure with five <bold>&#x003b2;</bold> strands, forming an antiparallel <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>-sheet. A novel zinc-binding site is situated at one end of the <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>-sheet, between strands <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>4 and <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>5. Based on this high-resolution crystal structure and site-directed mutagenesis, we have defined and confirmed that the DNA-binding residues of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C are located at <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>2 and <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>3 strands. These results provided us with structural information to understand the mechanism of transcriptional control and signal transduction events of the WRKY proteins.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>WRKY proteins comprise a large group of transcription factors identified specifically from the plant kingdom, ranging from lower plants such as mosses to higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Members of the WRKY superfamily play important roles in a variety of developmental and physiological processes in plants. The most documented function for this superfamily of genes is their involvement in salicylic acid (SA) signaling and disease responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">3&#x02013;8</xref>). SA is an important signal molecule in both local defenses and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Endogenous accumulation or exogenous application of SA activates SAR and pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression. In Arabidopsis, 49 out of 72 tested WRKY genes can be induced by pathogen infection or SA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), suggesting that a broad range of WRKY members could be involved in playing regulatory roles in disease resistance. This role of disease resistance was further confirmed by the finding of an over-presentation of the <italic>cis</italic>-element activated by the WRKY proteins, the W-box, within the promoters of a number of genes that are co-expressed in SAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NON-EXPRESSOR OF <italic>PR1</italic> (NPR1) has been demonstrated as a key protein in SAR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). SAR and expression of <italic>PR1</italic> are prevented in <italic>Arabidopsis npr1</italic> mutants even after SA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Previous reports also showed that over-expression of WRKY18 and WRKY70 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resulted in increased resistance to pathogens and enhanced expression of <italic>PR</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>In addition, WRKY genes are involved in abiotic stress, such as drought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>), cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), salinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>); and in biosynthesis of anthocyanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Some WRKY genes can also regulate developmental process such as embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), tricome development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) as well as seed size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>There are more than 70 WRKY family members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and more than 100 in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The name of WRKY is derived from the conserved WRKY sequence motif which is present in all WRKY members. The WRKY domain is a stretch of about 60 amino acids with strictly conserved WRKYGQK sequence at its N-terminal followed by a putative novel zinc-binding motif with features of C&#x02013;C&#x02013;H&#x02013;H or C&#x02013;C&#x02013;H&#x02013;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28">26&#x02013;28</xref>). The existence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> is crucial for the DNA-binding activity, which implies the importance of the putative zinc-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). WRKY proteins can be classified into three groups according to the number of WRKY domains and zinc-binding pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Group I WRKY proteins are distinct from groups II and III by containing two WRKY domains. The zinc-binding motif of group III proteins is C&#x02013;X<sub>7</sub>&#x02013;C&#x02013;X<sub>23</sub>&#x02013;H&#x02013;X&#x02013;C, different from the common pattern of C-X<sub>4&#x02013;5</sub>-C-X<sub>22&#x02013;23</sub>-H-X-C of group I and II proteins. It has been reported that substitutions of the invariable WRKYGQK residues in the WRKY domain decreased the DNA-binding affinity, and any mutations of the conserved cysteine and histidine of the zinc-binding motif abolished the protein&#x02013;DNA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>The two WRKY domains in group I proteins play different roles in DNA-binding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). It has been shown that the specific binding to W-box is mediated mainly by the C-terminal WRKY domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), whereas the function of N-terminal WRKY domain remains unclear. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> WRKY1 protein (also known as ZAP1), the first identified WRKY transcription factor from Arabidopsis, is localized in Chromosome 2 as a single copy and belongs to group I WRKY family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The recognition of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1 with W-box mainly depends on the C-terminal WRKY domain while the N-terminal WRKY domain just slightly affect the protein&#x02013;DNA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The structural information of WRKY proteins and how they interact with W-box were lacking until recently when an NMR structure of C-terminal WRKY domain of <italic>At</italic>WRKY4, <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C was determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). However, the domain division of the NMR sample seemed to be short and may not represent the structure of the whole domain. After the whole genome cloning of the transcription factors of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), we have carried out functional and structural studies on <italic>At</italic>WRKY1.</p><p>In this report, we have showed that <italic>At</italic>WRKY1 can be induced by SA treatment and the induction was partially dependent on NPR1, suggesting that this protein may be involved in the defense response. Most importantly, we present the crystal structure of the <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C at 1.6&#x02009;&#x000c5; and a model of protein&#x02013;DNA complex from site-directed mutagenesis studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (ecotype Col-0) were grown in the soil at a growth room (23/20&#x000b0;C, 12-h-light/12-h-dark cycle).

Leaves from different 4-week-old plants were harvested at indicated time points for total RNA preparation with RNAzol (Vigrous, Beijing) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Ten micrograms of total RNA was separated on 1.5% agrose&#x02013;formaldehyde gels and transferred to a nylon membrane to hybridize with digoxigenin (DIG) labeled DNA probes. DIG DNA probes labeling, hybridization and detection were performed according to DIG Application Manual for Filter Hybridization (Roche, Penzberg, Germany).

To study the potential involvement of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1 in SA signaling pathway and its possible relation to NPR1, a key protein in SAR, we characterized the expression profile of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1 by RNA gel blot in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, <italic>npr1-3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and NPR1-H line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) in response to exogenous SA treatment. As an important marker of SAR, <italic>PR1</italic> was also examined to monitor the SA treatment procedure. In consistence with previous reports, <italic>PR1</italic> began to accumulate at 4&#x02009;h post-treatment and the induction of <italic>PR1</italic> was abolished in <italic>npr1-3</italic> while increased in NPR1-H than that in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The induced expression of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1 was observed after 8&#x02009;h post-treatment and became obvious later than that of <italic>PR1</italic>. In <italic>npr1-3, At</italic>WRKY1 can still be expressed but at a lower level than that in wild-type plants. The opposite trend appeared in NPR1-H with higher expression level of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1 than in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

However, the NLS sequences of WRKY proteins are not well conserved, and may be distributed at different locations. The analysis of protein sequences of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1 revealed a potential NLS motif KRRKK between residues 273 and 277 near the C-terminal WRKY domain, which is a conserved feature for at least nine members of the group I WRKY proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D).

WRKY protein's defining sequence, &#x02018;WRKYGQK&#x02019;, spans the entire &#x003b2;2 strand. Due to the long bridging loop (Thr301&#x02013;Arg311) between &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 which covers one side of the &#x003b2;-sheet, the structure of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C looks rather globular and stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A).</p><p>The crystal structure of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C differs from the NMR structure of a similar protein <italic>At</italic>WRKY4&#x02009;C-terminal domain (<italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C, which shares about 53% sequence identity with <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C) determined recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and D, the &#x003b2;1 strand of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C was missing in the NMR <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C model, thus the strands &#x003b2;2 to &#x003b2;5 in the crystal structure of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C corresponding to the strands &#x003b2;1&#x02013;&#x003b2;4 of the NMR structure, and the RMSD corresponding to the similar regions of the two structures (<italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C residues 309&#x02013;367, <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C residues 411&#x02013;469) is 1.5&#x02009;&#x000c5;, indicating a very similar structure for a common DNA-binding mechanism. Since the <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C domain was constructed to start from VQTTS which is located in the middle of the &#x003b2;1 strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and D with the alignment), the discrepancy in the organization of the &#x003b2;-sheet is most likely caused by the different ways of preparing the NMR and crystallization samples. In order to have a fair comparison, we have repeated and constructed the NMR samples in this work and compared the CD spectra for the two proteins, <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C (Asp365&#x02013;Ala469) similarly constructed as <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C, and <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C&#x00394;1b (Val399&#x02013;Ala469) similar to the NMR sample without the N-terminal &#x003b2;1 strand. The CD spectra showed similar pattern for zinc binding for both <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C and <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C&#x00394;1b, and characteristics in both cases of a folded &#x003b2;-sheet structure. However, there was a reduction in the CD signal of <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C&#x00394;1b near the negative peak at 210&#x02013;220&#x02009;nm, indicating a reduction of &#x003b2;-sheet signal of the truncated protein (data not shown). We thus predict that the <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C would have a similar globular structure like <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C, had the <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C sample prepared several residues longer at the N-terminus.</p></sec><sec><title>The conserved &#x003b2;1 and <italic>B</italic>-factor distribution of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, in addition to the conserved WRKY defining residues (in red, yellow and blue), the sequences in the &#x003b2;1 region (colored green) are well conserved in the C-terminal domains of the group I WRKY family members. We can thus conclude that all the C-terminal domains of the group I WRKY protein possess a very similar five-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet architecture as in <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> describes the <italic>B</italic>-factor distribution over the <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C structure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A shows the <italic>B</italic>-factor plot against the residue numbers, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B is the overall structure overlaid with the <italic>B</italic>-factors color coded as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A.

The middle part of the long loop connecting &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2, and a few residues after &#x003b2;5 also showed slightly high <italic>B</italic>-factor between 20 and 25, whereas most of the structure are quite stable and ordered with an average <italic>B</italic>-factor of 21, particularly the zinc-binding site and the central &#x003b2; sheet are all with <italic>B</italic>-factors below 20.</p></sec><sec><title>The conserved salt-bridges and the D308-W312-K341 triad</title><p>Interestingly, both ends of the connecting loop between &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 show conserved pattern with ordered salt-bridge interactions and extensive hydrogen-bonding networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and D). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C shows that in the C-terminal end of the loop, Asp308 forms a well-defined salt-bridge with Lys341, and Asp308 also forms extensive H-bonds with Tyr310, Trp312, Tyr357. All these residues are very well conserved among the WRKY family proteins, indicating a common function of stabilizing the domain structure. The pivotal residue at this constellation of residues is Asp308. The distance between Asp308 OD1 and Trp312 NE1 is 2.94&#x02009;&#x000c5;, and between Asp308 OD2 and Lys341 NZ is 2.85&#x02009;&#x000c5;. These three residues are with the lowest <italic>B</italic>-factors, we thus name this constellation as D308-W312-K341 triad. In the NMR studies, the interactions around D308 could not be seen due to the undefined N-terminal of that structure, only the hydrophobic interaction of AtWRKY4-C W414-K443 (AtWRKY1-C residues W312-K341), which is part of the features of the previously defined triad constellation, has been mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D depicts another well conserved salt-bridge between Asp304 and Arg345 in the N-terminal end of the loop, and Arg345 is hydrogen bonded with the main chain of Thr301, Phe303 and Thr350.</p></sec><sec><title>The zinc-binding site in <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C</title><p>One of the important features resolved by the high-resolution crystal structure of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C is the well-ordered zinc-binding site. As shown in the electron density map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, the high-resolution data of 1.6&#x02009;&#x000c5; made it possible to distinguish the zinc coordination with all the ligand atoms, and it was clearly shown that the N&#x003b4; of His361 and the N&#x003b5; of His363, coordinate to the zinc ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B). The distances between the ligand atoms and the zinc ion are 2.06&#x02009;&#x000c5; (Zn&#x02013;N&#x003b4; of His361), 2.07&#x02009;&#x000c5; (Zn&#x02013;N&#x003b5; of His363), 2.28&#x02009;&#x000c5; (Zn&#x02013;S&#x003b3; of Cys332), 2.27&#x02009;&#x000c5; (Zn&#x02013;S&#x003b3; of Cys337), all the distances are well within the ideal distances of a zinc-binding site in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). </p><p>The whole zinc-binding site is situated in the low <italic>B</italic>-factor regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), and the zinc ligand residues have almost the lowest <italic>B</italic>-factors in the structure, the zinc-binding site is right next to the low <italic>B</italic>-factor D308-W312-K341 triad described in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C. Together with the D308-W312-K341 triad, the zinc-binding site is shaping up and stabilizing the <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C structure, since the zinc binding has been shown to be crucial for the stability of WRKY proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>The sequence signature of this zinc-binding site, C&#x02013;X<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;C&#x02013;X<sub>23</sub>&#x02013;H&#x02013;X&#x02013;H, somewhat resembles a classic C2H2 profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), the feature of a zinc-finger. In the crystal structure, it has been clearly shown that the zinc ion is coordinated by two cysteines (Cys332, Cys337) and two histidines (His361, His363) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), but structurally dissimilar to classic zinc fingers, instead the structure is similar to a sequence unrelated DNA-binding protein Drosophila GCM (glia cell missing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) (PDB ID 1ODH). In contrast with the classic C2H2 zinc finger, <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C does not contain any helix, so it cannot bind DNA through the helix as most zinc-finger proteins do. The DNA-binding ability of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C is mediated through the beta-hairpin regions between &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3, and this mode of DNA&#x02013;protein interaction is similar to the insightful prediction by Church, Sussman and Kim long time ago for non-helical DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Previous work on DNA binding of WRKY family has also pointed out that the conserved WRKYGQK region located on &#x003b2;2 strand is important for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conserved residues responsible for DNA binding</title><p>There are more than 70 members in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> WRKY family grouped into three major groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), nine members from the group I with two WRKY domains are selected for multiple sequence alignment based on secondary structure information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D) (sequence data were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rarge.gsc.riken.go.jp/rartf/tf_info/fasta_p1/TF_9_P1.fasta">http://rarge.gsc.riken.go.jp/rartf/tf_info/fasta_p1/TF_9_P1.fasta</ext-link>). It was shown from the alignment that at least 18 residues are strictly conserved, including the four residues coordinating with the zinc ion, and three residues in the conserved D308-W312-K341 triad.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, more than 10 well-conserved residues are positioned in the region between &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 including the WRKYGQK motif. Particularly, the five consecutive residues RKYGQ, distinct components of the WRKY family scaffold, belong to the &#x003b2;2 strand; while the other five conserved residues located on &#x003b2;3 strand, in the pattern of PRSYYR/K. Considering the specific DNA sequence that all WRKY members could recognize, these conserved residues are good candidates for the specific DNA-binding process.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, the surface charge distribution of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C was uneven, with a calculated PI (point of iso-electricity) of 9.5. On one side, there were consecutive regions of positively charged residues, including Arg313, Lys314, Lys318, Lys321, Arg327 and Arg331, all belonging to the strictly conserved residues and located on &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 strands. Well-conserved Lys340 located at the beginning of strand &#x003b2;4 also belongs to this positively charged region. Since the WRKYGQK sequence falls nicely into this positively charged region and it has been shown that the WRKY motif is responsible to bind to the W-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), it can thus be deduced that the &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 strands are most likely to be involved in the process of DNA binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification and confirmation of the DNA-binding residues</title><p>After searching for similar structures of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C using the DALI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), a DNA&#x02013;protein complex structure, the Drosophila GCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) (PDB ID 1ODH, Z-score &#x0003e; 6.2) was returned. When the GCM protein was used to perform a least-square fitting with <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C, the resulting RMSD between the aligned parts (68 residues) was 2.3&#x02009;&#x000c5;, a DNA complex model of W-box DNA and <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C was thus constructed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A. By comparison of the potential DNA-binding residues (which are close to the DNA major groove as shown in the complex model), and previous work on the DNA-binding related residues on the WRKYGQK motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), the following mutants with a single residue change were constructed: R313E, K314A, K314R, Y315F, Y315R, G316F, Q317A, Q317K, R327A, R327E, Y330F, R331K, R331A and K340A. In Maeo <italic>et al</italic>.'s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), it has been shown that all residues in the WRKYGQK (corresponding to residues 312&#x02013;318 in <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C) motif are important for the DNA binding. Particularly for W312, K314, Y315, K318, a change to Ala for any of those residues would completely abolish the DNA binding. On the other hand, the R313, G316 and Q317 would only reduce the amount of DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). We have thus constructed multiple mutants for R313, K314, Y315, G316 and Q317. Furthermore, the well-conserved residues R327, Y330, R331 and K340 are quite close to the DNA-binding sites, these residues were also selected for mutagenesis studies. Thirteen out of the fourteen mutants are located on strands &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3. This region, particularly the connecting loop, showed flexible feature (high <italic>B</italic>-factor) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B, indicating conformational changes might occur upon DNA binding. EMSA were used to test the DNA-binding abilities of these mutants with a fragment of 17-bp duplex DNA containing the W-box of TGAC as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. The EMSA assay using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probe according to standard protocol was also performed with similar results (not shown). To examine the specificity of the binding, a competition experiment was performed by using an excess amount of unlabeled probe of the same sequence. When a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides were included in the reaction, binding of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C to the labeled probe was abolished completely (data not shown). All the mutants could be readily expressed and purified as the wild-type <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C, the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of these mutant proteins were used to monitor the correct folding of these proteins, thus the DNA-binding ability changes are not due to the structural change caused by the mutations, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. </p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, K314A, Y315R, G316F, R331A, R327A and R327E have completely abolished the DNA-binding abilities of those mutants, and the CD spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> have shown those mutants were well-structured proteins. Thus the inabilities of DNA binding must be caused by the point mutations on the correct structural scaffold. The DNA-binding activity of the mutations R313E, K314R, Y315F and Q317K were reduced, whereas the mutations of Q317A, R331K, K340A and Y330F did not show any decrease of the DNA-binding ability, indicating that these mutations did not affect the DNA binding of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C. These results are in good agreement with the previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), and conclusions from the NMR structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>In the crystal structure as well as in the NMR structure, a kink was formed in the middle of &#x003b2;2 around Gly316. The formation of this kink was considered helpful for the protruding of Gly316 into DNA major groove deeply and attending specific binding. The assumption was confirmed by the mutation G316F, which has lost almost all the DNA-binding ability. The complete loss of DNA binding of the mutants R327E, R327A and R331A are of great interests, since these two positively charged residues localized on the &#x003b2;3 strand that has been shown to be crucial for the DNA binding for the first time by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, these two arginine residues, which are separated by four residues, is consistent with Tateno's model of DNA binding at the major groove with a pair of &#x003b2; strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).</p><p>As a summary, all the mutation results further confirmed that strands &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 participate in DNA binding. It also suggested that residues Lys314, Gly316, Lys318 on &#x003b2;2, and Arg327, Arg331 on &#x003b2;3 are the key residues for DNA-specific recognition and substitution any one of them resulted in no specific binding. In addition, the distribution of these residues is <italic>i, i</italic> + 2, <italic>i</italic> + 4 on one strand and <italic>j, j</italic> + 4 on the other strand. This distribution is in agreement with Tateno's model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>), which proposed that the binding of DNA to proteins with two &#x003b2; strands should happen on the DNA major groove in a convex manner. Based on such a model, it has been found that normally six consecutive base pairs are involved in specific recognition, and the large-sized residues (not only charged), such as lysines at <italic>i</italic> and <italic>i</italic> + 4, as well as arginines at <italic>j</italic> and <italic>j</italic> + 4, could bridge the large gap separating the DNA.</p><p>The structure model of DNA&#x02013;<italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C complex we made in this study has been based on the GCM&#x02013;DNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), which is different from the Tateno's DNA-binding model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) in details. The &#x003b2;-strands of the GCM protein adapted a previously undescribed binding mode to interact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Despite of the absence of sequence and topology similarity, <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C's five-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet overlaps with the corresponding strands of GCM with unexpected high accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), except for the &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 region including the flexible loop, which will be subjected to conformational changes upon DNA binding. We thus refined our DNA&#x02013;AtWRKY1-C complex according to the mutagenesis results, and the resulting model is quite similar to the GCM&#x02013;DNA complex in topology. A schematic description of this refined model for AtWRKY1-C and DNA interactions is described as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B. This figure summarizes all the residues that might interact with the W-box DNA, providing structural explanations for the function of the WRKY superfamily of transcription factors.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBER</title><p>The Protein Data Bank accession number for the <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C crystal structure discussed in this paper is PDB ID 2AYD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr Xinnian Dong for providing NPR1-H seeds, Dr Frederick M.Ausubel for npr1-3 seeds, Dr Biao Ding for pRTL2:dGFP (dimeric GFP); Ms Huanhuan Liang is acknowledged for her help with CD spectrum measurement.
