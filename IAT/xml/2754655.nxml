Although hormone therapy benefits about 80&#x00025; of patients by retarding the progression of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-OH1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, almost all prostate cancers eventually develop into an aggressive, hormone-independent form, with little hope for further intervention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Denis1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the best approach for combating prostate cancer is preventing its occurrence in the first place. This makes chemoprevention an attractive approach. In addition, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia develops over a period of around twenty years, and the progression to clinically significant carcinoma may take another thirteen to fifteen years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Bostwick1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Since it usually takes some time for the chemopreventive effects to be observable, the long latency periods make prostate cancer one of the best model systems in chemoprevention studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Ratan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Androgen is an important regulator of prostate gland development and function, including proliferation, differentiation, maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Chang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is also essential in the process of prostatic carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Miyamoto1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The androgen receptor (AR) is a crucial mediator of androgen action and a ligand-dependent transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear steroid hormone receptor super-family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Agoulnik1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Agoulnik2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to other steroid receptors, AR contains an amino-terminal activation functional domain (AF1) that affects transcription efficiency; a central DNA-binding domain (DBD), which mediates receptor binding to specific DNA sequences in the promoter/enhancer regions of the target genes; and C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) which also contains another activation functional domain (AF2). Without ligand binding, the AR mainly resides in the cytoplasm and complexes with heat-shock proteins. When bound to hormones, the receptor undergoes conformational changes, dissociates from heat shock proteins and translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the AR binds to a specific DNA sequence known as an androgen responsive element (ARE), where it initiates the recruitment of specific co-regulators and mediators to form transcription complexes and regulate the transcription of AR target genes. Combinations of AR target gene expressions determine the fate of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Miyamoto1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. AR plays pivotal roles not only in prostate cancer initiation, but also in its progression and even in the hormone-independent stages. AR and prostate specific antigen (PSA), the utmost useful biological maker of prostate cancer, express continuously in hormone-independent prostate cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Fletterick1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, multiple line of evidence shown that the AR signaling system remains functional in the hormone-independent stages with different mechanisms such as AR mutation, amplification and modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Kageyama1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, changes in AR coactivator and co-repressor ratios are implicated in these stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Yoon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the development of novel and more effective treatments targeting AR and AR-related molecules will be a plausible strategy in combating both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Kageyama1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Environmental factors, including nutritional and dietary factors, play fundamental roles in the development of prostatic cancer as well as other cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Ratan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Whittemore1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

For this purpose, AR cDNA was integrated into the genome of the AR-negative HeLa cell line to make an AR-positive cell line, AR(&#x0002b;), in which the expression of AR is not affected by RSV. Since AR is constitutively expressed in AR(&#x0002b;) cells, this enables us to specifically analyze the repressive effects of RSV on AR transcriptional activity. The AR-negative cell line, AR(-), was established by infecting the same parental HeLa cells with empty vector DNA and serves as a control. With this system, we demonstrated that RSV regulates AR target gene expression, at least in part, by repressing AR transcriptional activity.

Therefore, the molecular mechanisms about effects of RSV on AR and prostate cancer are confusing.</p><p>In order to distinguish the effects of RSV on AR regulated gene expression, we established an AR positive cell line, AR(&#x0002b;), from the AR-negative HeLa cell line. The FLAG-tagged AR is recognized by both AR and FLAG antibodies, and more importantly, the overexpressed AR behaves in a manner similar to the AR expressed endogenously (see below). However, since it is driven by the strong cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Beck1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, the expression of AR in these cells is not affected by RSV treatment.

Using this unique cellular model system, we demonstrated that RSV modulates AR functions by affecting AR transcriptional activity. However, this does not exclude the other effects of RSV on AR and prostate cancer development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Agoulnik2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Aziz1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since the parental cells used for the establishment of the AR(&#x0002b;) cell line are not of prostate origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Scherer1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, it is essential to demonstrate that the overexpressed AR functions in a manner similar to the AR in its intact cellular environment. First, we monitored the AR nuclear translocation by immunostaining. Similar to the AR in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, and as expected, the overexpressed AR in AR(&#x0002b;) cells treated with the synthetic androgen R1881 translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007398-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Second, by using both PSA-enhancer-Luc reporter assay and RT-PCR to measure the endogenous PSA mRNA levels we clearly demonstrated that the overexpressed AR has hormone-dependent transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007398-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, all the representative AR target genes in the AR(&#x0002b;) cells have responded to hormone treatment in a similar manner as that in the LNCaP cells. More importantly, the hormone-dependent effects were specifically observed in the AR(&#x0002b;) not the AR(&#x02212;) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007398-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, we were able to show that the overexpressed AR binds DNA specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007398-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) and regulates the expression of a target gene, presumably through the recruitment of specific co-regulators such as SRC-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Agoulnik3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we conclude that the overexpressed AR functions in a manner similar to the endogenously expressed AR and that the established AR(&#x0002b;) cell line can be used in studying AR functions without the interference of variations in AR protein levels. More importantly, AR(-) cells were established by transfecting the same parental cells with the empty vector DNA. Theoretically, the only difference between the AR(&#x0002b;) and AR(&#x02212;) cells is that AR is expressed in the AR(&#x0002b;) cells. Therefore, experiments with AR(&#x02212;) cells as a negative control will specifically elucidate the AR's effects.</p><p>The AR(&#x0002b;) cells were made by transfecting the retroviral pOZ vector containing the human AR open reading frame which is integrated into the genome randomly. Insertion-induced interruptions of certain endogenous genes are therefore unavoidable. However, when a population of cells is used, the effects from the insertion-induced interruption are minimal. Thus, results from such experiments, especially when the AR(&#x02212;) cells are used as a negative control, should represent AR-mediated effects specifically. For the same reason, individual AR(&#x0002b;) cells or colonies derived from individual AR(&#x0002b;) cells would not be recommended in studying AR functions even if AR(&#x02212;) cells are used as controls.</p><p>It is important to note that because the parental AR-negative HeLa cells are not of prostate origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Scherer1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The cellular and subcellular environment in the AR(&#x0002b;) cells would not be identical to that in cells expressing endogenous AR. Although this new model system will be useful in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of AR function, careful diligence is needed in interpreting data obtained from using these cells alone. Alternatively, it is practical to conduct experiments with both AR(&#x0002b;) cells as well as cells expressing AR endogenously such as the LNCaP call line. In our research, we simultaneously treated both the AR(&#x0002b;) and LNCaP cells with the same concentrations of RSV. The levels of AR protein and mRNA were repressed by RSV in LNCaP but not in AR(&#x0002b;) cells. However, RSV represses PSA expression in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007398-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Given the effects of AR on its target gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007398-g004">Figure 4</xref>), we conclude that RSV represses AR function, at least in part, by repressing AR transcriptional activity.</p><p>We want to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemopreventive effects of RSV on prostate cancers, and to apply this knowledge to further development of more potent chemopreventive reagents. By using the unique AR(&#x0002b;) cell line, we demonstrated that RSV amended the expression of AR target genes by affecting AR transcriptional activity. This is consistent with experiments using LNCaP cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Wang2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Jones1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Since RSV treatment of the AR(&#x0002b;) cells affected neither AR nuclear translocation nor the AR DNA binding, we proposed that RSV affects AR transcriptional activity by either affecting AR modification directly or altering the recruitment of AR cofactors indirectly. It has been well established that AR transcriptional activity is fine-tuned by different modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation and SUMOylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Shih1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Faus1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Fu et al reported that SIRT1 plays essential roles in AR acetylation status and inhibits AR transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Fu1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it has been demonstrated that RSV up-regulates SIRT1 expression as well as its enzymatic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-You1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Ajmo1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. It will be intriguing to explore the possibility that RSV affects AR transcriptional activity by up-regulating SIRT2. Since AR recruits both co-activators and co-repressors, Yoon and Wong proposed that the co-activator and co-repressor ratio plays a rather important role in determining AR transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007398-Yoon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that RSV tempers AR transcriptional activity, as well as AR target gene expression, by altering the co-activator and co-repressor ratios on AR target gene promoter/enhancer regions. Ultimately, modifications of histone tails on the target promoter/enhancer regions are inevitable. Thus, results from this research warrant further exploration of the molecular mechanisms in RSV-mediated alterations of the histone code and how they are involved in AR transcriptional regulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors want to than Dr. Jiemin Wong (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) for his kindness of offering the PSA-enhance-Luc reporter and the pOZ-N vector.
