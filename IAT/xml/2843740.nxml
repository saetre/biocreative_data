Thus, our study was designed to evaluate whether nSMase2 plays a role in apoptosis induced by TNF&#x003b1; and by oxLDLs.</p><p>For this study, we chose TNF&#x003b1; and oxLDLs, two agents known to activate nSMase, via different signaling mechanisms. TNF&#x003b1; is a prototypical trigger of cellular nSMase activation (and ceramide generation) associated with pleiotropic responses, including apoptosis, cell proliferation and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Clarke1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. As indicated above, TNF&#x003b1; was used without any protein synthesis inhibitor, in order to exclude interference due to the cytotoxicity of cycloheximide (or other protein inhibitor). The apoptotic effect of TNF&#x003b1; was apparently independent of nSMase2 and SM hydrolysis in murine fibroblasts, since similar apoptosis was observed in nSMase2-deficient cells, and since rescuing the activity of the nSMase2 did not alter the apoptosis induced by TNF&#x003b1; and oxLDLs. Apoptosis by TNF&#x003b1; is mediated by FADD and caspase 8 which in turn activates caspase-3 and/or Bid and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Wilson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative signaling pathway involving the generation of ceramide, either through the <italic>de novo</italic> synthetic pathway, or by sphingomyelin hydrolysis by SMases, has been hotly debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Kolesnick2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Hofmann2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our data allow to conclude that nSMase2 is not required for TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis and that its activation by TNF&#x003b1; is not necessary for triggering apoptosis in fibroblasts. However, it cannot be excluded that nSMase2 may play a pro-apoptotic role in other cell types, as suggested by its mutation in a murine osteosarcoma cell line and in human leukemias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Kim1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. This discrepancy may result from factors regulating the level of ceramide, for instance, subcellular location, transport and metabolic conversion, from the balance of ceramide/sphingosine-1-phosphate, and from cell type-dependent expression of pro-/anti-apoptotic effectors (e.g. Bcl2 family members) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Hannun2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Spiegel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Apoptosis triggered by oxLDLs was also found to be independent of nSMase2 in <italic>fro/fro</italic> fibroblasts.

Previous reports had shown that the mitogenic response mediated by both stress-inducing agents, depends on furin and metalloproteinases MT1-MMP and MMP-2 which activate nSMase2, sphingomyelin hydrolysis, as well as the generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate by sphingosine kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Tellier1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Auge3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The lack of TNF&#x003b1;- or oxLDLs-induced mitogenic effect in <italic>fro/fro</italic> fibroblasts strongly suggests that nSMase2 activation and ceramide production are crucial for this stress-induced response. Note that the acid SMase, which is not deficient in <italic>fro/fro</italic> fibroblasts (data not shown), is unable to compensate for the defect in nSMase2-deficient cells. This is in agreement with the idea that the topology of ceramide generated by sphingomyelinases may play a crucial functional role. Ceramide generated by the acid SMase in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane forms ceramide-enriched membrane platforms that promote death-domain receptor clustering, thereby amplifying apoptotic signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Grassme1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, nSMase2 is located on the inner leaflet, where it generates ceramide, hydrolyzed by ceramidases into sphingosine, which may be phosphorylated in turn by sphingosine kinase-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Hannun2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009826-Spiegel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.
