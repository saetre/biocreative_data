DUSP6/MKP-3 is inducible by FGF (fibroblast growth factor) signalling and acts as a negative regulator of ERK activity in key and discrete signalling centres that direct outgrowth and patterning in early vertebrate embryos. However, the molecular mechanism by which FGFs induce <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> expression and hence help to set ERK1/2 signalling levels is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate, using pharmacological inhibitors and analysis of the murine <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> gene promoter, that the ERK pathway is critical for FGF-induced <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> transcription. Furthermore, we show that this response is mediated by a conserved binding site for the Ets (E twenty-six) family of transcriptional regulators and that the Ets2 protein, a known target of ERK signalling, binds to the endogenous <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> promoter. Finally, the murine <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> promoter coupled to EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) recapitulates the specific pattern of endogenous <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> mRNA expression in the chicken neural plate, where its activity depends on FGFR (FGF receptor) and MAPK signalling and an intact Ets-binding site. These findings identify a conserved Ets-factor-dependent mechanism by which ERK signalling activates <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> transcription to deliver ERK1/2-specific negative-feedback control of FGF signalling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6)</kwd><kwd>fibroblast growth factor (FGF)</kwd><kwd>mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)</kwd><kwd>mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-3 (MKP-3)</kwd><kwd>phosphatase</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>AER, apical ectodermal ridge</kwd><kwd>ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation</kwd><kwd>ConA, concanavalin A</kwd><kwd>DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium</kwd><kwd>DUSP, dual-specificity phosphatase</kwd><kwd>EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>Elk1, Ets-like kinase 1</kwd><kwd>EMSA, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay</kwd><kwd>ER, oestrogen receptor</kwd><kwd>ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase</kwd><kwd>Ets, E twenty-six</kwd><kwd>FBS, fetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>FGF, fibroblast growth factor</kwd><kwd>FGFR, FGF receptor</kwd><kwd>FKHD, Forkhead mutant</kwd><kwd>&#x003b2;Gal, &#x003b2;-galactosidase</kwd><kwd>HA, haemagglutinin</kwd><kwd>HH10, Hamburger and Hamilton stage 10</kwd><kwd>4-HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen</kwd><kwd>I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, inhibitor of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B &#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase</kwd><kwd>MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase</kwd><kwd>MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase</kwd><kwd>MKK, MAPK kinase</kwd><kwd>MKKK, MAPK kinase kinase</kwd><kwd>MKP, MAPK phosphatase</kwd><kwd>mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>NF-&#x003ba;B, nuclear factor &#x003ba;B</kwd><kwd>PBX1, pre-B-cell leukaemia transcription factor 1</kwd><kwd>PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase</kwd><kwd>RSV, rous sarcoma virus</kwd><kwd>SRF, serum-response factor</kwd><kwd>SRY, sex-determining region Y</kwd><kwd>TNF&#x003b1;, tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1;</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><ref-count count="53"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DUSP (dual-specificity phosphatase) 6 or MKP [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) phosphatase]-3 is the prototypical member of a subfamily of three cytoplasmic MKPs, which also includes <italic>DUSP7</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>X</italic> and <italic>DUSP9</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These enzymes all display a high degree of substrate selectivity for the ERKs (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases) 1 and 2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Specific recognition and binding to ERK2 is mediated by a conserved KIM (kinase interaction motif) within the N-terminal non-catalytic domain of DUSP6/MKP-3 and this region of the protein also contains a conserved NES (nuclear export signal), which is responsible for the cytoplasmic localization of this phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The specificity of DUSP6/MKP-3 for dephosphorylation and inactivation of the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs is enhanced further by ERK-induced conformational change within the catalytic domain of MKP-3, which leads to greatly enhanced phosphatase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The first clues as to the physiological role of MKP-3 came from the observation that <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> mRNA is expressed at many sites of FGF (fibroblast growth factor) signalling in developing mouse and chicken embryos. These include the limb bud and branchial arch mesenchyme, midbrain/hindbrain isthmus, hair and mammary placodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and early neural plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Further experiments involving tissue ablation and transplantation in chicken embryos identified the AER (apical ectodermal ridge) and Hensen's node as tissue sources of FGF which are essential for the expression of <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> in the developing limb bud and neural plate respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, FGF signalling is also responsible for the expression of <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> in the murine isthmic organizer during neural tube development and in developing chick somites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These studies suggest that DUSP6/MKP-3 is a negative regulator of FGF signalling during vertebrate development, which may work to set the levels of ERK signalling downstream of this signalling pathway. This conclusion is supported by the results of a recent mouse knockout experiment. <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic>-null embryos display elevated ERK phosphorylation in limb bud mesenchyme and present with variably penetrant skeletal dwarfism, premature fusion of cranial sutures (craniosynostoses) and deafness, all of which are consistent with increased levels of FGF signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Although the link between FGF signalling and <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> expression is now well established, the precise molecular mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. In particular, it is unclear which of the intracellular signalling pathways that lie downstream of the FGFR (FGF receptor) is responsible for mediating <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> transcription, with essential roles proposed for both the ERK and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The majority of these data were obtained in a variety of embryonic tissues often using different pharmacological inhibitors of these pathways and this may account for some of the contradictory data obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we have used a cell culture model to overcome the limitations of drug delivery using bead implantation in chicken embryos to address the nature of the intracellular signalling pathways involved in FGF-mediated <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> expression. This has been combined with a bioinformatic and functional dissection of the <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> gene promoter and has enabled us to define a mechanism by which signalling though the ERK MAPK pathway interacts with a conserved regulatory region within the proximal promoter of the gene to effect negative-feedback control of FGF signalling <italic>in vitro</italic> and in the developing chick embryo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Recombinant human FGF2 (basic FGF), human FGF4 and mouse FGF8b were purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems.

In contrast, DUSP6/MKP-3 was absent in Cos-1, HeLa and HEK-293T (human embryonic kidney) cells (results not shown). Because NIH 3T3 cells have been widely used in studies of inducible gene expression, we determined whether levels of DUSP6/MKP-3 are increased following FGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Elevated levels of DUSP6/MKP-3 protein were detected following exposure to FGF2, FGF4 and FGF8, and this correlated with increased phosphorylation of ERK2. In contrast, none of the FGF treatments led to phosphorylation of either p38 or JNK. We note that DUSP6/MKP-3 is resolved as a doublet in these immunoblots.

We first determined whether expression of a dominant-negative mutant of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (Mad3 super-repressor) affected the FGF-mediated activation of the <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> promoter.

This complex is also effectively competed by a wild-type (E) but not a mutant (e) oligonucleotide containing a canonical Ets-binding site.

We could detect significant association of both Ets1 and Ets2 with the Ets-binding site, whereas no detectable signal was seen using either the control antibody or an antibody against ERM81, a member of the closely related Pea3 subfamily of Ets factors.

However, whether <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> induction represents a negative-feedback control or an example of regulated cross-talk between two intracellular signalling pathways is controversial, as essential roles have been proposed for both ERK MAPK and PI3K signalling in regulating <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

This makes the effective concentrations of inhibitor delivered to tissues difficult to assess and raises questions about both the potency and specificity of pathway inhibition in these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the present study, we have utilized cultured NIH 3T3 cells to study FGF-inducible expression of <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic>, allowing a more precise delivery of drug and direct biochemical readout of its effects.</p><p>Our results clearly show that FGF treatment of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts induces <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> expression at the level of both mRNA and protein. Furthermore, although inhibition of ERK1/2 activity blocks this expression completely, we can find no evidence for the involvement of PI3K in this process. These results are reinforced by the observation that conditional activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in &#x00394;-Raf-1:ER* NIH 3T3 cells also increases levels of DUSP6/MKP-3 protein, indicating that ERK activation is both necessary and sufficient to trigger expression of this phosphatase. To probe the molecular mechanism by which ERK activation might influence <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> expression levels, we performed both a bioinformatic and a functional analysis of the murine <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> gene promoter.</p><p>Comparative genome analysis revealed a conserved region within the proximal promoter of <italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic>/<italic>DUSP6</italic> containing a number of transcription factor-binding sites. This analysis included sequences from mammal, amphibian and fish genomes. Most of the work performed previously to analyse the signalling pathways involved in the regulation of <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> by FGF has been performed in chicken embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, we were unable to include the chicken <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> homologue in our analysis, as the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the gene is lacking from the current genome sequence release (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Gallus_gallus/index.html">http://www.ensembl.org/Gallus_gallus/index.html</ext-link>).</p><p>Of the putative regulatory elements within this conserved region, the most obvious candidate with respect to an interface with the ERK MAPK pathway is a conserved Ets-binding site. Many growth factor-activated genes such as c-Fos are regulated by SRF (serum-response factor), a MADS-box transcription factor. SRF forms a ternary complex with Ets family members such as Elk1, also known as TCFs (ternary complex factors), whose activity is controlled by MAPK signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, close examination of the <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> promoter reveals no cognate binding sites for SRF, indicating that the Ets site is functioning autonomously.</p><p>We can detect the constitutive binding of protein(s) to this Ets consensus sequence in EMSAs and, by using ChIP analysis, the Ets family proteins Ets1 and Ets2 were found to be associated with this binding site <italic>in vivo</italic>. The latter observation provides a mechanistic link between <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> transcription and ERK1/2 activity. The observation that two distinct Ets family members can associate with the <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> promoter in NIH 3T3 cells also raises questions of binding specificity. A recent genomewide analysis of Ets protein binding revealed unexpected levels of redundant occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, this degree of redundancy was increased if the Ets-binding site was proximal to the transcriptional start site, as is the case in <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic>. The Ets site within <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> is also palindromic, and core bases within both half-sites are required for FGF-responsive <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> transcription. Interestingly, the stromelysin-1 gene promoter also contains a head-to-head Ets-binding site palindrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This site has recently been demonstrated to mediate stromelysin-1 expression in response to the tumour promoter PMA, and the Ets1 transcription factor is found to be constitutively associated with this site <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. It will be interesting to explore further mechanistic similarities in the regulation of these two growth factor-regulated genes, both of which involve the Ets family of transcription factors acting independently of SRF as a conduit for ERK1/2 signalling.</p><p>The expression of the <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> gene in response to tissue sources of FGF is observed in mouse, chicken and zebrafish embryos, and this is probably a reflection of the conservation of the regulatory sequences revealed by our promoter analysis. Scanning genomic fragments for enhancer activity utilizing embryo electroporation in the chicken can identify such regions. This method makes use of reporter constructs in which expression of <italic>EGFP</italic> is driven by DNA sequences from the locus of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Using this approach, we have clearly shown that the region of the murine <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> promoter encompassing the conserved Ets-binding site recapitulates the endogenous domain of <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> expression in chicken embryo caudal neural tissue. Furthermore, this expression is dependent on the integrity of the Ets-binding site and is sensitive to inhibition of the ERK MAPK pathway. We have identified Ets1 and Ets2 as binding to the <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> promoter in NIH 3T3 cells, and the question arises as to their expression in the tissues we have analysed in the present study. We have not determined the pattern of <italic>Ets1</italic> and <italic>Ets2</italic> mRNA expression in the chicken embryo. However, between day 8.5 and day 10.5 of mouse embryonic development, <italic>Ets2</italic> mRNA is expressed in tail bud, pre-somitic mesenchyme and limb bud mesenchyme in a pattern which is almost indistinguishable from that which we observe for <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> mRNA, which in turn correlates with sites of active FGF signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we have provided compelling evidence that activation of the ERK MAPK pathway and not the PI3K pathway drives expression of <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> mRNA and protein in response to FGFs in mammalian cells. This, together with our previous studies in developing mouse and chicken embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], strongly supports the idea that DUSP6/MKP-3 performs a key role as a negative-feedback regulator of FGF-activated ERK1/2 signalling. In addition, our functional studies of the mouse gene promoter provide the first evidence of a molecular mechanism by which ERK1/2 signalling impinges on transcription factors that are responsible for mediating <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> expression. <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic>, along with genes such as <italic>Sprouty</italic> and <italic>Sef</italic>, belong to the FGF synexpression group of FGF antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Although the FGF-inducible expression of <italic>Sprouty</italic> and <italic>Sef</italic> has also been linked with activation of ERK1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], both the mechanism by which this occurs and their mode of action as inhibitors of FGF signalling remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Our present results thus make <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> the best understood of the FGF synexpression group in terms of a molecular mechanism for negative-feedback control of FGF signalling. Finally, <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> gene expression is also reported to be responsive to other agonists during early development, including maternal &#x003b2;-catenin signalling and retinoic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The tools we have developed in the present study should facilitate a more extensive analysis of the signalling pathways that interact with the transcription machinery to regulate <italic>DUSP6</italic>/<italic>MKP</italic>-<italic>3</italic> expression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Professor Andy Sharrocks (School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K.) for reagents and advice on performing ChIP analysis, Dr Neil Perkins (School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee) for reagents and advice on the NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathway, Dr Simon J.
