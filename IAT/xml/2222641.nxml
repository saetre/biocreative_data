Joints link the malleus to the incus and the incus to the stapes. In the mouse the first arch derived malleus and incus are formed from a single <italic>Sox9 </italic>and <italic>Type II collagen </italic>expressing condensation that later subdivides to give rise to two separate ossicles. In contrast the stapes forms from a separate condensation derived from the second branchial arch. Fusion of the malleus and incus is observed in a number of human syndromes and results in conductive hearing loss. Understanding how this joint forms during normal development is thus an important step in furthering our understanding of such defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that the developing incudomalleal joint is characterised by a lack of proliferation and discrete areas of apoptosis. Apoptosis has been suggested to aid in the removal of pre-cartilaginous cells from the joint region, allowing for the physical separation of the cartilaginous elements, however, we show that joint initiation is unaffected by blocking apoptosis. There is also no evidence of cell migration out of the presumptive joint region, as observed by labelling of joint and ossicle cells in culture. Using <italic>Type II collagen </italic>lacZ reporter mice, however, it is evident that cells in the presumptive joint region remain in place and downregulate cartilage markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The malleus and incus first appear as a single united condensation expressing early cartilage markers. The incudomalleal joint region forms by cells in the presumptive joint region switching off cartilage markers and turning on joint markers. Failure in this process may result in fusion of this joint, as observed in human syndromes such as Branchio-Oto-Renal Syndrome or Treacher Collins Syndrome.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In the mouse the malleus and incus of the middle ear initially develop as a single element that expresses cartilage markers such as <italic>Type II collagen </italic>and <italic>Sox9</italic>. This united structure then subdivides to form the two ossicles divided by the incudomalleal joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This early joint region is free of <italic>Type II collagen </italic>or <italic>Sox9 </italic>expressing cells and expresses joint markers such as <italic>Gdf5 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>Sox9 </italic>has been shown to upregulate <italic>Type II collagen </italic>expression, and overexpression of <italic>Sox9 </italic>leads to ectopic cartilage formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Loss of <italic>Sox9 </italic>and <italic>Type II collagen</italic>, therefore, is thought to play an important role in formation of the joint.</p><p>The formation of three ossicles in the middle ear (malleus, incus and stapes) is a characteristic of mammals. During the course of evolution the primary jaw articulation of non-mammalian vertebrates was replaced by a second articulation between two membranous bones, the squamosal and dentary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Studies involving comparative anatomy, embryology and paleontology have suggested that the primary jaw articulation, along with the hyomandibular (columella in chick and reptiles) were incorporated into the middle ear to form a three ossicle chain. Using this criteria, the malleus is homologous to the articular part of Meckel's cartilage, the incus is homologous to the quadrate/palatoquadrate, and the stapes is homologous to the hypomandibular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The incudomalleal joint is therefore homologous to the primary jaw joint. Homology has been confirmed by investigating expression of genes such as <italic>Bapx1 (Nkx3.2)</italic>, which is specifically expressed in the primary jaw joint of <italic>Xenopus</italic>, zebrafish and chick and in the incudomalleal joint in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Like the incudomalleal joint, the primary jaw joint divides two initially continuous elements expressing Type II collagen, the quadrate and articular part of Meckel's cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These two cartilages then separate to form the articulation point for the upper and lower jaws.</p><p>In a variety of human syndromes, such as Treacher Collins and Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) syndrome, the malleus and incus are often fused resulting in conductive hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The development of this joint is therefore essential to ensure correct hearing. It is thus of interest to examine what happens to these presumptive joint cells that are initially fated to become cartilage.</p><p>In a variety of limb joints, apoptosis has been observed within the interzone at the centre of the developing joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Such programmed cell death was postulated to account for the loss of the cartilage lineage cells within the forming joint, leading to the separation of skeletal elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Given this data from the limb, we wished to investigate the role of apoptosis in early joint formation in the middle ear.</p><p>Apoptosis can be mediated by distinct pathways initiating from within (intrinsic) or outside (extrinsic) the cell. Both pathways involve signalling via a family of cysteine proteases named caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Caspase machinery becomes activated in a cascade manner starting with apical caspases, such as Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, leading to cleavage of effector caspases, such as Caspase 3. <italic>Caspase 8 </italic>mutants die at E11.5 due to cardiovascular abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but <italic>Caspase 9 </italic>and <italic>Caspase 3 </italic>mutant mice survive up to and past birth depending on the strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These mutants display a strikingly similar phenotype, characterised by a prominent brain malformation caused by defective apoptosis in the proliferative neuroepithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Caspase 9 is activated within a complex known as the apoptosome, where the pro-caspase 9 interacts with Cytochrome c and Apaf-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>Cytochrome c </italic>deficient mice die at E8.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], however the majority of <italic>Apaf-1 </italic>mutant mice survive up to E18.5. These mice exhibit defects in the brain, inner ear and digits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The middle ear can therefore be analysed in <italic>Apaf-1</italic>, <italic>Caspase 3</italic>, and <italic>Caspase 9 </italic>mutant mice.</p><p>To knock down activation of all caspases, an <italic>in vitro </italic>approach must be applied and pharmacological inhibitors binding to the active site of activated caspases are generally used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We have therefore devised a method for culturing the middle ear in the presence or absence of caspase activity. By these two methods the role of apoptosis in formation of the incudomalleal joint can be analysed.</p><p>In the digits, developing cartilage recruits neighbouring cells into the cartilage creating high cell density in these regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It was therefore possible that the <italic>Sox9</italic>/<italic>Type II collagen </italic>expressing cells in the presumptive joint might migrate out of the forming joint into the body of the malleus or incus. To test this we labelled cells in the forming incudomalleal joint region and developing malleus with the lipophilic dyes DiO and DiI, and observed the movements of labelled cells as the joint formed in culture.</p><p>Alternatively, the <italic>Sox9</italic>/<italic>Type II collagen </italic>positive cells might remain in position and downregulate expression of these genes. To investigate this possibility we have utilised <italic>Type II collagen </italic>lacZ reporter mice, where the stable lacZ protein marks cells that express <italic>Type II collagen </italic>and also those that have recently switched off <italic>Type II collagen</italic>.</p><p>By these methods we hope to determine what processes are involved in early joint development in the middle ear.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Wild type and <italic>Type II collagen </italic>LacZ reporter mouse embryos were dissected out at embryonic day (E) 13.5 to 18.5.</p><p><italic>Caspase 3</italic>/C57BI/6J mutant mice were provided by Dr. S.

The joint region is thus thought of as a region of low proliferation. To see whether this situation is mimicked in the middle ear we looked at the distribution of proliferating cells during early formation of the incudomalleal joint. At E14.5 and E15.5 the malleus and incus are seen as separate structures with a clear joint in between. Using PCNA, the level of proliferation was high in the head of the malleus and incus but the joint region was negative (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,B,D,E</xref>). PCNA has a long half-life leading to its continuous expression in cells that are not actively dividing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. We, therefore, supplemented our results by using anti-phosphohistone H3 immunohistochemistry. The H3 antibody detects phosphorylation of histone H3, which is high during chromosome condensation as the cell enters the M-phase and has a short half-life. As expected, only a few cells were observed as positive in the middle ear using this method compared to using PCNA. The positive cells were concentrated in and around the ossicles but again excluded from the developing joint (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,F</xref>). Labelled cells were also located around the circumference of the eye as previously published using this method, indicating that the assay was working [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Proliferating cells are not observed in the developing joint region</bold>.

Using the H3 antibody at this stage, the incus showed positive proliferating cells but the presumptive joint region appeared negative (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>). The malleus also appeared negative, using the antibody to H3, perhaps indicating a time delay between proliferation of the two ossicles.</p></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis in the incudomalleal joint</title><p>A TUNEL assay was performed to detect nuclear DNA fragmentation in the developing joint from E13.5 to E15.5. Additionally, morphological criteria of apoptotic cells (nuclear condensation, apoptotic bodies) were evaluated. At E13.75, as the malleus and incus are starting to separate, a clear region of apoptotic cells was visible in a whirl underneath the head of the malleus (N = 4) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). At E14.5 and E15.5, when the joint is clear histologically, a few positive cells were located in this same region under the head of the developing malleus, with a line of positive cells running between the malleus and the incus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,D</xref> and data not shown) (N = 6). TUNEL positive cells were also observed in the external auditory meatus and in the inner ear, where apoptosis has been previously described, confirming that the method was successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Apoptotic cells are located between the malleus and incus</bold>.

These embryos displayed a variety of craniofacial defects, with a number showing obvious overgrowth of the brain, as would be expected from previously published observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. By E15.5 the joint region between the malleus and incus is clearly visible in section in wildtype mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The malleus and incus were found completely separated, and no cartilage-like cells were evident in the joint in either the wildtype or mutant embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;C</xref> and data not shown) (<italic>Caspase 3 </italic>and <italic>9 </italic>mutants N = 3; <italic>Apaf-1 </italic>mutants N = 4). In order to confirm the absence of apoptosis in these mutants a TUNEL stain was carried out in the <italic>Apaf-1 </italic>mutants. No TUNEL positive cells were observed in the middle ear region, compared to a heterozygous littermate or wildtype, thus confirming that apoptosis has been inhibited in these mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;F</xref>). To confirm the lack of phenotype in the mutants, sections were carried out on <italic>Apaf-1 </italic>mutants at E17.5 and E18.5, once the shape of the articulation is well formed (N = 6). In section the incudomalleal joint appeared normal, but the shape of the articulation showed subtle variations in some specimens while in others it appeared identical to that of a wildtype littermate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,B</xref>). This difference might relate to slight variations in the angle of section, rather than indicate a true defect, and so to confirm the result skeletal preparations of mutant heads were examined.

In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of apoptosis inhibition using the general caspase inhibitor, developing front limbs at E12.5 and E13.5 were cultured <italic>ex vivo </italic>for 24 hours.

Cultures were set up at E13.5, before joint initiation. The ossicles and associated middle ear structures developed well in culture along with neighbouring structures such as the inner ear (data not shown). Double labelling was used to identify any movement between cells in the presumptive joint region and the neighbouring malleus. A single spot of DiO was mouth pipetted in the region of the presumptive joint and a second spot of DiI was placed alongside in the developing malleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A-A"</xref>) (N = 10). The movement of these two groups of labelled cells was followed for 48 hours. Over this time period no movement of the DiO labelled cells towards the DiI labelled cells was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B-B"</xref>). As the presumptive joint region is not clearly defined morphologically, in some cases, a few cells in the presumptive incus were also labelled at the same time as the joint. In these cases labelled cells could be seen incorporated into the developing incus (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B"</xref>). Although cells did not appear to migrate from the presumptive joint into the malleus, the joint region itself did change shape and elongated caudally as the ossicles developed. This does not necessarily represent active migration but a re-shaping of the joint region as it is squeezed by the proliferating ossicles on either side.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Cells do not migrate into the malleus from the developing incudomalleal joint</bold>.

To test this we used <italic>Type II collagen </italic>reporter mice (where LacZ is inserted into one copy of the <italic>Type II collagen </italic>gene) to take advantage of the fact that the LacZ protein is very stable. At E14.5 <italic>Type II collagen </italic>expression, as assessed by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridisation or immunohistochemistry, is not observed in the joint region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Instead joint markers, such as <italic>Gdf5</italic>, are expressed at high levels throughout the joint (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast, blue cells are still found at high levels in between the two ossicles when the <italic>Type II collagen </italic>lacZ reporter mouse is stained for LacZ at this stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). By combining a LacZ stain (blue) and Type II collagen immunohistochemistry (brown), cells that still express Type II collagen will be visualised as both brown and blue, while those cells that have recently turned off Type II collagen will be blue only. We can thus view the expression history of cells in the joint region.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Downregulation of cartilage fate in the incudomalleal region</bold>.

Thus the Type II collagen expressing cells have remained in the same position and downregulated expression of chondrogenic genes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Apoptosis has been described as a sculptor of development in many mammalian structures and is observed in developing limb joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus it seems a good candidate process for removal of <italic>Sox9/Type II collagen </italic>expressing cells to create a joint, and thereby separate the malleus and incus. Apoptotic cells were observed early on between the malleus and incus, however, <italic>Apaf-1</italic>, <italic>Caspase 3 </italic>and <italic>Caspase 9 </italic>mutant mice exhibited normal division of the malleus and incus at E15.5. No middle ear defect was also observed in <italic>Apaf-1 </italic>mutants at E17.5. This is despite the loss of TUNEL positive cells in the mutant. This result was confirmed in explant culture by using caspase inhibitors. Thus formation of the middle ear joint appears independent of apoptosis. It may be, however, that loss of apoptosis is compensated for by cell death through other processes, such as necrosis or caspase independent programmed cell death, such as paraptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Paraptosis, like apoptosis, is programmed cell death but is independent of the normal apoptotic machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In the limbs of <italic>Apaf-1 </italic>mutants interdigital cell death is initially inhibited but after a delay of a few days, cell death in these regions is observed, resulting in separation of the digits. This interdigital cell death occurs despite no evidence of TUNEL positive cells or overall cell condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Thus in the absence of apoptosis, as indicated by TUNEL staining, cells may still be able to die.</p><p>Migration is another candidate process that could explain the disappearance of cartilaginous presumptive joint cells. DiI and DiO double labelling was used to trace the movement of cells in the presumptive joint region over 2 days. Results show that although the joint region changes shape, the labelled cells in the joint region did not move towards the DiI labelled cells and were not incorporated into the malleus. This is perhaps unsurprising as chondrogenic precursors have been shown to have a low migration capacity when compared to many other cells types, such as myogenic precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>By comparing the expression of Type II collagen protein and a LacZ reporter driven by the same promoter, we have shown that the initially chondrogenic cells remain in the incudomalleal joint region and downregulate expression of chondrogenic markers. In this way Type II collagen is turned off and joint markers, such as <italic>Gdf5</italic>, are turned on in the same cells. The signal to trigger this event is as yet unknown. It is thus unclear how cells only in the presumptive joint region turn off <italic>Type II collagen</italic>, while those on either side carry on with a cartilage differentiation pathway. The homeobox gene <italic>Emx2 </italic>may play a role in demarcating the future joint as it is expressed in the incus and presumptive joint but excluded from the malleus, prior to the separation of these two ossicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In keeping with this role, mutations in <italic>Emx2 </italic>lead to loss of both the incus and joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Joint markers, such as <italic>Bapx1 </italic>and <italic>Gdf5</italic>, have been shown to turn on before loss of <italic>Sox9 </italic>and <italic>Type II collagen </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is possible, therefore, that these joint markers act by directly repressing cartilage development. Overexpression of <italic>Gdf5</italic>, however, is unable to induce formation of an ectopic joint, thus although this gene has an important role in joint formation it is not sufficient to repress cartilage development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In contrast, overexpression of Wnt signalling is sufficient to induce an ectopic joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The role of Wnt signalling in formation of the incudomalleal joint and its relationship to the loss of cartilage markers is thus an interesting avenue to pursue. What leads to the induction of joint markers at the future incudo-malleal joint is also unclear. In the chick and zebrafish, <italic>Bapx1 </italic>acts upstream of <italic>Gdf5 </italic>in development of the primary jaw joint, with the expression of <italic>Bapx1 </italic>being controlled by a combination of inhibitory and inducing signals from Fgfs, Bmps and Endothelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Whether a similar combination of signals leads to the restriction of joint markers in the mammalian middle ear is therefore another important area for future study. Such comparative work will allow for further understanding of how cranial joints are initiated and positioned and will focus in on the genetic pathways that may have played a role in changing the pattern of joints during evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The incudomalleal joint in the mammalian middle ear separates the initially united incus and malleus. The forming joint is characterised by a lack of proliferation, compared to the ossicles on either side, and contains a number of cells undergoing cell death (apoptosis). In the absence of apoptosis, however, no defect in joint formation is observed. Cells in the joint region do not move away from this position but instead downregulate cartilage markers and take on a joint fate, expressing genes such as <italic>Gdf5</italic>. Fusions of the middle ear, as seen in patients with BOR Syndrome or Treacher Collins Syndrome, may therefore occur if presumptive joint cells fail to downregulate expression of chondrogenic genes. Many of the genes underlying such syndromes have been discovered, and so the next challenge is to investigate such possibilities using mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SA and AST wrote the manuscript.
