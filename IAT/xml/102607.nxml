This study characterizes the mechanisms of transactivation by GKLF. Using a GAL4 fusion assay, the activating domain of murine GKLF was localized to the 109 amino acid residues in the N-terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that two adjacent clusters of acidic residues within this region are responsible for the activating effect. Transactivation by GKLF involves intermolecular interactions as demonstrated by the ability of wild-type, but not mutated, GKLF to compete with the N-terminal activation domain. In addition, wild-type adenovirus E1A, but not a mutated E1A that failed to bind p300&#x0002f;CBP, inhibited transactivation by the N-terminal 109 amino acids of GKLF, suggesting that p300&#x0002f;CBP are GKLF&#x02019;s interacting partners. A physical interaction between GKLF and CBP was demonstrated by glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase pull-down and by <italic>in vivo</italic> co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We also showed that the two acidic amino acid clusters are essential for this interaction, since GKLF with mutations in these residues failed to co-immunoprecipitate with CBP. Importantly, the same mutations abrogated the ability of GKLF to suppress cell growth as determined by a colony suppression assay. These studies therefore provide plausible evidence for a structural and functional correlation between the transactivating and growth-suppressing effects of GKLF.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic transcription factors are modular proteins that depend on distinct domains for their functions such as DNA binding and modulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c1">1</xref>). Various structural motifs have been described that are involved in DNA binding and&#x0002f;or protein dimerization. Examples include the zinc finger, basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix and leucine zipper motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c6">6</xref>). Many transcription factors also contain distinct domains for the transcriptional activation or repression of target genes. Activation domains, for example, can be rich in glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c8">8</xref>), proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c10">10</xref>) or acidic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c13">13</xref>). Adding to the complexity of transcriptional regulation is the recent identification of a group of co-activator proteins, such as p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c15">15</xref>), CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c18">18</xref>) and P&#x0002f;CAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c19">19</xref>). Collectively, these proteins exhibit a broad spectrum of activities including interaction with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins and the basal transcriptional machinery, as well as chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c21">21</xref>).</p><p>The gut-enriched Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor (GKLF; also called Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor 4 or KLF4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c22">22</xref>) is a recently identified Kr&#x000fc;ppel-type transcription factor with 3 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers. Expression of <italic>GKLF</italic> is enriched in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c25">25</xref>) and the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c26">26</xref>), and in vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c27">27</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> expression of <italic>GKLF</italic> is temporally associated with a growth-arrested state, such as that induced by contact inhibition or serum deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>). In addition, constitutive GKLF production in transfected cells resulted in the inhibition of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>). These results suggest that GKLF is a negative regulator of cell growth. The significance of the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of GKLF is heightened by the fact that expression of its gene is developmentally regulated and is down-regulated in a rodent model of intestinal tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c28">28</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that GKLF may have a potentially important function in regulating proliferation and differentiation of specific epithelial and endothelial tissues.</p><p>The amino acid sequences of the zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>) and the nuclear localization signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c29">29</xref>) of GKLF are closely related to two other Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like transcription factors, LKLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c30">30</xref>) and EKLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c31">31</xref>). Among the three, EKLF is the most extensively characterized. EKLF is essential for expression of the &#x003b2;-globin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c33">33</xref>) and for erythropoeisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c35">35</xref>). It activates the &#x003b2;-globin gene by binding to a CACCC element in the &#x003b2;-globin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c33">33</xref>). Because of the high degree of homology between the zinc finger regions of GKLF and EKLF, GKLF has been shown to bind to the same or similar elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c36">36</xref>). However, GKLF also binds DNA sequences other than the CACCC element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c36">36</xref>). The basic transcription element (BTE), found in the promoter of a highly conserved family of genes encoding the cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes including <italic>CYP1A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c38">38</xref>), for example, is a high-affinity binding site for GKLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c39">39</xref>).</p><p>A recent examination of the relationship between GKLF and the promoter activity of the <italic>CYP1A1</italic> gene indicates that GKLF is a suppressor of the <italic>CYP1A1</italic> promoter in a BTE-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c39">39</xref>). It does so by competing with the binding of Sp1 to BTE and by physically interacting with Sp1, which is a potent activator of <italic>CYP1A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c39">39</xref>). Both effects seem to be mediated by the zinc fingers of GKLF. Another study showed that GKLF possesses an intrinsic repression domain in a region of protein preceding the zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c27">27</xref>). In different situations, however, GKLF can be a potent activator of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c36">36</xref>). Moreover, the N-terminal region of GKLF was shown to confer the activating function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c27">27</xref>). These observations indicate that GKLF is a pleiotropic protein with a dual activity in modulating transcription. The present study examines in detail the mechanisms by which GKLF activates transcription and shows that such mechanisms are complex, requiring two clusters of acidic amino acid residues within GKLF for full activity. The same amino acid residues proved to be indispensable for the interaction of GKLF with the co-activator CBP and for the ability of GKLF to suppress cell growth. Our study therefore demonstrates an important association between two primary biological activities of GKLF, that of transcription activation and that of growth suppression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid DNA constructs</title><p>The expression construct encoding full-length murine GKLF cloned in the mammalian expression vector PMT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c40">40</xref>), PMT3-GKLF(1&#x02013;483), was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c39">39</xref>).

We generated eight effector constructs by fusing various regions of the GKLF reading frame outside its zinc fingers to the N-terminal 147&#x000a0;amino acid DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f1">1</xref>B). A luciferase reporter driven by the herpes virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter linked to five tandem copies of the GAL4 binding site &#x0005b;pG<sub>5</sub>TKLUC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c44">44</xref>); Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f1">1</xref>A&#x0005d; was used to read out the activating potential of the various regions of GKLF upon co-transfection. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f1">1</xref>A show that the N-terminal 329 amino acids of GKLF (<italic>effector 1</italic>) harbors an activation domain, as evidenced by the significant induction in the luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with this effector when compared to those with the vector (<italic>effector V</italic>) alone. A deletion in the N-terminal 156 amino acids of GKLF (<italic>effector 2</italic>) resulted in a complete loss of activating potentials. In contrast, the N-terminal 157 amino acids of GKLF maintained its inducing effect when present in the sense (<italic>effector 3</italic>) but not in the antisense (<italic>effector 4</italic>) orientation. Further deletion analysis revealed that the activation domain of GKLF is solely localized to the N-terminal 109 amino acids (<italic>effector 6</italic>).</p><p>The N-terminal 109 amino acid region of GKLF contains several closely clustered acidic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>). As acidic residues have previously been shown to be involved in activation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c13">13</xref>), we selectively mutagenized two neighboring clusters of acidic residues, one of three glutamates and the other of three aspartates, in the region between amino acid residues 93&#x02013;104 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f1">1</xref>C). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f1">1</xref>A, mutation in either cluster in the context of the fusion between GAL4(1&#x02013;147) and GKLF(1&#x02013;109) completely abolished the ability of the N-terminal 109 amino acids of GKLF to activate reporter expression. These results strongly suggest that both clusters of acidic residues are involved in mediating transactivation by GKLF.</p><p>The activation domains of GKLF were verified by co-transfection experiments involving full-length or deleted GKLF constructs cloned in the mammalian expression vector, PMT3, and a luciferase reporter containing two tandem copies of the empirically determined GKLF-binding site (TDA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c36">36</xref>) linked to the adenovirus E1b TATA box (TDAx2-E<sub>1b</sub>TATALUC). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f2">2</xref>A, full-length GKLF (<italic>effector 1</italic>) induced the luciferase activity by a mean of 4.3-fold as compared to the PMT3 vector (<italic>effector V</italic>). The activating effect was abolished in a construct that contained only the zinc fingers (<italic>effector 2</italic>) or one that had the zinc fingers deleted (<italic>effector 3</italic>). Moreover, the activating effect was also abolished when the N-terminal 144 amino acids (<italic>effector 4</italic>) were deleted. In contrast, a construct with an internal deletion between amino acid residues 158 and 349 (<italic>effector 5</italic>) retained &#x0223c;75&#x00025; of the activity of the full-length construct. These results are therefore consistent with those of the GAL4 fusion assays in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f1">1</xref>.</p><p>To verify the preceding findings from the GAL4 fusion assay that the two clusters of acidic residues in the N-terminal 109 amino acids are indeed crucial for GKLF&#x02019;s ability to activate transcription, we generated two point mutants that selectively changed either the three glutamates or three aspartates to valines in the context of full-length GKLF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f2">2</xref>B). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f2">2</xref>A, conversion of the three glutamates to valines (<italic>effector 6</italic>) resulted in a significant (&#x0223c;75&#x00025;) reduction in the ability of GKLF to activate transcription. In comparison, mutation of the three aspartates (<italic>effector 7</italic>) resulted in a total loss of activity. These findings suggest that both clusters of acidic residues are involved in mediating transactivation by GKLF although mutation of the aspartates seems more deleterious than that of the glutamates.</p></sec><sec><title>Transactivation by GKLF involves intermolecular interaction</title><p>Among members of the subfamily of Kr&#x000fc;ppel proteins closely related to GKLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c29">29</xref>), EKLF was the earliest identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c31">31</xref>) and probably best characterized. Like GKLF, the transactivation domain of EKLF has previously been localized to its N-terminal 124 amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c49">49</xref>). Although it has a different primary amino acid sequence from that of GKLF, this region of EKLF is also rich in acidic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c31">31</xref>). Moreover, the mechanism of transactivation by EKLF appears to be complex and involves intermolecular interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c49">49</xref>). We therefore asked the question whether a similar mechanism is also involved in transactivation by GKLF.</p><p>The possibility of intermolecular interaction as part of the mechanism for transactivation of GKLF was examined by an <italic>in vivo</italic> competition assay similar to that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c49">49</xref>). In this assay an expression construct containing full-length GKLF was introduced by transfection in gradually increasing amounts relative to the GAL4 fusion construct containing the N-terminal 109 amino acids of GKLF along with the pG<sub>5</sub>TKLUC reporter. If transactivation by GKLF requires the participation of interacting molecules, the presence of full-length GKLF in excess might &#x02018;squelch&#x02019; the activating ability of its own transactivation domain. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f3">3</xref>, increasing amounts of full-length GKLF (<italic>competitor 1</italic>) competed for the activating effect of GAL4-GKLF(1&#x02013;109) on the reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f3">3</xref>B) in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the vector alone (<italic>competitor V</italic>) failed to do so (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f3">3</xref>A). Moreover, the competing effect of GKLF was mediated by the N-terminal 401 amino acids (<italic>competitor 2</italic>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f3">3</xref>C) but not by the sequence between amino acids 145 and 483 (<italic>competitor 3</italic>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f3">3</xref>D). This indicates that the N-terminal 144 amino acids of GKLF compete for an interacting molecule(s) involved in transactivation. Significantly, both mutant constructs with substitution in the two acidic clusters within the N-terminus of GKLF (<italic>competitors 4</italic> and <italic>5</italic>) failed to compete for the activating effect of the N-terminal transactivation domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f3">3</xref>E and F). These results suggest that intermolecular interaction is responsible, at least in part, for the transactivation by GKLF. Moreover, the same two clusters of acidic amino acids in the N-terminus necessary for GKLF&#x02019;s transactivating effect are involved in such interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Transactivation by GKLF involves p300&#x0002f;CBP</title><p>The recently described p300&#x0002f;CBP family of co-activators have been implicated in the regulation of transcription by modifying chromatin structure and by physically interacting with a host of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c52">52</xref>), including EKLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c53">53</xref>). An often employed strategy to study whether p300&#x0002f;CBP are involved in mediating the function of a transcription factor is to examine the effect of the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein on the activity of that factor. E1A is a multifunctional viral protein that modulates transcription of cellular genes by interacting with several key cellular proteins that include p300&#x0002f;CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c15">15</xref>). To determine whether E1A also modulates the transactivating effect of GKLF, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> competition experiments using expression constructs containing either wild-type or mutated E1A protein. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f4">4</xref>A, wild-type E1A (<italic>competitor 1</italic>) potently inhibited transactivation by the GAL4-GKLF(1&#x02013;109) construct in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, a mutated E1A construct that contained a deletion in its conserved region 2 (E1A&#x00394;CR2; <italic>competitor 3</italic>) was able to inhibit transactivation by the N-terminal 109 amino acids of GKLF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f4">4</xref>C). In contrast, another mutated E1A that contained a deletion in the conserved region 1 (E1A&#x00394;CR1; <italic>competitor 2</italic>) failed to inhibit GKLF&#x02019;s ability to transactivate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f4">4</xref>B). These results indicate that E1A is a potent inhibitor of transactivation by GKLF and that the conserved region 1 of E1A exerts this inhibitory effect.</p><p>The conserved region 1 of E1A has previously been shown to bind p300&#x0002f;CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c55">55</xref>). It is therefore possible that p300&#x0002f;CBP may mediate transactivation by GKLF. To determine this, we performed co-transfection experiments using expression constructs containing p300 or CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c47">47</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f5">5</xref> shows that both p300 and CBP were able to reverse the inhibition of GKLF&#x02019;s transactivation by E1A in a dose-dependent fashion. These findings suggest that p300&#x0002f;CBP are indeed involved in mediating the transactivating activity by GKLF.</p></sec><sec><title>GKLF and CBP physically interact with each other</title><p>E1A binds to p300&#x0002f;CBP. This raises the possibility that GKLF may also physically interact with p300&#x0002f;CBP. We therefore performed GST pull-down experiments using &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine-labeled, <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized GKLF and GST fusion proteins containing various segments of the CBP protein. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f6">6</xref>, GKLF was recovered from the eluants when it was first incubated with GST-CBP2 (lane 5) and GST-CBP3 (lane&#x000a0;6), with CBP2 exhibiting a higher binding affinity. In contrast, GKLF failed to interact with GST-CBP1 (lane 4) or GST alone (lane 3). Similarly, no activity was recovered from the beads when no GST proteins were present in the initial incubation (lane 2). These results indicate that GKLF specifically binds to CBP and that this binding occurs in at least two different regions of CBP.</p><p>The interaction between GKLF and CBP was further examined by co-immunoprecipitation of <italic>in vivo</italic> labeled proteins. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with RSV-CBP tagged with the HA epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c47">47</xref>) and PMT3 or PMT3-GKLF, and then metabolically labeled with &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine. Lysates from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with pre-immune serum, anti-GKLF serum or anti-HA antibodies, and the precipitated materials resolved by autoradiography. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f7">7</xref>, the anti-GKLF serum precipitated GKLF only in cells transfected with PMT3-GKLF (lane 5) but not in those with PMT3 (lane 2). Similarly, anti-HA antibodies precipitated a high-molecular-weight protein likely representing the HA-tagged CBP in transfected cells (lanes 3 and 6). Importantly, anti-HA antibodies also precipitated &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine-labeled GKLF in PMT3-GKLF-transfected cells (lane 6) but not in PMT3-transfected cells (lane&#x000a0;3). Moreover, when similar co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on the two point mutant proteins that involved the acidic residues of GKLF, anti-HA antibodies could no longer precipitate either GKLF mutant (lanes 9 and 11). These results strongly suggest that a physical interaction between GKLF and CBP occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that the two clusters of acidic residues in the N-terminus of GKLF are crucial for this interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Acidic residues are required for the growth-suppressing effect of GKLF</title><p>GKLF is a potent inhibitor of cell growth as demonstrated by previous studies involving transient transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>). In the present study we used an independent method to corroborate the growth-suppressing effect of GKLF&#x02014;the colony suppression assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c48">48</xref>) that is based on stable transfection. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f8">8</xref>A shows that while cells transfected with the PMT3 control plasmid and a puromycin resistance-containing plasmid led to the formation of a large number of puromycin-resistant colonies, those transfected with PMT3-GKLF and the resistant marker had far fewer. The degree of colony suppression by GKLF was slightly over 75&#x00025; as compared to vector alone, which represents a significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005 by two-tailed Students&#x02019; <italic>t</italic>-test) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f8">8</xref>B). These results suggest that expression of GKLF hindered cell growth, therefore preventing the formation of colonies. Importantly, the two point mutants of GKLF that abolished the transactivating and interacting abilities of GKLF completely failed to suppress colony formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd222f8">8</xref>A and B). We conclude that the same acidic residues in the N-terminus of GKLF are implicated in at least three of its biological activities including transactivation, protein&#x02013;protein interaction and growth suppression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>GKLF was first identified 3 years ago based on low-stringency cDNA library screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>) and polymerase chain reaction amplification of mouse embryonic cDNA with degenerate oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c25">25</xref>). Although the definitive physiological functions of GKLF have yet to be established, studies suggest that it is involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of certain epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c27">27</xref>). One important role that GKLF plays is to maintain a barrier function of the skin as demonstrated by recent experiments involving gene targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c26">26</xref>). Recent studies have also delineated some of the biochemical properties of GKLF including the DNA sequences to which it binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c39">39</xref>), the potential target genes subject to its regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c39">39</xref>) and the signals required for its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c29">29</xref>). In addition, GKLF was shown to exhibit a dual mechanism in modulating transcription, acting as a repressor under certain circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c39">39</xref>) and an activator in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c36">36</xref>). Moreover, studies involving deletional mutagenesis showed that GKLF contains distinct repressive and activating domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c27">27</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the mechanism of action of GKLF is complex. The current study thus provides new and detailed information on the mechanism of transactivation by GKLF from a structural&#x02013;functional perspective.</p><p>Various mechanisms have been shown to be involved in the activation of transcription by eukaryotic transcription factors. The domains responsible for transactivation often belong to one or more of three sequences that are rich in glutamates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c8">8</xref>), prolines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c10">10</xref>) or acidic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c13">13</xref>). Among the Kr&#x000fc;ppel-related proteins, Sp1 uses glutamate-rich domains for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c7">7</xref>) while NGFI-A uses all three types of domains for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c8">8</xref>). The transactivation domain of BTEB2, which exhibits significant homology to GKLF in the zinc finger region, is rich in proline residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c56">56</xref>). Although the primary amino acid sequence of GKLF is also very rich in prolines (12.8&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>), our results indicate that these residues are not essential for transactivation by GKLF. Instead, certain acidic amino acid residues are required. These studies therefore demonstrate a functional heterogeneity in the mechanisms of transactivation by the Kr&#x000fc;ppel family of related proteins.</p><p>Be that as it may, there is a remarkable degree of similarity in the mechanism of transactivation between GKLF and EKLF, a member of the GKLF subfamily of Kr&#x000fc;ppel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c29">29</xref>). The activation domain of EKLF has been localized to between amino acid residues 20 and 124, a region that is rich in both acidic and proline residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c49">49</xref>). Protein&#x02013;protein interaction has also been shown to be important in the ability of EKLF to activate transcription and evidence suggests that such interaction is mediated by acidic residues localized within the N-terminus of EKLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c49">49</xref>). EKLF physically interacts with p300 and CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c53">53</xref>). In transient transfection assays the addition of p300&#x0002f;CBP increased transactivation by EKLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c53">53</xref>). Thus, despite a difference in the primary sequence between the activation domains of GKLF and EKLF, there appears to be a significant degree of functional conservation in the mechanism by which the two proteins activate transcription.</p><p>p300 and CBP belong to the family of proteins that exhibit histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c57">57</xref>). They function to stimulate transcription of specific promoters following their recruitment by specific DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c51">51</xref>). The HAT activity within p300&#x0002f;CBP is responsible, at least in part, for this transcriptional stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c59">59</xref>). Numerous studies have demonstrated that p300&#x0002f;CBP may play a key role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c57">57</xref>). For example, p300 has been shown to physically interact with the myogenic transcription factor MyoD in differentiating myocytes. This interaction is necessary for both MyoD-induced activation of muscle-specific gene transcription and cell cycle arrest due to an up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c60">60</xref>). p300&#x0002f;CBP have also been shown to interact with the tumor suppressor p53, thereby modulating the cell cycle regulatory activity of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c61">61</xref>). Moreover, there is considerable evidence to suggest that interaction between the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A and p300&#x0002f;CBP is important for the biological effects of E1A including regulation of transcription, suppression of differentiation and immortalization of cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c15">15</xref>). In the context of gut epithelial differentiation, expression of CBP has been associated with terminal differentiation of a model enterocyte, Caco-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c62">62</xref>). Furthermore, CBP interacts with Cdx2, a homeodomain protein purportedly implicated in effecting intestinal epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c63">63</xref>). Taking into view the potential role of GKLF in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, it is very possible that p300&#x0002f;CBP are also an important component that mediates some of GKLF&#x02019;s biological activities.</p><p>Using transient transfection assays, we previously showed that GKLF is a potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd222c23">23</xref>). This inhibitory effect was substantiated in the present study by the colony suppression assay that is based on stable transfection. Importantly, point mutations in GKLF abolishing the transactivating activity of GKLF also abolished its growth-inhibitory effect. Thus, transactivation is an essential element of GKLF&#x02019;s biological functions. The significance of this finding is further increased by the fact that the same acidic residues are crucial for interaction with CBP. Consequently, these domains likely represent the convergence of several important aspects of GKLF&#x02019;s activities, including transactivation, protein&#x02013;protein interaction and growth suppression. Our study therefore provides strong evidence for an important structural and functional correlation among the various biological effects of GKLF.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd222f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Localization of the transactivation domain of GKLF by the GAL4 fusion assay.
