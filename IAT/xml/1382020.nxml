Increasing evidence suggests that transcriptional alterations contribute to polyQ pathogenesis, although the mechanism is unclear. We previously demonstrated that the <italic>SCA7</italic> gene product, ataxin-7 (ATXN7), is a subunit of the GCN5 histone acetyltransferase&#x02013;containing coactivator complexes TFTC/S TAGA. We show here that TFTC/S TAGA complexes purified from SCA7 mice have normal TRRAP, GCN5, TAF12, and SPT3 levels and that their histone or nucleosomal acetylation activities are unaffected. However, rod photoreceptors from SCA7 mouse models showed severe chromatin decondensation. In agreement, polyQ-expanded ataxin-7 induced histone H3 hyperacetylation, resulting from an increased recruitment of TFTC/S TAGA to specific promoters. Surprisingly, hyperacetylated genes were transcriptionally down-regulated, and expression analysis revealed that nearly all rod-specific genes were affected, leading to visual impairment in SCA7 mice. In conclusion, we describe here a set of events accounting for SCA7 pathogenesis in the retina, in which polyQ-expanded ATXN7 deregulated TFTC/S TAGA recruitment to a subset of genes specifically expressed in rod photoreceptors, leading to chromatin alterations and consequent progressive loss of rod photoreceptor function. </p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A mouse model of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) offers new insight into transcriptional alterations that contribute to this neurodegenerative disorder.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat encoding a polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

Expanded polyQ confers a toxic gain of function to otherwise unrelated proteins. Aggregation of expanded polyQ-containing proteins in the nucleus is a hallmark of these diseases. Despite these common properties, polyQ diseases also show distinctive features, which may reflect the unique protein context of the polyQ expansion in each disease. SCA7 can be distinguished from other polyQ diseases, as it is the only one affecting the retina leading to visual impairment and eventually to blindness &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>We recently demonstrated that ataxin-7 (ATXN7), the protein mutated in SCA7, is a bona fide subunit of TFTC, the TATA-binding protein (TBP)-free TBP-associated factor (TAF)-containing complex, and S TAGA, the SPT3/TAF9/GCN5 acetyltransferase complex &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. These transcriptional co-activator complexes were shown to preferentially acetylate histone H3 in both free and nucleosomal contexts and to activate transcription on chromatin templates &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b006">6</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

In contrast, the general transcription factor TFIID contains TBP and 14 TAFs, some of which are shared with TFTC/S TAGA. TFTC/S TAGA complexes are the mammalian homologs of the yeast SAGA (Spt/Ada/Gcn5) complex &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Genome-wide expression studies indicate that transcriptional regulation of approximately 10&#x00025; of the yeast genome is predominantly regulated by SAGA and 90&#x00025; by TFIID. Most SAGA-dominated genes were found stress inducible and highly regulated although TFIID controlled the expression of housekeeping genes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. In comparison with yeast SAGA, the mechanisms by which mammalian TFTC-like complexes regulate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription remain elusive. </p><p>Early and severe transcriptional alterations were detected in various polyQ models &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Expanded polyQ-containing proteins have been proposed to interfere with the normal function of several transcription factors, notably by sequestering them to nuclear inclusions (NIs), but the exact mechanisms leading to transcriptional deregulation remain largely unknown. The mouse retina is a suitable neuronal tissue to perform transcriptional studies as rods represent around 97&#x00025; of photoreceptors and more than 70&#x00025; of all retinal cells &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. In wild-type (WT) mice, the nuclei of rod photoreceptors display a very peculiar organization different from that of any other retinal neurons, with a thin rim of euchromatin surrounding a large heterochromatin territory &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Chromatin plays a pivotal role in regulating transcription, suggesting that rod nuclear organization specifies its gene expression profile. In particular, genes encoding components of the phototransduction cascade are expressed specifically in rods, at remarkably high levels due to constant renewal of rod outer segments. </p><p>We previously generated transgenic mice specifically expressing normal (10Q) or mutant (90Q) ATXN7 in rod photoreceptors (hereafter called R7N and R7E lines, respectively) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Mutant ATXN7 induced a progressive loss of segments and dramatic reduction of rod electrophysiological activity in R7E mice. Segment loss paralleled a progressive and severe down-regulation of <italic>Rho</italic> (rhodopsin), which was the earliest molecular anomaly detectable in these mice &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Similar observations were made in a SCA7 knock-in mouse model, which expresses mutant ATXN7 at endogenous levels &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that loss of photoreceptor-specific gene expression is relevant to SCA7 retinopathy. Finally, recent studies performed in yeast or in transfected cells suggest that polyQ-expanded ATXN7 incorporation in TFTC/S TAGA alters their composition and inhibits their nucleosomal HAT activity &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Here, we investigated the composition and activity of TFTC/S TAGA complexes in vivo. We discovered that, in the retina of SCA7 mice, mutant TFTC/S TAGA HAT complexes induced histone H3 hyperacetylation through their aberrant recruitment to promoters of rod photoreceptor-specific genes. Furthermore, rod nuclei showed chromatin decondensation which, surprisingly, correlated with severe transcriptional repression of the corresponding genes. Alteration of rod highly organized nuclear architecture disrupted the rod-specific expression profile through down-regulation of most genes whose expression is normally high and restricted to rods. Finally, loss of expression of most genes required for phototransduction provides a molecular explanation for the retinal degeneration observed in SCA7 mice. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Severe Alteration of Rod Photoreceptor Nuclear Architecture in SCA7 Mice</title><p>R7E mice, which express mutant (90Q) ATXN7 under control of the rhodopsin promoter, have a normal lifespan due to restricted transgene expression in rod photoreceptors. This allowed us to show that mutant ATXN7-induced retinopathy is characterized by long-term and complete dysfunction of rods &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. We have now investigated more thoroughly the ultrastructural changes accompanying prolonged rod dysfunction by electron microscopy of WT, R7N, and R7E retinas at different ages. Transgenic lines R7N.C and R7E.A were used throughout this study &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>The most surprising abnormality was a striking modification of rod nuclear architecture ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In WT mice, rods have small nuclei (4&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;m diameter) with a characteristic polyhedral shape and contain a single, large clump of heterochromatin surrounded by a sparse rim of euchromatin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, panels a and d). R7N rod photoreceptors were indistinguishable from those of WT mice ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, panel a), consistent with the absence of phenotype in this line &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. In marked contrast, rods from R7E mice showed a dramatic chromatin decondensation, associated with a massive increase in nuclear volume ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, panels b and c). Consequently, rod nuclei from R7E mice showed much more euchromatin and resembled cone nuclei or that of neurons from the inner nuclear layer. However, these abnormal photoreceptors were undoubtedly identified as rods because a fibrillar structure was observed in the decondensed chromatin territory (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, panels b and c), which likely corresponded to aggregated mutant ATXN7. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the presence of a single NI in weakly DAPI-stained territories in rods from aged R7E mice ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). This aberrant chromatin alteration was a progressive phenomenon as it was already observable in 2-mo-old R7E mice, although less prominent and heterogeneous ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, panel b). At 2 y of age, almost all nuclei were larger and rounder, and the spacing between nuclei was greater than in WT retina ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, panel c). Finally, we noticed a normal retinal epithelium appearance despite dramatic loss of segments ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>), indicating that rods from R7E mice are defective in segment renewal. </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Comparable Chromatin Remodeling in Rods from SCA7 Knock-In Mice</title><p>We then tested whether this nuclear phenotype was relevant to SCA7 retinopathy or due to overexpression of mutant ATXN7 in R7E mice. We performed electron microscopy of retina from 3-mo-old SCA7 heterozygous knock-in mice (Sca <sup>7266Q/5Q</sup>) which present a retinopathy comparable to that occurring in R7E animals &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Rod nuclear architecture was altered in Sca <sup>7266Q/5Q</sup> mice when compared to WT littermates ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Rod nuclei from Sca <sup>7266Q/5Q</sup> mice contained more euchromatin and displayed a reduced and disorganized heterochromatin territory (compare panels b, c, e, and f with panels a and d in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). We could observe a small, pale fibrillar structure in the decondensed chromatin territory ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>), which likely resulted from aggregation of mutant ATXN7 into NIs. Although comparable, chromatin decondensation appeared less severe in heterozygous Sca <sup>7266Q/5Q</sup> animals than in age-matched R7E mice. Premature death of Sca <sup>7266Q/5Q</sup> mice precluded analysis of the extent of chromatin remodeling at later stages, when the nuclear phenotype was prominent in R7E mice. These data together show that significant chromatin alterations occurred in rod nuclei of both SCA7 transgenic and knock-in mouse models, further suggesting that this aberrant nuclear phenotype is relevant to polyQ-expanded ATXN7-induced retinopathy. </p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Aberrant Rod Chromatin Remodeling Is Correlated with Rod Dysfunction</title><p>In early stages of the R7E retinal phenotype (at 2 mo), different degrees of chromatin decondensation were observed by electron microscopy ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) and by histological examination of toluidin-blue stained sections ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Strikingly, normal condensed rod nuclei were always connected with preserved inner and outer segments, whereas areas with abnormal decondensed rod nuclei were associated with segment thinning ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, bottom right panel). Interestingly, areas with remaining segments were occasionally found associated with slightly decondensed nuclei, wheres areas without any segments left were never associated with normal condensed nuclei. Furthermore, mild alterations of chromatin condensation could be detected on toluidin blue&#x02013;stained sections of 4-wk-old animals ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>B), before the onset of R7E retinopathy. These two observations suggested that the aberrant chromatin decondensation might be a primary event preceding the loss of segments and rod dysfunction. </p><p>Immunohistology using an anti-rhodopsin antibody revealed a striking, patchy down-regulation of <italic>Rho</italic> expression in 2-mo-old R7E mice ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Immunofluorescence showed that nuclei of rhodopsin-negative rods always displayed severe chromatin decondensation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), whereas nuclei from immunopositive rods had a preserved chromatin architecture ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Thus, rods undergoing chromatin decondensation have completely silenced rhodopsin expression, and the 10&#x00025; residual <italic>Rho</italic> mRNA levels detected by RT-PCR ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g003">Figure 3</xref>) at 2 mo of age are likely due to a small proportion of rods with a preserved chromatin structure. Altogether these results demonstrate that polyQ-expanded ATXN7 induces a dramatic chromatin alteration that correlates with extinction of <italic>Rho</italic> expression. </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Reduced mRNA Levels of Rod-Specific Genes in SCA7 Mice</title><p>Activation of transcription is usually associated with chromatin decondensation. However, we found that <italic>Rho</italic> down-regulation correlated with chromatin decondensation. We thus tested to what extent such an important change in chromatin organization would affect the gene expression profile of rod photoreceptors. Because the rod nuclear architecture in aged R7E mice was similar to that normally seen in cone photoreceptors ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), we analyzed expression levels of transcription factors specifically expressed and involved in rod versus cone fate specification. <italic>Crx,</italic> a homeobox transcription activator, <italic>Nrl,</italic> a basic motif-leucine zipper transcription activator, and <italic>Nr2e3,</italic> an orphan nuclear receptor, are essential for rod and cone differentiation by controlling photoreceptor gene expression &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b021">21</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed decreased mRNA levels of <italic>Crx</italic> (2-fold, 55&#x00025; residual mRNA levels), <italic>Nrl</italic> (3-fold, 31&#x00025;), and <italic>Nr2e3</italic> (5-fold, 21&#x00025;) in 2-mo-old R7E retina ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), suggesting an alteration of photoreceptor differentiation in adult R7E mice. We then quantified mRNA levels of genes encoding cone- or rod-specific markers, but we did not observe a consistent up-regulation of genes encoding components of cone phototransduction cascade. In 2-mo-old R7E mice, blue cone opsin <italic>(Bcp)</italic> and cone arrestin <italic>(Carr)</italic> were down-regulated (43&#x00025; and 65&#x00025; residual levels, respectively), whereas cone transducin <italic>(Gnat2)</italic> was up-regulated by 113&#x00025; ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). </p><p>Importantly however, we found a severe down-regulation of most rod-specific genes tested (12 out of 13). In 2-mo-old R7E mice, quantitative RT-PCR showed a down-regulation of rhodopsin ( <italic>Rho,</italic> 13&#x00025; residual mRNA levels), rod transducin ( <italic>Gnat1,</italic> 3&#x00025;), rod phosphodiesterase &#x003b2;-subunit ( <italic>Pde6b,</italic> 10&#x00025;), rhodopsin kinase ( <italic>Rhok,</italic> 28&#x00025;), Rom-1 ( <italic>Rom,</italic> 23&#x00025;), and Irbp ( <italic>Rbp3,</italic> 52&#x00025;) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, using Northern blot experiments, we observed comparable reduction of other rod-specific mRNA levels ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>), namely phosducin <italic>(Pdc)</italic>, rod cGMP-gated channel <italic>(Cncg),</italic> rod arrestin <italic>(Sag),</italic> guanylate cyclase activator <italic>(Guca),</italic> recoverin <italic>(Rcvrn),</italic> and peripherin 2 <italic>(Prph2).</italic> Five distinct housekeeping genes <italic>(Ppia, Gapd, Arbp, Tuba1,</italic> and <italic>Hprt)</italic> showed no differential expression between R7E and WT mice (see figure legends; data not shown). </p><p>Finally, we extended our analysis of transcriptional deregulation to the level of the whole transcriptome. Hybridization of MOE 430A Affymetrix microarrays that contained approximately 22,000 mouse transcripts using total RNA extracted from WT, R7N, and R7E mice at 2 mo of age, revealed that polyQ-expanded ATXN7 does not induce a global alteration of mRNA levels, as less than 1&#x00025; of genes were deregulated with a 2-fold threshold ( <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.015, Mann-Whitney test) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, when down-regulated genes were classified according to their expression levels in control retina, 29 of the 50 most highly expressed genes were found to be only expressed in the retina. Thus, polyQ-expanded ATXN7 preferentially down-regulated genes with a retina-restricted expression pattern, accounting for the visual impairment observed in SCA7 mice &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, we did not find up-regulation of genes encoding factors regulating chromatin structure or accessibility. This aberrant expression profile suggests that rods from R7E mice have completely lost their differentiated state, but did not trans-differentiate into mature cone photoreceptors. </p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Down-Regulated Rod-Specific Genes Are Transcriptionally Altered in SCA7 Mice</title><p>Because chromatin decondensation has been typically associated with active transcription, we tested whether the decreased mRNA levels of rod-specific genes were indeed due to a reduced transcriptional activity of these genes. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin extracts prepared from 2-mo-old control (WT or R7N) and R7E retina. We used an antibody raised against the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA Pol II in ChIP experiments to quantify the relative RNA Pol II occupancy at promoters and coding regions of down-regulated genes.

We hypothesized that these genes, normally highly expressed, would localize to peripheral euchromatin in normal rods and that this specific compartmentalization would be disrupted by the chromatin alterations that occur in rods from SCA7 mice. Accordingly, immunostaining of WT retina using antibodies against transcription factors (ATXN7, RNA Pol II, TBP, TAF10, Crx, and CBP) and chromatin-associated proteins (HP1&#x003b3;, HMGI(Y), Rb1, and acetyl-histone H3) revealed that these proteins were always excluded from the heterochromatic region, showing a characteristic ring-like appearance ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>, and see &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;). </p><p>We used interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of mouse retina sections to investigate the nuclear localization of the gene encoding rhodopsin <italic>(Rho)</italic> versus a gene not expressed in rods, the vascular smooth muscle alpha-actin gene <italic>(Acta2)</italic>.

Confocal analysis revealed that the <italic>Rho</italic> gene was almost never found inside the central, densely DAPI-stained chromatin territory in WT rod nuclei ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g005">5</xref>B).

We do not know at this point whether the proportion of rods showing a central FISH signal (around 16&#x00025;) reflects the actual situation in vivo or is due to the intrinsic limit of the FISH technique. Altogether, these results suggested that the rod nuclear organization normally compartmentalizes rod-specific genes in peripheral euchromatin. However, in R7E mice, alteration of this compartmentalization presumably contributes to loss of the rod-specific gene expression profile. </p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>PolyQ-Expanded ATXN7 Incorporation in TFTC/S TAGA Complexes Does Not Modify Their HAT Activity </title><p>The discrepancy between chromatin and transcriptional abnormalities in R7E mice prompted us to analyze the effect of the polyQ expansion in ATXN7 on the TFTC HAT complex composition and activity. We previously reported that both normal and mutant ATXN7 can incorporate into TFTC using transfected HEK293T &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. We have now extended this result by analyzing TFTC-type complexes purified from the retina of R7N and R7E transgenic animals, where the pathology normally appears in SCA7 patients. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using whole retinal extracts from 4-wk-old mice, an age at which mutant ATXN7 is soluble and not proteolytically processed &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. First an anti-ATXN7 immunoprecipitation (IP) using R7N or R7E mice retinal extracts, retrieved bona fide TFTC subunits, such as Gcn5, Trrap, Taf10, and Taf12, together with normal or polyQ-expanded ATXN7 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, and data not shown). Reciprocally, when anti-TRRAP or anti-SPT3 antibodies were used, normal and mutant ATXN7 were equally incorporated into the Trrap- and Spt3-containing complexes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, lanes 5&#x02013;9). We also tested whether the presence of mutant ATXN7 changed the incorporation of the histone acetylase subunit Gcn5 or of other subunits known to regulate TFTC HAT activity, such as Taf12 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. TFTC complexes prepared by an anti-ATXN7 or an anti-TRRAP IP from R7N and R7E mice contained about equal levels of Gcn5 and Taf12, as shown by Western blot analysis of immunopurified fractions ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, lanes 3 and 6, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, lanes 3 and 6). Importantly, Gcn5 incorporation was not altered even in 10-wk-old mice ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>D), an age at which severe chromatin changes were observed. </p><p>Next we tested whether the above-purified HAT complexes, containing either normal or mutant ATXN7 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;D), differentially acetylate free or nucleosomal histones in an in vitro acetylation test. TFTC-type complexes purified by an anti-AXN7 IP from the retina of R7N mice have the expected HAT activity, since they acetylate mainly histone H3 and, weakly, H4 as does the highly purified TFTC ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>E, and see &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;). Histone acetylation pattern of complexes immunopurified from R7N or R7E retina were indistinguishable ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>E, lanes 3&#x02013;6). When Spt3- or Trrap-containing complexes were tested for their acetylation activity we did not observe a significant difference between complexes purified from retina of R7N or R7E mice at either 4 or 10 wk of age ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>F, lanes 1&#x02013;4, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g006">Figure 6</xref>G, lanes 2&#x02013;5). Quantification of the HAT activities of ATXN7- and Trrap-containing complexes revealed an equal histone acetylation activity of TFTC-type complexes purified from R7N and R7E retina ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg006">Figure S6</xref>A). Using an anti-SPT3 antibody, we observed a slight decrease (0.25-fold) of TFTC HAT activity in R7E mice ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg006">Figure S6</xref>A).

We performed ChIP experiments using chromatin extracts prepared from 2-mo-old control (WT or R7N) and R7E retina to quantify TFTC recruitment at genes down-regulated <italic>(Rho, Pde6b, Rbp3, Crx,</italic> and <italic>Nrl)</italic> or unmodified <italic>(Ncl)</italic> in R7E mice. </p><p>To monitor TFTC recruitment, we used an antibody raised against SPT3 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d; and found a specific increase (2- to 3-fold) of Spt3 occupancy at the promoters from the <italic>Rho, Pde6b,</italic> and <italic>Rbp3</italic> genes in R7E mice, as compared to control mice ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). In contrast, Spt3 recruitment was not modified at the <italic>Crx</italic> and <italic>Nrl</italic> promoters ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Similarly, the housekeeping gene <italic>Ncl</italic> did not show any differences in Spt3 binding ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). We next analyzed whether this abnormal recruitment of TFTC-type complexes causes elevated levels of histone modifications at promoters of deregulated genes, possibly accounting for the transcriptional alterations observed in R7E mice. As TFTC preferentially acetylates lysines on the N-terminal tail of histone H3 from 5&#x02032; regulatory regions, we quantified H3 K9 and K14 acetylation at the promoter regions previously analyzed. We found an aberrant histone H3 hyperacetylation profile in R7E mice that paralleled aberrant TFTC recruitment. <italic>Rho, Pde6b,</italic> and <italic>Rbp3</italic> promoter regions were hyperacetylated in R7E mice as compared to control mice ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040067-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). When comparing the ChIP signals obtained at the <italic>Rho, Pde6b,</italic> and <italic>Rbp3</italic> promoters, we observed around a 2- to 3-fold increase both in histone H3 acetylation and in Spt3/TFTC occupancy between R7E and control mice.

We also analyzed TFTC-type complexes recruitment at different regions of the <italic>Rho</italic> gene using an anti-SPT3 antibody. We observed a 2-fold increased association of Spt3 at the <italic>Rho</italic> enhancer region, the proximal promoter, and the 3&#x02032;UTR in R7E mice as compared to control mice ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg007">Figure S7</xref>). Interestingly, an increased Spt3 occupancy was also observed 2 kb downstream of the <italic>Rho</italic> gene, in R7E animals. Taken together, these results indicate that, in mouse photoreceptors, the polyQ expansion in ATXN7 does not modify its incorporation into TFTC and does not affect its HAT activity. Rather TFTC/S TAGA recruitment is deregulated over large genomic regions, leading to histone H3 hyperacetylation, chromatin decondensation, and transcriptional dysregulation. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on our findings, we propose that mutant ATXN7, by its incorporation in TFTC-type complexes, deregulates its recruitment, thereby inducing aberrant histone H3 acetylation patterns at specific promoters. Alterations of chromatin-modifying complex regulation likely result in the severe disorganization of the normal chromatin condensation pattern seen specifically in mature rod photoreceptor nuclei. These perturbations eventually cause a loss of the tissue-specific pattern of gene expression, leading to rod photoreceptor dedifferentiation and dysfunction.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Chromatin Decondensation Leads to Transcriptional Repression of Rod-Specific Genes in SCA7 Mouse Retina</title><p>We provide here, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence that polyQ expansions induce chromatin structure changes in vivo, contributing to early neuronal dysfunction. Taking advantage of the mosaic progression of the R7E retinal phenotype, we showed that <italic>Rho</italic> down-regulation and hence rod dysfunction were completely correlated with chromatin decondensation. Furthermore, we could detect chromatin abnormalities in 4-wk-old R7E mice ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>B), before the onset of an overt retinal dysfunction and concomitantly with a 2-fold <italic>Rho</italic> mRNA decrease &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Chromatin decondensation and transcriptional dysregulation of rod-specific genes are thus the earliest molecular abnormalities in R7E mice and occur before retinal dysfunction can be observed. However, transcriptional alterations observed in later stages of R7E retinopathy might additionally result from the severe rod dysfunction that occurs at this age. Candidate gene expression and transcriptome analysis of retina from 2-mo-old R7E mice revealed a severe transcriptional defect affecting rod-specific genes. Accordingly, Bowman et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d; suggested that the photoreceptor transcriptional machinery is not globally affected, since rods showing a loss of rhodopsin staining in Sca7 <sup>266Q/5Q</sup> mice had increased Ub <sup>G76V</sup>-GFP transgene mRNA levels. In addition, Yoo et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; reported that several rod-specific genes were downregulated in Sca7 <sup>266Q/5Q</sup> animals. Thus, comparable chromatin and transcriptional abnormalities were observed in both transgenic and knock-in models, suggesting that these observations are relevant for SCA7 retinopathy.

Two recent studies, performed in yeast and in stably transfected 293T embryonic kidney cells, suggested that polyQ-expanded ATXN7 inhibits TFTC/S TAGA nucleosomal acetylation activity by interfering with recruitment of SPT3, ADA2b, and TAF12 into these complexes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.

In our study, TFTC/S TAGA was immunopurified from SCA7 mouse retina using antibodies against three different subunits. Our results convincingly demonstrate that SCA7 mutant TFTC/S TAGA complexes had normal incorporation of Gcn5, Taf12, and Spt3 and, consistently, normal levels of HAT activity on both free histones and nucleosomes. The discrepancies between our in vivo results and previously reported in vitro observations are likely explained by the different model systems used in each study. McMahon et al. analyzed the incorporation of polyQ-expanded human ATXN7 in the yeast SAGA complex. Although yeast Sgf73, Spt3, and Taf12 are the respective homologs of human ATXN7, SPT3, and TAF12, their sequence similarity is low and significant only in one or two conserved domains. In particular, mammalian ATXN7 differs from yeast Sgf73 by the presence of the polyQ tract and an additional third domain that is likely involved in interactions with other TFTC/S TAGA subunits &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, polyQ-expanded ATXN7 incorporation into yeast SAGA versus human TFTC/S TAGA might have different effects on the structure, composition, and function of these complexes. Furthermore, overexpression of other expanded polyQ-containing proteins in yeast has been shown to lead to the formation of intranuclear insoluble aggregates much quicker than in mouse models &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, in a yeast strain overexpressing mutant ATXN7, its rapid accumulation could alter the available levels of various components of the complex, such as Ada2, Taf12, and Spt3, due to a sequestration or destabilization of these proteins, leading to the quick loss of SAGA HAT activity. Palhan et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; analyzed S TAGA complexes from transfected cells using a single antibody against recombinant ATXN7 which could result in the purification of other partial complexes containing overexpressed ATXN7. Furthermore, no transcriptional and/or chromatin alterations were reported in this cell line, making it difficult to correlate impaired HAT activity with SCA7 pathology. In contrast, our results were exclusively obtained from SCA7 mouse retina in which chromatin decondensation is correlated with transcriptional deregulation that likely accounts for the retinal phenotype observed in these mice. In this in vivo model, TFTC/S TAGA composition and HAT activity were analyzed before and after the onset of aggregate formation and transcriptional alteration. Finally, using a lymphoblastoid cell line from a SCA7 patient carrying 51 CAG expansion, we previously reported that TFTC composition and HAT activity were unaltered, as compared to control cell lines &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. In conclusion, these discrepancies demonstrate that in vivo models, which reproduce key features of human pathologies, are likely more significant to understanding disease pathogenesis. However, we cannot exclude that some of our observations in R7E mice might be model specific, and therefore may not account for all pathogenic mechanisms underlying SCA7 retinal phenotype. In light of our observations made on the R7E model, the retina of the SCA7 knock-in mouse model, which recapitulates more accurately SCA7 phenotype in human, will also be further examined, although these mice die quite early, making the analysis difficult. </p><p>Previous studies suggested that disruption of the activity of the photoreceptor-specific transcriptional activator Crx may play a role in SCA7 retinopathy by its direct interaction with ATXN7 and that TFTC/S TAGA complexes might act as coactivators for Crx-mediated transcriptional activity &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.

In agreement, we show here a global down-regulation of all rod-specific genes and not exclusively those regulated by Crx, demonstrating that interference of Crx activity does not solely account for the retinal pathogenesis specifically observed in SCA7. Furthermore, we were unable to detect any direct interaction between ATXN7-containing TFTC/S TAGA complexes and Crx in WT mouse retina by co-immunoprecipitation experiments ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg008">Figure S8</xref>). This observation might be explained by the fact that interaction between known activators and co-activators can be temporally and specifically regulated in vivo.

Several non-exclusive hypotheses can be proposed to explain how mutant TFTC, containing polyQ-expanded ATXN7, can be aberrantly recruited at certain locations, i.e., at promoters and even nearby intergenic regions, and how this would down-regulate gene expression. One possibility would be that the presence of the polyQ stretch within TFTC serves as an aberrant interaction domain with chromatin, recruiting TFTC at aberrant sites, thus causing histone H3 hyperacetylation and chromatin decondensation, and eventually displacing transcriptional co-activators from their normal localization. Supporting this possibility, large-scale chromatin decondensation has been observed after targeting acidic activators to heterochromatin domains &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, mutant ATXN7 might impair some events downstream of co-activator recruitment, such as the formation of a fully active preinitiation complex containing all the general transcription factors. Indeed, increased occupancy of TFTC complexes did not lead to increased transcription, offering support that additional factors are required to assemble and activate RNA Pol II transcription machinery at rod-specific genes. Finally, mutant TFTC-type complexes may aberrantly acetylate non-histone substrates accounting for chromatin decondensation and directly or indirectly to transcriptional alterations observed in SCA7 mice.

Positioning highly expressed genes in the rod-specific euchromatic nuclear periphery might also be used to accelerate the coupling between mRNA synthesis, processing, and export, thereby accelerating the total rate of protein synthesis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>These findings might explain why such a massive chromatin remodeling in SCA7 mice affected only those genes whose expression and nuclear distribution are the most tightly regulated. These genes (i.e., <italic>Rho, Pde6b,</italic> and <italic>Rbp3</italic>) are characterized by an increased TFTC-binding, histone H3 hyperacetylation, but surprisingly with a transcriptional decrease in SCA7 mouse retina. We hypothesize that at the corresponding promoters, TFTC requirement is normally highly regulated and that aberrant, non-specific TFTC recruitment over a large genomic region ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg007">Figure S7</xref>) causes deregulated Pol II transcription. These highly expressed genes may be particularly sensitive to the changes occurring in the chromatin territories and to the consequent dilution of general transcription factors in the increased nuclear volume. In contrast, expression of a majority of genes is not changing despite severe chromatin reorganization, because these genes are probably weakly transcribed and thus are not sensitive to the changes in nuclear environment. </p><p>Altogether our study may provide new insights into SCA7 pathogenesis. Deciphering the exact causal relationships between TFTC/S TAGA aberrant recruitment, histone hyperacetylation, and chromatin decondensation will require further investigation. These future directions should shed light on the transcriptional mechanisms initiating and controlling a tissue-specific gene expression pattern and the contribution of TFTC-type coactivator complexes to such processes in vivo. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>R7N and R7E animals were from the R7N.C and R7E.A transgenic lines, respectively, and were maintained on the inbred C57BL/6 background &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040067-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

This time-course analysis revealed that alterations of rod nuclear architecture progressively worsened as retinopathy progressed in R7E mice. Cone photoreceptor nuclei (c), which are found in the outermost part of the ONL adjacent to inner segments (is), present a different architecture with several heterochromatin clumps surrounded by more euchromatin.

Histones were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) and acetylated histones were visualized by fluorography (Fluorogr). The position of each histone is indicated. The pattern of histone acetylation was identical to that of a highly purified TFTC fraction used as a positive control. No histone acetylation could be detected when the antibody was omitted. The age of the mice are indicated in weeks in brackets. These results are representative of three independent experiments.
