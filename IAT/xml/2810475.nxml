Our data show that in the inner ear aquaporin-6 is expressed, in both vestibular and acoustic sensory epithelia, by the supporting cells directly contacting hair cells. In particular, in the Organ of Corti, expression was strongest in Deiters' cells, which provide both a mechanical link between outer hair cells (OHCs) and the Organ of Corti, and an entry point for ion recycle pathways. Since aquaporin-6 is permeable to both water and anions, these results suggest its possible involvement in regulating OHC motility, directly through modulation of water and chloride flow or by changing mechanical compliance in Deiters' cells. In further support of this role, treating mice with salicylates, which impair OHC electromotility, dramatically reduced aquaporin-6 expression in the inner ear epithelia but not in control tissues, suggesting a role for this protein in modulating OHCs' responses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="section" id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Salicylates are a class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects that are known to induce reversible hearing loss and tinnitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A rationale for salicylate-induced hearing loss is the block of prestin, the molecular motor of outer hair cells (OHC), through competition with intracellular Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. On the other hand, the mechanism underlying salicylate-induced tinnitus is still unclear, since in the cochlea these drugs, besides prestin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], also target other systems, among which several players in the stress/inflammation pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The stress response affects a large number of targets, among which AQPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the proteins forming water channels in biological membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Several AQPs have been found in the inner ear, each with its distinct distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but so far only AQP4 is known to affect hearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The distribution and role of AQP6, however, are less clearly characterized, and may be interesting, given the low permeability to water and high permeability to anions (both increased by low pH) of this isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, the function of AQP6 could be that of regulating the flow of anions rather than water, possibly affecting the behavior of outer hair cells (OHCs), which are very sensitive to Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Previous findings show that AQP6 is expressed in human and rat inner ear, but the protein localization is still controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], possibly due to species differences, which have been observed for other aquaporins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Whereas in vestibular epithelia AQP6 was found in the apical part of supporting cells both in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] in the cochlea AQP6 has been detected in the human Organ of Corti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] but not in the rat Organ of Corti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In agreement with AQP6 localization in other tissues, AQP6 immunoreactivity in the rat ear appeared limited to intracellular structures, with a negligible labeling in the plasma membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p> In the present paper, we studied AQP6 mRNA expression in the mouse inner ear and its regulation by aspirin, by performing semiquantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

The PCR protocol consisted of an initial denaturation of 5&#x02009;min at 96&#x000b0;C followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 96&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;s annealing at 60&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;s, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;s. Reverse transcription was always performed both in the presence (positive) or in the absence (negative control) of reverse transcriptase enzyme. The RT-PCR reactions were normalized using <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-actin as an internal standard. First, sequences of the AQP bands were checked by using the Big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystem, PE, USA).

Discussion</title><p>In the present paper, we characterize for the first time the expression pattern of AQP6 in the mouse ear sensory epithelia and its regulation by salicylates. </p><p> Our data agree with previous studies in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] showing strong AQP6 expression in the supporting cells of vestibular epithelia. In the cochlea, on the other hand, our results disagree with previous localization in the rat, where labelling was seen in the stria vascularis but not in the organ of Corti. Although some discrepancies could be ascribed to differences in species and antibodies used, it is also possible that the different labelling observed in the organ of Corti results from variations in the modulation set point of expression, as our salicylate experiments show. </p><p>Our data show that AQP6 is expressed in the organ of Corti, and particularly in Deiters' cells. This pattern of expression suggests a possible role for AQP6 in regulating OHC electromotility, which involves both water and chloride flow, or in modulating Deiters' cell stiffness, which would affect OHC action on basilar membrane movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In facts, AQP6 displays interesting properties, and it is still debated whether its main function is that of an anion channel, a water channel, or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">25</xref>]. Moreover, although originally thought to be only intracellular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">26</xref>], recent data show that AQP6 can bind calmodulin with its N-terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">27</xref>], which is responsible for its subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">26</xref>]. It is therefore possible that stimuli that increase cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (such as purinergic signalling in Deiters' cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">28</xref>]), induce AQP6 traslocation to the plasma membrane, similar to what vasopressin does to AQP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">29</xref>].</p><p> To further explore this role, we treated mice with salicylates, which are known to impair OHC electromotility, and observed variations in the expression of AQP6 after treatment. AQP6 mRNA expression and protein labeling of the organ of Corti are dramatically reduced after treatment with aspirin. The reduction is quite rapid, being evident already at 3&#x02009;hrs after the last day of treatment and reversed 24 hours after treatment has ended. </p><p> These results appear interesting because salicylates are well known for their reversible ototoxic effect but the pathways through which they act are still largely unclear. Since prestin and AQP6 appear to be expressed by different cell types, the link between their modulations may be complex. </p><p> One possible link between OHC block and AQP6 downregulation in Deiters' cells is COX-2. In fact, this enzyme has been found to be involved in the downregulation of AQP2 in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">30</xref>], and is expressed in Deiters' cells, where it is modulated by sound conditioning, possibly through mechanically sensitive pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">31</xref>]. This enzyme could be modulated by salicylates (and by unknown physiological processes) in vestibular epithelia as well (where neither prestin nor motility are present), thus explaining AQP6 downregulation in these organs. Moreover, it is interesting to note the absence of downregulation in small intestine and in the kidney epithelia, suggesting the presence of different modulation mechanisms in different organs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In the present paper, we characterize the expression pattern of AQP6 in the mouse inner ear sensory epithelia. Our data show that AQP6 is expressed in the organ of Corti, and in particular in Deiters' cells. This suggests a possible role for AQP6 in regulating OHC motility, through modulation of water and chloride flow or of Deiters' cell mechanical compliance. To further explore this role, we treated mice with salicylates, which impair OHC electromotility, and observed variations in the expression of AQP6 after treatment. AQP6 mRNA expression and protein labeling of the organ of Corti are dramatically reduced already at 3 hrs after the last day of treatment with aspirin. Similar reduction is observed in vestibular epithelia, but not in control tissues (small intestine and kidney). These results suggest that AQP6 downregulation is not due to motility/prestin-dependent pathways, but may affect OHCs' ionic environment and/or their mechanical response through changes in coupling to the Organ of Corti.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was funded in part by AIT (Associazione Italiana Tinnitus) ONLUS.</p></ack><ref-list><ref

In both the organ of Corti (a), (c) and vestibular epithelia (b), (d), AQP6 labeling was lost or strongly attenuated. In vestibular epithelia of saline treated mice, AQP6 was present, possibly in supporting cells.
