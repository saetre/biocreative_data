Among two APEs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Apn1 provides the major APE activity, and Apn2, the ortholog of the mammalian APE, provides back-up activity. We have cloned <italic>apn1</italic> and <italic>apn2</italic> genes of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, and have shown that inactivation of Apn2 and not Apn1 sensitizes this fission yeast to alkylation and oxidative damage-inducing agents, which is further enhanced by Apn1 inactivation.

ROS are genotoxic and induce a multitude of DNA damage, including oxidized bases, abasic (AP) sites due to direct glycosylic bond cleavage in DNA, and strand breaks caused by fragmentation and oxidation of deoxyribose in the DNA backbone with generation of 3&#x02032;-phosphoglycolaldehyde and 3&#x02032;-phosphoglycolate termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c1">1</xref>). AP sites are also generated as repair intermediates after excision of alkylated and oxidatively damaged bases by DNA glycosylases and are produced due to spontaneous depurination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c3">3</xref>). Oxidized base-specific DNA glycosylases possess intrinsic AP-lyase activity, cleaving the DNA backbone at AP sites and producing 3&#x02032;-phospho-&#x003b1;,&#x003b2; unsaturated aldehyde or 3&#x02032;-phosphates. AP sites, arguably the most abundant endogenous lesions in DNA, have been shown to be cytotoxic and mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c5">5</xref>). Repair of AP sites and single-strand breaks with 3&#x02032;-blocked termini occurs primarily via the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is essential for mammalian survival. Inactivation of some BER proteins including the major AP-endonuclease (APE), DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol&#x003b2;) or XRCC1 protein in the mouse causes embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c6">6</xref>). Repair of AP sites is initiated with an APE which cleaves the DNA strand 5&#x02032; to the AP site and generates 3&#x02032;-OH and 5&#x02032;-phosphodeoxyribose termini. The resulting 5&#x02032;-phosphodeoxyribose group is removed by the lyase activity of Pol&#x003b2; to generate a 1 nt gap. Subsequently, Pol&#x003b2; fills in the gap, and DNA ligase seals the single-strand nick to complete repair &#x0005b;reviewed in Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c7">7</xref>)&#x0005d;. APEs also have intrinsic 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase activity responsible for removing the 3&#x02032;-blocking groups generated at strand breaks caused by either ROS directly or due to AP lyase activity of some DNA glycosylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c8">8</xref>). Two major classes of APEs are present in organisms ranging from the bacteria to mammals whose prototypes are Xth (exonuclease III), representing &#x0223c;90&#x00025; of the total AP repair activity, and Nfo (endonuclease IV) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Apn1, the first APE to be cloned, belongs to the <italic>E.coli</italic> Nfo family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c9">9</xref>), while Apn2 shares homology with <italic>E.coli</italic> Xth and human APE1 and APE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c11">11</xref>). Both Apn2 and Apn1 possess APE and DNA 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c13">13</xref>). However, the <italic>apn1</italic> but not the <italic>apn2</italic> mutant is sensitive to the methylating genotoxicant methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), while the <italic>apn1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant is much more sensitive to MMS than the <italic>apn1</italic>&#x00394; mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c14">14</xref>). These results confirm the earlier conclusion that Apn1 is the major APE in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, and that Apn2 has a back-up role in repair of AP sites in the absence of Apn1.</p><p>Fission and budding yeasts diverged early in evolution and often have distinct functional differences. Phylogenetically, the fission yeast <italic>Schizaosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is generally believed to be closer to mammalian cells than <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, particularly in functions of many regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c16">16</xref>). However, the BER pathway has not been studied in detail. Although the candidate genes for Apn1 and Apn2 were identified in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> genome, and the Apn1 gene was cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c17">17</xref>), the APE activity in the recombinant protein was not shown, presumably because of the presence of an intron in the genomic clone. Although Uve1, a UV photoproduct-specific endonuclease identified in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, but not <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, was shown to possess APE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c18">18</xref>), attempts to demonstrate APE activity in cell-free extracts of <italic>S.pombe</italic> were unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c17">17</xref>). Although Apn2 was identified in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> genome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c11">11</xref>), its repair activity was not shown. Based on these observations, it was suggested that <italic>S.pombe</italic> does not have active APE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c17">17</xref>). We show in this report that <italic>S.pombe</italic> does possess active Apn1 and Apn2 in addition to Uve1. Furthermore, we show a distinct difference in APE activity of the fission and budding types in that, in contrast to the situation in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, Apn2 is the major APE in <italic>S.pombe</italic>. Moreover, the UV photoproduct-specific Uve1, present in <italic>S.pombe</italic> but not in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, provides back-up activity along with Apn1 in repair of AP sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and media</title><p>The genotypes of strains used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh151tb1">1</xref>.

Such binding activates the 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase activity of Apn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c31">31</xref>). Because <italic>S.pombe</italic> and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Apn2 have extensive sequence homology, including the PCNA-binding and TOP3-like motifs, we tested the role of these motifs in MMS resistance of <italic>S.pombe</italic>. We generated alanine substitution mutants at positions 402 and 403 in the PCNA-binding motif, and at positions 456&#x02013;458 included in the TOP3-like motif in the Apn2 expression plasmid.

Thus, even if the binding of PCNA to Apn2 occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, this interaction, unlike in the case of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, does not modulate Apn2 activity in <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>APE activity of recombinant Apn2</title><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> studies described so far strongly suggest that Apn2 is active <italic>in vivo</italic> as an APE and a 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase. We then directly tested recombinant Apn2 for APE activity. We attempted to over-express GST&#x02013;Apn2 and His<sub>6</sub>-Apn2 fusion polypeptides in the <italic>S.pombe apn1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. The recombinant Apn2-His<sub>6</sub> was found to be mostly insoluble (data not shown). Furthermore, overexpression of the GST&#x02013;Apn2 fusion protein appeared to be toxic because the transformed <italic>S.pombe</italic> stopped growing and became elongated (data not shown). Nevertheless, we were able to purify the GST&#x02013;Apn2 fusion polypeptide in soluble form by affinity chromatography from extracts of these cells early after transformation. GST&#x02013;Apn2 showed significant APE activity with THF-containing DNA oligo as described in Materials and Methods. The formation of the predicted 30 nt product indicated that Apn2 catalyzed hydrolysis of DNA 5&#x02032; to the abasic site linearly for up to 1 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh151f6">6</xref>B). There are several possible reasons for very low specific activity of the Apn2 fusion protein. One obvious possibility is that even though present in a soluble form, a large fraction of the protein is not correctly folded, and the folding problem was exacerbated by the presence of the GST.</p></sec><sec><title>AP-endonuclease activity in <italic>S.pombe</italic> extracts</title><p>An earlier report raised the unlikely possibility that APE is absent in <italic>S.pombe</italic> in spite of the presence of <italic>apn</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c17">17</xref>). We examined cell-free extracts of wild-type and mutant <italic>S.pombe</italic> for APE activity. The APE activity was easily detectable in the wild-type cell extract which was stable at 37&#x000b0;C, and maintained linearity up to 20 min to generate the expected cleavage product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh151f7">7</xref>). As expected, the total APE activity was significantly decreased in the <italic>apn1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394; mutant, and the residual activity could be due to Uve1 or other unidentified APEs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Although both <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> have been extensively used as model eukaryotes for elucidating various cellular processes, <italic>S.pombe</italic>, in spite of its closer similarity to human cells, has not been extensively investigated for DNA repair processes. Among various excision repair pathways, BER is involved in repair of endogenous oxidation and alkylation damage in which APE plays a central role. While two APEs in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, Apn1 and Apn2, have been extensively characterized, much less is known about the Apns in <italic>S.pombe</italic>. One major problem in examining <italic>S.pombe apn</italic> genes is the presence of small introns and low efficiency of the cells to splice out these introns, especially in the case of <italic>apn2</italic>.</p><p>Ramotar <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c17">17</xref>) predicted, but did not show experimentally, that the <italic>S.pombe apn1</italic> gene contains a 72 bp intron. We confirmed the absence of this intron in cloned Apn1 cDNA. The Apn1 of <italic>S.pombe</italic> shares 46&#x00025; identical residues with <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Apn1 which accounts for &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of the APE/3&#x02032;-diesterase activity in this yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c11">11</xref>). This is consistent with the observed increase of spontaneous mutations as well as MMS sensitivity when the <italic>APN1</italic> gene was inactivated in the budding yeast. In contrast, deletion of the <italic>apn1</italic> gene in <italic>S.pombe</italic> did not affect its MMS sensitivity. Thus it appears that Apn1 is not the major contributor of APE activity. In our attempts to clone the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Apn2 cDNA, we discovered that due to inefficient splicing, the cDNA library contained mostly copies of Apn2 primary transcripts. This suggests that splicing plays a regulatory role in maintaining the Apn2 protein level. Similar regulation at the splicing level was observed for the <italic>mes1</italic> gene in <italic>S.pombe</italic> whose product is developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c40">40</xref>).</p><p>Deletion of <italic>apn1</italic> and <italic>apn2</italic> genes in <italic>S.pombe</italic> did not affect its growth and viability. Deletion of the <italic>apn2</italic> gene in <italic>S.pombe</italic> caused MMS sensitivity, in contrast to a lack of phenotype of <italic>APN2</italic> mutant in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. Although <italic>apn1</italic>&#x00394; mutation alone did not confer sensitivity to MMS in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, it enhanced MMS sensitivity of the <italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. These results strongly argue for the primary role of Apn2 in the removal of AP sites, and indicate that Apn1 provides the back-up activity in the absence of Apn2 in the fission yeast. An analogous situation was observed in <italic>E.coli</italic> in which <italic>nfo</italic> mutants do not show increased sensitivity to MMS, unlike the <italic>xth</italic> mutant. Xth is the major APE in <italic>E.coli</italic> and Nfo appears to provide the back-up activity. Accordingly, the <italic>nfo/xth</italic> double mutant is more sensitive to alkylating and oxidizing agents than the <italic>xth</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c41">41</xref>). As expected, inactivation of <italic>apn1</italic> and <italic>apn2</italic> did not sensitize the cells to UV (254 nm, 300 J/m<sup>2</sup>) because the BER pathway is not involved in repair of UV-induced pyrimidine photoproducts.</p><p>Structure modeling shows that Uve1 and <italic>E.coli</italic> Nfo have similar secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c42">42</xref>). Even though <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have indicated that Uve1 generates DNA strand breaks at AP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c43">43</xref>), its function in BER was unknown. The present studies provide the first evidence for the ability of Uve1 to repair AP sites <italic>in vivo</italic>. As in the case Apn1, inactivation of Uve1 alone did not confer sensitivity to MMS. However, deletion of the <italic>uve1</italic> gene in the <italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394; mutant significantly increased MMS sensitivity, suggesting that Uve1 functions independently of Apn2 in removal of AP sites to enhance cell survival. A low level of APE activity was detected in the extract of a <italic>apn1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>uve1</italic>&#x00394; triple mutant, suggesting the presence of other unidentified APEs in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (data not shown). Interestingly, the <italic>apn1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>uve1</italic>&#x00394; triple mutant was no more sensitive to MMS than the <italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>uve1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant (unpublished observation). This suggests a common downstream pathway in repair of AP sites initiated by Uve1 and Apn1, which is distinct from the Apn2-initiated process. In any case, Apn2 appears to be the predominant APE in <italic>S.pombe</italic> while both Uve1 and Apn1 provide the back-up functions in BER. However, it should be noted that it was recently shown that the <italic>apn1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> is viable but not in the absence of Rad1/Rad10. This suggests alternative repair of AP sites involving this nucleotide excision repair-specific endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c44">44</xref>). An analogous situation may be present in <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p><p>An earlier attempt to demonstrate APE activity in <italic>S.pombe</italic> extracts was unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c17">17</xref>). Because the present studies predict the presence of APE activity in Apn polypeptides, we have shown directly that the recombinant Apn2 is an authentic APE. We were also able to measure APE activity in <italic>S.pombe</italic> extracts, in contrast to an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c17">17</xref>). Although the reason for the discrepancy between the previous study and our experiments is not clear, it could be due to a difference in extract preparation. While we detected the APE activity in extract produced in a French press, the extract prepared with beating beads was inactive (data not shown). It is likely that Apns are easily inactivated during preparation. More importantly, a significant amount of APE activity in the <italic>apn1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant could be due to Uve1, and other unknown APEs. Thus our results provide the first evidence for APE-dependent BER in the fission yeast, in line with other organisms.</p><p>The <italic>E.coli</italic> Xth family of APEs, including yeast Apn2 and human APE1, share critical active site motifs. A newly discovered human APE, hAPE2, shares significant sequence homology with yeast Apn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c30">30</xref>). Although the recombinant hAPE2 was reported to have very weak APE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c30">30</xref>), we were unable to detect such activity in the recombinant protein purified from insect cells (unpublished experiment). We examined the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of hAPE1 and hAPE2 in a phenotypic complementation assay using the <italic>S.pombe apn1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Expression of hAPE1 in the mutant was indicated by enhanced APE activity in cell-free extract (data not shown), and increased MMS resistance of the mutant. On the other hand, no complementation was observed when hAPE2 was expressed in this mutant strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh151f5">5</xref>A). Thus, while hAPE2 may have some unknown enzymatic activity, it does not appear to function as an APE <italic>in vivo</italic>. The reason for the lack of complementation of the <italic>apn1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394; mutant with <italic>S.pombe</italic> Apn1 is not obvious. However, it is possible that Apn1 does not possess the same level of distinct activities of Apn2 or hAPE1 needed for repair of MMS-induced damage. Furthermore, the low sensitivity of the growth inhibition assay may mask the small extent of complementation with Apn1.</p><p>The C-terminal regions in proteins of the APE2 family contain a consensus sequence for a PCNA-binding motif that was shown to be functional in human APE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh151c29">29</xref>).

In contrast, we found in <italic>S.pombe</italic> that mutation in the putative PCNA-binding and TOP3-type motifs of Apn2 did not affect MMS resistance.
