Plastid nucleoids are believed to be associated with the inner envelope in developing plastids and the thylakoid membranes in mature chloroplasts, but the mechanism for this re-localization is unknown. Here, we present the further characterization of the coiled-coil DNA-binding protein MFP1 as a protein associated with nucleoids and with the thylakoid membranes in mature chloroplasts. MFP1 is located in plastids in both suspension culture cells and leaves and is attached to the thylakoid membranes with its C-terminal DNA-binding domain oriented towards the stroma. It has a major DNA-binding activity in mature <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplasts and binds to all tested chloroplast DNA fragments without detectable sequence specificity. Its expression is tightly correlated with the accumulation of thylakoid membranes. Importantly, it is associated <italic>in vivo</italic> with nucleoids, suggesting a function for MFP1 at the interface between chloroplast nucleoids and the developing thylakoid membrane system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA-binding and membrane-anchoring proteins play an important role in condensation and spatial organization of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. In the eukaryotic nucleus, chromosome condensation is mainly achieved by binding of histones and HMG proteins to DNA. Interactions of chromatin with nuclear envelope-associated proteins and possibly an internal nuclear matrix provide spatial organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c1">1</xref>). In bacteria, histone-like HU proteins are involved in chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c3">3</xref>), and association with the plasma membrane provides a spatial anchor for the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c4">4</xref>). In mitochondria, the HMG-like protein Abf2p is involved in chromosome stability and packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c5">5</xref>). The mitochondrial inner membrane protein Yhm2p binds DNA and is associated with mitochondrial nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c6">6</xref>), indicative of a spatial organization of the mitochondrial chromosome via membrane attachment too.</p><p>By comparison, little is known about the packaging and spatial organization of chloroplast genomes. Plastid DNA, like bacterial and mitochondrial DNA, is organized into protein&#x02013;DNA complexes termed nucleoids. An HU-like protein with DNA-compacting activity has been found in the red algae <italic>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</italic> but no homolog of this protein seems to be present in higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c7">7</xref>). Resolving the protein pattern of higher-plant chloroplast nucleoids typically shows 20&#x02013;50 prominent proteins, only few of which have been identified. They include CND41 from tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c8">8</xref>), PEND from pea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c9">9</xref>) and DPC68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c11">11</xref>) recently shown to be ferredoxin:: sulfite reductase (SiR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c13">13</xref>).</p><p>In analogy to prokaryotic and mitochondrial genomes, microscopic evidence supports the association of nucleoids with chloroplast membranes. In red algae, nucleoids are found in the chloroplast center, surrounded by thylakoids. In brown algae, a large, ring-shaped nucleoid is found within a thylakoid lamella located parallel to and just beneath the chloroplast envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c7">7</xref>). In higher plants, the distribution of nucleoids changes during plastid development. In the pea proplastid, a single small nucleoid is located at the center of the plastid. Nucleoids in developing plastids are localized close to the plastid envelope. Finally, in mature chloroplasts, they are located at the center of the chloroplast, in close vicinity to the thylakoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c14">14</xref>). A similar pattern of reorganization has also been shown for wheat chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c15">15</xref>). Liu and Rose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c16">16</xref>) have shown that nucleoids co-fractionate with the thylakoids and that a region of the chloroplast DNA is bound to the thylakoids.</p><p>The PEND protein is a candidate for anchoring nucleoids to the inner plastid envelope at early stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c9">9</xref>). PEND is an unusual bZIP protein that binds to plastid DNA in a sequence-specific manner and is associated with the inner envelope membrane. Its expression correlates with the early stage of plastid development at which the nucleoids are found associated with the plastid envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c17">17</xref>). In contrast, no information exists about possible DNA-binding proteins associated with the thylakoid membranes and expressed in fully developed chloroplasts.</p><p>We have previously identified the nuclear-encoded protein MFP1 in tomato by its ability to bind to matrix attachment region DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c18">18</xref>). MFP1 is a large coiled-coil protein with a C-terminal DNA-binding domain and a predicted N-terminal transmembrane domain. It was shown to be associated with globular structures of unknown identity at the nuclear rim of tobacco suspension culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c19">19</xref>). We show here that the MFP1-containing structures are the proplastids of tobacco suspension culture cells, which can be tightly associated with the nuclear envelope. MFP1 is targeted to plastids both in suspension culture cells and in leaves and is located in the thylakoid membranes, with the C-terminal DNA-binding domain oriented towards the stroma. MFP1 has a major DNA-binding activity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplasts and binds to several regions of the chloroplast DNA with equal affinity. Its expression is tightly correlated with the accumulation of thylakoid membranes, and it is <italic>in vivo</italic> associated with nucleoids. These findings present MFP1 as the first candidate for a protein involved in anchoring nucleoids to the thylakoid membrane system in fully developed chloroplasts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Prediction programs</title><p>For chloroplast transit peptide prediction, the programs ChloroP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c20">20</xref>), TargetP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c21">21</xref>) and PSORT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c22">22</xref>) were used.

It remains associated with the membrane fraction after treatment with either 1 M NaCl or 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, pH 11.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f2">2</xref>E), which dissociate peripheral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c44">44</xref>).</p><p>Most proteins containing the RR motif are imported into the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c46">46</xref>). However, plastid fusion&#x0002f;protein translocation factor (Pftf), which is inserted into the thylakoid membrane via an N-terminal transmembrane domain with the C-terminus oriented towards the stroma, contains the RR motif and utilizes the &#x00394;pH-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c47">47</xref>). To determine if MFP1 has the same topology, thermolysin proteolysis in the absence or presence of Triton X-100 was performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f3">3</xref>). Proteins on the stroma side are degradable under both conditions, while lumen proteins will only be accessible to thermolysin after Triton X-100 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c48">48</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f3">3</xref> shows that MFP1 is accessible to thermolysin in the absence of Triton X-100, while lumenal OEC33 is only minutely degraded under the same conditions.</p><p>Together, these data indicate that MFP1 is imported into chloroplasts and associated with thylakoid membranes. The major portion of the protein is present on the stroma side and accessible to proteases. This is consistent with a topology where the N-terminal transmembrane domain of the processed protein is inserted into the thylakoid membrane and the C-terminal DNA-binding domain is facing the stroma.</p></sec><sec><title>MFP1 expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is tissue specific and light regulated</title><p>The anti-AtMFP1 antibody OSU91 recognized a single band of 82 kDa in light- and dark-grown <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f4">4</xref>A). AtMFP1 accumulates to high levels in shoots of light-grown seedling. A significantly lower amount of protein was detected in roots of both light- and dark-grown seedlings, and an intermediate amount in dark-grown shoots. RNA blot analysis indicated that protein abundance is primarily regulated at the RNA level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f4">4</xref>B).</p><p><italic>AtMFP1</italic> is a single gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (AT3G16000), with a predicted 540 bp of non-coding sequence upstream of the ATG and downstream of the next, divergently oriented open reading frame (ORF) (AT3G16010). Analyzing this putative promoter region for <italic>cis</italic>-elements involved in light-activation of plant gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c49">49</xref>), two G-boxes, one I-box and three additional GATA elements were found close to and upstream of the predicted CAAT and TATA boxes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f4">4</xref>C).

Seven-day-old dark-grown seedlings were placed into light, and were assayed at different time points for AtMFP1 abundance in total shoot protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f5">5</xref>A). AtMFP1 accumulation was first observed after 9 h and reached the level of light-grown seedlings after 3 days. This paralleled the accumulation of the large subunit of Rubisco (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f5">5</xref>A) and the visually observed greening of the cotyledons (data not shown).</p><p>To test if MFP1 accumulation also correlates with the presence of photosynthetic membranes in a different system, we investigated its abundance during tomato fruit development. Young, green tomato fruits contain chloroplasts that are similar to leaf chloroplasts. During fruit ripening, the photosynthetic membranes break down and the chromoplasts accumulate carotenoids and lycopene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c52">52</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f5">5</xref>B shows that LeMFP1 accumulation remains constant until the onset of ripening, when the protein level begins to decline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f5">5</xref>B, lane 4). Subsequently, it drops to an undetectable level coincident with the transition from chloroplasts to chromoplasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f5">5</xref>B, lane 5). Therefore, MFP1 abundance not only matches the abundance of photosynthetic membranes during greening, but also during their degradation in fruit development.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA-binding activity of AtMFP1</title><p>We tested the DNA-binding activity of endogenous, chloroplast-localized and recombinant AtMFP1. Chloroplasts were isolated from rosette leaves of wild-type plants and a T-DNA insertion line (see Materials and Methods). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f6">6</xref>A shows the protein profile of the two chloroplast preparations. MFP1 is detected in an immunoblot in wild-type, but not the T-DNA insertion line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f6">6</xref>B). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f6">6</xref>C shows a &#x02018;South-western&#x02019; DNA-binding experiment with a <italic>Drosophila</italic> MAR (which had been previously shown to bind recombinant LeMFP1) in the presence of sheared herring-sperm DNA as competitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c18">18</xref>). The data show a DNA-binding activity of 82 kDa, the size of AtMFP1, which is present in wild-type but not in the T-DNA insertion line. A second, minor DNA-binding activity of &#x0223c;70 kDa was detected, which was not influenced by the T-DNA insertion. Its size would be consistent with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> sulfite reductase (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f7">7</xref>).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f6">6</xref>D shows that recombinant &#x00394;144AtMFP1 binds <italic>in vitro</italic> with comparable affinity to six DNA fragments of similar size and different AT content in the presence of sheared herring sperm DNA as competitor. In contrast, binding was significantly weaker when the probes were denatured. Approximately equal binding was also observed when three restriction-digested BAC clones (which together represent the complete <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplast genome) were used separately as probes in &#x02018;South-western&#x02019; blots with recombinant &#x00394;144AtMFP1 (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that AtMFP1 is a prominent DNA-binding protein in mature <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplasts and that it binds to different double-stranded DNA fragments without detectable sequence specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>MFP1 is associated with chloroplast nucleoids</title><p>To investigate if MFP1 is associated with nucleoids in mature chloroplasts, we purified nucleoids and probed in an immunoblot for the presence of MFP1. A nucleoid fraction was isolated from tobacco chloroplasts and confirmed by DAPI staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f7">7</xref>A). In addition, nucleoid DNA was probed in a dot-blot experiment for the presence of five regions of the chloroplast genome. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f7">7</xref>B shows that the signals were comparable with those obtained with total chloroplast DNA, confirming the presence of the chloroplast genome in the nucleoid fraction.</p><p>The immunoblots in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f7">7</xref>C follow the abundance of four chloroplast proteins during nucleoid fractionation. OEC33 and Cytochrome f were present in the total chloroplast extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f7">7</xref>C, lane Chl) and the 48 000 <italic>g</italic> supernatant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f7">7</xref>C, lane S1), but not in the concentrated wash (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f7">7</xref>C, lane S2) or the final nucleoid pellet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f7">7</xref>C, lane Nc). This controls for the absence of non-specific thylakoid proteins in the nucleoid fraction. In contrast, ferredoxin::sulfite reductase&#x0002f;DPC68 (SiR), a major component of purified chloroplast nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c13">13</xref>), was enriched in the nucleoid fraction. Like SiR, MFP1 co-fractionated with the 48 000 <italic>g</italic> pellet, indicating a direct physical interaction of MFP1 with nucleoids in mature leaf chloroplasts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>MFP1 was originally identified as a DNA-binding protein with affinity for matrix attachment regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c18">18</xref>) and was subsequently shown to be associated with nuclei and the nuclear matrix in tobacco suspension culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c19">19</xref>). We have demonstrated here that the primary location of MFP1 in both suspension culture cells and in plants is in plastids and associated with the thylakoid membranes. MFP1 can also be clearly identified in nuclei and the nuclear matrix and a convincing NLS is predicted at the C-terminus of MFP1 from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, tomato and tobacco. At present, we cannot rule out that there is a second fraction of MFP1 which is associated with the nuclear matrix and which might correspond to the onion MFP1-like protein found in discrete locations in the nuclear matrix, which resemble replication factories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c54">54</xref>). However, the MFP1&#x02013;GFP signal that we have found in speckles at the nuclear rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c19">19</xref>), corresponds to proplastids associated with the nucleus in tobacco suspension cultured cells. Further work at the electron microscopy level using intact tissue sections could address if there is a separate pool of intranuclear MFP1. A precedence for a protein with such a dual cellular address is the yeast inner nuclear envelope protein Trm1p, which is also located in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c55">55</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, the nuclear portion of MFP1 might be due to a contamination of this fraction with plastid material. The close association of plastids with the nuclear rim and cases of embedded plastids into nuclear material shown here might lead to a co-fractionation of insoluble plastid material with the nuclear matrix fraction from suspension culture cells. It should be pointed out that the isolation procedures widely used to prepare the nuclear matrix from plants were originally developed for animal cells, which do not contain plastids.</p><sec><title>MFP1 has the features of an unusual TAT pathway target</title><p>Analysis of the N-terminal sequence of AtMFP1 indicated that the protein contains a chloroplast transit peptide, a hydrophobic signal peptide, and a hydrophobic membrane anchor. The signal peptide is of the twin arginine type, indicative of a substrate of the &#x00394;pH-dependent or TAT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c46">46</xref>). While most substrates of this pathway known to date enter the thylakoid lumen, there are two examples of thylakoid membrane-anchored proteins, which are TAT-pathway substrates, Pftf and the Rieske Fe&#x0002f;S protein, which utilizes the TAT pathway, but lacks the twin-arginine motif and a cleavable signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c56">56</xref>). Our data are consistent with MFP1 being inserted into the thylakoid membrane with a short N-terminal domain located in the lumen and the long coiled-coil domain located in the stroma. This would require the second hydrophobic domain to act as a transmembrane domain. Its length of 20 amino acids is sufficient and the resistance of MFP1 to the extraction with 1 M NaCl indicates its integral association with the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c47">47</xref>). The TAT pathway might therefore function for more membrane associated, stroma-exposed proteins than previously expected.</p></sec><sec><title>MFP1 is associated with both nucleoids and thylakoid membranes in mature leaf chloroplasts</title><p>For more than 30 years, there have been indications that in mature chloroplasts DNA is associated with thylakoid membranes. Woodcock and Fernandez-Moran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c57">57</xref>) noticed in their electron microscopy studies of spinach chloroplast DNA that the DNA fibers are frequently associated with and extrude from the grana lamella. Lindbeck and Rose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c58">58</xref>) demonstrated that chloroplast DNA is associated with thylakoid vesicles. Liu and Rose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c16">16</xref>) identified a region of the chloroplast genome that remains bound to thylakoid membrane vesicles after restriction digestion. Cytological studies in wheat and pea showed a developmental re-localization of nucleoids from the plastid periphery to the interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c59">59</xref>). While all these studies indicated an association of nucleoids with the thylakoids in mature chloroplast, the molecular nature of this interaction has not been understood.</p><p>We have shown here that MFP1 is associated with thylakoid membranes, with the coiled-coil DNA-binding domain of the protein located on the stroma surface and that it has a major DNA-binding activity in mature <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplasts. Most importantly, MFP1 is <italic>in vivo</italic> associated with nucleoids similar to SiR&#x0002f;DCP68, a known component of chloroplast nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c12">12</xref>). This suggests that MFP1 is acting at the interface between nucleoids and the thylakoid membranes in mature chloroplasts. The expression pattern of MFP1 is tightly correlated with the accumulation of photosynthetic membranes and reciprocal to that of PEND, the other known membrane-associated DNA-binding protein in chloroplasts. This is consistent with a model in which nucleoids are associated with the plastid envelope at the early stages of plastid development when PEND is expressed, and relocate to the thylakoids in mature chloroplasts, when PEND is absent but MFP1 is abundant. We did not find a difference, however, in the pattern of DAPI-stained nucleoids associated with isolated thylakoids from wild-type and MFP1 knock-out <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants. In addition, we found no significant difference in abundance of SiR in the two thylakoid fractions (data not shown). This might be due to functional redundancy among MFP1-like chloroplast proteins or point to a function of MFP1 other than physical association (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>MFP1 is a unique long coiled-coil protein from plants</title><p>Proteins with extended coiled-coil domains have been mostly described in animals and yeast, where many of them function as structural proteins. The most prominent example of DNA-binding coiled-coil proteins are the nuclear lamins, which are involved in connecting chromatin with the inner nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c1">1</xref>). While no canonical nuclear lamins appear to exist in plants, MFP1 is somewhat similar to this protein class in being a long coiled-coil protein that is anchored to membranes and binds DNA. Sato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c60">60</xref>) suggests that during evolution the plastid genetic machinery has sequentially lost many of the original &#x02018;prokaryotic&#x02019; DNA-organizing proteins, such as HUs, and has instead acquired nuclear &#x02018;eukaryotic&#x02019; types of proteins. The bZIP protein PEND with its similarity to nuclear transcription factors is an example of the latter class. While MFP1 is structurally similar to &#x02018;eukaryotic&#x02019; long coiled-coil proteins, no homologs have been found in the fully sequenced genomes of <italic>Cynechocystis</italic> and <italic>Nostoc</italic> (data not shown). MFP1 therefore appears to be another example in favor of Sato&#x02019;s hypothesis of discontinuous evolution of the plastid &#x02018;chromatin&#x02019; by incorporation of nuclear proteins.</p><p>We asked whether other chloroplast-located long coiled-coil proteins are encoded by the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. In a computational screen of the translated genome with the algorithm MultiCoil and subsequent search for putative targeting signals, we found six additional predicted chloroplast proteins with a coiled-coil domain similar in length and type to that of MFP1. They can be grouped into two families of homologous sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg693f8">8</xref>). The coiled-coil domains of MFP1 and both families are rich in glutamic acid residues and show weak similarity to the coiled-coil segments of mammalian and prokaryotic SMC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c62">62</xref>). However, in contrast to MFP1, no thylakoid targeting signals and transmembrane domains were predicted for these proteins. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, MFP1 is therefore unique in its combination of domains.</p><p>Interestingly, a short coiled-coil DNA-binding, plastid-localized protein has been recently described in the resurrection plant <italic>Craterostigma plantagineum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c63">63</xref>). CpPTP is a 200 amino acid protein with an N-terminal chloroplast import signal and a C-terminal approximately 100 amino acids long coiled-coil domain, which non-specifically binds DNA. CpPTP is induced by drought and not detectable in unstressed plants. It has no homolog in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. Interestingly, a CpPTP&#x02013;GFP fusion protein localizes in a spot-like pattern in tobacco chloroplasts, very similar to MFP1. While the function of CpPTP is presently not known, the authors propose a structural role in protecting chloroplast DNA from dehydration. If this is confirmed, it will be worth investigating whether CpPTP in <italic>C.plantagineum</italic> functions by replacing DNA-binding, coiled-coil proteins such as MFP1 under extreme drought stress, and whether this mechanism is absent from desiccation-sensitive plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>What are the function and selective advantage of nucleoid&#x02013;thylakoid association?</title><p>The MFP1 T-DNA insertion line described here has no detectable protein accumulation, but shows no visible phenotype under standard laboratory conditions (data not shown). It is therefore possible that the MFP1-like coiled-coil proteins provide functional redundancy despite the lack of true sequence homologs of MFP1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In addition, there are several possible scenarios for the function of MFP1, the disruption of which would lead to no drastic phenotypes. For example, the expression of several chloroplast genes coding for PSI and PSII subunits is fine-tuned by the redox state of plastoquinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c66">66</xref>). It is possible that the presently unknown signal transduction chain leading to this regulation is facilitated by a short physical distance between the chloroplast gene expression machinery and the photosynthetic membranes and that MFP1 is involved in providing this connection. Alternatively (or additionally), MFP1 might be involved in facilitating the co-translational membrane insertion and assembly of thylakoid proteins such as the D1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c67">67</xref>) and Cytochrome f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg693c33">33</xref>) by contributing to short distances between transcription, translation and protein insertion.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg693f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Localization of LeMFP1 in BY-2 plastids.
