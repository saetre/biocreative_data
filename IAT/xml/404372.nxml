The major difference between mitochondrial and peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidations is their substrate specificity: mitochondria mainly oxidize short, medium, and most long chain fatty acids, while peroxisomes preferentially oxidize very long chain fatty acids and branched-chain fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>In rodents, two distinct peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation pathways are found to metabolize either straight-chain fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or branched-chain fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Each pathway contains its own enzymes encoded by different genes. Straight-chain fatty acyl-CoAs are catabolized by fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX), peroxisomal L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydratase/L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (bifunctional enzyme: L-PBE) and peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (PTL). The enzymes involved in the branched-chain fatty acids pathway include branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, peroxisomal D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydratase/D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (bifunctional enzyme: D-PBE) and sterol carrier protein 2/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (SCP2 /thiolase) also named sterol carrier protein x (SCPx). Humans differ since both very long chain and branched-fatty acids are degraded by D-PBE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. L-PBE might not be required for these degradations. Very long chain fatty acids seem to be degraded by PTL as well as by SCPx.</p><p>Administration of peroxisome proliferators to rodents results in peroxisomal proliferation and induction of the three peroxisomal enzymes involved in the straight-chain fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation i.e. AOX, L-PBE and PTL. In rat liver, the level of these enzymes can be over 20 times as high after treatment with di-(2-ethyl-hexyl)phthalate, a peroxisome proliferator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In contrast, a weak induction of the enzymes of the peroxisomal branched-chain fatty acids system is observed after treatment with clofibrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In the rat, peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activity is encoded by two distinct genes: <italic>thiolase A </italic>and <italic>thiolase B </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The aim of this study was to clone the mouse <italic>thiolase </italic>genes in order to study the tissue expression and associated enzymatic activity. This work will lead to further study of the regulation of their corresponding transcripts, the functionality of the thiolase promoters and the identification of the response elements implicated in their regulation.</p><p>We cloned and characterized two mouse peroxisomal <italic>3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase </italic>genes and their corresponding cDNAs. The tissue distribution of their corresponding transcripts is described in mice: <italic>peroxisomal thiolase A </italic>and <italic>B </italic>transcripts are mainly expressed in liver [preliminary results, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]]. With the aim of following gene expression main steps, this study was undertaken at the mRNA and enzymatic levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Cloning of two mouse peroxisomal thiolase genes</title><p>Genomic DNA extracted from 129SV mouse was digested by different restriction enzymes and analyzed by Southern blotting (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). The membrane was hybridized with an exon 9 rat thiolase probe common to both A and B isoforms. Each genomic DNA digestion revealed two distinct bands suggesting the existence of two mouse <italic>thiolase </italic>genes. By screening a 129SV mouse genomic DNA library, two distinct sets of clones were identified corresponding to the two different mouse <italic>thiolase </italic>genes. These clones were sequenced and named <italic>mThA </italic>(for mouse <italic>Thiolase A</italic>) and <italic>mThB </italic>(for mouse <italic>Thiolase B</italic>) according to their analogies with their rat counterparts. By comparing these sequences with the database, we identified a genomic clone containing all of the mouse <italic>thiolase B </italic>gene under the accession no AC055818 (Genbank). In this clone, <italic>thiolase B </italic>gene spans from position 72906 (position for the +1 transcription initiation site determined below) to position 81956 (position for the polyA site determined by cloning cDNA, see below). For the <italic>thiolase A </italic>gene, no complete sequence was found in database and therefore, we completely sequenced our genomic clone and deposited it under GenBank accession no AY304542.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cloning of the two mouse peroxisomal <italic>thiolase </italic>genes and determination of the transcription initiation sites of each gene</bold>. a) Southern blot of a 129SV mouse genomic DNA digested with different restriction enzymes.

Thiolase A and B probes were obtained by PCR (as indicated in Methods) with the oligonucleotides indicated by arrows on figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, respectively. These probes (678 nt for mThA and 521 nt for mThB) extended from the end of exon I (167 nt downstream the ATG codon for the mThA and mThB probes) to 409 nt and 251 nt upstream the ATG initiation codon for <italic>thiolase A </italic>and <italic>B </italic>genes, respectively. The transcription start sites were determined with liver RNA extracted from mice. The thiolase A probe protected three fragments of 388 nt, 398 nt and 431 nt (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, lane 1) allowing to localize three transcription initiation sites indicated by dots on figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>.

For thiolase B, five fragments were protected: 267 nt, 270 nt, 284 nt, 288 nt and 298 nt (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, lane 6). The 267 nt-protected fragment was considered as the major transcription initiation site and designed as +1 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).

Then, these proteins were cleaved into two mature forms of 398 aa (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

For example, the three thiolase signature patterns were found (framed in dotted lines on the sequences in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>): two of which were based on the regions around the cysteine residues (Cys123, Cys408) which are essential for the catalytic function and the third was based on a highly conserved region in the C-terminal part of these proteins containing histidine 377 also involved in the catalytic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The putative Peroxisomal Target Signal (PTS 2) was also identified in the N-terminal region of the protein. This signal is characteristic of peroxisomal thiolase and is cleaved after the import of the protein in peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], which results in a mature protein of 398 aa. At the 3' ends of the cDNAs, the stop codon and the putative polyadenylation signal AGTAAA were identified (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In this 3' region, downstream of the stop codon, the two <italic>thiolase </italic>cDNAs were very different (55% identity on a 136 nt stretch), which allowed us to prepare probes specific to each <italic>thiolase </italic>cDNA (underlined sequences, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

The high expression of thiolase A and B mRNAs in the liver may be closely related to larger peroxisome volume in this organ, a major site of peroxisomal lipid oxidation. The smaller thiolase mRNA contents in kidney, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and heart compared to liver were in concordance with what was observed in these same tissues for the mouse acyl CoA oxidase gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the thiolase mRNA level is low in brain whereas N&#x000f6;hammer et al.

Even if the peroxisomal oxidation enzymes are lower expressed in brain compared to liver ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], this work), their presence is essential for metabolism of specific lipids such as docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) and very long chain fatty acids. Moreover, Janssen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] described that neuronal migration alteration in Pex5 knock out mice could be significantly corrected by a partial reconstitution of peroxisomal function in liver suggesting that hepatic peroxisomal metabolism defect could affect the normal neuronal development.

In order to evaluate if this differential gene regulation by peroxisome proliferators occurs also in mouse, we compared the ratio of the mThA and the mThB mRNAs between mice treated or not with fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>, mThB mRNA level was increased more than ten-fold whereas mThA mRNA level was increased two-fold.

Because of the presence of distinct thiolases both in mitochondria and peroxisomes, we used the indirect method of Miyazawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] to specifically determine peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase A+B activities. It consists in the measurement of thiolase activities before and after an immunodepletion with an antibody directed against both thiolase A and thiolase B proteins. Since no substrate specificity has been described to distinguish between rat thiolase A and B activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], differentiating their activities in the mouse was not feasible. Therefore, thiolase activities were measured by using 3-keto-octanoyl-CoA as substrate, as previously described by Miyazawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>To verify the complete immunodepletion of peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase from the homogenate, samples of the homogenate before and after immunodepletion were separated on a polyacrylamide gel and analysed by Western blotting. Membranes were incubated with an anti-peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase antibody (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>, lane a) and after stripping, membranes were reprobed with an anti-mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase antibody (T1) to verify the specificity of the immunodepletion (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>, lane b). Peroxisomal thiolase A+B proteins were totally absent from the homogenate after immunodepletion with 5 &#x003bc;l and 10 &#x003bc;l of anti-PTL antibody (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>, lane a). Under these conditions, the amount of mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase was not affected by the immunodepletion showing the specificity of this technique (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>, lane b). Once these verifications were done, the peroxisomal thiolase activity was measured in the four tissues showing the strongest <italic>thiolase </italic>mRNA levels (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Thiolase A+B activities were detected in liver, kidney, intestine and white adipose tissue. No significant differences were observed between liver and the other three tissues. Discrepancies between enzymatic activity and mRNA level have already been described for some enzymes, particularly under treatment conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, under our conditions, thiolase activities resulted from measurement of both thiolase A and B activities. As described in the rat, the two enzymes could have different stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or the two thiolase mRNAs could be differently translated. Thus, differences observed between thiolase A and B protein and mRNA levels may more likely reflect the inability to discriminate between thiolase A and thiolase B activities.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Tissue distribution of mouse peroxisomal <italic>3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase </italic>A+B activities. </bold>a) Sample immunodepletion with antibody anti-peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase A and B proteins (anti-PTL).

After membrane saturation at room temperature for 1 h 30 with TBS (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH8.0, 0.15 M NaCl) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1% (w/v) BSA, blots were incubated in the same solution for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed againt thiolase A and thiolase B proteins (PTL, diluted to 1:15000) or directed against mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (T1, diluted to 1:30000). After three washes in TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, primary antibody was detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:30000). The bands labelled with the antibodies were visualized using a Western blotting Chemiluminescence luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by exposure to X-ray films (Amersham). Membranes were stripped for 15 min at room temperature in a Restore buffer (Pierce, Montlu&#x000e7;on, France) and four washes in TBS were performed before new hybridization.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme activity assays</title><p>The 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activities were determined at 25&#x000b0;C by measuring the absorbance decrease at 303 nm due to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-enolate cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The reaction mixture (500 &#x003bc;l) contained: 5 &#x003bc;g of protein homogenate (with or without immunodepletion), 100 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 10 &#x003bc;M 3-keto-octanoyl-CoA (a generous gift of Dr. T. Hashimoto and Dr. N. Usuda, Shinshu University School of Medecine, Japan). The enzymatic reaction was activated by adding Coenzyme A at a final concentration of 100 &#x003bc;M (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO). Under these assay conditions, the molar absorption coefficient was determined by the method of Staack et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]: 3-keto-octanoyl-CoA, 14400 M.cm<sup>-1</sup>. Thiolase A+B activities were measured on homogenates before and after immunodepletion. Peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase A+B activity was calculated as the difference between these two determinations. Units of thiolase activities are expressed as nmol of substrate utilized per mg of total protein per min. The results are expressed as means &#x000b1; S.E.M.
