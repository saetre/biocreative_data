Individual rhombomeres are polyclonal compartments, defined both by cell-lineage-restriction and by segmental expression of transcription factors, such as <italic>Krox20</italic>, <italic>Kreisler </italic>and members of the <italic>Hox </italic>gene family. This network of genes regulates the formation of specific rhombomeres and their identities along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The morphological and molecular segmentation of the hindbrain is essential for the establishment of specific patterns of neuronal differentiation and axon outgrowth and for the formation of distinct streams of migratory neural crest cells, implicated in the subsequent generation of neuronal networks and craniofacial structures (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]).</p><p>Concurrent with the establishment of hindbrain rhombomeres, a specialized population of boundary cells forms at their interfaces. A series of studies have characterized these cells, demonstrating that boundary cells have an elongated shape, increased extracellular spaces containing matrix components and that they display a reduced proliferation rate and interkinetic nuclear migration compared to intra-rhombomeric cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Much less is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate their formation or what the functions of boundary cells are during hindbrain development.</p><p>The signaling system of Eph tyrosine kinase receptors and their membrane-bound ephrin ligands have been shown to be required for boundary cell formation in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Eph receptors and ephrins are largely expressed in alternate rhombomeres such that they interact at their interfaces, and this restricts cells from mixing across hindbrain segments, possibly by mediating cell repulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, EphA4 was shown to sharpen hindbrain boundaries by regulating cell affinity within rhombomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Importantly, knocking down Eph/ephrin proteins or inhibition of their activation also leads to a decrease or loss of the expression of several boundary cell markers, such as <italic>pax6 </italic>and <italic>sema3Gb</italic>, in the zebrafish hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These results indicate a requirement for this signaling system in boundary cell formation, although it is not known if this is due to a direct role in cell specification or secondary to the increased mixing between segments. Whether Eph-ephrin interactions are also required for hindbrain boundary formation in higher vertebrates is not known.</p><p>Several soluble signals were shown to be localized to boundary cells of different species. For instance,<italic>Wnt1 </italic>and <italic>Wnt3a </italic>are expressed in zebrafish hindbrain boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], while fibroblast growth factor 3 (<italic>FGF3</italic>) and <italic>FGF19 </italic>are confined to mouse and chick hindbrain boundary cells, from around E10/Hamburger Hamilton stage 16, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Some modulators or inhibitors of signaling systems, such as the TGF&#x003b2; inhibitor follistatin and the Notch modulator radical fringe also accumulate at hindbrain boundaries of chick, mouse or zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Little is known regarding the function of these factors at rhombomere interfaces. Interestingly, before boundary cells are formed, several of these signals, such as <italic>FGF3 </italic>and <italic>follistatin</italic>, have segmental expression within specific rhombomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The significance of these dynamic spatio-temporal expression patterns as well as the regulatory mechanisms by which these signals are turned on and off in different hindbrain regions are not clear.</p><p>In this study we set out to determine whether signaling by EphA4 is required for boundary cell formation in the chick hindbrain. We found that boundary cell markers and the formation of sharp interfaces were lost upon overexpression of dominant negative EphA4. Unexpectedly, we found that the segmental expression of the boundary cell marker <italic>FGF3 </italic>persisted, raising the possibility that lack of boundary cells may underlie the failure of rhombomeric <italic>FGF3 </italic>to become downregulated. The effect of ablation of boundary cells or blockage of the contact between a rhombomere and one of its boundaries confirmed this possibility. These findings suggest a new role for hindbrain boundary cells in inducing downregulation of the segmental expression of <italic>FGF3 </italic>in rhombomeres.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Eggs</title><p>Fertile Loman chick eggs were incubated at 38&#x000b0;C until embryos reached the desired somite-stage (ss).

We set out to investigate whether EphA4 has a similar role in the chick hindbrain by taking a similar approach. We cloned truncated mouse EphA4 into pCAGGS plasmid upstream to an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and a GFP coding sequence to visualize its expression in the transfected cells. First, we assessed the expression level of the construct by electroporating it into the hindbrain of 6&#x02013;8 ss chick embryos. High levels of GFP were found a day later in the electroporated cells which corresponded to dnEphA4 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), similar to the expression of control GFP vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Next, the ability of the dnEphA4 expressing cells to bind ephrin ligands was assessed by performing an <italic>in situ </italic>binding assay of a soluble ephrinA5-Fc chimeric protein to the dnEphA4 expressing cells. Strong levels of ephrinA5-Fc binding were found in ectopic locations in the dnEphA4 electroporated side of the hindbrain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), in addition to r3 and r5 where endogenous Eph receptors are expressed, as seen in control electroporated embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Together, these results verify that truncated EphA4 is efficiently expressed and capable of binding its ligands in the chick hindbrain.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of truncated EphA4 on rhombomeres</bold>.

In control electroporations, there was an expected r3 and r5 expression of <italic>Krox20 </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> n = 12) and of EphA4 protein, which was detected with an antibody against the intracellular domain that binds the endogenous EphA4 but not the truncated ectopic protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref> n = 12). In contrast, there was a disruption to the formation of sharp borders on the electroporated side of embryos transfected with dnEphA4, with <italic>Krox20 </italic>and EphA4 expressing cells extending from their normal r3/r5 expression domains in the electroporated side into the adjacent r2, r4 or r6 territories (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F, G, I, J</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>; n = 12 for Krox20, n = 12 for EphA4). Notably, the data shows variability between embryos in the severity of the effects and in which segment(s) ectopic cells with <italic>Krox20 </italic>or EphA4 expression are observed in. This variability may be due to differences in electroporation efficiencies, intrinsic variability in cell mixing, and whether or not ectopic cells have switched their identity at the time of analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that EphA4 signaling is required to restrict cell mixing between r3/r5 and adjacent segments in the chick hindbrain, consistent with previous reports in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Disruption of boundary cells in embryos expressing truncated EphA4</title><p>The disruption in sharp segmental borders raised the possibility that the formation of boundary cells at rhombomere interfaces is disturbed upon expression of truncated EphA4 receptor. To examine this, we analyzed the expression of several markers of chick hindbrain boundary cells. The extracellular matrix protein, chondroitin-sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG), accumulates at high levels at rhombomere boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] in control electroporations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> n = 10) and in the control side of dnEphA4-electroporated hindbrains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, F</xref> right hand side). In contrast, accumulation of CSPG at boundaries is largely disrupted upon expression of dnEphA4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> n = 10). Double staining with EphA4 and CSPG antibodies in another set of electroporated embryos confirmed that dnEphA4 transfection leads to disorganisation or loss of rhombomere boundaries together with distortion in the shape of rhombomeres on the electroporated side (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, F, H</xref> n = 6), compared to the non-electroporated side (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, F, H</xref> right hand side) and control embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, E, G</xref> n = 6). Notably, in several embryos, r4 and its flanking boundaries are less affected by truncated EphA4 than other boundaries (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, F</xref> and also see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E&#x02013;J</xref>). A similar differential effect occurs following EphA4 knockdown in zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which can be explained by the presence of Eph receptors in addition to EphA4 in r3/r5 that are activated by ephrins in r4, such that r4 boundaries are more resistant to decreased EphA4 function than other boundaries; further analysis will be required to determine whether a similar explanation holds in chick.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Disruption of boundary cells in embryos expressing truncated EphA4</bold>.

Both markers are expressed in a specific DV-restricted pattern along the hindbrain as well as in higher levels at rhombomere interfaces. We found that there is normal expression of both genes in control embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I, J</xref> n = 8 for each) and the non-electroporated side of embryos transfected with dnEphA4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K, L</xref> right hand side n = 9 for each). In contrast, the elevated expression levels of <italic>pax6 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref> n = 9) and of <italic>NSCL1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L</xref> n = 9) at rhombomere borders decrease following overexpression of dnEphA4, whereas their DV-restricted expression within hindbrain segments appears unaffected. These findings suggest that disruption of Eph-ephrin signaling does not lead to a general alteration of gene expression throughout the hindbrain but rather to a localized effect at rhombomere interfaces. To further confirm this point, we evaluated the effect of dnEphA4 on the expression pattern <italic>of hoxb1</italic>, which is normally localized to r4. We found that in contrast to the sharp borders of r4 in controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M</xref> n = 6), expression of dnEphA4 leads to a mild disruption in the formation of sharp domains of <italic>hoxb1 </italic>expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2N</xref> n = 6). Notably, as for Krox20 and EphA4, there was a disorganisation consistent with abnormal mixing rather than segmental changes to <italic>hoxb1 </italic>expression, suggesting that expression of dnEphA4 does not alter segmental identity.</p><p>Finally, the gross morphology of the manipulated hindbrain was examined by frontal paraffin sections of dnEphA4-expressing embryos. While the shape of rhombomere bulges separated by repeated boundary constrictions is evident in the intact side of the hindbrain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O, P</xref> right hand-side), a loss of this typical hindbrain morphology occurs on the dnEphA4 electroporated side (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O, P</xref> left hand-side n = 5). Taken together, these results suggest that disruption of EphA4 signaling in the chick hindbrain leads to a decrease or loss of hindbrain boundary cells, in agreement with previous studies on zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The boundary cell marker <italic>FGF3 </italic>shows persistent segmental expression in embryos transfected with truncated EphA4 receptor</title><p><italic>FGF3 </italic>expression was previously described as occurring at early stages in specific hindbrain segments and later in hindbrain boundaries in chick and mouse embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We carried out a more detailed analysis of the transition of <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression from a segmental pattern to boundary cells. In 8 somite stage (ss) embryos, <italic>FGF3 </italic>is expressed in the ventral half of r4-r6 and r6 (excluding the floor plate) and at lower levels in r2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). By 16 ss, expression is seen in all even-numbered segments, is downregulated in r5, and some upregulation begins at rhombomere borders (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In 20 ss embryos, expression in r2 is downregulated while still present in the other even-numbered segments, and <italic>FGF3 </italic>transcripts become more apparent at r2/r3, r3/r4, r4/r5 and r5/r6 boundaries (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

Finally, in embryos at 30&#x02013;45 ss, <italic>FGF3 </italic>transcripts are confined to the ventral part of hindbrain boundary cells and are absent from all rhombomere bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). This analysis shows that <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression is firstly restricted to specific hindbrain segments and subsequently downregulated from these rhombomeres while expression is upregulated at rhombomere boundaries.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The boundary cell marker <italic>FGF3 </italic>shows persistent segmental expression in embryos expressing truncated EphA4</bold>.

However, examination of <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression in 28&#x02013;36 ss embryos following transfection of dnEphA4 at 8 ss revealed a surprising result:<italic>FGF3 </italic>was expressed in even-numbered rhombomeres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G, I</xref>, n = 12) at stages when this segmental expression would normally be downregulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;D</xref>). Indeed, on the contra-lateral side of the dnEphA4-expressing hindbrains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G, I</xref> right hand side) as well as in control electroporated embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F, H</xref>, n = 10), <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression was confined to boundary cells, as expected at this embryonic stage. The effect of dnEphA4 misexpression was non-cell autonomous since following dorsal electroporation, the transfected cells were not overlapping with the more ventral segmental <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref>, compare GFP labeled cells in green with <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression in red). This result rules out the possibility that <italic>FGF3 </italic>becomes upregulated in cells expressing dnEphA4. In contrast to these findings, transfection of dnEphA4 in older embryos at 22 ss, when <italic>FGF3 </italic>is about to become downregulated from r4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), did not result in any rhombomeric expression of <italic>FGF3</italic>. Instead, expression occurred only in the boundary cells in both GFP control and dnEphA4 expressing embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3J, K</xref>, n = 7 for each), further eliminating the possibility that ectopic expression of truncated Eph directly induces <italic>FGF3 </italic>upregulation. Taken together, these findings suggest that overexpression of dnEphA4 at stages when <italic>FGF3 </italic>is segmentally expressed leads to failure of the normal downregulation of this aspect of <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Downregulation of rhombomeric <italic>FGF3 </italic>requires boundary cells</title><p>Potential clues to why dnEphA4 affects segmental <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression are the observations that this effect is non cell-autonomous (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H, I</xref>) and that hindbrain boundary formation is disrupted upon blocking Eph-ephrin signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A possible mechanism is that the presence of boundary cells is involved in the downregulation of <italic>FGF3 </italic>from hindbrain segments. Consistent with this, examination of the normal dynamics of <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;E</xref>) shows the disappearance of <italic>FGF3 </italic>from even-numbered rhombomeres occurring later than the appearance of boundaries between hindbrain segments. Therefore, we took a microsurgical approach in order to examine whether rhombomeric <italic>FGF3 </italic>downregulation is affected in a segment where its adjacent boundary has been ablated. Unilateral removal of the r3/4 boundary was performed in 12 ss embryos, when this boundary is morphologically visible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>). As removal of a rhombomere boundary has been previously shown to be followed by its regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], we inserted a silicon piece into the ablated region to prevent interactions between r3 and r4 required for regeneration of the boundary (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). As a control for the microsurgery manipulation, some ablated embryos were allowed to develop without this insert to enable regeneration of the r3/4 boundary. Both types of embryos were fixed at 28 ss, when <italic>FGF3 </italic>is normally absent from r4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D, E</xref>). Embryos that were lacking the r3/4 boundary were found to express <italic>FGF3 </italic>within r4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D, E</xref>, n = 12), while on the contra-lateral side it was already downregulated from r4 and localized to the r3/4 and r4/5 boundaries. Moreover, <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression was already downregulated from r6 at both sides of this hindbrain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D, E</xref>), as expected from the embryonic stage at the time of fixation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), indicating that the continued expression of <italic>FGF3 </italic>in r4 on the ablated side is not due to a general developmental delay. The ablation of the r3/4 boundary did not cause <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression in r3, a segment in which <italic>FGF3 </italic>is not expressed at any stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;E</xref>), indicating that the loss of r3/4 boundary does not result in an ectopic upregulation of <italic>FGF3 </italic>in the operated area. In contrast, in embryos in which the ablated r3/4 boundary was allowed to regenerate, <italic>FGF3 </italic>mRNA was not detected within r4 and was upregulated in the re-formed boundary as in normal embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>, n = 8). These data suggest that the r3/4 boundary is required in order for <italic>FGF3 </italic>to become downregulated from r4.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Ablation of a boundary results in sustained rhombomeric expression of <italic>FGF3</italic></bold>.

These centers regulate patterning and differentiation of the neighboring tissues by the production and secretion of soluble signals (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]). By analogy, our findings could be explained by the downregulation of <italic>FGF3 </italic>from hindbrain rhombomeres being mediated by soluble factor(s) from boundary cells. This possibility was examined by making a slit between the r3/4 boundary and r4 in 12 ss embryos, followed by insertion of a piece of aluminum foil as a non-permeable barrier into the slit (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>). This manipulation aimed to block the secretion of a putative signal from this boundary towards r4 as well as to prevent cell processes, if present, from interacting between these two regions. Embryos were assessed for <italic>FGF</italic>3 expression at ~28 ss, a stage by which it is normally downregulated from rhombomeres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;E</xref>). Embryos with the inserted barrier beneath r3/4 boundary had <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression within r4, while it has already been downregulated in this segment on the contra-lateral side (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D, E</xref> n = 10). Notably, <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression was already downregulated from r6 on both sides of the manipulated hindbrain, arguing against the possibility that the microsurgery caused <italic>FGF3 </italic>to remain expressed in r4 due to a general delay in embryonic development. We next analyzed whether the effect on <italic>FGF3 </italic>in r4 is mediated only by the r3/r4 boundary or whether prevention of the contact between r4 and the r4/5 boundary will also prevent <italic>FGF3 </italic>from becoming downregulated from r4. We found that insertion of a barrier between r4 and the r4/5 boundary led to persistent segmental expression of <italic>FGF3 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref> n = 6). This result shows that both boundaries contribute to the downregulation of <italic>FGF3 </italic>from r4, and suggests that the concentration of the putative factor(s) that is released from both boundaries is limiting such that reduction in its amount from either boundary is sufficient to prevent <italic>FGF3 </italic>from being downregulated.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Prevention of the contact between r4 and its boundaries results in sustained <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression in r4</bold>.

Nevertheless, to test this we analyzed whether inserting a barrier anterior to the r3/4 boundary affects <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression. We found that this did not result in sustained <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression in r4 or in ectopic expression in r3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>, n = 5). This result further confirms that <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression in r4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D, E</xref>) is not due to a non-specific effect of the operation procedure. Moreover, this indicates that it is not signaling from r3 to r4 that is necessary to downregulate <italic>FGF3 </italic>in r4, but rather the r3/4 boundary itself is required.</p><p>To further analyze whether signaling from boundaries in involved in downregulation of segmental <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression, we inserted a permeable membrane of 3 &#x003bc;m-diameter pore size, which allows diffusion of proteins, between the r3/4 boundary and r4. In these embryos, <italic>FGF3 </italic>was downregulated from this segment and localized to the boundaries, as in the contra-lateral side of the operated embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>, n = 11). This control further excludes the possibility that the sustained <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression in r4 observed upon the insertion of the non-permeable barrier (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D&#x02013;F</xref>) is a non-specific effect of the surgical manipulation. The differing effects of inserting a non-permeable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D&#x02013;F</xref>) or a porous barrier (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>) suggests that a diffusible factor(s) from r4 boundaries are involved in downregulation of <italic>FGF3 </italic>from this segment.</p><p>Finally, we analyzed whether boundary cells also regulate the expression of <italic>follistatin</italic>, which is initially expressed in a segmental pattern in several rhombomeres including r4, and later becomes restricted to boundary cells and a DV-restricted stripe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Moreover, abnormal maintenance of <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression in r4 occurs upon insertion of a non-permeable barrier between this rhombomere and either of its boundaries, suggesting that the downregularion of segmental <italic>FGF3 </italic>is induced due to the secretion of signals from boundary cells.

The dynamic regulation of <italic>FGF3 </italic>in the hindbrain may be an example of the widespread phenomenon of the redeployment of the same signals at sequential stages of development. <italic>FGF3 </italic>and several other secreted factors, such as <italic>FGF19 </italic>and <italic>follistatin</italic>, initially have rhombomeric expression that then switches to boundary-restricted expression in the chick and mouse embryo hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The early segmental expression of <italic>FGF3 </italic>is required for the induction and patterning of the otic vesicle, which develops from a placode adjacent to the hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In addition, rhombomeric-derived FGFs are required for hindbrain patterning, such as segmental expression of <italic>Krox20 </italic>and <italic>Kreisle</italic>r/MafB in specific segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Recently, we have found that the segmental expression of <italic>FGF3 </italic>is enabled by follistatin that is expressed in the same segments and blocks BMP signaling that would otherwise inhibit the upregulation of <italic>FGF3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Knockdown of follistatin leads to a lack of segmental <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression and disruption to hindbrain patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The downregulation of segmental <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression could simply reflect that its initial roles in hindbrain segmentation and inner ear induction have been fulfilled, so continued expression is not required. However, our finding that boundary signals promote the downregulation of <italic>FGF3 </italic>suggests a more active requirement. An attractive possibility is that continued segmental expression of <italic>FGF3 </italic>would interfere with the roles of the subsequent boundary-restricted expression. Currently, it is not possible to test this since the role of <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression at hindbrain boundaries is not known. The expression of a number of signaling molecules at hindbrain boundaries in chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] is suggestive of roles as signaling centers that pattern adjacent rhombomeres. Such a role could be analogous to the midbrain-hindbrain boundary that acts as an organizing centre to pattern cell fate and neural differentiation in the midbrain and anterior hindbrain through the secretion of FGF8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, it is not clear whether hindbrain boundaries organize neuronal patterns within rhombomeres in the chick since, unlike the situation in zebrafish hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], there is no overt organization of repetitive neurogenesis or of mature neurons and glia along the AP axis within rhombomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Furthermore, there is normal formation of neuronal nuclei following retinoic acid treatment, surgical ablation or genetic alterations that disrupt hindbrain boundaries in chick or mouse embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is possible that FGFs expressed at hindbrain boundaries have roles in other aspects of tissue organization, such as axon pathfinding or formation of nerve exit points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>What is the signal that downregulates FGF3?</title><p>An important question raised by our results is the identity of boundary signals that induce the downregulation of segmental <italic>FGF3 </italic>in the hindbrain. One possibility is that segmental &#x02013; but not boundary &#x02013; <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression is itself downregulated by FGF signaling from boundaries. However, on the contrary we found that addition of exogenous <italic>FGF3 </italic>increased the level of segmental <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression whereas blocking of FGF receptors inhibited <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These results suggest that an autoregulatory positive feedback loop regulates <italic>FGF3 </italic>expression in the hindbrain, arguing against the possibility that <italic>FGF3 </italic>from boundaries downregulates its own expression in segment bodies. <italic>FGF3 </italic>downregulation may be mediated by the loss of <italic>follistatin </italic>from segment bodies, since both genes overlap in the hindbrain and we have recently found that <italic>FGF3 </italic>requires follistatin in order to be expressed in rhombomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Our present data are consistent with the possibility that a boundary signal(s) downregulates segmental <italic>follistatin </italic>expression, in turn leading to downregulation of <italic>FGF3</italic>.

In addition, boundary cell markers are lost upon overexpression of dominant negative EphA4. However, the segmental expression of the boundary cell marker <italic>FGF3 </italic>persists. Similar sustained expression of <italic>FGF3 </italic>in rhombomeres occurs upon ablation of boundary cells or blockage of the contact between a rhombomere and its boundaries. Together, we suggest that hindbrain boundary cells are required for the switching-off of rhombomeric <italic>FGF3</italic>, presumably mediated by a soluble factor(s) emanating from the boundaries. These findings imply for a new role of boundary cells in the downregulation of genes expressed at hindbrain segments. This boundary-cell activity may be required for stage-specific function of segmental genes in the developing hindbrain.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DSD designed and guided the study, carried out most of the experiments, analyzed and interpreted the data, and wrote the manuscript.
