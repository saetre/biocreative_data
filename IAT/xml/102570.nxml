It does so by sensing of the extracellular amino acids via a sensor, Ssy1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c2">2</xref>). The addition of amino acids results in a drastic induction of expression of several amino acid permease genes, e.g. the <italic>AGP1</italic> gene, encoding a broad specificity amino acid permease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c3">3</xref>), the <italic>TAT1</italic> and <italic>TAT2</italic> genes encoding the tyrosine and tryptophan permeases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c4">4</xref>), the <italic>BAP2</italic> gene encoding a branched chain amino acid permease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c5">5</xref>) and the <italic>BAP3</italic> (<italic>PAP1</italic>) gene, encoding a protein with high similarity to Bap2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c6">6</xref>). We have identified an element in the promoter of <italic>BAP3</italic> that we called UAS<sub>aa</sub> (amino acid-dependent upstream activator sequence), which is responsible for this induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c7">7</xref>). We have shown that this UAS<sub>aa</sub> is both necessary and sufficient for induction of <italic>BAP3</italic> expression by most <sc>l</sc>-amino acids found in proteins. Furthermore, we showed that Stp1p, a nuclear protein with zinc finger domains, plays an essential role in induction via the UAS<sub>aa</sub>. Gel shift analysis showed that the UAS<sub>aa</sub> can form a specific DNA&#x02013;protein complex when incubated with total yeast extract. This complex is formed irrespective of whether the extract is isolated from cells grown in the presence or absence of amino acids in the medium, or from cells that contain or lack Stp1p. A limited mutational analysis of the UAS<sub>aa</sub> showed that there is a strong correlation between the ability of the mutated UAS<sub>aa</sub> to form a complex <italic>in vitro</italic> and its ability to function as an amino acid-dependent promoter element when fused to a <italic>CYC1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>LacZ</italic> reporter. These observations led to the conclusion that the UAS<sub>aa</sub> is constitutively bound by a factor different from Stp1p, and that this factor is also involved in the induction of transcription in response to amino acids in the medium.</p><p>In this paper we show that the factor that <italic>in vitro</italic> binds to the UAS<sub>aa</sub> is Abf1p. This global transcription factor, encoded by <italic>ABF1</italic> (also known as <italic>OBF</italic>, <italic>BAF1</italic>, <italic>TAF</italic> and <italic>GF1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c8">8</xref>), was originally identified as a protein binding to autonomously replicating sequences. Abf1p has been shown to take part also in the regulation of expression of a large number of genes involved in various cellular processes and with a variety of expression patterns. For example, Abf1p has been shown to be involved in the regulation of transcription of some of the ribosomal protein genes, as well as the <italic>COX6</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c9">9</xref>), the <italic>ARO3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c10">10</xref>), the <italic>FOX3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c11">11</xref>), the <italic>CHA1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c12">12</xref>) and the <italic>HIS7</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c13">13</xref>). We show that the UAS<sub>aa</sub> harbours an Abf1p-binding site and that mutations within the UAS<sub>aa</sub> that obliterate Abf1p binding also lead to a loss of the capacity of this DNA element to function <italic>in vivo</italic> as an amino acid-dependent UAS. However, we also show that the mere binding of Abf1p to a DNA element placed in front of a <italic>CYC1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>LacZ</italic> reporter is not sufficient for induction of that reporter by amino acids.</p><p>Furthermore, we provide evidence that in addition to Stp1p, Stp2p, a protein with considerable similarity to Stp1p and having the same number and arrangement of zinc finger domains as Stp1p, is also involved in amino acid-induced transcription via the UAS<sub>aa</sub>. Whereas amino acid-induced expression of <italic>BAP3</italic> is severely compromised in &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic> as well as in &#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> mutant cells, induction is completely lost in a &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic>&#x0002f;&#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> double mutant. To test whether Stp1p or Stp2p can bind to the UAS<sub>aa</sub>, we have overexpressed both proteins in yeast cells. Using extracts from cells overexpressing Stp2p in band shift assays, we found formation of an Stp2p-dependent complex.</p><p>Taken together, we have shown that induction of <italic>BAP3</italic> transcription in response to amino acids requires Stp1p and&#x0002f;or Stp2p, and that Abf1p is involved in the response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media and genetic methods</title><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are derived from M4054 (MAT&#x003b1;, <italic>gap1-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>101</italic>, <italic>ura3</italic>, <italic>gal2</italic>) as described by Grauslund <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c5">5</xref>).

Based on the observation that the UAS<sub>aa</sub> may comprise an Abf1p-binding site we set out to test whether indeed Abf1p is the protein that does bind to the UAS<sub>aa</sub><italic>in vitro</italic> in gel shift analyses. First, we carried out a gel shift experiment with a labelled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the UAS<sub>aa</sub> (&#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-D) and using excess of an unlabelled double-stranded oligonucleotide harbouring an Abf1p-binding site (i.e. the Abf1p-binding site as present in the promoter of the <italic>rpS28A</italic> gene) as competitor. We found that this latter oligonucleotide is an efficient competitor for protein binding to the UAS<sub>aa</sub>, suggesting that both the UAS<sub>aa</sub> and the Abf1p-binding site bind the same protein (data not shown). Next, we made mutations at two of the four fully conserved nucleotides present in the consensus Abf1p-binding sequence, i.e. at the conserved C at position 3 (&#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-L) or at the conserved C at position 12 (&#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-K; see also Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd187tb2">2</xref>) and used these oligonucleotides as probes in a gel shift assay. From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f1">1</xref> it is clear that the mutations in both &#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-L and K lead to a severe decrease in protein binding. We also found that a mutation at position 14 (&#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-M), which is less conserved, reduces protein binding. Point mutations as present in &#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-N, -P and -R which do not affect the Abf1p-binding consensus, have no effect on the formation of complex Y. Then we asked whether bacterially produced Abf1p is able to bind to the UAS<sub>aa</sub>. Abf1p has been shown to contain two DNA-binding domains. The first is a zinc finger motif in the N-terminal region (amino acids 40&#x02013;91) and the second a DNA-binding region located in the middle of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c25">25</xref>). Using two constructs described by Halfter and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c23">23</xref>) we expressed both a full-length Abf1p and a shorter version from which the N-terminal zinc finger domain was deleted and which therefore could no longer bind to Abf1p-binding sites in <italic>E.coli</italic>. Production of <italic>bona fide</italic> Abf1p and Abf1p&#x00394;33&#x0002f;240 was established by western blotting using an antiserum against Abf1p (results not shown). We then used extracts from <italic>E.coli</italic> producing these two proteins in gel shift analyses. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f2">2</xref>A illustrates that the complete recombinant Abf1p can form a complex with the UAS<sub>aa</sub> with the same mobility as the complex it forms with the <italic>S28A</italic> probe (a double-stranded oligonucleotide harbouring an Abf1p-binding site as present in the promoter of the <italic>rpS28A</italic> gene). Furthermore, the complexes found with the recombinant Abf1p have similar mobility to the complexes observed using yeast extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f2">2</xref>A, compare lanes 2 and 4). When we use a protein extract from <italic>E.coli</italic> cells&#x000a0;expressing Abf1p&#x00394;33&#x0002f;240 no complex formation was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f2">2</xref>A, lanes 3 and 8). Finally, we studied the effect of antibodies directed against Abf1p in gel shift assays to reveal the nature of the protein(s) that binds to the UAS<sub>aa</sub>. Using the double-stranded oligonucleotide o<italic>BAP3</italic>-WT, comprising the UAS<sub>aa</sub>, and yeast extract in a gel shift assay we find two complexes, a weak complex X and a much stronger complex Y (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f2">2</xref>B, lane 2). Addition of anti-Abf1p antibodies to such a gel shift experiment resulted in disappearance of the major complex, Y, and a concomitant increase in the intensity of complex X (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f2">2</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;6). This effect can either be explained by a supershift of the Y complex as a result of binding of the antibody to the complex or by the inability of antibody-bound Abf1p to bind to the Abf1p-binding site, which can then complex with another factor(s) to form complex X. To distinguish between these two possibilities we performed a similar series of gel shift assays using the <italic>S28A</italic> probe and yeast extract in the presence or absence of anti-Abf1p antibodies. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f2">2</xref>B (lanes 11&#x02013;14) clearly shows that upon addition of anti-Abf1p antibodies the <italic>S28A</italic>&#x02013;Abf1p complex is supershifted to a complex of similar mobility to that of complex X. Taken together, these experiments unambiguously demonstrate that complex Y is formed as a result of the interaction of o<italic>BAP3</italic>-WT with Abf1p, meaning that <italic>in vitro</italic> the UAS<sub>aa</sub> can be bound by Abf1p. It must be noted, however, that this binding site is much weaker than the Abf1p-binding site in the <italic>S28A</italic> promoter (cf. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f2">2</xref>A, lanes 4 and 9).</p></sec><sec><title>In addition to Stp1p, Stp2p is involved in the induction of <italic>BAP3</italic></title><p><italic>STP1</italic> encodes a nuclear protein with zinc finger domains which is involved in pre-tRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c26">26</xref>) and which is also required for the induced expression of <italic>BAP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c27">27</xref>). We previously reported that Stp1p is also involved in the induction of <italic>BAP3</italic> transcription by leucine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c7">7</xref>). Since the absence of Stp1p leads to a strongly reduced induction of <italic>BAP3</italic> expression, rather than to a complete loss of induction, we looked for other proteins that might be involved in the induction process. Stp2p is such a protein. <italic>STP2</italic> was found in a screen for genes that in higher copy number would confer growth on minimal proline medium containing the inhibitor of branched chain amino acid synthesis, methylsulfonyl urea (MM), plus isoleucine (0.2 mM) and valine (20 &#x000b5;M). On this medium cells grow only when the uptake of valine is increased. This may for instance be the result of an increased activity or an increased expression of one or more of the permeases Bap2p, Bap3p or Tat1p. To investigate the role of <italic>STP2</italic> in <italic>BAP3</italic> expression, we used northern blot analysis and monitored <italic>BAP3</italic> expression in a &#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> as well as in a &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic>&#x0002f;&#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> double disruption mutant in comparison to the <italic>BAP3</italic> expression in isogenic wild-type cells after addition of leucine. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f3">3</xref>A shows that as in a &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic> mutant, <italic>BAP3</italic> induced expression is severely diminished in a &#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> mutant. However, in either single disruption mutant we still find a low level of leucine-induced <italic>BAP3</italic> expression. In a &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic>&#x0002f;&#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> double mutant, however, leucine-induced <italic>BAP3</italic> expression is completely lost. We have also monitored expression of <italic>BAP2</italic> in a similar experiment and found that <italic>BAP2</italic> expression follows a pattern similar to <italic>BAP3</italic> (data not shown). These results indicate that both Stp1p and Stp2p are involved in the amino acid-induced expression of <italic>BAP2</italic> and <italic>BAP3</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of Stp1p and Stp2p</title><p>To gain more insight into the functions of Stp1p and Stp2p, we sought to overexpress either or both these proteins by placing the corresponding genes under control of the <italic>PGK1</italic> promoter and to express them from a multiple copy vector (see Materials and Methods). Stp1p was overexpressed as the wild-type protein, whereas the overexpressed Stp2p carried a triple HA epitope tag &#x0005b;(HA)<sub>3</sub>&#x0005d; at its N-terminus. Strong overexpression of either protein was clearly demonstrated in a western blot analysis using either an anti-Stp1p antibody (a kind gift of Dr A. Hopper, Seattle, WA) or the 12CA5 antibody directed against the HA epitope in Stp2p (results not shown). To find out whether the overproduced Stp1p or (HA)<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;Stp2p is functional in leucine-induced <italic>BAP3</italic> expression we tested the recovery of <italic>BAP3</italic> induction in &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic>&#x0002f;&#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> disruption mutants with the respective overexpression constructs by northern blot analysis. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f3">3</xref>B shows that upon transformation of the &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic> mutant with either the single copy <italic>STP1</italic> overexpression construct (SC<italic>PGK1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>STP1</italic>) or the multiple copy <italic>STP1</italic> overexpression vector (MC<italic>PGK1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>STP1</italic>) leucine-induced <italic>BAP3</italic> induction was restored. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f3">3</xref>C shows, likewise, that upon transformation of the &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic>&#x0002f;&#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> mutant with either the single copy (HA)<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;<italic>STP2</italic> overexpression construct (SC<italic>PGK1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>STP2</italic>) or the multiple copy (HA)<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;<italic>STP2</italic> overexpression vector (MC<italic>PGK1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>STP2</italic>) leucine-induced <italic>BAP3</italic> induction was restored. We find that overexpression of either <italic>STP1</italic> or <italic>STP2</italic> leads to an increase in <italic>BAP3</italic> induction as compared to untransformed wild-type cells. Furthermore, strong overexpression of <italic>STP1</italic> or <italic>STP2</italic> leads to <italic>BAP3</italic> expression without the addition of leucine (compare lanes 1 and 7 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f3">3</xref>B and lanes 1 and 16 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f3">3</xref>C). We conclude that we have successfully constructed vectors that enable us to overexpress functional Stp1p or Stp2p in yeast.</p><p>To see whether Stp1p or Stp2p directly interacts with the <italic>BAP3</italic> promoter, we performed gel shift analysis with the &#x02013;495 to &#x02013;392 region of the <italic>BAP3</italic> promoter involved in induction by amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c7">7</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f4">4</xref>A shows that the <italic>BAP3</italic> promoter fragment forms several DNA&#x02013;protein complexes when extracts from wild-type cells are used (lane 5). The weakest complexes with the slowest mobility (collectively called X) appear as one or two bands depending on the size of the UAS<sub>aa</sub> fragment. Previously we have shown that these X complexes are formed by non-specific protein binding since their formation cannot be competed out by unlabelled fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c7">7</xref>). The strongest complex, Y, is, as we have shown, formed by Abf1p. Finally, we found a very weak complex with a higher mobility than the Abf1p complex. Stp2p overexpression led to a significant increase in the formation of this weak DNA&#x02013;protein complex, which we therefore called the Stp2p-dependent complex. The Stp2p-dependent complex is also formed using the &#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-D fragment as probe and using yeast extracts from cells overexpressing Stp2p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f4">4</xref>A, lane 8). Overexpression of Stp1p has no apparent effect on the gel shift pattern. We have monitored the sequence requirements for Stp2p-dependent complex formation by testing various mutated versions of the <italic>BAP3</italic> UAS<sub>aa</sub> in gel shift analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f4">4</xref>C; see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd187tb2">2</xref> for the specific sequences). Stp2p-dependent complex formation is highly sequence specific; the complex is formed using the non-mutagenised UAS<sub>aa</sub> version &#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-D (cf. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f4">4</xref>A), but there is no complex formation with the mutagenised versions &#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-B, E, G, L and P. Loss of Stp2p-dependent complex formation with these latter oligonucleotides suggests that the sequence 5&#x02032;-CGGCTC-3&#x02032; in the UAS<sub>aa</sub> is important for protein binding.</p><p>To show that the Stp2p-dependent complex involves Stp2p, we have expressed Stp2p in <italic>E.coli</italic> and used such extracts in gel shift assays. Using these protein extracts in band shift analysis, an Stp2p-dependent complex is formed with the o<italic>BAP3</italic>-WT promoter fragment, which is absent when protein extracts from wild-type <italic>E.coli</italic> cells are used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f4">4</xref>B, compare lanes 2 and 3). We have also tested binding of the Stp2p protein, expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, to the mutated <italic>BAP3</italic> fragments used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd187f4">4</xref>C. We found a similar pattern of complex formation, indicating that <italic>in vitro</italic> produced Stp2p binds to the UAS<sub>aa</sub> with the same sequence specificity as found for the tagged Stp2p version expressed in yeast (results not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the <italic>LacZ</italic> fusions</title><p>To test whether the ability of a DNA fragment to bind Abf1p or&#x0002f;and to form the Stp2p-dependent complex <italic>in vitro</italic> correlates with its capacity to render a promoter inducible by amino acids we cloned the UAS<sub>aa</sub> and several mutated versions thereof or the <italic>rpS28A</italic> elements (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd187tb2">2</xref>) in front of a <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene. The reporter constructs were integrated at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus and single copy integrants were tested for induction of the fusion gene by measuring &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity after growing the mutants with or without 2 mM leucine in the medium.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd187tb2">2</xref> shows that mutations in the Abf1p-binding site of the UAS<sub>aa</sub> result in a loss of induced <italic>LacZ</italic> expression in response to leucine (&#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-A, -B, -K, -L and -M). This loss of induction correlates well with the results obtained from the gel retardation assays. In other words, binding of Abf1p correlates with induction in response to leucine via the UAS<sub>aa</sub>. However, when the Abf1p-binding site as found in the <italic>rpS28A</italic> promoter was fused to the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter (<italic>S28A</italic> and <italic>S28A</italic><italic><sup>rev</sup></italic>), no induction by the addition of leucine was observed. This means that Abf1p interaction is not enough for induction in response to leucine and that other elements and&#x0002f;or factors are required.</p><p>Since Stp2p overexpression results in the formation of an additional complex in the gel shift assay, it is possible that Stp2p plays a direct role in <italic>BAP3</italic> transcription. For example, oligonucleotides E and P are still bound by Abf1p, but they do not form the Stp2p-dependent complex and have lost their capacity to induce the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter in response to leucine. On the other hand, oligonucleotide &#x00394;<italic>BAP3</italic>-G, which is still bound by Abf1p but does not form the Stp2p-dependent complex, is still able to induce the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter in response to leucine. This would imply that, in addition to Abf1p and Stp2p, another protein(s) is also involved in the induction of <italic>BAP3</italic> in response to amino acids (e.g. Stp1p).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We previously identified an upstream activating sequence in the <italic>BAP3</italic> promoter that is responsible for the induced expression of <italic>BAP3</italic> in response to the availability of amino acids in the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c7">7</xref>). This paper describes the identification of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors interacting with this <italic>cis</italic>-acting element.</p><p>We have found that the UAS<sub>aa</sub> constitutes a weak binding site for the global transcription factor Abf1p. This Abf1p-binding site does not completely comply with the consensus sequence, but has considerable similarity to the Abf1p-binding site as found in the promoters of other yeast genes. We tested several mutated versions of the UAS<sub>aa</sub> to establish the sequence specificity of the Abf1p interaction and found that point mutations in nucleotides known to be essential for Abf1p binding result in a severe decrease in complex formation. We previously showed that the UAS<sub>aa</sub> is both necessary and sufficient for induction of a <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter in response to addition of amino acids. We also tested mutated UAS<sub>aa</sub> versions that can no longer be bound by Abf1p and found that there is a correlation between Abf1p complex formation and ability to induce the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter. In other words, binding of Abf1p to the UAS<sub>aa</sub> may be involved in the induced expression in response to amino acids. To investigate whether Abf1p binding alone is sufficient to induce the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter, we fused an Abf1p-binding site as present in the <italic>rpS28A</italic> promoter to the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter. We found that this fusion does not induce induction of the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter in response to amino acids. This implies that the binding of Abf1p to its cognate site by itself is not sufficient to support induction of the gene concerned in response to amino acids and that other elements and factors are involved in the specific induction of expression of UAS<sub>aa</sub>-controlled genes.</p><p>One candidate involved in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>BAP3</italic> might be the <italic>STP1</italic> gene product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c7">7</xref>). We found that deleting the <italic>STP1</italic> gene leads to a severe decrease in <italic>BAP3</italic> induction; however, there is still some remaining residual <italic>BAP3</italic> induction. This implies that another factor(s) might play a role in leucine-induced <italic>BAP3</italic> transcription. <italic>STP2</italic> was found in a screen for genes that in higher copy number would confer increased activity of one or both of the permeases Bap2p and Bap3p. Comparison of <italic>STP1</italic> and <italic>STP2</italic> reveals that the <italic>STP2</italic> gene encodes a protein with considerable similarity to the <italic>STP1</italic> gene product. We constructed a &#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> mutant and found that this mutant, like &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic>, also had a decreased level of leucine-induced <italic>BAP3</italic> transcription. Not unexpectedly, upon deletion of both <italic>STP1</italic> and <italic>STP2</italic>, expression of <italic>BAP3</italic> was completely lost. Since the double deletion mutant had an aggravating effect in comparison to the single deletion mutants, we propose that the <italic>STP1</italic> and <italic>STP2</italic> gene products have similar functions in the regulation of <italic>BAP3</italic> expression. To confirm this, we overexpressed Stp2p in a &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic>&#x0002f;&#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> deletion mutant. We found that overexpression of Stp2p could restore <italic>BAP3</italic> induction, even to higher levels than in wild-type cells. This means that indeed Stp1p and Stp2p have similar functions in <italic>BAP3</italic> expression and can function independently of each other.</p><p>Stp1p and Stp2p are the most likely candidates for being the transcription factors that directly interact with the UAS<sub>aa</sub>. Overexpression of Stp2p does result in formation of an additional UAS<sub>aa</sub>&#x02013;protein interaction in an <italic>in vitro</italic> gel shift experiment. We have also used protein extracts from yeast cells overexpressing Stp1p. However, we could not find any interaction of Stp1p with the <italic>BAP3</italic> promoter. Furthermore, attempts to express Stp1p in <italic>E.coli</italic> have been unsuccessful. Both negative findings could result from differences in protein stability and sequence specificity between Stp1p and Stp2p. We found that formation of the Stp2p-dependent complex requires the sequence 5&#x02032;-CGGCTC-3&#x02032; in the UAS<sub>aa</sub>, which partially overlaps with the Abf1p-binding consensus. This suggests that Abf1p is either required to recruit other transcription factors, like Stp2p, for amino acid-induced transcription or that Abf1p competes with these factors for binding to the UAS<sub>aa</sub>. Similar sequences appear to be present in the <italic>BAP2</italic> and <italic>TAT1</italic> promoters (see also ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c7">7</xref>), which makes it interesting to note that we have found that the &#x00394;<italic>stp1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>stp2</italic> mutations resulted in a similar expression pattern of <italic>BAP2</italic> as reported here for <italic>BAP3</italic> (data not shown).</p><p>Since overexpression of Stp2p does not lead to complexes that involve both Stp2p and Abf1p, it is not likely that there is concomitant binding of both Abf1p and Stp2p to the UAS<sub>aa</sub>. For leucine-induced <italic>BAP3</italic> expression we propose a model in which Abf1p acts as a general transcription factor interacting with the UAS<sub>aa</sub> irrespective of whether leucine is present or not. Several reports have been published in which it has been shown that Abf1p is responsible for transcriptional regulation of genes involved in distinct processes. This functional diversity can only be explained if Abf1p plays a role in a general mechanism such as, for example, chromatin (re)modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd187c28">28</xref>). Recent data from our laboratory show that Abf1p is indeed involved in bending of DNA and nucleosome positioning, thereby regulating expression of the <italic>rpS28</italic> gene (Lascaris <italic>et al.</italic>, submitted for publication). In the case of the <italic>BAP3</italic> gene, Abf1p may also function by excluding nucleosomes or by bending the DNA, thereby rendering the UAS<sub>aa</sub> accessible to the specific transcription factors Stp1p and Stp2p.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd187f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Gel shift analysis of the UAS<sub>aa</sub> and mutated versions thereof.
