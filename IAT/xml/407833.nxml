Moreover, studies indicate that XRCC1 possesses discrete G<sub>1</sub> and S phase-specific functions. To further define the contribution of XRCC1 to DNA metabolism, we determined the <italic>in vivo</italic> localization pattern of this protein and searched for novel protein interactors. We report here that XRCC1 co-localizes with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at DNA replication foci, observed exclusively in the S phase of undamaged HeLa cells. Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis and co-immunoprecipitation indicate that XRCC1 and PCNA are in a complex and likely physically interact <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> biochemical analysis demonstrated that these two proteins associate directly, with the interaction being mediated by residues between amino acids 166 and 310 of XRCC1. The current evidence suggests a model where XRCC1 is sequestered via its interaction with PCNA to sites of DNA replication factories to facilitate efficient SSBR in S phase.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant EM9 was originally isolated on the basis of increased sensitivity to the alkylating agent ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and was concurrently shown to be cross-sensitive to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c1">1</xref>). Following exposure to these DNA-damaging agents, the rate of single-strand break (SSB) rejoining was found to be impaired several fold, indicating a defect in DNA repair. EM9 cells also exhibit a very high level (elevated &#x0223c;10-fold) of sister chromatid exchange (SCE), particularly when grown in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU). It was hypothesized that once incorporated, these halogenated bases are incompletely processed by the repair machinery in EM9, leading to the formation and accumulation of recombinagenic DNA strand break intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c2">2</xref>). The gene defective in these mutant cells was later identified in a screen for genomic fragments that confer resistance to CldU treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c3">3</xref>). Since the initial effort was to isolate X-ray repair genes, the cross-complementing human gene was termed X-ray Repair Cross Complementing 1.</p><p>There is substantial biochemical evidence indicating that XRCC1 participates in base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair (SSBR). XRCC1 was first found to physically associate with DNA ligase III&#x003b1; (LIG3&#x003b1;), an enzyme that functions to seal single-strand nicks in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c4">4</xref>). EM9 cells possess lower than normal levels of LIG3&#x003b1; protein, indicating that XRCC1 functions to stabilize this <italic>in vivo</italic> partner. Since this initial discovery, several other studies have reported interactions between XRCC1 and proteins involved in BER and SSBR. For instance, XRCC1 has been shown to interact with DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (POL&#x003b2;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c7">7</xref>), apurinic endonuclease (APE1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c8">8</xref>), polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c9">9</xref>), tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase (TDP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c10">10</xref>), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases 1 and 2 (PARP1/2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c12">12</xref>) and 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c13">13</xref>). Although no catalytic function has been ascribed to XRCC1, nick, gap and double-strand break (DSB) DNA binding activities have been associated with this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c14">14</xref>).</p><p>While both biological and biochemical evidence indicates a direct role for XRCC1 in BER/SSBR, likely as a scaffolding protein via the interactions noted above, other studies have suggested functions for XRCC1 in DNA replication and/or recombination. In particular, Taylor <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c15">15</xref>) found that EM9 cells expressing a mutant form of XRCC1, which is defective in its ability to interact with LIG3&#x003b1; through its C-terminal BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) domain (BRCT2), are deficient in SSBR during G<sub>1</sub> phase yet proficient in SSBR during S phase. This finding suggested cell cycle-specific roles for XRCC1, where the XRCC1&#x02013;LIG3&#x003b1; interaction is required for G<sub>1</sub> SSBR, but is dispensable for this process in S phase. Moreover, Kubota and Horiuchi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c16">16</xref>) reported that mutation of the central BRCT domain (BRCT1), but not BRCT2, results in a protein that is unable to restore alkylating agent resistance to EM9 cells. They subsequently found that XRCC1 mutant cell lines expressing XRCC1 with a mutated BRCT1 domain exhibit normal SSBR activity, but suffer from a defective reinitiation of replication following methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) challenge. This finding is generally consistent with the observations of Taylor <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c17">17</xref>), who reported that the BRCT1 domain of XRCC1 is required for proficient repair during both the G<sub>1</sub> and S/G<sub>2</sub> cell cycle phases. Taylor <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c15">15</xref>) also found that XRCC1 partially co-localizes with Rad51, implying a role for XRCC1 in homologous recombination-related processes. Thus, evidence indicates that XRCC1 has distinct functions in the G<sub>1</sub> and S phases, with potential roles in replication and/or recombination.</p><p>To further explore the contributions of XRCC1 to DNA metabolism, we determined the <italic>in vivo</italic> localization patterns of this protein using fluorescently tagged XRCC1 proteins. We report here that XRCC1 localizes to sites of replication foci, independent of exogenous DNA damage, and interacts directly with PCNA both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, revealing a novel molecular link between XRCC1-mediated responses and chromosomal DNA replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Fluorescently tagged protein expression systems</title><p>To generate the yellow fusion protein (YFP)-tagged XRCC1 expression constructs, human <italic>XRCC1</italic> cDNA was first PCR amplified.

Upon transfection of either pXRCC1-EYFP or pEYFP-XRCC1 into HeLa cells, XRCC1 protein was found to reside primarily in the nucleus, independent of the position of the YFP tag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f1">1</xref>A). This intracellular localization pattern is consistent with the computational predictions of XRCC1 sorting (PSORT, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.psort.org/">http://www.psort.org/</ext-link>), the fact that XRCC1 maintains six consensus nuclear localization signals between residues 242 and 555 (PSORT) and previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c26">26</xref>).

Confocal microscopy of HeLa cells expressing both YFP-tagged XRCC1 and CFP-tagged PCNA revealed that up to 90&#x00025; of the PCNA and XRCC1 foci co-localize in S phase cells (identified by PCNA foci; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f1">1</xref>B). In non-S phase cells (defined as those with evenly distributed PCNA), XRCC1 formed varying numbers of discrete foci (up to 30) in &#x0223c;80&#x00025; of the cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f1">1</xref>C). It is noteworthy that the relative intensity of the two proteins varied among the different foci and that some of the XRCC1 and PCNA foci did not coincide (see green and orange arrows in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f1">1</xref>B).</p><p>This co-localization prompted us to examine the relative proximity of XRCC1 and PCNA using quantitative FRET analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c33">33</xref>). FRET enables one to examine whether different proteins directly interact or, more precisely, whether the fluorescent tags (ECFP and EYFP) are within 100 &#x0212b; of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c20">20</xref>). FRET occurs only when the intensity of emitted light measured in the presence of two fluorescently tagged proteins is greater than the emitted light from cells transfected with only blue- or yellow-tagged proteins (i.e. background levels; see Materials and Methods). The FRET values normalized against protein expression levels, FRET<sub>N</sub>, are given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh556tb2">2</xref>. Such scrutiny revealed that XRCC1 and PCNA fusion proteins exhibit an average FRET<sub>N</sub> of 0.15. This FRET<sub>N</sub> level is comparable to what was seen with the positive control ECFP&#x02013;PCNA/EYFP&#x02013;PCNA (PCNA is a known trimer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c34">34</xref>) and considerably higher than that of the negative (background) control UNG2&#x02013;ECFP and UNG2&#x02013;EYFP (a known monomer which interacts with PCNA in replication foci) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c35">35</xref>). These observations suggest that XRCC1 and PCNA are likely associated directly <italic>in vivo</italic>. The FRET<sub>N</sub> for XRCC1&#x02013;ECFP/XRCC1&#x02013;EYFP was on average 0.55 and 0.26 within and outside XRCC1 foci, respectively, indicating that XRCC1 exists as a multimer <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>XRCC1 and PCNA co-immunoprecipitate from whole cell extracts</title><p>To test further whether XRCC1 and PCNA coexist in a common protein complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using 293T whole cell extracts treated with DNase I. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f2">2</xref>A, anti-PCNA antibody pulled down both PCNA and XRCC1 (see lane IP). However, we consistently found that co-immunoprecipitation of PCNA with anti-XRCC1 antibodies was less convincing (data not shown), perhaps reflecting inaccessibility of the antigenic epitope (to the XRCC1 antibody) in the context of the multi-protein complex or disruption of the XRCC1&#x02013;PCNA interaction upon antibody association. The inability to immunoprecipitate proteins from cell extracts in a reciprocal manner has been seen with other protein partners as well (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c36">36</xref>).</p><p>As an alternative for assessing the complex nature of XRCC1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated and employed a HeLa cell line stably expressing XRCC1&#x02013;EYFP. Immunoprecipitation from these cell extracts using an antibody against GFP captured both the XRCC1&#x02013;EYFP fusion protein and PCNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f2">2</xref>B). Conversely, immunoprecipitation with the same antibody from extracts expressing only EYFP did not pull down PCNA. These complementary data further support the idea that XRCC1 and PCNA exist in a common protein complex.</p></sec><sec><title>XRCC1 physically interacts with PCNA</title><p>Using purified recombinant proteins, we next tested for a direct physical association between XRCC1 and PCNA. The human XRCC1 protein was both HIS tagged at the C-terminus and S peptide tagged at the N-terminus. Taking advantage of the S peptide tag, we bound purified XRCC1 to an S protein affinity matrix and examined several untagged human replication and repair-related proteins (APE1, POL&#x003b2;, PCNA and FEN1) for direct interactions in pull-down assays. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f3">3</xref>, POL&#x003b2; was strongly retained (i.e. &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of the input) by the XRCC1-bound matrix, but not the matrix alone, supporting previous findings that XRCC1 forms a stable complex with POL&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c37">37</xref>). In addition, we observed direct recovery of PCNA (&#x0223c;10&#x00025; of the input) with the XRCC1-bound matrix, but not the matrix alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f3">3</xref>), indicating a direct physical interaction between these two proteins, as supported by the FRET analysis (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh556tb2">2</xref>). In the solution studies here, we did not observe a strong interaction between XRCC1 and APE1, a previously demonstrated protein partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c8">8</xref>), nor did we see an association (i.e. consistently above background) with FEN1, a structure-specific endonuclease that operates in repair and replication (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f3">3</xref>).</p><p>To define the PCNA-interacting region within XRCC1, we designed a series of XRCC1 protein fragments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f4">4</xref>A). Following partial purification (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f4">4</xref>B), these fragments were immobilized onto Ni&#x02013;NTA&#x02013;agarose and examined for their ability to capture PCNA. In these studies, untagged PCNA was pulled down by full-length XRCC1, as well as by XNTD and MD, but not by NTD, BLB or BRCT2, as determined by anti-PCNA western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f4">4</xref>C, see arrow). This experiment defines the region between the N-terminal and BRCT1 domains of XRCC1 (residues 166&#x02013;310) as the interacting site for PCNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We report here that XRCC1 co-localizes with PCNA replication-specific foci, that these two proteins co-purify from human whole cell extracts and that XRCC1 physically interacts with PCNA <italic>in vitro</italic> via residues within 166&#x02013;310 of XRCC1. Our finding brings the total number of XRCC1-interacting protein partners to at least eight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f5">5</xref>A and legend). While XRCC1 lacks a consensus PCNA interaction sequence (i.e. the PIP- or KA-box), other proteins without a consensus motif (e.g. Gadd45 and CAF1) have also been found to associate with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c31">31</xref>). Moreover, the PCNA-interacting region found here (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f5">5</xref>A) overlaps the portion of XRCC1 shown to interact with APE1 and OGG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c13">13</xref>). Thus, elaborate mechanisms presumably exist to modulate the interactions of these various repair and regulatory proteins.</p><p>Both Caldecott and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c17">17</xref>) and Kubota and Horiuchi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c16">16</xref>) have suggested an S phase-specific role for XRCC1. In fact (as shown here in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f1">1</xref>), Taylor <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c15">15</xref>), using indirect immunofluorescence, observed S phase-specific XRCC1 foci, which they suggest are connected to RAD51 and DNA recombination. Our results indicate that such XRCC1 foci are associated with replication factories. Since Rad51 nuclear foci are seen exclusively in the S phase of undamaged human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c38">38</xref>), the data in total may suggest that replication, repair and recombination are strategically intertwined. We propose that the S phase-specific XRCC1 foci reflect PCNA-directed sequestration of XRCC1 into strand break repair complexes that are associated with translocating DNA replication machines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f5">5</xref>B).</p><p>While we cannot exclude a role for XRCC1 in replication reinitiation, particularly following DNA damage induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c16">16</xref>), our &#x02018;replication-coupled repair&#x02019; model is consistent with the observation that EM9 cells do not exhibit hypersensitivity to hydroxyurea, an agent used to evaluate the contribution of genetic factors to replication restart (H.-K. Wong and D.M. Wilson III, unpublished observations). In other words, XRCC1 does not appear to maintain a universal role in replication reinitiation. Moreover, since evidence suggests that XRCC1 is not a major participate in long patch, PCNA-dependent BER events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c39">39</xref>), the XRCC1&#x02013;PCNA foci seen here likely do not represent sites of &#x02018;conventional&#x02019; long patch BER. While there is evidence that PCNA co-localizes to sites of atypical SSBs following DNA damage induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c26">26</xref>), these findings are not directly relevant to our studies, where exogenous DNA-damaging agent exposures were not employed. Nonetheless, they may suggest a cooperative role between XRCC1 and PCNA in certain SSBR processes outside of DNA replication.</p><p>A role for XRCC1 in specifically coordinating repair and replication is supported by the facts that XRCC1 mutant cells (i) exhibit an increased doubling time (from 13 to 16 h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c1">1</xref>) and (ii) display, as a hallmark, markedly elevated SCEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c40">40</xref>). In particular, spontaneous or EMS-induced SCEs are increased 7- to 12-fold in EM9 cells relative to their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c41">41</xref>). While the precise molecular mechanism for SCEs is unclear, this genetic outcome is thought to result from homologous recombination repair of SSBs converted to DSBs upon replication fork collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c42">42</xref>). PARP-1, for instance, has been shown to suppress SCEs by promoting efficient repair as opposed to regulating homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c43">43</xref>), and this protein, like XRCC1 (data within), has been linked to chromosome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c46">46</xref>). On the other hand, POL&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> cells, which are also presumably defective in nick/gap DNA repair, exhibit no increase in spontaneous SCEs and only a mild (2-fold) increase in SCEs upon exposure to the alkylating agent MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c47">47</xref>). Thus, the data in total suggest (i) unique functions for XRCC1 and PARP-1 in strand break repair, which we propose to be coordination of repair with replication, and (ii) that polymerases other than POL&#x003b2; may function in XRCC1-associated SSBR during S phase.</p><p>Published data clearly indicate distinct roles for XRCC1 in the G<sub>1</sub> and S phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c17">17</xref>). As described above, we propose a model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f5">5</xref>B) where in S phase XRCC1 specifically facilitates efficient SSBR through its interaction with PCNA (and progressing replication factories), prior to DNA replication arrest, fork collapse and DSB formation. In G<sub>1</sub>, XRCC1 likely functions to coordinate direct BER/SSBR events (perhaps represented by the non-S phase foci seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f1">1</xref>B). In particular, following PARP-1 relocalization and recruitment of XRCC1 to the strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c48">48</xref>), XRCC1 operates to organize and &#x02018;scaffold&#x02019; proteins such as POL&#x003b2;, PNK and DNA ligase III&#x003b1; until repair is complete. Notably, among the small set of BER-related proteins analyzed here, the strongest <italic>in vitro</italic> XRCC1 interactor was POL&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh556f3">3</xref>). Since we employed only recombinant proteins purified from bacteria, which do not contain eukaryotic-like post-translational modifications, this finding may suggest that XRCC1 is largely unmodified in G<sub>1</sub> and, in this state, more proficient at interacting with POL&#x003b2;, and potentially DNA ligase III&#x003b1;, to mediate nick and gap DNA repair. Whether XRCC1 undergoes post-translational modification upon entry into S phase or following exposure to a DNA-damaging agent that alters its ability (or affinity) to specifically interact with proteins in repair, replication and/or recombination (such as PARP-1, PCNA and RAD51) awaits further investigation. Importantly, evidence exists for phosphorylation of the XRCC1 polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh556c16">16</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh556f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Localization of XRCC1 and PCNA in HeLa cells.
