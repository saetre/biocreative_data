Previous research has established that the viral oncoprotein Tax mediates the transformation process by impairing cell cycle control and cellular response to DNA damage. We showed previously that Tax sequesters huChk2 within chromatin and impairs the response to ionizing radiation. Here we demonstrate that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a member of the Tax&#x000b7;Chk2 nuclear complex. The catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs, and the regulatory subunit, Ku70, were present. Tax-containing nuclear extracts showed increased DNA-PK activity, and specific inhibition of DNA-PK prevented Tax-induced activation of Chk2 kinase activity. Expression of Tax induced foci formation and phosphorylation of H2AX. However, Tax-induced constitutive signaling of the DNA-PK pathway impaired cellular response to new damage, as reflected in suppression of ionizing radiation-induced DNA-PK phosphorylation and &#x003b3;H2AX stabilization. Tax co-localized with phospho-DNA-PK into nuclear speckles and a nuclear excluded Tax mutant sequestered endogenous phospho-DNA-PK into the cytoplasm, suggesting that Tax interaction with DNA-PK is an initiating event. We also describe a novel interaction between DNA-PK and Chk2 that requires Tax. We propose that Tax binds to and stabilizes a protein complex with DNA-PK and Chk2, resulting in a saturation of DNA-PK-mediated damage repair response.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health Public Health Service</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>CA-76595</grant-num> from <grant-sponsor>NCI</grant-sponsor>.

Cellular transformation is attributed to expression of the viral oncoprotein Tax. Although the specific mechanism is not fully known, it is clear that Tax affects diverse cellular processes through direct interaction with various cellular proteins involved in cell cycle control and DNA damage repair response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Recently, in an elegant <italic>ex vivo</italic> model, Sibon <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) demonstrated that HTLV-1-infected (but preneoplastic) CD4+ T-lymphocytes displayed genomic instability that correlated with Tax expression. Thus, strong <italic>in vivo</italic> data exist implicating expression of Tax and the loss of genomic integrity as a pathway to development of ATL.</p><p>Studies showing increased mutation frequency in both Tax-expressing mammalian cells and yeast provide evidence of genomic instability induced by Tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). These mutations are of a random nature, suggesting impairment of the ability of the cell to repair accumulated DNA damage introduced during its normal life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Furthermore, an increase in persistent DNA breaks is observed in Tax-expressing cells as micronuclei, which seems to occur because of Tax-induced loss of cellular DNA repair function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Several observations have prompted diverse models as to how Tax impairs cellular repair response. Tax represses transcription of DNA polymerase &#x003b2;, an enzyme involved specifically in base excision repair, and base excision repair is suppressed in HTLV-1-transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Tax also suppresses nucleotide excision repair, which correlates with its ability to <italic>trans</italic>-activate proliferating cell nuclear antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Transcriptional repression of human telomerase (hTert) by Tax may inhibit the addition of telomeric repeats to stabilize the ends of double-stranded DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). In addition, a reduction or loss of expression of two or more mismatch repair genes was observed in primary ATL leukemic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>).</p><p>There is also evidence that the ability of Tax to induce micronuclei is dependent on Ku86, a component of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway employed for DNA double strand break (DSB) repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Ku86 and Ku70 form the regulatory subunit of DNA-PK, an enzyme with a critical role in NHEJ repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). We showed previously that Tax interacts with Chk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>), a downstream target of DNA-PK, and subsequently demonstrated Tax-induced impairment of the Chk2-mediated response to exogenous DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Collectively, these studies demonstrate the wide-ranging effects that Tax has on the capacity of the cell to respond appropriately to DNA damage.</p><p>In this study, we have identified a novel physical interaction between Tax and DNA-PK. We show that Tax co-localizes in nuclear speckles with forms of the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) that are phosphorylated at Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 and that these phosphorylated forms are increased in Tax-expressing cells. Tax is required for formation of a DNA-PK/Chk2 interaction and inhibition of DNA-PK ablated Tax activation of Chk2, implying that DNA-PK mediates this Tax activity. Tax expression alone resulted in increased steady-state levels of phospho-DNA-PKcs and phosphorylated histone 2AX (&#x003b3;-H2AX). However, the ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) formation and -fold induction of phospho-DNA-PK in response to ionizing radiation (IR) is repressed in the presence of Tax. We provide evidence that Tax elicits its action via physical binding and constitutive stabilization of phosphorylated DNA-PK. Collectively, these data demonstrate that through direct interaction with DNA-PK, Tax subverts a normal cellular DNA damage response by saturation of naive DNA-PK.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Plasmids</italic>&#x02014;The S-tagged expression vectors <italic>STaxGFP</italic> and <italic>SGFP</italic> were constructed by inserting the <italic>tax-EGFP</italic> fusion or <italic>EGFP</italic> open reading frame, respectively, into the SmaI site of <italic>pTriEx4-Neo</italic> (Novagen, Madison, WI) in-frame with the amino-terminal S-tag and His tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>).

In the current study, we purified S-tagged Tax protein along with interacting cellular factors and resolved these protein complexes by SDS-PAGE and visualization by silver staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Individual bands corresponding to proteins that interact with Tax were excised from the gel, and the proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis.

In addition, immunoblot analysis showed that the steady-state levels of native DNA-PKcs protein were unaffected by Tax (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). However, when we assessed phosphorylated forms of DNA-PKcs in the presence of Tax, we observed a dramatic increase in steady-state levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus, phosphorylation of endogenous DNA-PK at Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 resulted from the expression of Tax alone without external DNA damage agents. Furthermore, these phosphorylated forms of DNA-PK co-localized with Tax in nuclear structures, which we have previously termed Tax speckled structures (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Phosphorylated DNA-PK is present in characteristic nuclear foci only in the Tax-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>).

Our laboratory and others have shown that Tax interacts with Chk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>) and increases its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). To determine the role of DNA-PK in mediating Tax activation of Chk2, we measured the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase activity of Chk2. The basal activity of Chk2 in rabbit reticulocyte lysates has been attributed previously to the presence of DNA-PK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>).

These data establish that activation of DNA-PK in Tax-expressing cells is sufficient for the observed increase in Chk2 kinase activity.</p><p><italic>Tax Expression Is Coincident with DNA-PK Phosphorylation and</italic> &#x003b3;<italic>-H2AX Expression</italic>&#x02014;The formation of &#x003b3;-H2AX nuclear foci at the site of DNA strand breaks is an early cellular response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). Direct IR-induced phosphorylation of H2AX can be carried out efficiently by DNA-PK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Because we observed increased DNA-PK activity in Tax-expressing cells, we asked whether phosphorylation of the DNA-PK substrate H2AX was increased concomitantly. Strikingly, immunofluorescence experiments using confocal microscopy showed that Tax-expressing cells have a strong induction of &#x003b3;-H2AX as compared with non-Tax-expressing cells in the absence of an external source of DNA damage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). The images were digitally overexposed to reveal background staining of the non-Tax-expressing cells.

Thus, in the absence of any exogenous DNA damage, Tax expression results in increased steady-state levels of &#x003b3;-H2AX. We next addressed the impact that Tax expression would have on the &#x003b3;-H2AX response to exogenous DNA damage. Nuclear lysates of mock-transfected cells harvested at various time points post-irradiation show peak H2AX phosphorylation at 1 h post-IR, decreasing at 12 h, and returning to pre-IR levels before 24 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). The increase in &#x003b3;-H2AX is directly related to the availability of naive unphosphorylated H2AX and is a common feature of cells with a competent DNA damage response. In contrast, the temporal regulation of &#x003b3;-H2AX induction is delayed in Tax-expressing cells such that peak levels of H2AX phosphorylation are not reached until 12 h post-IR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). Furthermore, although the peak &#x003b3;-H2AX induction is 3.5-fold higher than pre-IR levels in mock-transfected cells, Tax-expressing cells achieve only a 1.4-fold increase in &#x003b3;-H2AX in response to IR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>).

We evaluated the change in phospho-DNA-PK(pS2609) as a quantitative measure of the response to exogenous damage in Tax-expressing cells. As expected, we show that nuclear levels of phospho-DNA-PK(pS2609) increase directly proportional to the extent of exposure to IR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). The -fold increase in phospho-DNA-PK(pS2609) in response to 10 Gy (2.9-fold) is greater than to 2 Gy (1.8-fold) in mock-transfected cells. Also note that the -fold increase in phospho-DNA-PK(pS2609) between Tax-expressing cells and non-expressing cells (4.8-fold) in the absence of IR is comparable to the increase in response to 10 Gy IR. However, in Tax-expressing cells, the -fold increase in phospho-DNA-PK(pS2609) is suppressed at both low and high IR exposure (1.1-fold). Thus, Tax suppresses the quantitative change in phosphorylated DNA-PK in response to exogenous sources of DNA damage.</p><p>We extended this analysis to the chromatin-bound fraction of DNA-PK.

As was the case for nuclear fraction, Tax expression alone induced an increase in phosphorylation of DNA-PK as well as &#x003b3;-H2AX. This increase was comparable with that seen following 10 Gy exposure in non-Tax-expressing cells. However, the quantitative response to IR in Tax-expressing cells was severely muted. The relative change in DNA-PK phosphorylation, calculated based upon densitometry, is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>.

Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we examined the localization of the phospho-DNA-PK(pT2609) in the presence of wild type Tax and a Tax mutant that is deleted of the native nuclear localization signal and expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm (Tax&#x00394;NLS). Interestingly, phospho-DNA-PK relocates to the cytoplasm in the presence of the cytoplasm-restricted Tax deletion mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The interaction between the cytoplasm-restricted Tax mutant and phospho-DNA-PK is stable enough to redistribute DNA-PK to the cytoplasm. Thus, it appears that the binding between Tax and DNA-PK is robust enough to account for and facilitate cellular redistribution via molecular sequestration.</p><p>We have suggested that Tax binds to DNA-PK and co-opts the protein into a phosphorylated constitutively active state. The result is induction of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. If this model is correct then the Tax mutant that is unable to target to nuclear speckles should not activate the foci even though this mutant can still bind to phospho-DNA-PK. To test this hypothesis we expressed Tax&#x00394;NLS in cells and observed the resulting activation of H2AX. In <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> we show that the dramatic increase in steady-state levels of &#x003b3;-H2AX due to Tax expression is not reproduced by the nuclear excluded Tax mutant. This failure is observable at early time points, indicating that the initial events of H2AX activation are ablated. Although the cytoplasmic DNA-PK remains phosphorylated at extended times post-IR (8 h), there is no indication of induction in &#x003b3;H2AX (see supplemental Fig. 1).

Impairment of the DSB repair pathway can lead to gross genomic abnormalities exacerbated by premature entry of cells into mitosis before DSBs are repaired, by the rejoining of DSBs on different chromosomes, fusion of chromosome ends with eroded telomeres, or defective repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Along with playing a key role in DNA repair via NHEJ, DNA-PK is also involved in other important responses to DSBs, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Because of the central role it plays in genomic integrity, DNA-PK has been suggested as a potential target for Tax-induced genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Our observation that Tax binds specifically to DNA-PK provides a critical component in the development of this model for impaired cellular responses to DNA damage and presentation of genomic instability.</p><p>DNA-PK consists of an &#x0223c;470-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a regulatory subunit composed of the Ku70 and Ku86 heterodimer. The activation of DNA-PK is tightly regulated so that recognition of DNA damage activates the response cascade. Specifically, initial DNA end synapsis occurs prior to (and in fact it activates) DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation and kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). Autophosphorylation at Ser-2056 and Thr-2609, which is facilitated by Ku, activates the kinase and is a key event for the regulation of DNA-PK function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). However, the relationship among autophosphorylation, kinase activation, and a functional damage response is not a simple on-off mechanism. For instance, it has been observed that activated autophosphorylated DNA-PKcs must separate from the DNA ends to allow for ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). This insures that DNA-PK is activated only in the presence of damaged DNA, facilitated by the presence of the Ku heterodimer at the broken DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). Thus, in addition to initiating the kinase signal cascade, autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs promotes disassembly of the protein-DNA complex at the end of the repair process and presumably initiates recycling of the component proteins for future repair events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>). Clearly, appropriate dephosphorylation and timely factor recycling are critical in providing DNA-PK in a naive ready state for response to new damage. Disruption in the delicate coordinated timing of DNA repair and DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation/activation would result in significant impairment of the DNA repair response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). In fact, sustained hyperphosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 results in increased sustained damage, indicating that prolonged phosphorylation is detrimental to DNA-PK repair function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>). Interestingly, elevated DNA-PK activity has been correlated previously with a number of human cancers with both metastatic and multidrug-resistant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>).

Thus our observation that Tax induced sustained activation of DNA-PK is consistent with a model for impaired damage response. If Tax binding to DNA-PK interferes with recycling of repair factors for additional rounds of repair, the result could be manifest as genomic instability and supportive of cellular transformation and development of ATL.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Chromatin-bound DNA-PK co-precipitates with Chk2 in the presence of Tax.</bold><italic>A</italic>, cells were co-transfected with S-Chk2 expression plasmids and either Tax (<italic>HpX</italic>) or control (<italic>vector</italic>) plasmid.

Conversely, Tax-expressing cells displayed a prolonged duration of IRIF as evidenced by phosphorylated DNA-PK and H2AX. Most significantly, however, may be the finding that the -fold response to IR was dramatically reduced in Tax-expressing cells, implying a reduced capacity to respond to DNA damage. The likelihood of such a scenario was bolstered by our observation of decreased survival of Tax-expressing cells following exposure to IR.</p><p>In addition to the direct effects upon DNA damage recognition and repair, DNA-PK is an early mediator of cell cycle arrest via activation of Chk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). Our laboratory has shown that constitutive expression of hyperphosphorylated Chk2 by Tax leads to delayed cell cycle progression through the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) and an impaired response to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Persistent activation of cell cycle checkpoints, such as we observed in Tax-expressing cells, is a common early step in tumorigenesis that is generally associated with genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>). Our discovery that DNA-PK, a known upstream activator of Chk2, is a major component of Tax&#x000b7;Chk2 complexes provides for a clearer mechanistic understanding of how Tax impacts cellular damage response and checkpoint activation. Furthermore, we clearly show that Tax induces a stable interaction between DNA-PK and Chk2. Thus, we propose that Tax physically stabilizes phosphorylated DNA-PK and subsequently phosphorylated Chk2, which results in a saturation of DNA-PK signaling and, by inference, supports a Bloom syndrome-like state.</p><p>Another target of DNA-PK is the tumor suppressor p53, which has been shown to be phosphorylated by DNA-PK on serine residues 15 and 37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>). Incidentally, there is significant evidence that Tax can inactivate p53 function through a proposed mechanism involving hyperphosphorylation of p53 at serines 15 and 392, which interferes with the function of p53 as a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>). Although it has been proposed that DNA-PK could mediate the phosphorylation mechanism through which Tax inactivates p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>), a separate study found that Tax-mediated p53 inactivation still occurs in DNA-PKcs-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>). However, because of overlapping roles of DNA-PK with other DNA damage response proteins, ATM and ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>), we would suggest that other redundant damage response mediators compensated for the lack of DNA-PK in these knock-out systems. Thus, it is entirely possible that DNA-PK mediates the observed effects of Tax on p53.</p><p>DNA-PK is also critical for telomere capping, and DNA-PK-deficiency promotes increased chromosomal instability with telomeric fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref>). Telomerase inactivation, via Tax-mediated repression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTert) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), would promote unstabilized telomeres, which could result in end-to-end chromosomal fusions in the context of increased DNA-PK activity, leading to the cytogenetic abnormalities observed in HTLV-1-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref>). Consequently, Tax-expressing cells display frequent unstabilized DNA breaks detected as unprotected free 3&#x02032;-OH DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>).</p><p>An immediate question to address is why a retrovirus would target the NHEJ DNA repair pathway. To fully explore this issue it is important to recall that clonal expansion is a critical component of HTLV-1 biology. Specifically, cell-free <italic>de novo</italic> infection by HTLV-1 is a rare event, and numeric propagation of infected cells occurs via clonal expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref>). Thus, a survival advantage to the virus would be realized via facilitation of cellular expansion. A DSB is especially harmful to cells, in large part because of the propensity to form genetic translocations (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>). As a result of the severity of gene translocations, a failure to repair DSBs primarily leads to cell death or neoplastic transformation. Because the opportunity for DSBs increases with cell replication, clonal expansion would result in increased exposure to DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref>). In this scenario, suppression of NHEJ may constitute a selective advantage by avoiding recognition-initiated apoptosis. Interestingly, NHEJ repair gene knockouts uniformly result exclusively in T-cell tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">77</xref>), suggesting that the link among NHEJ, defective DSB repair, and clonal expansion may be particularly linear in the HTLV-1 host cell type. The isolation of V(D)J inversion events, a hallmark of DSB repair defects in lymphocytes, from patient-isolated ATL cells is strong evidence for the intimate role of NHEJ function and ATL development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">78</xref>). Thus, resistance to damage repaired via the NHEJ pathway by HTLV-1 Tax may contribute to the endurance of HTLV-infected cells. So in this scenario HTLV-1 avoids DNA damage-mediated apoptotic host elimination at the risk of increased host genomic instability and cellular transformation. However, this is likely an evolutionarily beneficial trade-off because ATL events arise in less than 3% of infected individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M804931200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M804931200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Edward Johnson and Ann Campbell for helpful comments.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Gessain, A., Barin, F., Vernant, J.
