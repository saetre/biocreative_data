Apoptosis is one of secondary SCI mechanisms and it is thought to play an important role for the delayed neuronal injury. The enhanced formation of nitric oxide (NO) via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of apoptosis in SCI. The level of .iNOS mRNA peaked at 6 hr after SCI and it declined until 72 hr after SCI in a rat model. Double-immunofluorescence staining revealed that iNOS positive cells were stained for ED-1, synaptophysin, GFAP, and oligodendrocyte marker. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUDP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) positive cell count was higher for the 72 hr post-SCI group than for the 24 hr post-SCI group. This cell count was also higher going in the caudal direction than in the rostral direction from the epicenter, and especially for the 72 hr group. Treatment with a selective iNOS inhibitor resulted in the reduction of TUNEL-positive cells at the lesion site. These findings suggest that nitric oxide generated by the iNOS of macrophages, neurons, oligodentrocytes, and astrocytes plays an important role for the acute secondary SCI that results from apoptotic cell death.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>inducible nitric oxide synthase</kwd><kwd>Spinal Cord Injuries</kwd><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Rats</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It is generally accepted that acute spinal cord ingury (SCI) is a two-step process involving primary and secondary injury mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The primary injury is caused by the initial mechanical insult due to the local deformation and energy transformation. The secondary cord injury is mediated by a cascade of biochemical and cellular processes that are initiated by the primary process and these secondary processes exacerbate tissue damage and limit the restorative processes. Various theories have been proposed concerning the biochemical and cellular mechanisms of secondary SCI. In the 1970s, the free radical mechanism was thought to be important in secondary SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In the 1980s, however, the roles of calcium, opiate receptors and lipid peroxidation became the focus of research. Modern research suggests that apoptosis, intracellular protein synthesis inhibition, and glutaminergic mechanisms play important roles in the mediation of secondary SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Apoptosis of neurons is caused by growth factor deprivation, ischemia, hyperthermia, hypercalcemia, excitotoxin, and active free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Understanding the apoptotic pathway, which is one of the mechanisms involved in delayed SCI, may contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies against the delayed neurologic deficit and the progression of cord injury.</p><p>Apoptosis in SCI was first recognized in 1997 as occurring in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Emery et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) reported that apoptosis was observed in the area adjacent to the injured site along the ascending and descending nerve bundles of the white matter, and they suggested that the oligodendrocytes are the major cell type to undergo apoptosis during spinal cord compression injury. Their proposal supported the report showing that oligodendroglial death may be the result of microglial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is known to be closely involved in the development of post-traumatic spinal cord cavitation as well as playing an important role in the development of the pathological process in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). NO-mediated cell injury occurs via both the necrotic and apoptotic pathways, according to the severity of the cellular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Hamada et al. have reported that the NO produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is neurotoxic, whereas the NO produced by the nNOS is neuroprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). A consensus has been reached that eNOS acts as a neuroprotective agent in the central nervous system (CNS) injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). However, there is still debates about the actions of iNOS and nNOS in CNS injury. The concentration range, the redox state, the cell type source, and the environment in which the NO is produced seem to determine the role of NO in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The aim of this study is to elucidate the actions of iNOS in parallel with the actions of nNOS, in the pathogenesis of secondary lesions after SCI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Operation procedure</title><p>Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 220-250 g were used as experimental animals. A modified version of Allen's method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) was applied to create a contusion injury model. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.), immobilized in a stereotaxic instrument (Stoelting, Wood Dale, Illinois, U.S.A.) and laminectomy was performed at the T8-T10 level. Rats in control group received a laminectomy only (sham operation). In experimental group, a 10 g stainless steel cylinder with a flat tip of 2 mm diameter was dropped from a height of 5 cm on their exposed dura.

The caudal side of the spinal cord showed more prominent maximum than the rostral side. However, nNOS mRNA did not show such changes as iNOS mRNA. nNOS mRNA showed constitutive expression in both traumatic and sham operation group and showed same expression pattern in both caudal and rostral side also (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Morphologic features</title><p>Hematoxylin-eosin staining and luxol-fast blue staining of spinal cord sections showed that trauma induced a wide destruction of white and gray matter accompanied by massive hemorrhage.

In the 24 hr group, the TUNEL positive cell count was 42.87&#x000b1;14.075 before iNOS inhibition, which it was 42.38&#x000b1;8.520 after iNOS inhibition. In the 72 hr group, the TUNEL positive-cell count was 195.20&#x000b1;27.759 before iNOS inhibition, whereas it was 29.30&#x000b1;11.286 after iNOS inhibition. These results suggest that after iNOS inhibition, the TUNEL positive cell count decreased significantly in the 72 hr group (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), however, the TUNEL positive cell count did not decrease in the 6 hr group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). To verify iNOS inhibition of SMT, anti-nitrotyrosine staining after treatment of SMT was done. Also, anti-nitrotyrosine staining revealed markedly reduced NO production after iNOS inhibition (data not shown).</p><p>Few TUNEL-positive cells were observed in sham operation group. The number of TUNEL-positive cells per section has increased until 72 hr after contusion. The number of TUNEL positive cells was larger in the 72 hr group (mean count: 123.58&#x000b1;10.46) than the 24 hr group (mean count: 31.10&#x000b1;4.89). This result suggests that cell death after trauma increases until 72 hr. In the 24 hr group, TUNEL-positive cell count did not show significant difference between the cord levels (2 mm rostral from epicenter (R1), 25.10&#x000b1;8.82; 4 mm rostral (R2), 28.40&#x000b1;10.29; 6 mm rostral (R3), 20.00&#x000b1;6.36; and 8 mm rostral (R4), 30.10&#x000b1;8.86; 2 mm caudal (C1), 79.70&#x000b1;27.36; 4 mm caudal (C2), 43.60&#x000b1;14.25; 6 mm caudal (C3), 11.70&#x000b1;4.98; and 8 mm caudal (C4), 10.20&#x000b1;3.72). In the 72 hr group, TUNEL-positive cell count showed no significant difference between the cord levels (2 mm rostral from epicenter (R1), 128.64&#x000b1;28.43; 4 mm rostral (R2), 122.43&#x000b1;34.25; 6 mm rostral (R3), 58.64&#x000b1;19.89; and 8 mm rostral (R4), 79.43&#x000b1;24.31; 2 mm caudal (C1), 176.43&#x000b1;34.59; 4 mm caudal (C2), 159.21&#x000b1;29.58; 6 mm caudal (C3), 106.36&#x000b1;28.52; and 8 mm caudal (C4), 103.50&#x000b1;26.34). In the 24 hr group, the TUNEL-positive cell count showed the same distribution pattern in both rostral (mean count: 35.90&#x000b1;4.22) and caudal side (mean count: 36.30&#x000b1;8.82). However, in the 72 hr group, the TUNEL-positive cell count was larger in the caudal side (mean count: 149.88&#x000b1;15.01) than rostral side (mean count: 97.29&#x000b1;13.82) and this result was statistically significant The number of TUNEL positive cells in gray matter was larger in the 72 hr group (mean count: 129.48&#x000b1;12.33) than the 24 hr group (mean count 20.13&#x000b1;6.31).

According to real time RT-PCR, the iNOS mRNA peaked at 6 hr, decreased at 24 hr, and then returned to control levels 72 hr after SCI. This result is concordant with that of Satake et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, the nNOS expression was constitutive in both the control and experimental groups. Double-labeling iNOS antibody with cell markers revealed that microglial cells, neurons, and some astroglial cells expressed iNOS protein in their cytoplasms after SCI. According to this study, all the cell types present in the traumatized spinal cord seemed to play a role in producing NO via iNOS, and this result does not coincide with the results of Wada et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). They reported that after traumatic brain injury, the major cellular sources of iNOS are the astrocytes and macrophages. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed an aberrant neuronal expression of nNOS during the time course. We first demonstrated the aberrant spatial expression of nNOS in neurons following SCI. However, the reason for this result remain unclear. nNOS is actually protective against cell death and it is constantly expressed in neurons, yet the aberrant neuronal expression of nNOS may result in the loss of its neuroprotective role. Further study is needed to prove this proposal. iNOS is a known inducer of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway that brings about caspase-3 activation and affects apoptosis. Therefore, we observed the effect of iNOS on neuronal and glial apoptosis, and this led us to conclude that the neurologic deficit may continue for up to 72 hr after trauma because iNOS mRNA was observed for up to 72 hr. In addition, the neurologic deficit progresses in both directions and it may be more detrimental in the caudal side than in the rostral side at 72 hr after SCI. This was shown by the findings where the TUNEL positive cell count was higher in the caudal side than in the rostral side. SMT was injected intraperitoneally at 6 hr and 72 hr after SCI, because the iNOS mRNA peaked at 6 hr after SCI, and the apoptosis peaked at 72 hr after SCI. After selective iNOS inhibition was induced, the apoptosis was reduced in the 72 hr group, but not in the 6 hr group. We can suppose that until 72 hr, other factors instead of iNOS may induce apoptosis, and iNOS, may induce apoptosis after 72 hr following SCI. We also verified that iNOS is involved in delayed neuronal and glial cell death, in part via the apoptotic signaling in SCI. Therefore, the inhibition of the iNOS activity may have a beneficial effect on reducing the acute secondary SCI, and the iNOS inhibition should be done before 6 hr post-SCI.</p><p>By employing luxol fast blue staining, the destructive changes in the epicenter were observed to be more severe in the gray matter than in the white matter. This might be due to the softer consistency and the greater vascularity of the gray matter as has been mentioned previously by Wolman (<xref ref-type="bibr"
