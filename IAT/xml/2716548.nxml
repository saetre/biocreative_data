Here we illustrate that inflammation within the intestine enhanced the level of BMDC fusion with intestinal progenitors. To identify important microenvironmental factors mediating intestinal epithelial cell fusion, we performed bone marrow transplantation into mouse models of inflammation and stimulated epithelial proliferation. Interestingly, in a non-injury model or in instances where inflammation was suppressed, an appreciable baseline level of fusion persisted. This suggests that additional mediators of cell fusion exist. A rigorous temporal analysis of early post-transplantation cellular dynamics revealed that GFP-expressing donor cells first trafficked to the intestine coincident with a striking increase in epithelial proliferation, advocating for a required fusogenic state of the host partner. Directly supporting this hypothesis, induction of augmented epithelial proliferation resulted in a significant increase in intestinal cell fusion. Here we report that intestinal inflammation and epithelial proliferation act together to promote cell fusion. While the physiologic impact of cell fusion is not yet known, the increased incidence in an inflammatory and proliferative microenvironment suggests a potential role for cell fusion in mediating the progression of intestinal inflammatory diseases and cancer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell fusion between bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) and somatic cells has been reported in a number of different organ systems as an intriguing means for tissue regeneration in response to injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-AlvarezDolado1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Weimann1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Together, these observations highlight the existence of an endogenous baseline level of epithelial cell fusion in the intestine, suggesting that the nature of rapidly self-renewing epithelium may sensitize or prime it for fusion with circulating BMDCs under certain microenvironmental conditions. These findings strongly suggest that additional factors are important for the fusion process in the intestine.</p><p>Currently, reports in other organ systems show that baseline levels of cell fusion are relatively non-detectable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Johansson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Nygren2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Nern1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Important differences between these other organ systems and the intestine is that the intestinal epithelium is a rapidly renewing, highly proliferative tissue that dynamically responds to its microenvironment. An additional distinction between the intestine and the other somatic organs lies in the host fusogenic cell. We have previously reported that BMDC fusion occurs with a stem or progenitor population in the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Rizvi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas in other tissues fusion takes place with differentiated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-AlvarezDolado1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Nygren1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Nygren2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Wang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. These differences along with the respective disparity in homeostatic cell fusion levels suggest that host-cell proliferative status may be a factor in the fusion process. It is well established that &#x003b3;-IR elicits intestinal microenvironmental inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Molla1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, and that the epithelium undergoes massive apoptosis that peaks within the first 24 h post-irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Potten1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> accompanied by a proliferative response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Potten2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken along with our observation that fusion is increased in a tumor setting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Rizvi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, these elements implicate cell death or proliferation signals as possible additional factors that promote cell fusion.</p><p>To gain additional insights from the pre-fusion intestinal microenvironment, we detailed the temporal events surrounding the generation of cell fusion hybrids. The dynamic trafficking of GFP-expressing BMDCs to the intestine was defined at various early time points post-transplantation. Since our initial observations implicated progenitor cells as the host fusion partner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Rizvi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, we focused our analyses on the stem cell niche. At 1 day post-transplant, the first detectable GFP-positive BMDCs were present scattered around the crypt region in the intestinal mesenchymal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>; arrowheads). By 4 days post-transplant, an appreciable level of GFP-expressing BMDCs populated the intestine, but GFP-expressing epithelium was not yet observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g003">Figure 3E, F</xref>; arrowheads). Cell fusion in the epithelial compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g003">Figure 3J</xref>; yellow brackets and arrowheads) was routinely detected 7 days post-transplant and was accompanied by high levels of GFP-expressing cells in the mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g003">Figure 3I,J</xref>; red arrowheads). The arrival of GFP-expressing BMDCs into the intestine coincided with a striking increase in proliferation of the intestinal epithelium, appreciated both histologically by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining and by Ki67 antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g003">Figure 3C,D,G,H,K,L</xref>; yellow brackets). Intriguingly, the dramatic proliferative epithelial response coincident with clustering of GFP-expressing BMDCs in the stem cell niche suggested that intestinal cell fusion may also be governed by the proliferative status of the recipient cell.</p><fig id="pone-0006530-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006530.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Increased epithelial proliferation occurred after gamma-irradiation.</title><p>Wild-type (WT) mice were transplanted with GFP-expressing whole bone marrow (WBM).

However, in other tissues where cell fusion occurs after &#x003b3;-IR, it is reported that the host fusion partner is a differentiated cell type that is not known to be actively cycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-AlvarezDolado1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Johansson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Wang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Based upon this observation and our data in the intestine, we hypothesized that host cell proliferative status is important in driving cell fusion. Therefore, to determine if entry into the cell cycle might also be stimulated in a subset of other organs after &#x003b3;-IR, we surveyed for cycling cells in the liver and skeletal muscle using antibodies to Ki67. A visible increase of Ki67-positive cells was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006530.s007">Figure S7</xref>), further supporting the idea that cell cycle status of the host cell within these organs may also mediate cell fusion.</p><p>Therefore, to directly implicate epithelial proliferative status as a contributing host factor in promoting cell fusion, we utilized a mouse model in which we could temporally manipulate epithelial proliferation in the intestine. The previously described intestinal-specific, inducible <italic>AhCre</italic> mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Ireland1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> harboring floxed <italic>Apc</italic> alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Shibata1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, results in a dramatic induction of intestinal epithelial proliferation upon Cre activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Sansom1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g004">Figure 4C,E</xref>. We showed by H&#x00026;E that an increase in immune infiltrate was not readily apparent during the timeframe in which epithelial proliferation was stimulated (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g004">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Further, qRT-PCR showed that there was not an increase in inflammation in these mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006530.s008">Table S1</xref>). To evaluate cell fusion in this proliferative model, we transplanted <italic>AhCre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>;Apc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice on day 0, induced epithelial proliferation on day 2, then analyzed cell fusion in the intestine on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Dramatically, a significant increase in epithelial cell fusion within the crypt and villus, compared to mock-injected controls, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g004">Figure 4F&#x02013;K</xref>). Cell fusion in crypt/villus units displayed three distinct patterns: fusion restricted to the crypts, fusion on the villus only, and fusion in both crypt and villus epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g004">Figure 4G&#x02013;J</xref>). Differences in each of these three patterns were significant when compared to mock-injected control intestines (crypt: <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.056; villus: <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.011; crypt/villus: <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.009; mock injected <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5, <italic>AhCre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>;Apc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7). Because the induction of proliferation occurs over a window of 4 days, the differences in the crypt, villus or crypt/villus fusion expression patterns likely represented different kinetics of cell fusion and subsequent expansion of progeny. For example, it is possible that fusion in the crypt epithelium represents an initial fusion event in a proliferative cell that occurred only a short time before analysis (perhaps on day 5&#x02013;6). Likewise, GFP-expressing epithelia in both the crypt and villus might represent an early fusion event in a crypt-based progenitor cell, perhaps on day 2. Notably, crypt-based differentiated Paneth cells which have a &#x0003e;20 day turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Cheng1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, remain unmarked and are not descendents from the cell fusion event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g004">Figure 4J</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0006530-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006530.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Increased epithelial proliferation correlates with increased cell fusion.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of experimental design. <italic>AhCre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>;Apc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were transplanted with GFP-expressing whole bone marrow (WBM) on day 0.

Noticeably, each crypt/villus unit had extensive GFP-expressing cells which could argue for a more rapid expansion of progeny from the original fusion event. However, the fact that there were significantly more total crypt/villus units harboring at least one GFP-expressing cell indicated there were also more initial cell fusion events (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.009). Our assay cannot distinguish between whether the host fusion target is a progenitor or if it is a cell actively engaged in the cell cycle. Regardless, our data indicates that the host cell must be receptive or primed for the fusion process. Importantly, these observations suggest that proliferative capacity of the host cell contributes to promote cell fusion in the intestinal epithelium.</p><p>Perhaps the most pressing question relating to <italic>in vivo</italic> cell fusion is if the generated cell fusion hybrids have a physiologic impact on normal organ function. Although it is apparent that these intestinal cell fusion hybrids retain an overt epithelial phenotype, it is unclear if the BMDC transcriptome is modified. To explore the possibility that cell fusion results in nuclear reprogramming of the donor genome, we transplanted WBM from mice harboring a <italic>Villin-Cre</italic> transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Madison1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> into recipient mice homozygous for the floxed <italic>Apc</italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Shibata1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Villin is an epithelial-specific promoter and Cre recombinase is not expressed in any of the blood lineages under this context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Madison1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, functional Cre recombination of the <italic>Apc</italic> allele would only occur if Cre recombinase were activated, such as in the event of cell fusion between the BMDC (<italic>Villin-Cre</italic>) and the epithelial cell. The intestines from transplanted mice possessed hyperproliferative epithelial regions in both the distal small intestine and colon appreciated by wholemount analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g005">Figure 5B,D</xref>) and morphologically by H&#x00026;E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006530-g005">Figure 5C,E</xref>). The polyp-like region in the distal small intestine was reminiscent of Min mouse polyps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006530-Moser1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> where the <italic>Apc</italic> allele is mutated.

In both the DSI and the colon, a 258 bp amplicon was identified, confirming that Cre recombinase had been activated within the tissue. This observation not only strongly supports the occurrence of cell fusion, but it importantly illustrated that these cell fusion hybrids can reprogram BMDC gene expression by activating an epithelial-specific promoter. While this functional evidence supports the implication that cell fusion can create a genetically distinct hybrid cell, the extent of reprogramming of the genome remains an intriguing and important future focus of investigation.</p><fig id="pone-0006530-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006530.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Bone-marrow/epithelial cell fusion causes genetic reprogramming.</title><p>(A) Schematic diagram of transplantation scheme.

Further, we demonstrate that intestinal cell fusion with BMDCs is mediated by both inflammation and cellular proliferation. A possible physiologic role for intestinal cell fusion may be to facilitate rapid regeneration of the epithelial barrier after injury. Because the intestinal epithelium is the largest surface barrier to the external environment, barrier maintenace is critical for the organism's survival. If cell fusion participates in this rapid response, the intestine is certainly poised to solicit fusion with both its intrinsic immune capacity and functional proliferation. While previous reports dismiss the importance of cell fusion or tie its potential to therapeutic gene replacement strategies, our data implicates cell fusion in a role to potentially impact inflammatory disease pathogenesis, including inflammatory bowel disease and cancer. Only by understanding the long-term fate of the epithelial cell fusion hybrid will we uncover its physiologic potential in both homeostasis and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment under strictly controlled light cycle conditions, fed a standard rodent Lab Chow (#5001 PMI Nutrition International), and provided water ad libitum.

These images were overlayed (C,F; yellow).

Arrowheads indicate examples of GFP-positive epithelium.

The epithelial cells that are GFP-positive can be appreciated (brackets) when juxtaposed to GFP-negative epithelial regions and are distinct from IELs (arrowheads).
