D6-deficient mice were rapidly killed by intranasal administration of low doses of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. The death of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was associated with a dramatic local and systemic inflammatory response with levels of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> colony-forming units similar to control D6-proficient mice. D6-deficient mice showed an increased numbers of mononuclear cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, and CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes) infiltrating inflamed tissues and lymph nodes, as well as abnormal increased concentrations of CC chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5) and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;, interleukin 1&#x003b2;, and interferon &#x003b3;) in bronchoalveolar lavage and serum. High levels of inflammatory cytokines in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> infected mice were associated with liver and kidney damage, resulting in both liver and renal failure. Blocking inflammatory CC chemokines with a cocktail of antibodies reversed the inflammatory phenotype of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice but led to less controlled growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.

This process is dependent on the activation of mycobacteria-reactive T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), particularly IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;secreting CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Granuloma formation, however, is a complex process that requires not only the activation of lymphocytes, but also their recruitment with monocytes to the site of the infection, migration into the tissues, and juxtaposition around mycobacteria-infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). This colocalization facilitates the activation of bactericidal mechanisms in infected macrophages by T cell&#x02013;derived cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Some mycobacteria, however, survive within macrophages, and persistent antigenic stimulation perpetuates the process, leading to chronic granuloma formation characterized by dense accumulations of infected macrophages, epithelioid cells, and T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). These granulomas contain the mycobacterial infection and prevent dissemination to other organs, but they are also responsible for lung immunopathology, as the granulomas displace and destroy parenchymal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). One of the major roles of the granuloma is to localize and contain not only the bacteria but also the inflammatory response to the bacteria itself. Indeed, if immune cells are not tightly controlled within the lungs, this could lead to excess inflammation. Thus, rigorous control of the organization of granulomas is likely necessary to prevent immunopathology. In most cases, after the repair of an inflamed or damaged tissue, inflammation subsides and the tissue returns to its homeostatic norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). However, if the resolution phase of inflammation is ineffective, chronic inflammatory pathologies may develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Failure to resolve ongoing inflammation is an invariable key feature of pathologies, which are typically characterized by the high-level expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Therefore, understanding the resolution phase of transient inflammatory responses will probably yield insights into some of these chronic inflammatory pathologies.</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; and the related cytokine lymphotoxin-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) are potent proinflammatory cytokines with a wide range of activities in both the inflammatory and immune responses, and they play an essential role in host resistance against infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and other mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;deficient mice infected by aerosol with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> develop normal T cell responses to mycobacterial antigens, but because of the failure of granuloma formation in the infected organs they are profoundly susceptible to the infection, succumbing with extensive necrosis in the lungs and infected organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Other than TNF-&#x003b1;, the role of other soluble mediators in regulating granuloma formation and persistence is poorly understood. Chemokines and their receptors are involved in cell migration and are logical candidates for a role in granuloma formation, although their expression has been studied to a limited degree in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In general, the production of chemokines at a certain level may be a factor in preventing cell movement out of the granuloma.</p><p>Recently, studies of the D6 chemokine receptor (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) have provided novel insights regarding the mechanism of chemokine removal from inflamed sites. D6 is structurally similar to the other chemokine receptors, and is most homologous to CCR4 and CCR5. However, several properties set D6 apart from other CCRs. First, D6 is extremely promiscuous, recognizing 15 chemokines. Interestingly, all D6 ligands are inflammatory CC chemokines, whereas constitutive CC chemokines, as well as chemokines of other subfamilies, are not recognized. Thus, D6 is a promiscuous receptor with selectivity for inflammatory CC chemokines. Second, the D6 expression pattern is unusual, with the predominant expression sites being trophoblasts in the placenta and lymphatic endothelial cells in the skin, gut, and lung. Third, and most crucially, D6 does not signal in response to the binding of any of its ligands. Conversely, the only apparent function of D6 is to convey the entire ligand&#x02013;receptor complex intracellularly, target the chemokine for degradation, and recycle the receptor to the membrane. This observation, together with the ability of D6 to bind most inflammatory CC chemokines, has resulted in the proposal that D6 functions as a &#x0201c;scavenging&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;decoy&#x0201d; receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), and has suggested a role for D6 in controlling the resolution of CC chemokine&#x02013;driven inflammatory responses. Accordingly, D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice display exaggerated inflammatory responses after skin application of phorbol esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) and subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). In this last model, D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice developed granulomas characterized by angiogenesis, extensive leukocyte infiltration, and prominent areas of necrosis more rapidly and severely than WT counterparts. However, whether D6 plays a similar role in inflammatory responses caused by infectious microorganisms, or has a role in the induction of a protective response to infectious agents, is presently unknown. To test this possibility, we have studied the course of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Expression of the D6 receptor during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection</title><p>Preliminarily, we investigated the expression of the D6 receptor during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. In human lungs and lymph nodes from a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis, D6 expression was observed in lymphatic endothelial cells and only occasionally in scattered leukocytes (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070608/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070608/DC1</ext-link>). In the mouse, qualitative RT-PCR experiments indicated that D6 transcripts in the liver, spleen, and lungs do not undergo significant changes at 4, 8, and 12 wk after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (Fig. S2). These data suggest that D6 is mainly expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells, in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), and that its expression does not change appreciably during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>To determine whether the D6 receptor plays a role in the control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, WT and D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were infected via the intranasal (i.n.) route with 2,000 CFU. This dose did not cause mortality in C57BL/6 mice in our study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice resulted in increased mortality, with &#x0223c;20% of mice succumbing by week 8, 50% of mice succumbing by week 12, and 100% of mice succumbing at week 16, at which time the experiments were terminated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The phenotype of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> was dramatic and was found highly reproducible over a period of 3 yr in two additional experiments performed on a total of 17 mice per group. Despite the exaggerated susceptibility of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, there was no difference between the two groups of mice in bacterial loads, as determined by CFU counts in the lung, liver, and spleen at 2, 4, 8, and 12 wk after infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</bold> (A) Survival curve of WT (closed squares) and D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (open squares) mice infected i.n. with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> CFU <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10).

We then examined by histology the effect of D6 deficiency on the inflammatory response in the lungs, liver, and spleen. Although in WT mice a moderate cellular infiltration was seen at 12 wk after infection and most of the lung airspace remained intact, an exaggerated response was evident in surviving D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Histological analysis also showed a diffuse liver necrosis in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice when compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In agreement with the histology results, at 12 wk after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, serum transaminases were abnormally increased in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Areas of focal necrosis and mononuclear cell infiltrates were also evident in the kidneys (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), and consistent with this, at 12 wk after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection renal function was also severely compromised in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which had significantly higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and frequency of severe proteinuria as compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Of note, although <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth occurred in the liver (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), we failed to detect <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CFU in kidneys of both WT and D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice over a 12-wk period (not depicted). Thus, despite the successful control of the growth of the infecting mycobacteria, D6 deficiency led to increased mortality associated with lung inflammation and combined renal and liver failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Leukocyte infiltration in tissues during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>We examined the cellular infiltrate in the lungs and liver of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. At predetermined time points, organs were removed, the total number of cells was calculated, and flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine cell populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Numbers of DCs (F4/80<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) in the lungs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) were not significantly different between D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT mice. The numbers of macrophages and CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes were significantly higher in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at all time points after infection.

Similar findings were also detected in the liver, although the differences between D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT mice were lower than in the lungs and generally reached significance at 8 and 12 wk after infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Leukocyte recruitment to tissues and lymph nodes after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</bold> Leukocytes were isolated from the lungs (A), livers (B), and mediastinal lymph nodes (C) of WT (closed squares) and D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (open squares) mice and analyzed by flow cytometry at different times after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.

To investigate this possibility, flow cytometric analysis was performed on the mediastinal lymph nodes of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT mice after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, the number of macrophages showed a significant increase in the lymph nodes of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at 4 wk after infection. At 4 and 8 but not 12 wk after infection, there were also statistically significant differences in the total number of DCs in the lymph nodes of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The numbers of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were significantly higher in the lymph nodes of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at 4 and 8 wk after infection, but although the latter constantly increased, the former peaked at week 4 and then decreased. The increased migration of DCs and T lymphocytes to the lymph nodes was expected to result in increased numbers of primed T lymphocytes, followed by migration to the lungs. ELISPOT analysis confirmed this hypothesis, showing that significantly more CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes from the lungs of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were primed to produce IFN-&#x003b3; when stimulated by bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG)&#x02013;infected DCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lungs after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</bold> Lung leukocytes were isolated from WT (closed squares) and D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (open squares) mice at the indicated time points after infection and were restimulated in vitro with irradiated BCG-infected WT DCs for 36&#x02013;40 h at 37&#x000b0;C.

To investigate whether the highly increased levels of chemokines observed in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were involved in the pathogenesis, we attempted to block inflammatory chemokines in vivo. For this purpose, mice were treated with a mixture of antibodies to the CC chemokines CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1&#x003b1;, CCL4/MIP-1&#x003b2;, and CCL5/RANTES, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), or with antibodies to each individual chemokine. On the same days, control mice received i.p. injections of an equivalent amount of irrelevant antibodies. Mice were injected weekly with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, starting from the third week after infection. Following this treatment schedule, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1&#x003b1;, CCL4/MIP-1&#x003b2;, and CCL5/RANTES production in the serum of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was consistently reduced (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070608/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070608/DC1</ext-link>), even below levels detected in WT mice, thus demonstrating the efficacy of the blocking. Conversely, D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice treated with control antibody had very high levels of serum chemokines, as did untreated D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IFN-&#x003b3; levels in serum were also consistently reduced by treatment with antibodies to CC chemokines (Table S1), and cellular influx to the infected tissues significantly decreased (unpublished data). Additionally, both renal and liver function appeared improved by this treatment, as suggested by the low levels of serum transaminases and BUN, and by the low proteinuria detected in these mice (Table S1). Overall, the most impressive consequence of the neutralization of CC chemokines in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was a significantly prolonged survival, as demonstrated by the only 10% mortality at 12 wk and 30% mortality at 16 wk after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). However, in spite of the ability of chemokine-blocking antibodies to reduce the overall inflammatory response (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>), the ability of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice treated in this manner to control the growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the lungs was impaired, with higher CFU counts found at 8 and 12 wk (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>).

It has been proposed that the protective response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection requires CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, the Th1-type cytokines IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;, and activated macrophages (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). The cooperation between the cells and cytokines requires close interaction, which is achieved after migration and granuloma formation in the lungs. The hallmark of infection in the lung is granuloma formation, consisting of clusters of macrophages, lymphocytes, and DCs, which physically contains the mycobacteria and creates a microenvironment for immune cell interaction, limiting <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth and dissemination. Chemokines are potent leukocyte activators and chemoattractants aiding granuloma formation and thought to be critical for the immune response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In vitro experiments demonstrated that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection of bone marrow&#x02013;derived mouse macrophages results in the expression of TNF-&#x003b1;, as well as several chemokines, including ligands for the chemokine receptors CXCR3, CCR5, and CCR2. Neutralization of TNF-&#x003b1; by using antibody or TNFR1-deficient macrophages demonstrated that expression of certain chemokines (CXCL9/monokine induced by IFN-&#x003b3;, CXCL10/IFN-inducible protein 10, CXCL11/IFN-inducible T cell &#x003b1; chemoattractant, CCL5/RANTES, and CCL2/MCP-1) after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection was dependent, at least in part, on TNF-&#x003b1;. However, the lack of TNF-&#x003b1; did not completely abrogate chemokine expression, indicating that there are other factors, induced as a result of infection, that stimulate chemokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>In mouse models, gene expression of CXC and CC chemokines has been detected in the lungs after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). CXCR3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) have an impaired granuloma formation after aerosol infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, although this effect is transient, occurring at the early stages of infection. CCR2-deficient mice are extraordinarily susceptible to moderate- or high-dose <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> administered i.v. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), and susceptibility is dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Conversely, CCR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) may not be essential to the development of a protective response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. CCL2/MCP-1&#x02013;deficient mice did not demonstrate an increased susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, but whether cell infiltration or histology was affected in these mice was not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). However, transgenic mice overexpressing CCL2/MCP-1 were more susceptible to tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).</p><p>The action of chemokines is tightly controlled by decoy receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), which internalize and target chemokines for intracellular degradation, thus avoiding excessive inflammatory responses and the consequent tissue damage. D6 is a decoy receptor that recognizes most inflammatory CC chemokines, implying that it may play a key role in resolving CC chemokine&#x02013;driven inflammatory responses. The results reported in this paper confirm this possibility in a mouse model of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection through the mucosal (i.n.) route and show that D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have an exaggerated inflammatory response leading to death, despite their ability to efficiently control bacterial load. Upon i.n. delivery of low-dose <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, 20% of mice succumbed at week 8, 50% of mice succumbed at week 12, and 100% of mice succumbed at week 16, despite the successful control of the growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacilli. The phenotype of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> was dramatic and was found highly reproducible over a period of 3 yr in two additional experiments performed on a total of 17 mice per group. Moreover, CFU data at 4, 8, and 12 wk after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection were found highly reproducible in two additional independent experiments performed over a period of 2 yr. Mortality in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice coincided with an overwhelming local and systemic inflammatory response that mainly compromised liver and kidney functions in the host, characterized by increased and sustained numbers of macrophages, DCs, and CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes, and increased production of inflammatory CC chemokines and cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IFN-&#x003b3;). However, we failed to detect <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CFU in kidneys of both WT and D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice over a 12-wk period. This might reflect either <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth below the CFU detection limit or the development of kidney damage in the absence of kidney infection. A similar increase in macrophage, DC, and T cell numbers was detected in the mediastinal lymph nodes, suggesting the possibility that more T lymphocytes were being primed and migrating to the lungs. Such increased priming likely accounts for the substantially increased numbers of T lymphocytes migrating to the lungs of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>mice after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, as confirmed by ELISPOT analysis showing that significantly more CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes from the lungs of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were primed to produce IFN-&#x003b3; when stimulated in vitro by BCG-infected DCs. The finding that D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had more inflammation is intriguing and convincingly supports an immunoregulatory role for the D6 receptor. Recent data in other systems have shown that D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice display exaggerated responses to inflammatory stimuli, resulting in an aggressive cutaneous inflammatory pathology after the application of phorbol esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed an exaggerated response to the subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant. Unfortunately, none of these studies has been able to define a mechanism for the heightened immune response in the D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Although there are several different possibilities for the increased inflammatory response in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the one we favor is that lack of the D6 receptor fails to remove CC chemokines from many different organs and tissues, determining their increased concentration. Such increased expression/circulation of CC chemokines may, in turn, lead to signaling through their receptors and could result in the influx of immune cells and abundant, uncontrolled production of proinflammatory cytokines, which ultimately mediate tissue damage. However, the increased expression may also have been a reaction to the numbers of cells in infected organs. Whatever the case, the concentrations of CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1&#x003b1;, CCL4/MIP-1&#x003b2;, and CCL5/RANTES were found to be highly increased in the BAL and serum of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and sustained over time; moreover, blocking all four of them in D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in vivo (CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1&#x003b1;, CCL4/MIP-1&#x003b2;, and CCL5/RANTES) by repeated injection of a cocktail of neutralizing antibodies significantly reduced cell recruitment, production of proinflammatory CC chemokines and cytokines, liver and kidney damage, and, most importantly, the mortality of D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. However, despite controlling inflammatory responses, these mice became more susceptible to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, as demonstrated by higher CFU counts in the lungs at 8 and 12 wk after infection. The data reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> clearly show that none of the neutralized chemokines alone accounts for the reduced inflammatory response and mortality, and for the increased susceptibility to infection.</p><p>CCL3/MIP-1&#x003b1;, CCL4/MIP-1&#x003b2;, and CCL5/RANTES are all ligands of CCR5, which can attract and activate macrophages and Th1 lymphocytes. However studies in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have found that although CCR5 plays a role in the migration of DCs to and from lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), it is not indispensable for granuloma formation and immune protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). CCL5/RANTES has been associated with the generation of type 1 cytokine&#x02013;producing granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). CCR2-deficient mice are extraordinarily susceptible to moderate- or high-dose <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> administered i.v. but not to low aerosol doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), and CCL2/MCP-1&#x02013;deficient mice do not demonstrate an increased susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). However, there is redundancy in the chemokine system. Specific to this study, the chemokines CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1&#x003b1;, CCL4/MIP-1&#x003b2;, and CCL5/RANTES are ligands of CCR5, but CCL3/MIP-1&#x003b1; and CCL5/RANTES can also signal through CCR1 and CCR3. This finding makes it difficult to dissect the precise roles of individual chemokines and their receptors. In this study, enhancing the type 1 T cell response or the ability of T lymphocytes to enter the lungs over the WT level does not have an obvious beneficial effect on the control of infection and inflammation, indicating that there are additional factors that must be induced or enhanced to increase the ability of the host to eliminate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p><p>In summary, our study suggests an important role for the D6 receptor in immune regulation. D6 controls chemokine accumulation and activity, migration, and possibly, the maintenance of DCs and T cells in infected organs, as well as the production of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore D6, through its ability to avoid an excess of chemokines in the inflamed tissue, may favor resolution of chronic inflammatory responses and overall provide a fine mechanism for the control of the balance between protective immune responses and immunopathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>D6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).
