These changes are driven by the activity of CDK1 associated with mitotic cyclins, notably cyclin B (CycB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgan, 2006</xref>). Activation of CDK1 requires sufficient levels of CycB and the removal of CDK1 inhibitory phosphorylation. CDK1 phosphorylation is controlled by conserved kinases Wee1 and Myt1 and by the phosphatase Cdc25. The rapid onset of CDK1 activation at the end of G2 is driven by inactivation of Wee1 and activation of Cdc25. Active CDK1 contributes to these changes in Wee1 and Cdc25 activity, thus establishing a positive feedback loop that drives cells into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferrell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgan, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In spite of these insights, little is known about the mechanisms by which nuclear and cytoplasmic CDK1 activities are coordinated. Resolving this issue requires determining whether nuclear and cytoplasmic CDK1 pools are differentially regulated. Support for a differential regulation comes from the finding that subcellular localization of CycB plays a role in regulating CDK1 activity. In vertebrates, CycB is predominantly cytoplasmic at interphase because of Crm1-mediated nuclear exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagting et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). At prophase, CDK1&#x02013;CycB is activated in the cytoplasm before its entry into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Souza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackman et al., 2003</xref>), and the abrupt CDK1&#x02013;CycB nuclear translocation is triggered by the phosphorylation of CycB on its cytoplasmic retention signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ookata et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pines and Hunter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hagting et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takizawa and Morgan, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Controlling the subcellular localization of CycB may also be involved in checkpoint function. Un-replicated or damaged DNA results in the activation of the conserved S-phase checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), which inhibits Cdc25 and activates Wee1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furnari et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanchez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). Consequently, the S-phase checkpoint delays the cell cycle in interphase by Chk1-mediated inhibition of CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walworth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melo and Toczyski, 2002</xref>). However, expression of CDK1<sup>AF</sup>, a version of CDK1 lacking the phosphorylation inhibitory sites, only partially bypasses the interphase arrest induced upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 1996</xref>). This arrest is fully bypassed by coexpressing CDK1<sup>AF</sup> and nuclear-targeted CycB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heald et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 1998</xref>). These studies imply that prevention of CycB nuclear localization is one of the mechanisms by which the S-phase checkpoint delays nuclear entry into mitosis. Thus, the coordination of cytoplasmic and nuclear mitotic entry likely involves the control of CycB subcellular localization as well as the CDK1 phosphorylation state.</p><p>The late syncytial nuclear cycles of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryo are regulated by levels of CycB and S-phase checkpoint activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edgar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fogarty et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sibon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stiffler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Price et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stumpff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Crest et al., 2007</xref>). These cycles provide an excellent system to address the role of CycB subcellular localization in driving cytoplasmic and nuclear mitotic events during normal and S-phase checkpoint&#x02013;activated conditions. We addressed this question by taking advantage of our ability to inject functional CycB in the syncytial embryo at precise times during the cell cycle and to monitor its effects on multiple cytoplasmic and nuclear events. Increasing the level of CycB during early interphase of cycle 13 induces premature nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Upon activation of the S-phase checkpoint, increased levels of CycB drives cytoplasmic but not nuclear mitotic events. We demonstrate that the S-phase checkpoint protects the nucleus from active cytoplasmic CDK1&#x02013;CycB via two distinct mechanisms involving Grapes(Chk1)-dependent control of CycB nuclear localization and Wee1-dependent inhibition of nuclear CDK1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Injection of CycB prematurely drives NEB and spindle assembly</title><p>We injected recombinant CycB N-terminal GST fusion protein into living <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos at precise times during interphase of the syncytial cycle 13. GST-CycB is able to induce CDK1 phosphorylation on T161 and promote its kinase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edgar et al., 1994</xref>). We will refer to the recombinant protein as CycB.</p><p>Nuclear CDK1 activity is thought to promote chromosome condensation and NEB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lamb et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peter et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enoch et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, nuclear mitotic events were defined by chromosome condensation (monitored with GFP-H2Av) and NEB (monitored by nuclear infusion of injected rhodamine-conjugated tubulin). The central regions of embryos were injected with either 71 &#x003bc;M GST or 65 &#x003bc;M CycB at the onset of interphase of nuclear cycle 13. After GST injection, NEB occurred almost synchronously throughout the embryo at 14.3 min after injection, and the chromosomes entered anaphase shortly after NEB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, GST). After CycB injection, the timing of NEB was greatly accelerated near the site of injection compared with NEB in areas more distant from the site of injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, CycB, white outlines). Premature NEB occurs as a wave probably caused by the slow diffusion of CycB from the injection site. These observations indicate that CycB injection at 65 &#x003bc;M is sufficient to induce a local activation of CDK1, which triggers premature NEB and spindle assembly. This result is consistent with work demonstrating that exogenous CycB promotes premature disassembly of the nuclear pore complex in syncytial <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Onischenko et al., 2005</xref>). Although CycB induced premature NEB, it did not promote premature chromosome condensation before NEB. At NEB, the level of chromosome condensation was much greater in the control embryo than in the CycB-injected embryo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, top row). In most cases, once NEB occurred in the area near the site of CycB injection, the chromosomes rapidly condensed and, by metaphase, achieved the same state of condensation as control embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, bottom row).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CycB drives premature NEB and overrides CHX-induced interphase arrest.</bold> (A) Injection of CycB induces premature NEB.

Injection of CHX at metaphase induced a cytoplasmic and nuclear interphase arrest in the next cycle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, left). Exogenous CycB locally overcame the CHX-induced interphase arrest as indicated by NEB and rapid spindle formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, right; and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801153/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801153/DC1</ext-link>). The data suggest that new rounds of CycB synthesis are necessary to drive the next mitotic cycle. We determined by single embryo Western that the amount of injected CycB was equivalent to the total level of endogenous CycB at metaphase of cycle 13. Taking into account the limited diffusion of the injected CycB, we estimate that the 65 &#x003bc;M of exogenous CycB at the center of the gradient was less than fivefold the level of endogenous CycB at mitosis (see Materials and methods).</p></sec><sec><title>Injection of CycB prematurely drives the cytoplasm into mitosis</title><p>We next determined whether injected CycB prematurely drives the cytoplasm into mitosis.

The timing of cytoplasmic CDK1 activation was determined when RLC-GFP disappeared from the focal plane. The timing of nuclear CDK1 activation was determined when RLC-GFP filled the nucleoplasm (NEB).

We monitored the timing of cytoplasmic marker dynamics and NEB in areas close to and distant from the site of injection. We will refer to these as injected and control areas, respectively. In control areas, RLC-GFP concentrated at the cortex throughout interphase and dispersed just before NEB. This dispersion occurred 12 min after the onset of interphase (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 23, average deviation [AVD] &#x0003d; 1.8; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and D</xref>; and see Fig. S1 for quantification of the RLC-GFP signal, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801153/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801153/DC1</ext-link>). In CycB-injected areas, RLC-GFP dispersed prematurely, 4 min after interphase onset (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 23, AVD &#x0003d; 1.8; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and D</xref>, blue outlines). Interestingly, in both areas, RLC-GFP disappearance always preceded NEB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and D</xref>, orange outlines). A previous study has shown that RLC-GFP dispersion is driven by CDK1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Royou et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, our results indicate that high levels of CycB promote premature cytoplasmic as well as nuclear CDK1 activation.</p><p>GFP-moesin, a marker for F-actin, reorganizes from caps at interphase into furrows in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 1997</xref>). By focusing 5 &#x003bc;m below the plasma membrane, only furrows that have extended to this depth are visualized (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In control and CycB-injected regions, F-actin furrows progressed to this depth at 11.5 min. and 3.5 min after injection, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, blue outlines). These experiments indicate that exogenous CycB drives premature reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>To confirm that the effect of CycB was not confined to actin and myosin, we monitored the effect of CycB injection on Nuf, a Rab11 effector that exhibits a cell cycle&#x02013;dependent association with the microtubule- organizing center (MTOC; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cao et al., 2008</xref>). We find that GFP-Nuf is concentrated at the MTOC through interphase of cycle 13 in the control area. Upon CycB injection, Nuf prematurely disperses from the MTOC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, blue outlines). Collectively, these observations indicate that high levels of CycB induce local cytoplasmic CDK1 activation and trigger remodeling of the cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec><title>CycB drives cytoplasmic events independently of the nuclear cycle</title><p>In the aforementioned studies, we observed that cytoplasmic mitotic events precede nuclear mitotic events. This observation raises the possibility that cytoplasmic and nuclear CDK1 activities are differentially regulated by CycB levels. To explore this possibility, we monitored nuclear (NEB) and cytoplasmic (myosin dispersion) mitotic events after injecting CycB at a lower concentration of 32 &#x003bc;M (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). In six out of eight injected embryos, 32-&#x003bc;M CycB dilution induced cytoplasmic and nuclear CDK1 activation at a similar rate as 65 &#x003bc;M CycB. However, in two embryos, although CycB induced premature myosin dispersion, it did not induce premature NEB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). This uncoupling between the cytoplasmic and nuclear CDK1 activation rate suggests that different mechanisms regulate these two activities.</p><p>To further examine independent activation of cytoplasmic and nuclear CDK1, we took advantage of the prolonged interphase of nuclear cycle 14. During this cycle, the nuclei arrest in interphase while the cytoskeleton reorganizes to form furrows that elongate and encompass each nucleus in a process known as cellularization. The mechanisms that trigger cellularization are not understood. To determine whether CycB is limiting for driving CDK1 activation at cycle 14, we injected CycB at different times during cellularization and monitored cytoplasmic and nuclear CDK1 activation. Cytoplasmic CDK1 activation was monitored by examining RLC-GFP, GFP-moesin, and GFP-Nuf dynamics (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Nuclear CDK1 activity was measured by monitoring NEB (when the cytoplasmic markers invade the nucleoplasm). When injected early during cellularization (3&#x02013;5 min after nuclear envelope formation [NEF]), CycB triggered both cytoplasmic and nuclear entry into mitosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>, blue and orange outlines, respectively; and Video 4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801153/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801153/DC1</ext-link>). However, the timing of NEB was not coordinated with the timing of myosin dispersion. Although CycB injection induced myosin dispersion promptly (4.6 &#x000b1; 0.6, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>), NEB was delayed and occurred 5.5 min after myosin had dispersed (10.1 &#x000b1; 2.1, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>). This uncoupling between the cytoplasmic and nuclear cycle was even more dramatic when CycB was injected 6&#x02013;9 min after the onset of cellularization. Injection of CycB at this later time failed to induce NEB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>), yet the cytoplasm entered mitosis rapidly after CycB injection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>, blue outlines; and Fig. S2). CycB also induced the reorganization of GFP-moesin into furrows and the dispersion of Nuf from the MTOC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, blue outlines; and Video 5). However, there were no cases in which NEB occurred. CycB injected 15 min after the onset of cellularization had no effect on the progression of nuclear or cytoplasmic events (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6; unpublished data). These experiments show that increasing the level of CycB is sufficient to induce an additional syncytial cycle. They demonstrate that CycB remains limiting for cytoplasmic and, to a lesser extent, nuclear CDK1 activation during early cellularization. Furthermore, they provide evidence that CDK1 can be activated in the cytoplasm independently of its activation in the nucleus.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>CycB drives cytoplasmic mitotic events independently of the nuclear cycle during cellularization.</bold> (A) CycB is limiting for nuclear and cytoplasmic CDK1 activity when injected at the onset of cycle 14 interphase.

We injected CycB at two different time points during the next interphase, as represented by the schematic in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. We injected CycB at the onset of interphase (early injection) and 10 min later (late injection). Injection of CycB during early interphase overcame the CHX &#x0002b; Aph&#x02013;induced interphase arrest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The timing of cytoplasmic and nuclear CDK1 activation was similar to embryos in which only CycB was injected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). The results were strikingly different when CycB was injected 10 min after the onset of interphase. NEB occurred in only 3 out of 15 embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and D</xref>; and Fig. S1).

We propose this idea because live analysis using a Grp-GFP fusion protein reveals that Grp is dispersed in the cytoplasm during mitosis and accumulates in the nucleus upon NEF (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801153/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801153/DC1</ext-link>).

To test this hypothesis, we performed the same experiments in the S-phase checkpoint&#x02013;compromised mutant <italic>grp</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). As with wild-type embryos, CHX &#x0002b; Aph arrested the nuclei and cytoplasm of <italic>grp</italic> embryos in interphase (unpublished data).

At this concentration, CycB-R did not induce premature entry into mitosis in five out of six wild-type embryos. CycB-R accumulates at the centrosome and is excluded from the nucleus during interphase, in agreement with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang and Raff, 1999</xref>). During early prophase, before NEB, CycB-R maintains its association with the centrosome and accumulates in discrete puncta within the nucleus, indicating that the recombinant CycB used in these experiments is efficiently imported into the nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, arrows). After NEB, CycB-R is primarily associated with the bipolar spindle, consistent with observations in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pines and Hunter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1998</xref>).

Unlike more conventional cell cycles, the maternal pool of CycB is not fully degraded during these syncytial mitotic divisions; therefore, it was not clear whether CycB was limiting for CDK1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edgar et al., 1994</xref>). Our finding that inhibition of protein synthesis induced a prolonged interphase in wild-type and S-phase checkpoint&#x02013;compromised embryos indicates that new rounds of protein synthesis are required to drive the late syncytial cycles. Of more significance is the fact that injection of CycB into these interphase-arrested embryos efficiently drives cytoplasmic and nuclear entry into mitosis. Our data imply that, even though CycB is not fully degraded at mitosis, new rounds of CycB synthesis are required to trigger the next mitosis. Support for this idea comes from the fact that increasing the maternal copies of CycB affects the timing of entry into mitosis during the late syncytial cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2004</xref>). It may also be that the pool of endogenous CycB is maintained in a form that prevents CDK1 activation through posttranslational modifications and that the exogenous CycB lacks these modifications.</p><p>Careful analysis of the timing of cytoplasmic and nuclear mitotic events in the last syncytial cycle reveals that initiation of chromosome condensation and reorganization of the cytoskeleton occur before NEB. We have found that, even in the absence of protein synthesis, exogenous CycB can efficiently coordinate the reorganization of the cytoskeleton with NEB. However, exogenous CycB does not preserve the order of the nuclear mitotic events because the chromosomes did not condense before NEB. There are three maternal mitotic cyclins in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, cyclin A, B, and B3, with overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacobs et al., 1998</xref>). One interesting idea is that the proper ratio of the three mitotic cyclins is required to maintain the order of the nuclear events.</p><p>We have observed that increased levels of CycB at the onset of cellularization during cycle 14 drive an additional round of syncytial mitosis. A recent study has shown that the knockdown of the three mitotic cyclins with RNAi blocks the syncytial cycles but does not affect the timing of cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCleland and O'Farrell, 2008</xref>). Both findings are compatible with the idea that low levels of CycB are required for the correct timing of cellularization. Earlier work demonstrated that inhibition of zygotic transcription also prevents cellularization and drives an additional round of syncytial mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Edgar et al., 1986</xref>). Collectively, these results fit a model in which cellularization is triggered by thresholds of high levels of as yet unknown zygotic gene products and low levels of CycB. Although injecting CycB within the first 9 min of cycle 14 prevents cellularization, injecting CycB after this time point has no effect on cellularization. This suggests a narrow time window in which the embryo is not fully committed to cellularization.</p></sec><sec><title>CycB injections uncouple the cytoplasmic and nuclear cycles</title><p>Our results also demonstrate that CDK1 can be activated in the cytoplasm independent of its activation in the nucleus. The prolonged interphase of nuclear cycle 14 provided us with an opportunity to determine the effects of CycB injections later in interphase. Early injections of CycB (0&#x02013;5 min after NEF) prematurely drive nuclear and cytoplasmic events. However, CycB injections later in interphase (6&#x02013;9 min after NEF) drive the cytoplasm but not the nuclei into mitosis. Specifically, we observe myosin dispersion while the nuclear envelope remains intact. Given that myosin dispersion requires high CDK1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Royou et al., 2002</xref>), these studies indicate that CDK1 is activated in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. This result is consistent with the observation that the cytoplasm continues to cycle in enucleated frog embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wasserman and Smith, 1978</xref>). It is also in accord with studies in mammalian cultured cells and <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, indicating that the CDK1&#x02013;CycB complex is activated in the cytoplasm before its nuclear activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heald et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Souza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Draviam et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackman et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The S-phase checkpoint component Grp prevents nuclear CDK1 activation</title><p>In performing CycB injection in embryos treated with Aph and CHX, we observed that the effects of CycB on nuclear and cytoplasmic CDK1 activation varied depending on the timing of injection. CycB injections during early interphase drive both cytoplasmic and nuclear CDK1 activation, whereas later injections induced only cytoplasmic CDK1 activation. Moreover, this nuclear protection from premature cytoplasmic CDK1 activity upon late CycB injection depends on the S-phase checkpoint component Grp. Our observation that Grp must be imported into the nucleus at the beginning of interphase raises the possibility that time is required for sufficient quantities of Grp to accumulate in the nucleus and create a functional S-phase checkpoint. Injection of CycB induces mitosis in both the nuclei and cytoplasm early in interphase because the S-phase checkpoint is not fully established. However, later in interphase, Grp has accumulated sufficiently in the nucleus to completely prohibit nuclear CDK1 activation.</p><p>How does Grp protect the nucleus from active cytoplasmic CDK1? In response to damaged or incompletely replicated DNA, Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25, altering its relative import/export rates such that it remains cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furnari et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanchez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takizawa and Morgan, 2000</xref>). Additionally, Chk1 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate Wee1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). Although these findings remain to be demonstrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it provides an explanation for the Grp-dependent protection of the nucleus from active cytoplasmic CDK1. Grp maintains the inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation on nuclear CDK1 via activation of Wee1 and exclusion of Cdc25 from the nucleus. Support for this idea comes from a study in mammalian cultured cells in which overexpession of Wee1 prevents NEB in the presence of high cytoplasmic CDK1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heald et al., 1993</xref>). The fact that increased levels of cytoplasmic CycB overrides the cytoplasmic but not the nuclear S-phase checkpoint inhibitory signal suggests that the S-phase checkpoint is more efficient at inhibiting CDK1 in the nucleus. One idea is that the level of S-phase checkpoint activity is higher in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. This notion is supported by experiments in binucleate yeast and sea urchin embryos in which one of the two nuclei has altered DNA. Entry into mitosis is delayed in the nucleus with altered DNA with respect to the other normal nucleus and the common cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sluder et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Demeter et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, our observations, as well as others', that Grp and Wee1 are predominantly nuclear during S phase support this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heald et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Purdy et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Grp and Wee1 delay CycB nuclear accumulation</title><p>The subcellular localization of CycB plays an important role in regulating nuclear CDK1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takizawa and Morgan, 2000</xref>). Specifically, it has been shown in mammalian cultured cells that CycB is predominantly cytoplasmic during the G2 arrest caused by DNA damage, and a nuclear-targeted CycB can partially bypass this arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smeets et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 1998</xref>). To test the hypothesis that the S-phase checkpoint affects CycB subcellular localization, we injected CycB-R and monitored its dynamics after inhibition of DNA replication in wild-type embryos and embryos lacking Grp or Wee1. In a normal cycle, we observed that CycB-R is imported into the nucleus and forms discrete puncta, which colocalize with GFP-Polo and GFP-Cid, suggesting an association of CycB-R with kinetochores before NEB. This provides an excellent means to monitor CycB nuclear accumulation.</p><p>In embryos with high S-phase checkpoint activity, CycB nuclear accumulation was impaired. In contrast, in <italic>grp</italic> mutant embryos, CycB rapidly accumulated in the nucleus. One explanation is that in the absence of Grp, Wee1 activity is low, resulting in high nuclear CDK1 activity, which in turn promotes CycB import. Consistent with this hypothesis, we also found that CycB-R is rapidly imported into the nucleus and promotes NEB in <italic>wee1</italic> mutant embryos. Interestingly, the observation that high levels of CycB efficiently triggered cytoplasmic CDK1 activation but failed to localize in the nucleus reveals that cytoplasmic CDK1 activity is not sufficient to promote CycB nuclear import.</p></sec><sec><title>Grp also delays CycB nuclear accumulation by a mechanism independent of Wee1</title><p>Significantly, our observation that Grp-mediated inhibition of CycB nuclear import is independent of both Wee1 and the state of nuclear CDK1 activity reveals an additional mechanism by which the S-phase checkpoint prevents nuclear CDK1 activation. Monitoring CycB nuclear import in Aph and CHX-treated wild-type <italic>wee1</italic> and <italic>grp</italic> mutant embryos in which CDK1 is maintained in an inactive state reveals that CycB is rapidly imported into the nucleus only in the <italic>grp</italic> mutant. These results indicate a novel mechanism by which the S-phase checkpoint prevents mitotic entry: a Grp-dependent but Wee1-independent mechanism that prevents CycB nuclear accumulation. A satisfying aspect of this result is that it readily explains why bypassing interphase arrest caused by DNA damage not only requires a constitutively active form of CDK1 but also nuclear localized CycB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 1998</xref>). It would be of interest to determine whether Grp inhibits nuclear import of other cyclins as well.</p><p>The observation that CycB rapidly accumulates in the nucleus in the <italic>wee1</italic> mutant where Grp is fully active contrasts with our results that Grp delays CycB nuclear import. One idea is that, in the absence of <italic>wee1</italic>, the active form of nuclear CDK1 associated with basal levels of CycB promotes CycB (and more likely the CDK1&#x02013;CycB complex) nuclear import, which in turn increases nuclear CDK1 activity. This triggers a positive feedback loop that efficiently bypasses the Grp inhibitory signal.</p></sec><sec><title>Model for the regulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear CDK1 activity</title><p>This study provides a model to explain the differential regulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear CDK1 in a normal cycle. We speculate that, at interphase, the slow rate of CycB synthesis in the cytoplasm provides sufficient time for cytoplasmic CDK1 inhibitors, such as Wee1 and Myt1, to prevent cytoplasmic CDK1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Price et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stumpff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2005</xref>). However, nuclear CDK1 inhibition is maintained by controlling CycB nuclear accumulation. At interphase, the rate of CycB nuclear translocation is low because of inhibition of nuclear CDK1 by Wee1 and Grp-dependent inhibition of CycB transport. Upon completion of S phase, Grp and Wee1 activity decreases. This triggers cytoplasmic CDK1 activation and initiation of cytoplasmic mitosis. This decrease in Grp and Wee1 activity also allows the abrupt CycB nuclear translocation catalyzed by nuclear CDK1 activity, thus increasing CDK1 activity to a level sufficient for triggering NEB.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p>The fly stocks GFP-H2Av (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Clarkson and Saint, 1999</xref>), GFP-moesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 1997</xref>), RLC-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Royou et al., 2004</xref>), GFP-Nuf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riggs et al., 2007</xref>), GFP-Polo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moutinho-Santos et al., 1999</xref>), and GFP-Cid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schuh et al., 2007</xref>) were used in these studies.

CycB cDNA was cloned at its N terminal to GST in pGEX-1 vector. The recombinant protein was overexpressed and purified from 4 liters of XL-10 bacteria culture (Stratagene) grown in 2XYT (tryptone, yeast extract, and NaCl). The culture was grown at RT until it reached an OD of 0.8. The cells were induced with 100 &#x003bc;M IPTG for 12 h at RT. The cells were harvested by spinning them for 5 min at 5,000 rpm. The pellet was ground in liquid nitrogen for 15 min. The powder was dissolved in 5 vol PBS that contained 0.5% Tween 20, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 M NaCl. The solution was sonicated three times for 20 s. 10 mM DTT was added to the solution before its ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1 h in a 60.2 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). The supernatant was loaded onto a 9-ml glutathione-agarose column (Sigma-Aldrich) for a period of 2&#x02013;4 h. The column was extensively washed with PBS, pH 7.4, 1 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.5 mM DTT and rinsed with a 1-vol column with wash buffer without Tween 20. The protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris, pH 8.1, containing 500 mM KCl and 5 mM of reduced glutathione. The fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively into 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 500 mM KCl, and 30% glycerol.

Our studies have focused on mitotic entry, not exit, so the fact that it is not degraded should not affect the interpretation of our experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>CycB labeling</title><p>CycB was coupled with NHS-rhodamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a 1:4 ratio. The solution was mixed gently and sat at RT for 75 min. The solution was loaded onto a 3-ml Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 500 mM KCl, and 30% glycerol. The absorbance of the fractions was measured with a NanoDrop (Eppendorf).

Each image in all figures represents a single focal plane.</p></sec><sec><title>Microinjection</title><p>The embryos were prepared for microinjection as follows. They were dechorionated by hand on a double-sided sticky tape and aligned on a coverslip covered with glue. They were dehydrated and covered with halocarbon oil. The embryos were injected at the onset of interphase 2 min after NEF with either dialyzed buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 500 mM KCl, and 30% glycerol), 71 &#x003bc;M GST, or 65, 32, 13, and 6.5 &#x003bc;M CycB. The embryos were injected at the center lengthwise and one third heightwise toward the surface. The same hole was used for double and triple injections. The embryos were monitored within 30 s after injection. Injection of CycB at 13 and 6.5 &#x003bc;M did not have a significant effect on timing of cytoplasmic and nuclear entry into mitosis in wild-type embryos (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6 for each concentration). Aph and CHX (Sigma-Aldrich) were used at final concentrations of 300 &#x003bc;M and 1 mg/ml, respectively, in 2% DMSO and injected either on their own or mixed together during mitosis. CycB-R was injected at 13, 56, or 100 &#x003bc;M. Roscovitine and RO-3306 (EMD) were injected at 10 mM in 100% DMSO. Injection of 100% DMSO was used as a control. Rhodamine-conjugated tubulin (cytoskeleton) and Cy5-labeled histone (provided by E. Homola, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada) were injected at interphase of the previous cycle. The quantification of the RLC-GFP signal was performed by drawing two regions of interest of the same size, one near the site of CycB injection and one in a region not affected by CycB injection. The mean pixel intensity for each region was calculated using the Leica software.</p></sec><sec><title>Single-embryo Western blot and determination of the amount of injected CycB relative to the level of endogenous CycB</title><p>RLC-GFP embryos were prepared for microinjection as described in the previous paragraph. They were monitored with the confocal microscope until they reached interphase of cycle 13. They were injected with 0.5 mM colchicine and monitored until they reached metaphase. Each embryo was either collected and boiled in 10 &#x003bc;l of sample buffer or injected with 65 &#x003bc;M CycB and immediately collected and boiled in 10 &#x003bc;l of sample buffer. The samples were loaded on a 10% acrylamide gel and transferred onto the nylon membrane, and the membrane was probed with anti-CycB to reveal endogenous CycB and GST-CycB. Membranes were also probed with anti-GFP (Roche) to reveal RLC-GFP as a loading control. As expected, the injected embryo extract reveals an additional higher molecular weight GST-CycB band (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, injected CycB). The intensities of the endogenous and injected CycB bands were estimated to be equivalent. Because CycB is injected at the center of the embryo lengthwise and diffuses very slowly through a fifth of the embryo, we estimated that, at the center of the gradient, the injected CycB is &#x0003c;10-fold the amount of endogenous CycB at mitosis of cycle 13.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows RLC-GFP signal intensities over time in control and CycB-injected areas of embryos previously injected or not injected with CHX and Aph.
