Moreover, S-phase abolition was correlated with a decrease in the expression of <italic>tramtrack</italic>, a downstream N-target gene. Finally, N cell responsiveness was modified after changes in chromatin packaging.

The interaction between Notch receptors and their ligands (Serrate and Delta in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) triggers N signalling by way of evolutionarily conserved intramembrane cleavage events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Fiuza1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. These events allow the translocation of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor into the nucleus where it participates, along with other factors such as the DNA-binding protein Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)), in the formation of a transcriptional activator complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Schweisguth1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Cell fate diversity mechanisms involving N-signalling are implicated in both lateral inhibition, an essential process in which one cell is selected from an equivalent cell group after a mutual exchange of signals, as well as cell fate induction, in which a competent cell is committed to its fate after unidirectional signalisation.</p><p>A clear relationship between cell cycle and N-mediated cell determination processes has been observed in asymmetric cell divisions that take place during <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Jan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, cells involved in N-signalling are mitotically related and the direction of the N-signalling is controlled by differential segregation of N-modulators during mitosis, such as Numb and Neuralized (Neur) (see for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Bardin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Betschinger1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>). Nevertheless, the relationship between cell cycle and cell determination does not seem to be limited to the asymmetric segregation of fate determinants during mitosis. The progression through the S-phase also appears to be required for the acquisition of determined cell identities. Thus, after self-renewed division of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> 2&#x02013;7 neuroblast, the smallest daughter cell resulting from this division acquires a Ganglion Mother Cell fate only if it undergoes DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Weigmann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, during vulva formation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, N-signalling occurs only during the S-phase, suggesting some degree of dependency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Ambros1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations are consistent with the idea advanced thirty years ago that DNA-replication renders regions of the genome available for transcription that are normally not accessible in other phases of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Holtzer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Many studies have been performed on <italic>Drosophila</italic> to analyze cell cycle machinery, cell fate acquisition and signalling pathways partly because of the low level of genetic redundancy exhibited by this organism. In particular, the cell lineage leading to the formation of mechanosensory microchaete (hereafter referred to as bristles) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has become an excellent model system to analyse the relationship between cell division and cell determination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Lai1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. During the formation of these bristles (around 12 hours After Pupal Formation, APF), N-mediated lateral inhibition is involved in selecting the primary precursor cell (pI) from a cluster of equivalent cells, called a proneural cluster. Down-regulation of the N-pathway during this period results in a neurogenic phenotype characterized by the formation of extra bristles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Hartenstein1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Once determined, pI initiates a rapid sequence of four asymmetric cell divisions giving rise to five different cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Gho1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. At each division, one daughter cell (N-off) acts as a N ligand-producer and the other (N-on) as a N signal-receiver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Gho2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Wang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The bias in the activation of the N-pathway is assured by the stereotyped segregation of Numb and Neuralized in one cell which blocks the N-receptor and promotes N-signalling respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Guo1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-LeBorgne1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). During the first round of division (at about seventeen hours APF), pI divides, roughly parallel to the midline, giving rise to two secondary precursor cells. Numb and Neuralized are inherited by the anteriorly located secondary precursor cell that then acquires a pIIb fate (it becomes the N-off cell and corresponds to the N-signal sender cell of the pair). The posteriorly located cell, the pIIb sister cell, acquires a pIIa identity (it becomes the N-on cell and corresponds to the N-receiver cell). During the next division (around nineteen hours APF), the pIIb cell generates a tertiary precursor cell, pIIIb, and a glial cell that enters apoptosis shortly after birth. The subsequent division of pIIIb produces the inner cells of the organ (the sheath cell and the neurone). The division of pIIa leads to the formation of the outer cells of the organ (the shaft and socket cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Gho1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Fichelson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The essential role of the Notch pathway in cell fate acquisition in this organ is demonstrated by the fact that, in absence of Notch activity, both precursor cells acquire a pIIb fate and the resulting organ is composed exclusively of inner cells. Reciprocally, organs composed exclusively of outer cells are obtained after ectopic activation of the N-pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Hartenstein1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0003646-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003646.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The bristle lineage.</title><p>(A) pI cells divide giving rise to two secondary precursor cells, pIIb and pIIa.

The differential segregation of Numb and Neuralized (Neu) during pI division triggers unidirectional Notch-signalling to the posterior cell.

Thus, in secondary precursor cells, the S-phase begins directly after birth and lasts for about one hour. It is followed by the G2-phase that continues until the next round of division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A precise knowledge of the timing of these phases allows us to study whether cells express a differential sensitivity to the Notch pathway during S and G2 cell cycle phases. Here we show, using an <italic>in vivo</italic> approach, that cells from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> bristle lineage are more sensitive to N-activation during the S-phase than during the G2-phase. In addition, this differential N-responsiveness of bristle cells could be modified under experimental conditions that affected the activity of chromatin-remodelling factors. Thus, we suggest that progression through the S-phase overrides local high-order chromatin folding structures in genomic regions essential to implement the response to N-pathway activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We used <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging techniques to analyse fluctuations in bristle lineage cell responsiveness to N-pathway activation. This pathway was activated at precise times of the cell cycle of the two secondary precursor cells of the lineage, pIIa and pIIb. To visualize bristle lineage cells, we expressed YFP-tagged histone2B proteins (hereafter H2B::YFP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Bellaiche1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>) using the UAS-Gal4 binary expression system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Brand1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>neuralized<sup>P72</sup></italic>-Gal4 (<italic>neur&#x0003e;</italic>) line was used to specifically express the constructions in pI and its progeny. Both secondary precursor cells were identified as the daughter cells resulting from the division of pI cells. After completion of the lineage, the presence of inner and/or outer cells was used to monitor the identity acquired by the secondary precursor cells and as such to measure the sensitivity of these cells to the N pathway. The thermosensitive <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> allele was used to enable endogenous N-pathway activation after a temperature shift from 30&#x000b0;C to 18&#x000b0;C. The overexpression of the active form of the N-receptor (N<sup>intra</sup>) driven by a heat-shock promotor was used to ectopically trigger the N-pathway after a temperature pulse (HS) to 37&#x000b0;C for 10 min.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>The kinetics of the cell response under N<sup>ts-1</sup> and N<sup>intra</sup> conditions was fast enough to activate the N-pathway during the cell cycle phase studied</title><p>In a series of control experiments, we ascertained that the kinetic of the N-response triggered under <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> and <italic>N<sup>intra</sup></italic> conditions were compatible with the timing of phases of the cell cycle.</p><p>In the <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> strain, the N receptor behaves as a wild-type at 18&#x000b0;C (permissive temperature) and as a strong hypomorph at 30&#x000b0;C (restrictive temperature). The kinetics of the <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> allele inactivation was measured by applying temperature shifts from 18&#x000b0;C to 30&#x000b0;C at precise times before and after pI division (Supporting data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003646.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). The formation of sensory organs composed exclusively of inner cells was used to assess the delay required to block N-function at 30&#x000b0;C. This analysis revealed that the N-function was blocked when temperature was shifted prior to and between 0 and 15 min after pI division. More interestingly, temperature shifts applied later than 15 min following pI division were ineffective in blocking the N-response. These findings show that the <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> receptor is rapidly rendered non-functional after 15 minutes at a restrictive temperature. As such, when experimental conditions required an N-off state, <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> pupae were shifted to 30&#x000b0;C for at least one hour before beginning data acquisition.</p><p>We analyzed the kinetics of <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> activation by applying temperature pulses of variable duration (to 18&#x000b0;C) to <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> pupae maintained at 30&#x000b0;C (see Supporting data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003646.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). The formation of normal sensory organs composed of both inner and outer cells (proof that N-on cells were formed) was used to assess the time required for <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> receptors to recover their function at 18&#x000b0;C. We observed that N-on cells were present following temperature pulses lasting longer than 15 minutes (Supporting data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003646.s001">S1B</xref>). This shows that <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> receptors recover their function within 15 min at 18&#x000b0;C. Taken together, these data suggest that the activation and inactivation kinetics of the <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> receptor are similar, around 15 minutes.</p><p>In the <italic>HS-N<sup>intra</sup></italic> strain, we analyzed the kinetic of N-signalling by following, by immunodetection, the accumulation of N<sup>intra</sup> induced after a HS. N<sup>intra</sup> was clearly detected in the nucleus 20 minutes after HS. This nuclear signal reached its peak about 30 min post-HS and remained visible for around 2 hours (Supporting data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003646.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Moreover, the time-course of N<sup>intra</sup> accumulation was the same whether the HS was applied during the first hour (during S-phase) or the second hour (during G2-phase) of the secondary-precursor-cell's life (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003646.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). A similar time course of N<sup>intra</sup> accumulation following a HS has been obtained in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Struhl1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Schweisguth2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>These data show that the N pathway is either functional or activated after a delay of approximately 15 or 20 minutes when the <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> allele or the <italic>HS-N<sup>intra</sup></italic> construction were used respectively. This period is sufficiently short to enable us to analyse the cell response elicited by N-activation as a function of different cell cycle phases, since each phase lasts for one hour or more.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cells are most receptive to endogenous Notch pathway activation during their first hour of life</title><p>In order to determine a time-frame during which posterior secondary cells are most sensitive to N-signalling, we maintained <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup></italic> pupae at 30&#x000b0;C for at least 1 hour prior to the experiment to create an &#x0201c;N-off&#x0201d; condition. Pupae were then imaged <italic>in vivo</italic> and at a given time following pI division, they were shifted to 18&#x000b0;C in order to permit endogenous activation of the Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). If the temperature shift falls during the period of heightened N-receptivity, the N pathway will be activated in the posterior secondary precursor cell by a signal coming from its anterior sister cell as in the wild-type situation. As a result the former will acquire a pIIa identity and the latter a pIIb identity thus resulting in a normal sensory organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, upper lineage). If, on the other hand, the N cell response is not implemented in the posterior precursor cell, both secondary precursor cells will acquire a N-off pIIb identity and the organ will be composed exclusively of inner cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, bottom lineage). Thus, the timing of the temperature shift that allows the formation of normal sensory organs is related to the period during which cells are receptive to the N-signal. These results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> where we show representative frames from time lapse imaging of two clusters in <italic>N<sup>ts-1</sup>; neur&#x0003e; H2B::YFP</italic> living pupae (frames 1&#x02013;11) combined with immunostaining (frame 12) (see also Supporting data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003646.s006">Movie S1</xref>). In this time-lapse recording, the upper cluster experienced the temperature shift at 1h54 after pI division (a late shift) and the lower cluster at 0h18 after pI division (early shift). In the upper cluster, both pI daughter cells behaved similarly and underwent two rounds of divisions (bracket in frames 4 and 7 and in frames 5 and 9 respectively). In addition, the resulting cells harboured small nuclei typical of inner cells (see frame 11). These observations show that, for late temperature shifts, no N response was triggered in the posterior cell and it behaved as a pIIb cell. Conversely, for early temperature shifts (lower cluster), the posterior cell divided only once (bracket in frame 8) instead of twice as did its anterior sister cell (bracket in frame 6 and 11). The size of the nuclei in the resulting cells differed, with two large nuclei for the posterior daughter cells and three small nuclei for the anterior daughter cells (frame 11). Taken together, these observations suggest that this lower cluster harbours a normal set of cells and that the N response was indeed triggered in the posterior cell, which then acquired a pIIa identity.</p><fig id="pone-0003646-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003646.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Cells are more receptive to endogenous N-pathway activation during their first hour of life.</title><p>The acquisition of a pIIa identity was used as an index of Notch pathway activation in the posterior secondary precursor cell.

In this particular case, the glial cell was too immature for Repo detection. In contrast, the upper cluster was formed exclusively by inner cells (absence of Su(H) positive cells). In addition, two cells in this cluster behave as glial cells since one accumulates the glial specific marker, Repo (blue cell in frame 12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Reddy1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and the other enters apoptosis (the cell with a condensed nucleus in frame 10, arrowhead).

Using this combined technique of time-lapse imaging and immunodetection, 190 bristle lineages from at least 20 pupae were analysed. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g002">Figure 2C</xref> in which the percentage of posterior secondary precursor cells acquiring a pIIa identity (in other words, the probability that these cells implemented a N-response) is plotted against the time of the temperature shift after pI division. We observe that more than 50&#x00025; of the cells responded to endogenous N-activation when the temperature shift occurred within 45 minutes following pI division. After this time, the proportion of cells that acquire a pIIa identity diminished progressively and moreover cells did not respond at all if the shift occurred within the 30 minutes preceding the next division. These results show that the relationship between the cell's ability to generate a response after endogenous activation of the N-pathway and the time at which the N-response is implemented is not linear. Indeed, the probability of acquiring a pIIa identity is more important (&#x0003e;0.5) when the Notch receptor is able to respond within the first hour of life.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Cells are more susceptible to respond to ectopic Notch pathway activation during their first hour of life</title><p>The enhanced responsiveness to N-pathway activation during the first hour of life may be due to a higher receptivity of cells during this period.

We then observed whether or not the anterior cell (normally an N-off cell) transformed into pIIa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g003">Fig. 3Ai</xref>). Two representative clusters in <italic>hs-N<sup>intra</sup>; neur&#x0003e; H2B::YFP</italic> living pupae are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> (see Supporting data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003646.s007">Movie S2</xref>) recorded with time-lapse imaging combined with immunostaining. The N-pathway was activated (HS at frame 3) 30 min after pI division for the left cluster (early activation) and 1h18 after pI division for the right cluster (late activation). When the N-pathway was activated early, the anterior cell divided once and almost simultaneously with the posterior cell (brackets in frame 6). Moreover, all resulting cells harboured large nuclei (see frame 8). This suggests that the anterior cell was transformed and acquired a pIIa identity. This was confirmed by immuno-detection (frame 9) showing that the left cluster was formed by four outer cells: two Su(H) positive socket cells (yellow cells) and two shaft cells (green sibling cells), showing that the organ originated from two pIIa cells. In contrast, when the N pathway was activated late, the anterior cell behaved as a normal pIIb cell and underwent two rounds of divisions (bracket in frames 4 and 7) instead of only one for its posterior sister cell (bracket in frame 5). As in a normal lineage, three out of the five resulting cells contained a small nucleus and one of these cells entered apoptosis (arrowhead in frame 8). The presence of a normal set of cells in the right cluster was confirmed by immunodetection (frame 9, right cluster). Among the final four cells present in this cluster one was a Su(H) positive socket cell (yellow cell) and one a neuron (blue cell, the inset shows a z-reconstitution to illustrate the nucleus that is not situated in the same plane as the other cells). The results obtained from 390 clusters (at least 25 pupae) are summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g003">Fig. 3C</xref> in which the proportion of anterior cells acquiring a pIIa identity is plotted as a function of the time of heat-shock. Our results show that cells pass from a state of high responsiveness to N-pathway activation (up to 50&#x00025;) during the first 60 minutes of life to a low, no null, responsiveness state (under 50&#x00025;) with a period of transition around 60 to 75 minutes after birth.

In other words, the closer the moment of N-activation is to the next cell division, the lower the probability of the cell becoming N-on. Thus, the fact that cells are less sensitive to N-activation during their second hour of life may simply reflect a critical period necessary to implement the N-response. In order to study this possibility, we activated the N-pathway at different times after pI division and asked whether the probability to respond to N-activation depended on the moment of the heat-shock or on the time-lapse after the heat-shock. We predicted that if the enhanced sensitivity to N-activation depended on the delay after N-activation, the probability to respond to N-activation would increase with longer delays.</p><p>The N-pathway was activated via HS at different moments after pI division and the nota were dissected out at either 40, 65, 80, 100 or 115 min post-HS.

We detected Ttk in the anterior cell only after 60 minutes or more following HS. Thus, with Ttk detection used as a cellular marker, 60 minutes was the minimal time required to identify a cell transformation after ectopic N-activation.

We hypothesize that the enhanced sensitivity to N-activation during the first hour of life could be related to the DNA replication phase. To test this possibility, we modified the timing of the S-phase in secondary precursor cells and we analysed whether or not the temporal response to N-activation changed accordingly. In order to delay the entry into the S-phase, we overexpressed the CDK inhibitor Dacapo (Dap,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-deNooij1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Lane1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>) specifically in the bristle cells using the <italic>neu-Gal4</italic> driver.

Under conditions of Dap overexpression, secondary precursor cells did not incorporate BrdU during the first 20 minutes after birth (see 10' column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, <italic>neu&#x0003e;dap</italic>). In addition, the punctuate incorporation of BrdU was not observed until 100 min after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Thus, after Dap overexpression, the S-phase in secondary precursor cells was delayed by around 20 minutes. Associated with this 20 min delay, the enhanced response window to N-activation was prolonged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, cells displayed a high responsive state to N-pathway activation during the first 75 minutes of life instead of during the first 60 minutes as in control conditions.

As a consequence, given the rapid accumulation of N<sup>intra</sup> (within 20 minutes) and the global developmental delay induced by the heat-shock, the activation of the N-pathway by the overexpresssion of N<sup>intra</sup> is probably concomitant to the cell cycle phase at the moment of the heat-shock. Thus, in the <italic>HS-N<sup>intra</sup></italic> construction, cells have enough time to elaborate their response when the N-pathway was directly activated during the S- or the G2-phases.</p><p>These considerations, together with the lack of correlation between the probability of acquiring an N-on identity and the time-lapse following N-activation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003646-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), show that the fact that cells respond less well to N-activation during the G2-phase is not due to time constraints related to the implementation of a cell-response. Rather, cells appear to have different sensitivity to Notch when the N-pathway is activated in the S- or in the G2-phases.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Abolition of the S-phase impaired ttk expression</title><p>A dramatic reduction in <italic>ttk</italic> expression was observed when the S-phase was abolished after overexpression of the licensing replication factor, Gem. Since Gem overexpression was performed after pI specification, when cells are G2-arrested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Usui1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, the division of pI was normal. As such, the resulting two secondary precursor cells were genetically normal under these Gem-overexpression conditions. Thus, the dramatic reduction in Ttk expression observed in secondary precursor cells was not due to a problem of aneuploidism. Instead, this reduction seems to be related to the abolition of the S-phase itself.</p><p>Alternatively, the lack of Ttk expression may be due to a change in cell identity induced by Gem. It has been shown that, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, the number of neurons increased after overexpression of Gem. Thus, Gem seems to act directly as a neuralizing factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Kroll1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, the observed reduction in <italic>ttk</italic> expression after Gem overexpression can be interpreted as a premature neuronal transformation of secondary precursor cells. We think that this possibility is unlikely because we never observed neuronal markers such as Elav in secondary precursor cells that would suggest a cell transformation. Cell death, probably due to generalized aneuploidy following secondary precursor cell divisions, prevents us from performing a detailed analysis of the identity of S-phase arrested cells. In any case, we cannot rule out a potential neuralizing effect of Gem to explain our results, neither can we eliminate the possibility that the neuralizing action of Gem suggested by previous work results from a failure of non-neuronal fate determinant pathways to act after S-phase arrest.</p><p>Apart from its effect on chromatin remodelling, it has been suggested that Brm can also have a direct action on cell identity. Loss of function of <italic>brm</italic> results in double shaft-double socket sensory organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Elfring1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, a phenotype that resembles those observed in Notch gain of function conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Gho3">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a more recent study shows, that under the same conditions, sensory organs present more than one neurone, a phenotype similar to that resulting after reduced Notch signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Armstrong1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The different experimental conditions used in these two studies can explain this discrepancy. Thus, a fine-tuning of <italic>brm</italic> function can result in opposite phenotypes suggesting that the action of Brm on the Notch pathway is more complex than that of a cell fate modulator. This complexity can be due to the change in the cell responsiveness to Notch due to cell cycle phase modifications as revealed in the present work.</p><p>Taken together, our data show that the cell sensitivity to N-activation depends on the progression through the S-phase. It is important to state that, although we show that DNA synthesis is critical for <italic>ttk</italic> expression, we cannot extend these observations to the expression of all N-target genes. Given the complexity of the transcriptional complex in which N receptor is involved, one would expect that all N-target genes are not restricted to the same degree of dependence on DNA-replication conditions. Systematic analysis of the expression of N-target genes is required to resolve this problem.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Cells responsiveness in G2-phase</title><p>During the G2-phase, the response to N<sup>intra</sup> was reduced but not completely abolished. We show that about 30&#x00025; of cells responded when N was activated at different moments during the G2-phase. A response to N-activation during this phase is compatible with previous observations showing that N-mediated lateral inhibition occurs among proneural cells arrested in the G2-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Kimura1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Negre1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the sensitivity of cells to N-activation as a function of the cell cycle could be different in quiescent cells (cells during sensory precursor cell selection involving lateral inhibition) from that in mitotically active cells (cells in the bristle lineage). In fact, the molecular mechanisms involved in N-signalling may be different in these cell types. This is indeed the case for different cells within the bristle lineage itself. For example, while the N pathway is required for the determination of both outer and inner cells, Su(H) is essential only for the determination of the former <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Nagel1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. By analogy, one must be cautious when comparing cell responsiveness to N-signalling as a function of cell cycle phases in quiescent and mitotically active cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>DNA replication, chromatin assembly and Notch target gene transcription</title><p>The enhanced sensitivity to N-activation during the S-phase can be ascribed to either an association of N-signal transductor factors with the DNA replication machinery or a specific availability of N-signal transductor factors during the S-phase. Alternatively, a local decompacted chromatin state during S-phase can favour the trans-acting factor recruitment on N target genes. We favour this last hypothesis since deregulation of chromatin packing affected the response to N-signalling. Increasing evidence indicates that higher-order chromatin compaction presents an efficient barrier to DNA trans-acting factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Li1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed that HP1 overexpression abolished the residual N-dependant response occurring during the G2-phase. Although HP1 has been originally identified as a heterochromatin-associated protein, its function in regulation of euchromatic gene transcription is beginning to be elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Hediger1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, HP1 associates with approximately 200 euchromatic sites on <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Fanti1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> and an increasing number of reports show that HP1 regulates gene expression during cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Panteleeva1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, HP1 overexpression may induce a local &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; chromatin structure rendering it inaccessible to transcription factors that promote some of the N target genes. In addition, it has been shown that tethering HP1 to euchromatic sites of <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromosomes is sufficient to nucleate a silent chromatin conformation in the promoter region of genes whose transcriptional activity is low or absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Li2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the formation of a closed chromatin structure will be facilitated all the more when cells are in the G2-phase, a phase in which we show a reduced cell responsiveness to N-activation. In agreement with this possibility, HP1 overexpression did not affect the cell responsiveness to N-activation in the S-phase where N-target genes seem to be set to be transcribed. Furthermore, this lack of effect when HP1 was applied during the S-phase rules out the possibility that HP1 has cell-cycle independent actions on transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>This work shows that the N-induced response in cells of the bristle lineage is enhanced during the S-phase. We suggest that high-order chromatin structures associated with the progression through the S-phase create favourable conditions for N-target gene transcription. We highlight a new mechanism that regulates N-target gene expression during cell fate acquisition. This mechanism couples DNA synthesis and N signalling to reprogram the default state (N-off, pIIb identity) to another (N-on, pIIa identity). The enhanced sensitivity of cells to respond to cell-fate signalling during the S-phase seems to be a widespread phenomenon. For example, progression through the S-phase is required for the expression of <italic>even-skipped</italic> during specification of cell identity in the central nervous system of <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Weigmann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the S-phase is clearly important during de-differentiation of tobacco protoplasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Zhao1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, vulva-precursor cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> seem to be more sensitive to N-signaling in late G1- or early S-phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Edgar1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. We do not know whether this sensitivity is a general property of the S-phase or is a local characteristic that affects a restricted number of genes. Further experiments are required to address this issue. In this regard, it will be of interest to know whether the expression of other N-target genes or even the signalling efficiency of other pathways also depend on the progression through the S-phase.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p>The neuralized<sup>P72</sup>-Gal4 (<italic>neur&#x0003e;</italic>) line was used to express the constructions <italic>UAS-histone2B::YFP (H2B::YFP)</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Bellaiche1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>; <italic>UAS-Dacapo (UAS-Dap)</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003646-Lane1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>UAS-Geminin</italic> (a gift from H.
