The cap structure has been implicated in the enhancement of pre-mRNA splicing. More recently, this structure has also been suggested to facilitate RNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We have previously identified and purified an 80kD Nuclear Cap Binding Protein (NCBP) from a HeLa cell nuclear extract, which could possibly mediate these nuclear activities. In this report, we describe cloning of complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding NCBP. The partial protein sequences of NCBP were determined, and the full-length cDNA of NCBP was isolated from HeLa cDNA libraries. This cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 790 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 91,734 daltons, which contained most of the determined protein sequences. However, the protein sequence had no significant homology to any known proteins. Transfection experiments demonstrated that the epitope-tagged NCBP, transiently expressed in HeLa cells, was localized exclusively in the nucleoplasm. Similar experiments using a truncated NCBP cDNA indicated that this nuclear localization activity is conferred by the N-terminal 70 amino-acid region.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00043-0057-a" xlink:role="3862"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00043-0058-a" xlink:role="3863"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00043-0059-a" xlink:role="3864"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00043-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3861"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00043-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3862"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00043-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3863"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00043-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3864"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00043-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3865"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
