Both the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium marinum</named-content> and the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> genomes contain an extended region of difference 1 (extRD1) locus that encodes one such pathway, the early secretory antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) system 1 (ESX-1) secretion apparatus. ESX-1 is required for virulence and for secretion of the proteins ESAT-6, culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10), and EspA. Here, we show that both Rv3881c and its <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content> homolog, Mh3881c, are secreted proteins, and disruption of RD1 in either organism blocks secretion. We have renamed the <italic>Rv3881c/Mh3881c</italic> gene <italic>espB</italic> for ESX-1 substrate protein B. Secretion of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content> EspB (EspB<sub>M</sub>) requires both the <italic>Mh3879c</italic> and <italic>Mh3871</italic> genes within RD1, while CFP-10 secretion is not affected by disruption of <italic>Mh3879c</italic>. In contrast, disruption of <italic>Mh3866</italic> or <italic>Mh3867</italic> within the extRD1 locus prevents CFP-10 secretion without effect on EspB<sub>M</sub>. Mutants that fail to secrete only EspB<sub>M</sub> or only CFP-10 are less attenuated in macrophages than mutants failing to secrete both substrates. EspB<sub>M</sub> physically interacts with Mh3879c; the <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> homolog, EspB<sub>T</sub>, physically interacts with Rv3879c; and mutants of EspB<sub>M</sub> that fail to bind Mh3879c fail to be secreted. We also found interaction between Rv3879c and Rv3871, a component of the ESX-1 machine, suggesting a mechanism for the secretion of EspB. The results establish EspB as a substrate of ESX-1 that is required for virulence and growth in macrophages and suggests that the contribution of ESX-1 to virulence may arise from the secretion of multiple independent substrates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>A major mechanism used by pathogenic bacteria for disabling host defenses is secretion of virulence proteins. These effectors are often transported by specialized secretion machines. One such pathway, present in <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> and other Gram-positive genera, is ESX-1 (early secretory antigenic target 6 system 1). Although ESX-1 is required for multiple phenotypes related to the pathogenesis of infection, only three substrates of the secretion machine have been identified to date, and the mechanism by which these substrates are exported is not understood. In our efforts to understand this virulence-related secretion mechanism, we identified a novel substrate and found that its delivery to the ESX-1 machine requires different protein interactions than previously identified substrates. Finally, we present data that the various ESX-1 substrates contribute additively to virulence.

Although a substrate of ESX-1, we find that the specific genes required for secretion of EspB differ from those required for the secretion of CFP-10. Biochemical investigation demonstrates that EspB forms a complex with Rv3879c and that Rv3879c interacts with Rv3871, the same component of ESX-1 that interacts with the ESAT-6/CFP-10 complex during its secretion. These data support a model that different substrates are delivered to the ESX-1 machine by molecularly distinguishable pathways. Moreover, each of these pathways for ESX-1&#x02013;mediated secretion contributes to mycobacterial virulence.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Both <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content> EspB Restore Intracellular Growth to the <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content> Mutant <italic>espB<sub>M</sub>::tn</italic></title><p>A previous genetic screen for <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content> mutants that fail to cause hemolysis led to the isolation of eight mutants in the extended RD1 (extRD1) locus, <italic>Mh3866-Mh3881c</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030105-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

Two mutants of EspB<sub>M</sub> that were stable after synthesis but failed to bind Mh3879c were not secreted, while a large carboxylterminal deletion did not interfere with either Mh3879c binding or secretion. Additionally, the carboxyterminus of Rv3879c/Mh3879c is required for interaction with and secretion of EspB. These results suggest that the EspB/Mh3879c protein complex is required for EspB<sub>M</sub> secretion. While complex formation between ESAT-6 and CFP-10 is required for their secretion as a heterodimer by <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> Mh3879c appears not to be secreted. Our data, though, do not exclude the possibility that the aminoterminus of Mh3879c is quantitatively removed during or immediately after secretion, since we do not have and could not probe with antibodies to the native protein. We hypothesize that Mh3879c acts as a cytosolic chaperone to deliver EspB<sub>M</sub> to the secretion machine. We showed that Rv3879c interacts directly with Rv3871 and that Rv3871, in addition to being required for the secretion of ESAT-6/CFP-10, is required for the secretion of EspB.

Characterizing the function of Mh3868 will certainly be important to better understand ESX-1&#x02013;mediated secretion.</p><p>Like ESAT-6 and CFP-10, EspA is secreted by the ESX-1 machine.

Loss of either EspA or EspB inhibits secretion of ESAT-6 and CFP-10, but the reason for their requirement is unknown. It may be that as substrates reach the final common pathway for secretion, they interact in a manner that leads to cooperative secretion. Clearly, though, the secretion of EspB is quite distinct from that of EspA. While EspA requires CFP-10 for its secretion, EspB secretion is independent of CFP-10. EspB secretion is not disrupted in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content> mutants <italic>Mh3866::tn</italic> and <italic>Mh3867::tn,</italic> neither of which secrete CFP-10, nor is EspB secretion disrupted in the <italic>M. tuberculosis &#x00394;CFP-10</italic> mutant. These data are consistent with the model that EspB, unlike either ESAT-6 or EspA, is targeted to the ESX-1 machine independently of CFP-10.</p><p>These studies beg the question of whether it is possible to determine which ESX-1 substrates are most important for virulence. This has been a difficult task because of the apparent codependence of the various substrates on each other for secretion. However, our results allowed a somewhat different approach. We used a set of extRD1 mutants in which some <italic>(Mh3866::tn</italic> and <italic>Mh3867::tn)</italic> failed to secrete CFP-10, but did secrete EspB; while another mutant <italic>(Mh3879::tn)</italic> secreted CFP-10 but failed to secrete EspB; while mutants that disrupted the core secretion machinery <italic>(Mm&#x00394;RD1</italic> and <italic>Mh3871::tn)</italic> and <italic>espB<sub>M</sub>::tn</italic> itself failed to secrete all substrates. We found that mutants lacking secretion of both substrates had a more marked growth defect in macrophages than the mutants lacking secretion of only one substrate. This suggests that the different substrates make distinct, and potentially additive, contributions to virulence. Although we cannot say that the defects in intracellular growth of the various mutants are caused by the substrates we have identified, our work does support the hypothesis that ESX-1 secretes more than one substrate that contributes to the virulence of <italic>Mycobacteria</italic> and that different substrates may have independent contributions to bacterial pathogenesis.</p><p>In summary, this work has identified a novel substrate for ESX-1&#x02013;dependent secretion and has demonstrated interactions of this substrate with a protein encoded within RD1, expanding our understanding of how genes within this locus contribute to this novel secretion pathway. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that secretion of distinct ESX-1 substrates follows variable pathways to interaction with the core secretion machinery, and that the different substrates may contribute independently to intracellular survival and growth of the bacteria.
