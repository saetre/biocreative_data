When plants growing in soil were exposed to drought (by reducing or completely withholding watering) the wild-type lines showed a large decrease in leaf water potential and leaf wilting, but the leaves in the transgenic lines did not wilt and exhibited only a small decrease in water potential. During exposure to drought the stomata of the transgenic lines did not close as much as in the wild type, and the rates of photosynthesis and transpiration became less inhibited than in the wild type. These parameters of drought resistance in the BiP overexpressing lines were not associated with a higher level of the osmolytes proline, sucrose, and glucose. It was also not associated with the typical drought-induced increase in root dry weight. Rather, at the end of the drought period, the BiP overexpressing lines had a lower level of the osmolytes and root weight than the wild type. The mRNA abundance of several typical drought-induced genes [<italic>NAC2</italic>, a seed maturation protein (<italic>SMP</italic>), a glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase (<italic>GST</italic>), antiquitin, and protein disulphide isomerase 3 (<italic>PDI-3</italic>)] increased in the drought-stressed wild-type plants. Compared with the wild type, the increase in mRNA abundance of these genes was less (in some genes much less) in the BiP overexpressing lines that were exposed to drought. The effect of drought on leaf senescence was investigated in soybean and tobacco. It had previously been reported that tobacco BiP overexpression or repression reduced or accentuated the effects of drought. BiP overexpressing tobacco and soybean showed delayed leaf senescence during drought. BiP antisense tobacco plants, conversely, showed advanced leaf senescence. It is concluded that BiP overexpression confers resistance to drought, through an as yet unknown mechanism that is related to ER functioning. The delay in leaf senescence by BiP overexpression might relate to the absence of the response to drought.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Binding protein</kwd><kwd>BiP</kwd><kwd>drought tolerance</kwd><kwd>environmental stresses</kwd><kwd>leaf senescence</kwd><kwd>soybean</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants under natural conditions are continually subject to environmental stresses that adversely affect growth and productivity. As a consequence, they have evolved a variety of adaptive and molecular responses. Water deficit is among the major environmental limitations to crop productivity. Engineered overexpression of a single downstream target, such as biosynthetic enzymes for osmoprotectants, enzymes of the antioxidant system, late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, and molecular chaperones, has been shown to increase water deficit tolerance in plant model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wehmeyer and Vierling, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rodrigues <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashraf and Foolad, 2007</xref>). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident molecular chaperone BiP (binding protein) has been shown to confer drought tolerance when constitutively overexpressed in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>tabacum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism for BiP-mediated increases in water stress tolerance and the effectiveness of this strategy on other economically relevant crops are unknown. They constitute the major focus of the present investigation.</p><p>BiP has been demonstrated to act as a multifunctional protein in animal systems (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maa and Hendershot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</xref>). BiP assists in the folding of proteins and also acts in the ER quality control mechanism that recognizes unfolded or abnormally folded proteins and sends them out of the organelle for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maa and Hendershot, 2004</xref>). Conditions that disrupt ER homeostasis and promote the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER lumen cause ER stress. Cells respond to ER stress by activating a protective signalling cascade, designated unfolded protein response (UPR), that allows the ER processing and folding capacities to be balanced with the cell secretory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</xref>). In animal systems, BiP plays a major role as a sensor of disturbances in protein folding. It regulates the activity of the UPR proximal transducers, PERK, URE1, and ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</xref>). Overexpression of BiP in mammalian cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morris <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>) and tobacco protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leborgne-Castel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) increases cell tolerance to ER stress, whereby ER stress is defined as an imbalance between the cellular demand for ER function (proper protein folding) and the capacity of the ER to carry out this function. Furthermore, antisense down-regulation of BiP mRNA has been shown to increase the sensitivity of transfected cells to ionophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li and Lee, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>) and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>).</p><p>The effect of BiP overexpression on a typical ER stress response was investigated previously using a germination/survival assay in the presence of tunicamycin, a potent inducer of ER stress and an activator of UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Transgenic seeds expressing a soybean BiP gene (soyBiPD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Figueiredo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>) were better able to cope with ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). As in mammalian cells, in plants the BiP-mediated protection against ER stressors is related to the alleviation of the reduced protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morris <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laitusis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leborgne-Castel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In addition to alleviating ER stress and being up-regulated by treatments that promote ER stress, the ER-resident molecular chaperone BiP from soybean exhibits an unusual response to drought. Four BiP genes have been identified in soybean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalinski <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; Figueredo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997). Overexpression of one of these, soyBiPD, has been found to confer tolerance to drought in the plant model system <italic>N</italic>. <italic>tabacum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Although the mechanism of BiP-mediated water stress tolerance has yet to be elucidated, BiP overexpression prevented the increase in anti-oxidative defences found in wild-type plants exposed to drought. Some physiological and molecular changes in the response to drought introduced by the overexpression of <italic>BiPD</italic> in soybean are investigated here, including the effect of this overexpression on soybean leaf senescence. In addition, the effect of <italic>BiPD</italic> silencing and <italic>BiPD</italic> overexpression on leaf senescence in drought-stressed tobacco is reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Soybean transformation</title><p>A plant expression cassette containing the <italic>soyBiPD</italic> gene (GeneBank accession number AF031241) was constructed by insertion of the 2.0 kb <italic>Xba</italic>I cDNA insert of pUFV42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) into the pBS35SdAMVNOS2 vector.

A slow soil drying experiment was imposed in 50% of wild type and transgenic lines at the V6 stage of development. Control plants were watered daily, providing about 180 ml of water per plant.

After this period, the plants again received the normal water supply for 2 weeks. The remaining 50% of plants received normal water supply continuously. All the experiments were conducted with five clones from at least four independently transformed lines.

In the first one, water deficit was induced by a reduction of irrigation to a 40% level for 18 d. This slow soil drying experiment was intended to mimic field conditions and to allow physiological and molecular responses to low water potential (&#x003c8;<sub>w</sub>) be examined for a longer period. The soil water content of all samples was recorded as a function of time to ensure that the extent of soil drying or the severity of plant water stress was similar for all samples analysed. After 18 d of 40% irrigation the leaves of wild-type plants had completely wilted. The transgenic plants, by contrast, had normal turgid leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The leaf &#x003c8;<sub>w</sub> of stressed wild-type plants declined to a maximum stress of &#x02013;2.2 MPa, whereas the leaf &#x003c8;<sub>w</sub> of transgenic plants did not decrease below &#x02013;0.7 to &#x02013;1.0 MPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>).

It is now shown that the same gene (<italic>soyBiPD</italic>) confers drought tolerance in soybean. The BiP-mediated drought-tolerant phenotype and the possible mode of action of BiP in conferring drought resistance is characterized further here. The role of this gene on drought-induced senescence in soybean and tobacco is also investigated. In soybean plants subjected to drought, the overexpression of BiP resulted in the maintenance of shoot turgidity. Unexpectedly, this improvement of leaf water relations was associated with less stomatal closure during drought, and less reduction of photosynthesis and transpiration. The increase in drought tolerance was also not related to some parameters of other short-term or long-term avoidance responses. For example, overexpression of BiP did not result in the accumulation of proline and sucrose, and did not result in the normal increase in root growth under drought conditions. Taken together these results show less drought stress in the drought-treated plants. This was also inferred from the lower (or very much lower) induction of typical drought-induced genes, in drought-stressed BiP overexpressing plants. It should be noted, however, that our measurement of proline and sugars did not exhaust the possibilities of osmotic adaptation. Further work on osmotic potential in the transgenic lines might still reveal an underlying osmotic effect. Interestingly, in the plants in which BiP was overexpressed, drought did also not result in the typical down-regulation of genes encoding the ER molecular chaperones BiP and CNX. The attenuation of drought-induced responses and the basal levels of ER-molecular chaperone transcripts in OE lines may reflect a lower intensity of drought-induced endogenous stress. The reason why the plants become resistant to drought when overexpressing BiP, therefore, is at present unknown. The data might suggest that changes in the ER protein-folding process may serve as an early sensing mechanism of drought stress.</p><p>PEG-induced dehydration has been demonstrated to promote a co-ordinate down-regulation of ER molecular chaperones and folding catalysts in young soybean plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Irsigler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Our results showed that severe drought imposed by a drying soil also represses the expression of UPR&#x02013;specific targets, such as <italic>BiP</italic> and <italic>CNX</italic>, in soybean plants. These results indicated that drought stress inversely regulates UPR-specific targets, impairing the ER folding capacity. However, overexpression of <italic>BiP</italic> prevented the drought-mediated down-regulation of UPR genes. Also, the levels of BiP and CNX transcripts in droughted OE leaves were as high as those detected in wild-type leaves under normal growth conditions. Thus, <italic>BiP</italic> overexpression may prevent the cell from sensing osmotic stress-induced variations in ER function by keeping ER basic activities to a normal level under severe drought conditions.</p><p>It was found that BiP overexpression delayed drought-induced leaf senescence. The mode of BiP action is as yet unclear. Drought stress in the plant, and thus a low leaf water potential, is known to promote leaf senescence. The absence of such a low leaf water potential in the BiP overexpressing plants might be the reason why senescence is not induced in these plants. Interestingly, decreasing BiP expression in tobacco antisense lines hastened leaf senescence, thus showing a close connection between BiP mRNA and senescence. It is not yet known if the accelerated leaf senescence in the BiP antisense plants is associated with a lower leaf water potential than in wild-type plants.</p><p>In addition to its role as molecular chaperone, in mammalian cells BiP has been shown to function as a sensor of alterations in the ER environment that activate the cytoprotective unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</xref>). Like BiP from animal systems, plant BiP has been shown to regulate UPR negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leborgne-Castel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). BiP regulates UPR by controlling the activation status of the three transducers, IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 which act in concert to reduce the unfolded protein load in the ER by attenuating protein synthesis and promoting protein folding and degradation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</xref>). BiP has also been demonstrated to regulate pro-apoptotic pathways that emanate from the ER when ER homeostasis cannot be restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</xref>). Prolonged ER stress (accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins) has been shown to induce cell death, apoptotic-like responses and leaf senescence in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crosti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malerba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zuppini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Watanabe and Lam, 2008</xref>). The effect of UPR on leaf senescence has recently been associated with multimeric G-protein signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Disruption of the G&#x003b2; gene impairs ER stress-induced leaf cell death and attenuates UPR in the same fashion as <italic>BiP</italic> overexpression.</p><p>BiP-mediated increases in water stress tolerance may be connected to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling responses. This idea is based on several observations. Firstly, BiP has been demonstrated to play a direct role in the storage of a rapidly exchanging Ca<sup>2+</sup> pool within the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lievremont <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Thus, overexpression of <italic>BiP</italic> in sense plants may increase the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage capacity, thereby modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in response to drought and hence altering stress perception and response. Secondly, the cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal transduction pathway is thought to regulate turgor pressure of plant cells and to co-ordinate stomatal responses to leaf dehydration (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 1997</xref>). Thirdly, an increase in the level of cytosolic free calcium ions is involved in signal transduction leading to one type of programmed cell death in plants, the hypersensitive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu and Heath, 1998</xref>). Fourthly, in mammalian cells, the control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER by <italic>BiP</italic> overexpression prevented oxidative stress and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997, 1998</xref>). Finally, drought promotes a rapid and excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells that, in turn, causes a lipid peroxidation chain reaction resulting in chemically reactive cleavage products, largely represented by TBA-reactive compounds such as malondialdehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartels, 2001</xref>). Under drought, the level of TBA-reactive compounds was much lower in <italic>BiP</italic> OE lines as compared to wild-type lines. Thus, <italic>BiP</italic> overexpression apparently attenuated the degree of membrane degradation, which is often associated with the release of reactive oxygen species. Leaf senescence is also usually associated with an increase in membrane degradation and an increase in TBA-reactive compounds. Thus, by functional analogy with mammalian cells, the plant BiP effect on oxidative stress and leaf senescence may be associated with a capacity to control Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER. Therefore, the BiP control of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis may provide a link for the apparently pleiotropic physiological effects of BiP protection under water stress. This hypothesis warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern296/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern296/DC1"><bold>Supplementary Fig. S1.</bold></ext-link> Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration in leaves of soybean transgenic lines continuously irrigated (I) or exposed to a 7 d period of suspended irrigation (drought stress, DS).</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern296/DC1"><bold>Supplementary Fig. S2.</bold></ext-link> Enhanced accumulation of <italic>GmNAC1</italic> and <italic>GmNAC3</italic> transcripts during leaf senescence in soybean.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="ern296_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="ern296_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the members of the Plant Molecular Biology Laboratory at BIOAGRO/UFV for technical assistance and for reading the manuscript.
