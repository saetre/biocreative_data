Sequential branching of the epithelium forms an intricate tree of airways with a distinct axis of proximal to distal differentiation, and a coordinated formation of blood vessels at the distal end. An understanding of the budding process that leads to epithelial branching is quite advanced. Organ culture experiments have shown that branching morphogenesis depends on the presence of lung mesenchyme, which induces branching in tracheal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and that the mesenchymal-expressed fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) can substitute for mesenchyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The importance of FGF10 for lung development is demonstrated by the fact that <italic>Fgf10 </italic>null mice die at birth due to numerous defects, one of them being the absence of lung buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Using lung explant culture Bellusci et al and Park et al demonstrated that FGF10 acts as a chemoattractant for the epithelium in lung buds in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. <italic>Fgf10 </italic>expression studies suggest that FGF10-signaling plays an iterative role during lung branching morphogenesis in vivo, as <italic>Fgf10 </italic>is expressed in a dynamic pattern at the tip of each forming bud [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although it is still unknown precisely how this <italic>Fgf10 </italic>expression pattern is controlled, factors that regulate <italic>Fgf10 </italic>expression in the lung include <italic>Fgf9 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], <italic>Tgf-beta </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], <italic>Shh </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and <italic>Bmp4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and interplay between the budding epithelium (expressing SHH and BMP4) and the mesenchyme causes a rapid downregulation of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>as soon as budding is initiated.</p><p>In vivo studies of the mechanism by which <italic>Fgf10 </italic>regulates development of the lung are limited, but a study employing transgenic overexpression of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>by promoter elements from Clara cell secretory protein (<italic>Ccsp</italic>) or surfactant protein C (<italic>SftpC</italic>) genes demonstrated a pronounced prenatal and postnatal effect of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>overexpression. Transgenic expression could be detected starting from E15.5 after embryonic induction and resulted in perturbed branching morphogenesis and formation of adenomatous malformations in E17.5 lungs, demonstrating that localized dynamic expression is the key to proper branching. Postnatal overexpression of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>led to tumor formation and differentiation of epithelial tumor cells into a distal type II alveolar cell like phenotype. Affected areas regressed into proximal cell types upon FGF10 cessation indicating that the differentiated distal cells in this transgenic setting required ongoing FGF10 signaling to be maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This result indicates that <italic>Fgf10 </italic>may play a role in selectively regulating differentiation of the two different pulmonary cell lineages; the proximal conducting airways (bronchi and bronchioles) and the distal respiratory airways (alveolar epithelium). The bronchial epithelium contains Clara cells, ciliated cells and neuroendocrine cells, while the alveolar epithelium consists of type I and type II alveolar cells. Since most of these cell types are specified already before birth, and ectopic FGF10 has the potential to balance cell types in favor of distal cells postnatally, it is possible that <italic>Fgf10 </italic>plays a role in this prenatal specification, although this question has not yet been addressed.</p><p>FGF10 has been shown to regulate prenatal differentiation in other endodermal organs and act as a progenitor maintenance factor. In the pancreas, <italic>Fgf10 </italic>null mice are depleted of progenitor cells leading to arrest of growth and differentiation of the epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], while overexpression causes expansion of progenitor cells and attenuation of differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A similar function is seen in the gastrointestinal tract, as <italic>Fgf10 </italic>null mice exhibit a decrease in dividing progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and ectopic overexpression leads to attenuation of differentiation in a lineage specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The apparent dichotomy of an established role of FGF10 as a chemoattractant in the lung versus a progenitor maintenance factor in the gastrointestinal organs might be rooted in lack of available information due to the dramatic early phenotype in the lungs of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>null mice. Indeed, a recent paper has demonstrated that dosage of FGF10 in the lungs is critical for progenitor cell amplification. Hypomorphic lungs exhibit severe hypoplasia most likely due to insufficient progenitor cell maintenance and reduced vascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>During the course of our analyses of the role of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>on more posterior endoderm (stomach, pancreas and gut), based on a model of ectopic expression of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>using the supposedly pancreas/duodenal/gastric specific <italic>Pdx1 </italic>(Pancreatic and Duodenal homeobox 1) promoter element, we surprisingly detected a dramatic effect on lung development. The transgenic model allowed us to address the hypothesis that <italic>Fgf10 </italic>controls differentiation in the embryonic lung epithelium and functions in lung progenitor maintenance. We here demonstrate that the endogenous PDX1 protein is expressed in developing lung at reduced levels compared to the previously described expression in posterior stomach, pancreas and anterior duodenum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and we find elevated level of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>mRNA and protein in lungs of the pPdx1-<italic>Fgf10 </italic>model from E14.5. We observe effects on multiple aspects of lung development upon ectopic presence of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>within the developing lung epithelium: Our studies confirm that epithelial branching is impaired in <italic>Fgf10 </italic>overexpressing lung lobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Additional effects in the embryonic lung include increased cell proliferation, distalization of the epithelium, attenuation of terminal differentiation, and goblet cell metaplasia. Our work using a gain-of-function approach suggests that the tight control of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>expression observed in the lung is important in controlling the balance between proliferation and differentiation as well as cell lineage determination.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>FGF10<sup>FLAG </sup>is expressed in lung lobes of pPdx1-<italic>Fgf10</italic><sup>FLAG </sup>mice</title><p>Transient transgenic mice expressing a Flag-tagged version of mouse <italic>Fgf10 </italic>under the <italic>Pdx1 </italic>promoter elements were obtained by oocyte injection as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although this <italic>Pdx1 </italic>promoter is thought to be specific to the pancreas, duodenum and posterior stomach, we found a profound phenotype in the lung in approximately half of the transient transgenic (TG) mice, causing perinatal lethality. Initial assessment of pPdx1-<italic>Fgf10</italic><sup>FLAG </sup>embryos with malformed lungs revealed enlargement of one or more lung lobes, and an increase in the distance between terminal branches (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). The phenotype varied between individual mice; in two of the transgenic mice analyzed by histochemistry the entire lung was aberrantly formed, while the other two embryos had abnormal formation of only one of the right lobes or the entire left lobe. Immunohistochemistry for FGF10, using an antibody that only detects high amounts of protein, as well as an antibody for the Flag-tag demonstrated that epithelial cells in these lung lobes contained transgenic FGF10, while the normal lobes did not (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E&#x02013;F</xref>). Some cells displayed abundant FGF10 expression in the entire cytoplasm (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref> arrow), suggesting that these cells synthesize FGF10, while the majority of cells only stained for FGF10 in the cell membrane (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref> arrowhead). In order to validate the production of transgenic FGF10 in the lung itself, we performed in situ hybridization for <italic>Fgf10 </italic>and low cycle multiplex (MPX) RT-PCR for <italic>Fgf10</italic><sup>FLAG </sup>mRNA using <italic>G6pd-2 </italic>as a control. MPX RT-PCR for the transgenic construct showed that <italic>Fgf10</italic><sup>FLAG </sup>mRNA was detectable in the TG lung (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>).

The highest <italic>Fgf10 </italic>mRNA expression was confined to small clusters of cells in the E18.5 embryos (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref> insert) and to isolated cells at E14.5 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>).

This was surprising given the previously reported very accurate replication of endogenous <italic>Pdx1 </italic>expression conferred by the construct in the pancreas, duodenum and posterior stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As the <italic>Pdx1 </italic>promoter fragment used is limited to app. 4.5 kb upstream regulatory sequence, lung expression may be explained by absence of regulatory elements involved in repression of the <italic>Pdx1 </italic>promoter outside the distal foregut domain. However, it was also possible that <italic>Pdx1 </italic>is normally expressed in lung at a low level and would therefore not have been previously detected. We tested this latter hypothesis by performing an analysis of PDX1 expression throughout embryonic development. Our results revealed that PDX1 protein is present in the early lung buds at E12.5, albeit at a very low level compared to pancreatic and duodenal expression (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;B</xref>). We were unable to detect any PDX1 expression in E14.5 (results not shown) and E18.5 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>) wildtype lungs, but in transgene expressing lung lobes significant PDX1 protein expression was maintained in clusters of epithelial cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These lobes exhibited the transgenic phenotype in the entire lobe, likely attributed to the secreted nature of FGF10. Not all PDX1 expressing cells displayed high levels of cytoplasmic staining for FGF10, but all FGF10 secreting cells were positive for PDX1 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). These observations argue that FGF10 is capable of autocrine maintenance of cells with <italic>Pdx1 </italic>expression, otherwise lost during development.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>PDX1 expression</bold>.

Embryonic lung formation by branching morphogenesis depends on chemotactic attraction by FGF10 secreted from the mesenchyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This is however not the only role of FGF10 during lung development. We here provide evidence that in addition to controlling branching morphogenesis, FGF10 maintains the undifferentiated state of the progenitor like cells of the distal buds, hereby coordinating the two processes.</p><p>We show here that PDX1 is expressed by the epithelium of embryonic lung at E12.5, and we employ a <italic>Pdx1 </italic>promoter construct to drive <italic>Fgf10 </italic>expression from this time onwards, as ectopic FGF10 expression presumably allows for maintenance of PDX1 expression. Notwithstanding a possible physiological role of <italic>Pdx1 </italic>in lung development which is not investigated here, the <italic>Pdx1 </italic>promoter driven expression of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>is sufficient to elicit a significant effect on lung development. We confirm previous results showing that overexpression of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>in the embryonic lung epithelium is highly disruptive for branching morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and demonstrate that the observed enlargement of the lung is due to hyperplastic growth and formation of large internal cavities. We conclude that <italic>Fgf10 </italic>overexpression has a mitogenic effect in vivo similar to what has been previously demonstrated in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], corresponding with the reduction of epithelial cell proliferation seen in <italic>Fgf10 </italic>hypomorphic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Transgenic lungs were covered by a dense layer of smooth muscle, also supporting previous findings by Mailleux et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] that FGF10 is required for entry of mesenchymal cells into the parabronchial smooth muscle cell lineage.</p><p>Based on previous studies of the role of FGF10 in more posterior endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and the postnatal effect of FGF10 overexpression on differentiation of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we wished to explore the hypothesis that <italic>Fgf10 </italic>functions in embryonic lung progenitor maintenance. At E18.5, transgenic pulmonary cells were phenotypically similar to wildtype cells before completion of the canalicular stage (E16.6&#x02013;17.4). The majority of the transgenic airway cells remained undifferentiated and mitotic at a time when cells outside of the bronchial epithelium normally cease active proliferation and terminal lung cells differentiate. Markers of early distal cells such as TTF1, the FGFR target PEA3 and Clusterin were co-expressed with pro-Surfactant protein C, while markers of differentiated alveolar type I cells and bronchial cells were largely absent. Pro-surfactant protein C is expressed both early in development and in alveolar type II cells, but mature alveolar type II cells do not co-express TTF1 and Clusterin or PEA3. In contrast, these markers were co-expressed in the transgenic lung and in wildtype E16.5 distal bud cells before differentiation. These results demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>results in attenuation of differentiation and promotion of a progenitor-like distal cell type. An embryonic progenitor maintenance program such as this is necessary for sufficient expansion of the progenitor pool before differentiation, but can contribute to oncogenesis if reinstated during postnatal life. The previous finding that postnatal <italic>Fgf10 </italic>overexpression induces lung tumors with high expression of TTF1 and SftpC thus corresponds with our findings that FGF10 maintains the distal progenitor-like cells during early embryonic development.</p><p>Consistent with the published FGF10 induction of <italic>Bmp4 </italic>expression in lung buds in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we observed upregulation of <italic>Bmp4 </italic>expression in the TG lung. It is likely that part of the observed effects are caused by the altered expression of <italic>Bmp4</italic>, as BMP signaling has been shown to be necessary for the morphologically correct development of lung buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, BMP4 has an anti-proliferative effect in the lung, suggesting that the proliferating progenitor-like cells seen in the pPdx1-<italic>Fgf10</italic><sup>FLAG </sup>lung are maintained by a different mechanism. Our results indicate that this mechanism works through activation of beta-catenin. In previous studies, ectopic expression of an activated form of beta-catenin caused distalization of the proximal airways and goblet cell hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], while ectopic expression of a beta-catenin-Lef1 fusion protein lead to expansion of progenitor cells and intestinal metaplasia of the lung epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The observed difference between the two studies is probably due to binding specificity of Lef1 as opposed to TCF factors. We observe a similar expansion of distal-like progenitor cells, indicating that activation of beta-catenin may be the main mechanism through which FGF10 maintains undifferentiated distal cells. We conclude that the arrested lung phenotype resembles that of the undifferentiated distal lung buds, possibly caused by an increase in <italic>Bmp4 </italic>expression and beta-catenin activation, and appears incapable of normal differentiation under conditions of high FGF10 expression. Consequently, FGF10 elicits lung epithelial progenitor arrest, in a comparable manner to that observed in pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and duodenum (Nyeng et al. Manuscript submitted), indicating a conserved role of FGF10 in the endoderm.</p><p>In the light of the attenuated lung program, it was possible that transdifferentiation of the lung to a pancreatic, gastric or intestinal fate had occurred as a result of ectopic FGF10 and PDX1 expression. Respecification of endodermal cells has been noted in several cases. Overexpression of <italic>Pdx1 </italic>in the liver of Xenopus tadpoles leads to transdifferentiation into pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and forced expression of <italic>Ptf1a </italic>and <italic>Pdx1 </italic>is capable of inducing a pancreatic fate in more anterior endoderm, including stomach, but not lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We found no evidence of transdifferentiation using pancreatic markers whereas early lung markers such as TTF1 and pro-surfactant protein C were preserved. There was also no evidence of conversion to a gastric fate. Transdifferentiation of lung epithelium to an intestine-like fate as seen in the beta-catenin-Lef1 fusion protein model resulted in expression of Paneth cell markers, <italic>Math1 </italic>and <italic>Cdx1 </italic>among other intestinal genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Although <italic>Fgf10 </italic>overexpression leads to dephosphorylation and activation of beta-catenin in our model, we did not find evidence to suggest a major transformation towards an intestinal fate. Although we did observe a few MATH1 expressing cells in the lung, and also several goblet cells, which derive from MATH1 expressing cells, the absence of CDX2 and <italic>Fabp2 </italic>argues against major posteriorization of the lung to an intestinal phenotype.</p><p>Our observation that goblet cells were present in the prospective alveolar epithelium is indicative of goblet cell metaplasia. Increased presence of goblet cells in the lung is often observed during adult lung pathogenesis such as asthma, COPD and cystic fibrosis. Adult goblet cell hyperplasia has been associated with activation of EGFR resulting in signaling through the RAS-MAP-kinase pathway leading to an increase in expression of genes involved in goblet cell formation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]). It is possible that increased FGFR signaling upstream of the MAP-kinase pathway may trigger the same mechanistic pathway, consistent with our observation of upregulation of PEA3, a target of the MAP-kinase pathway. An alternate mechanism could be that the FGF10 mediated activation of beta-catenin seen in our model lead to goblet cell metaplasia, as expression of an activated form of beta-catenin results in goblet cell hyperplasia of the bronchial epithelium through this mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] Goblet cell metaplasia has been shown to originate from Clara cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]) in adult lung pathogenesis. It seems highly unlikely that goblet cells originate from Clara cells in our model, as we did not observe any goblet cells near the bronchial epithelium. Alveolar type II cells function as a progenitor cell for the alveolar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], raising the possibility that metaplastic goblet cells could have differentiated from alveolar type II progenitor cells. We cannot exclude this possibility, although no SftpC and DBA double-positive cells were found. We conclude that <italic>Fgf10 </italic>overexpression leads to embryonic goblet cell metaplasia of the prospective alveolar epithelium, but not conversion to a more posterior endodermal fate. These results demonstrate that, even though <italic>Fgf10 </italic>overexpression perturbs lung morphology and attenuates the lung differentiation program, the lung still retains pulmonary identity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>FGF10 is normally expressed in proximity to budding epithelium, where it directs branching morphogenesis spatially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

These results suggest that a single molecule, FGF10, is intricately involved in coordinating pulmonary branching morphogenesis and cellular differentiation.
