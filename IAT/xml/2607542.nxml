The comparison of <italic>CgPDR1</italic> alleles from azole-susceptible and azole-resistant matched isolates enabled the identification of 57 amino acid substitutions, each positioned in distinct <italic>CgPDR1</italic> alleles. These substitutions, which could be grouped into three different &#x0201c;hot spots,&#x0201d; were gain of function (GOF) mutations since they conferred hyperactivity to CgPdr1p revealed by constitutive high expression of ABC-transporter genes.

In this yeast species, azole resistance is mediated almost exclusively by ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters. Their overexpression results in enhanced efflux of azoles and thus generates resistance. Regulation of ABC transporters is therefore of pivotal importance to understanding azole resistance. In <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, the expression of ABC transporters is mediated by a zinc finger transcription factor called <italic>CgPDR1</italic>. Gain of function (GOF) mutations in <italic>CgPDR1</italic> result in high ABC transporter expression. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of GOF mutations in a large collection of azole-resistant isolates and found a high variety of mutations localized in three distinct domains of <italic>CgPDR1</italic>. We found that these mutations are not only associated with resistance but also enhanced virulence and fitness of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> in animal models. Our study provides for the first time evidence that mutations causing antifungal resistance can also provide a selective advantage under host conditions and thus highlights the need of carefully monitoring resistance in this pathogen.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Candida glabrata</italic> has recently emerged as the second most common cause of invasive candidiasis, and there are increasing numbers of reports showing its important role in mucosal or bloodstream infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Pappas1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Pfaller1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since the three ABC-transporter genes are regulated by <italic>CgPDR1</italic>, their uncoordinated expression might be explained by either differences in their promoter sequences or by differences in the transcriptional capacity of CgPdr1p. To avoid differences due to strain genetic backgrounds, pairs of <italic>CgPDR1</italic> alleles were reintroduced in the same background (DSY562 <italic>pdr1</italic>&#x00394;). mRNA levels of <italic>CgCDR1</italic>, <italic>CgCDR2</italic> and <italic>CgSNQ2</italic> were measured by real-time RT-PCR in the revertant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and compared with those obtained in the clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

These isolates may have adapted to the host conditions in order to cause disease. Moreover, azole therapy in these patients selected for azole-resistant isolates and ultimately led to treatment failure. One interesting and unresolved question is whether <italic>CgPDR1</italic> mutations responsible for high transporter expression have an impact on virulence and fitness of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> under host conditions. We therefore first measured tissue fungal burdens in animal models using tail-vein injections in groups of immuno-competent and immuno-suppressed mice according to previously established protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Barchiesi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-MacCallum1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Fungal loads in kidneys, spleen and liver of all mice were measured seven days after infection. We next performed virulence assays by measuring mice survival after infection with several <italic>C. glabrata</italic> isolates to challenge correlations between virulence and possible differences in tissue fungal loads.</p><p>Using first DSY562 and DSY565 in immuno-competent or immuno-suppressed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>), our results showed that fungal loads in kidneys were significantly increased in both mouse models infected with DSY565 as compared to DSY562 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0007, respectively; see details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000268.s008">Table S3</xref>). The same trend was observed in fungal loads of spleen and liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000268.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Higher fungal loads in tissues of mice infected with the azole-resistant isolate DSY565 correlated with a significant increased virulence as compared to DSY562 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the azole-resistant isolate (DSY565) was more virulent than its azole-susceptible parent, DSY562. Since DSY562 and DSY565 differ at least by the presence of the L280F substitution in <italic>CgPDR1</italic>, it was tempting to test whether this substitution was responsible for this behavior. We therefore replaced the mutated allele with the <italic>CgPDR1</italic> wild type allele in DSY565 (named as DSY565 pdr1&#x00394;-PDR1; SFY118) and also replaced the <italic>CgPDR1</italic> wild type allele with the mutated allele in DSY562 (named as DSY562 pdr1&#x00394;-L280F; SFY115). <italic>CgPDR1</italic> alleles were also reconstituted in their original backgrounds (DSY562 pdr1&#x00394;-PDR1; SFY114 and DSY565 pdr1&#x00394;-L280F; SFY119). Mice infected with DSY562 pdr1&#x00394;-L280F or DSY565 pdr1&#x00394;-L280F had significant higher fungal loads in their kidneys as compared to DSY565 pdr1&#x00394;-PDR1 or DSY562 pdr1&#x00394;-PDR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).

No significant changes in kidneys fungal loads occurred between immuno-competent mice infected with DSY562 and DSY562 pdr1&#x00394;-PDR1 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.07) or with DSY562 pdr1&#x00394;-PDR1 and DSY565 pdr1&#x00394;-PDR1 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.62). Virulence assays with the same strains confirmed the association of increased virulence with increased fungal loads of infected tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Thus, increased virulence was associated with the presence of a GOF mutation in <italic>CgPDR1</italic> independently on the strain background. Introducing other mutations in the background of DSY562 mimicked results of fungal tissue burdens and of virulence assays obtained with the first tested <italic>CgPDR1</italic> mutant allele (see results obtained with DSY562 pdr1&#x00394;-T588A, -Q1083Q, -P822L and DSY562 pdr1&#x00394;-P822L, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g008">Figure 8B</xref>) and thus one can predict that increased virulence may be caused by any of the GOF mutations so far identified in <italic>CgPDR1</italic>. Interestingly, the absence of <italic>CgPDR1</italic> in DSY562 (DSY562 pdr1&#x00394;; SFY92) did not significantly alter fungal tissue burdens and virulence in animal models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g008">Figure 8A</xref>).

The 48 other mutations are also likely GOF mutations since they are present only in alleles isolated from azole-resistant strains upregulating ABC-transporter genes and the localization of these mutations along the protein is similar to GOF mutations described in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homologs Pdr1p/Pdr3p.

Given the high diversity of GOF mutations found in <italic>CgPDR1</italic>, it is unlikely that all mutations affect similarly the transcriptional activity of CgPdr1p that is responsible for ABC-transporter genes overexpression. Hence, GOF mutations in the inhibitory domain might impair transcriptional inhibition and those in the transcriptional activation might induce hyperactivation as proposed for <italic>PDR3</italic> mutations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>The effect of some of the identified GOF mutations might be enlightened by the recent finding that CgPdr1p acts as nuclear receptor by directly binding to azoles in order to activate expression of efflux pumps genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Thakur1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance, the xenobiotic binding domain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pdr1p has been mapped between amino acids 352 and 543, and this domain corresponds by sequence alignment to the MHR region of CgPdr1p. GOF mutations in the MHR might bypass the requirement of xenobiotic binding that is otherwise necessary to activate the transcription of efflux pumps genes. Determining whether <italic>CgPDR1</italic> alleles containing mutations in the MHR domain could still be induced by azoles may verify this hypothesis. Once bound to azoles, CgPdr1p forms a complex with the Mediator co-activator subunit CgGal11p though the KIX motif to activate transcription of target genes. The CgPdr1p KIX-binding domain has been mapped between amino acids 1074 to 1104 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Thakur1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

This sequence is found in the promoters of <italic>CgCDR1</italic>, <italic>CgCDR2</italic> and <italic>CgSNQ2</italic>, suggesting that CgPdr1p binds directly to PDRE sequences to regulate transcription of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Vermitsky2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Tsai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Torelli1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, our results show that <italic>CgCDR1</italic>, <italic>CgCDR2</italic> and <italic>CgSNQ2</italic> are not coordinately expressed in azole-resistant isolates. Moreover, the selective upregulation of efflux pump genes is dependent on the <italic>CgPDR1</italic> GOF alleles, since expression of distinct mutated alleles in the same genetic background restored the ABC-transporter gene expression of the parental clinical strains from which the alleles were isolated. This observation highlights still underscored and novel functions of <italic>CgPDR1</italic> on the regulation of target genes. One possible explanation for these differentiated effects could be the localization of the mutations that may alter the transcriptional activity of CgPdr1p. However, data presented here indicate that mutations within the same domain do not yield similar ABC-transporter expression patterns. For example, two distinct mutations in the KIX domain, E1083Q (in DSY530) and D1082G (in DSY2254), gave selective upregulation of <italic>CgCDR1</italic> alone or both <italic>CgCDR1</italic> and <italic>CgCDR2</italic>, respectively. On the other hand, differences in the number and/or sequence of the PDRE present in the efflux pump promoters could influence CgPdr1p regulatory activity. Alternatively, the function of CgPdr1p might be subjected to regulation by other transcription factors. Irrespective of the precise molecular mechanism involved, our results strongly suggest that <italic>CgPDR1</italic> GOF mutations have differentiated effects on target genes including the major ABC-transporters involved in azole resistance. Microarray experiments performed with individual <italic>CgPDR1</italic> mutations would help determining whether other target genes are differentially expressed and promoter analysis may provide clues to uncover this mechanism.</p><p>The presence of a PDRE sequence in the promoter of <italic>CgPDR1</italic> as well as the constitutive high expression of <italic>CgPDR1</italic> in some azole-resistant isolates suggested an auto-regulation similarly to <italic>PDR3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Vermitsky2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Tsai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Delahodde1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

It has thus been proposed that <italic>CgPDR1</italic> may regulate its own expression leading to azole resistance. However, results presented here suggest that <italic>CgPDR1</italic> upregulation is restricted to a limited number of azole-resistant isolates and does not correlate with the presence of GOF mutations. The increase in <italic>CgPDR1</italic> expression observed in our strains is not sufficient <italic>per se</italic> to induce azole resistance.

Existing studies have mostly used intravenous injection of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> at varying doses (10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> cells per mouse) with different immune system status (immuno-competent and immuno-suppressed) and in different mice backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Arendrup1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Brieland1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Depending on the initial infection doses and the mice genetic background, not only CFU counts in target organs (kidneys, spleen and liver) differed by several logs (from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> CFU per g infected tissue) over the duration of the experiments but also mice survival was varying. As compared to <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. glabrata</italic> was consistently much less pathogenic. In our study, we have followed protocols established recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Torelli1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Kaur1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and used different immune status regimen to enable valid conclusions on the relationship between azole resistance and virulence. Our findings that <italic>C. glabrata</italic> resistant strains are both more virulent in mice and less susceptible to azoles <italic>in vitro</italic>/<italic>in vivo</italic> as compared to wild type isolates strongly suggest a gain in fitness for the resistant isolates. As shown in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000268-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), the azole-resistant population did effectively take over the azole-susceptible isolates in the absence of drug selection. We showed that it is the presence of GOF mutations rather than the presence of <italic>CgPDR1</italic> that accounts for increased virulence. On the opposite to known <italic>C. glabrata</italic> mutants (such as <italic>ace2</italic>&#x00394;) for which hypervirulence was associated with formation of pseudo-hyphae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Kamran1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, the morphology of azole-resistant isolates tested here was not altered and therefore GOF mutations in <italic>CgPDR1</italic> are likely to account for the observed phenotype. Hypervirulence has been also observed in other fungal species such as <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> where perturbation in cAMP signalling by inactivation of <italic>PKR1</italic> (encoding the PKA regulatory subunit) resulted in capsule overproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-DSouza1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Even though other <italic>C. glabrata</italic> infection models remain to be tested, this is to our knowledge the first example of <italic>in vivo</italic> acquired mutations in a fungal gene with a positive impact on <italic>in vivo</italic> fitness. This highlights a need of carefully monitoring drug resistance of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> in infected patients, since increased virulence observed here may also have a negative impact on the outcome of the disease. In <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, the gain in fitness may have favoured an important proportion of azole-resistant <italic>C. glabrata</italic> isolates with ABC transporter upregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Bennett1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Sanguinetti1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This is in contrast with studies on molecular epidemiology of drug resistance performed with other fungal pathogens, where resistance develops by more diverse resistance mechanisms, thus raising the question whether the gain of fitness mediated by <italic>CgPDR1</italic> is a feature unique for <italic>C. glabrata</italic>. It will be therefore interesting to test whether transcriptional activators of drug resistance genes have similar effects on virulence and fitness in other important fungal pathogens.</p><p>How <italic>CgPDR1</italic> GOF mutations may affect virulence is still unknown. Nevertheless, published microarray experiments comparing a wild type <italic>C. glabrata</italic> isolates with a resistant strain expressing a mutated form of CgPdr1p may help identifying genes having a putative role in the virulence on the basis of differentially expressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000268-Vermitsky2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Even though the number of differentially regulated genes is high in this study, several genes involved in stress response, resistance to DNA damage and cell wall structure are upregulated in the azole-resistant isolate, all of which may contribute individually or in combination to modulate the virulence of <italic>C. glabrata</italic>. Further studies are therefore necessary to address the involvement of these genes in virulence.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that <italic>CgPDR1</italic> GOF mutations alone are responsible for fluconazole treatment failure in a murine model.
