Double-immunostaining with antibodies directed against PAR and ISWI shows that ISWI is overloaded on polytene chromosomes misexpressing wild-type ISWI, as compared to control chromosomes misexpressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The increase in chromatin-bound ISWI is accompanied by a massive increase in PARylation of chromosomes. This hyper-PARylation is not dependent on ISWI ATPase activity, because misexpression of the enzymatically inactive ISWI<sup>K159R</sup> protein has a similar effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Thus, over-PARylation of chromosomes probably occurs as a consequence of the physical binding of a nonphysiological amount of ISWI on chromatin rather than as an indirect response to an increase in ISWI activity. One interesting possibility is that increased PARylation of chromatin-bound proteins, which might include ISWI itself, could be a homeostatic response designed to counteract excessive ISWI chromosome binding.</p><fig id="pbio-0060252-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>ISWI Misexpression Is Accompanied by Global Hyper-PARylation of Chromosomes</title><p>(A) Distribution of PAR (green) and ISWI (red) on polytene chromosomes from lines expressing <italic>UAS-GFP</italic>, <italic>UAS-ISWI</italic>, or <italic>UAS-ISWI<sup>K159R</sup></italic> transgenes under control of the <italic>eyGAL4</italic> driver.

Immunoprecipitations conducted on wild-type larval nuclear extracts using antibodies directed against ISWI, or on extract derived from HA-epitope tagged ISWI using the aHA antibody, failed to detect a direct physical association between ISWI and PARP (unpublished data). Since PARP has been shown to be dynamically associated with its target sites on chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, we may not be able to detect a direct physical interaction with ISWI from crude nuclear extracts.

The dual detection by immuno-FISH of the <italic>hsp70</italic> genes at cytological location 87A and 87C and ISWI has allowed us to establish that in the absence of heat shock conditions, ISWI very reproducibly binds the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus at 87A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g007">Figure 7</xref>B, arrowhead). However, upon heat shock, the <italic>hsp70</italic> loci acquire elevated levels of PARylated chromatin components and PARP is required in the process of chromatin decondensation that manifests itself as localized heat shocked puffs (see DAPI in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg006">Figure S6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg006">S6</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

If, upon heat-shock, PARP activity removes ISWI chromatin binding at the 87A <italic>hsp70</italic> locus, we would predict that in the <italic>Parp</italic> mutant, ISWI should remain bound to chromatin after heat shock. Indeed, in <italic>Parp</italic> mutant polytene chromosomes ISWI remains bound to the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus 87A after heat shock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg006">Figure S6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060252-sg006">S6</xref>D). In line with these findings, in heat-shocked salivary gland protein extracts, the amount of PARylated ISWI is significantly higher than in extracts obtained under non&#x02013;heat-shocked conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060252-g007">Figure 7</xref>D).</p><p>Our data indicate that binding of ISWI to the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene can be counteracted by PARylation of chromatin at the 87A locus and that the loss of ISWI binding upon heat shock is a physiological response that is directly dependent upon the activity of PARP. Since ISWI is a target of PARylation both in vitro and in vivo, we propose that upon heat shock, ISWI bound at the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus could be among the chromatin components that get PARylated and this in turn promotes its release from chromatin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>PARP and ISWI Could Compete for Common Chromatin Target Sites</title><p>PARP is an abundant nuclear protein that plays important roles in multiple DNA repair pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

Therefore, one intriguing possibility is that PARP activity can counteract ISWI function. Indeed, ISWI and PARP appear to compete for common chromatin target sites, as supported by their nonoverlapping chromatin binding patterns. The antagonistic dominant action of PARP over ISWI may help to promote transcription at specific chromatin sites by opening chromatin and blocking higher order chromatin structure formation by ISWI, although PARP has also been shown to directly promote the formation of compact, transcriptionally repressed chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Poly-ADP-Ribosylation Can Regulate ATP-Dependent Nucleosome Remodeler</title><p>We found that ISWI is PARylated in vivo and in vitro, revealing the molecular basis of the genetic interaction we found between <italic>ISWI</italic> and <italic>Parp</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although, the PARylation of ISWI reduces its chromatin-stimulated ATPase activity by &#x0223c;40&#x00025;, PARylated ISWI reduces its affinity for nucleosomes by nearly 10-fold. These differences can be explained by the different nature of the ATPase/PARylation and band shift assays. In contrast with the band shift assay, during the enzymatic ATPase/PARylation assay, the fraction of ISWI that is not yet PARylated can be strongly and rapidly stimulated by nucleosomes, thus masking the strong inhibition exerted by PARP on the PARylated ISWI fraction.</p><p>PARP is in a dynamic equilibrium between its chromatin-bound and free nucleoplasm form &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

The levels of ISWI and PAR in the eyG<italic>AL4;EP3570</italic> and <italic>eyGAL4;UAS-GFP</italic> polytene chromosomes have been normalized with anti-Mod &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060252-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; and do not change by Western blot on larval nuclear extracts (unpublished data). Our data suggest that the eyGAL4 misexpression of PARP in the <italic>EP3570</italic> increases general chromatin PARylation that in turns reduces ISWI binding to chromatin, thus causing the enhancement of <italic>ISWI<sup>K159R</sup></italic> eye phenotypes we observed with the <italic>EP3570</italic> line. These data bring support to the notion that the antagonistic relationship between ISWI and PARP, which is presented in this manuscript, is physiological and of biological significance.</p><p>(3.46 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0060252.sg001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0060252-sg002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Analysis of PARylated Proteins in Wild-Type and <italic>ISWI</italic> Mutants and of Recombinant ISWI Proteins</title><p>(A) Aliquots of total protein extracts from wild-type (wt) and the <italic>ISWI<sup>1</sup>/ISWI<sup>2</sup></italic> (<italic>ISWI</italic>) mutant third instar larvae were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis, with anti-PAR (lanes 1 and 2) and anti-ISWI (lanes 3 and 4) antibodies.

In the absence of PARP, a mass excess of &#x0223c;8 fold ISWI/DNA is sufficient to start to shift the bulk of the DNA population. In contrast, when PARP is included in the bandshift reaction, the mass excess of ISWI necessary to shift the DNA population to the same extent is at least 2-fold greater (16-fold). The reduction in DNA affinity is reversed in the presence of 3-AB.</p><p>(1.06 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0060252.sg003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0060252-sg004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><title>Effect of Free PAR on the ATPase Activity of ISWI</title><p>(A) Known amounts of free poly-ADP-ribose &#x0005b;Standard&#x0005d; (Alexis Biochemicals) are compared, by Immuno-dot, with serial dilutions of total PAR&#x02014;free and covalently attached&#x02014;produced in standard ATPase/PARylation dual assay reactions in the presence of DNA &#x0005b;DNA&#x0005d; or UV-treated chromatin &#x0005b;CHR&#x0005d; (4 nmol ISWI, 0.03 nmol PARP, 1 &#x003bc;g of activated DNA, or 100 ng in vitro assembled UV-treated chromatin).
