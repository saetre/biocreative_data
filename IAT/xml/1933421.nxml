They are effectors in diacylglycerol-regulated signaling pathways. In mammals, three highly related PKDs 1&#x02013;3 (in human named also PKC&#x003bc;, PKD2 and PKC&#x003bd;) are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. PKD contains two domains, a regulatory domain and a catalytic kinase domain. The regulatory domain inhibits the kinase domain, until the enzyme is activated by phosphorylation of two serine residues located within the kinase domain. Three ways have been described to activate PKD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As consequence of a mitotic signal, diacylglycerol is generated by phospholipase C stimulation, resulting in the activation of either novel protein kinase C, PKC&#x003b5; or PKC&#x003b7;, which in turn phosphorylate PKD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Alternatively, PKD1 is activated by G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; that binds to the regulatory domain, thereby abrogating its inhibitory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Finally, in response to genotoxic stress, the kinase domain can be released by Caspase-mediated cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, a PKD homologue in <italic>C. elegans </italic>DKF-1 (D-kinase factor 1) is directly activated by phorbol-esters independent of PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. PKDs are found within different subcellular compartments in agreement with their multiple biological roles in highly diverse cellular processes including cell proliferation and apoptosis, cell migration, cellular differentiation and notably, cargo specific secretory transport from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The involvement of PKD in the regulation of fission of secretory vesicles from TGN was deduced primarily from overexpression experiments of a presumptive dominant negative PKD variant, which bears a single amino acid substitution in the ATP binding domain and therefore lacks kinase activity ('kinase dead') [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. 'Kinase dead' PKD interferes with the fission of vesicles at the TGN owing to a tubularization of Golgi membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The relevance of these observations is strengthened by the finding that one of the physiological substrates of PKD1 and PKD2 is phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase III beta (PI4KIII&#x003b2;), which is central to Golgi structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Apart from its role in secretory transport, transgenic mouse models reveal the importance of PKD for differentiation of T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, mutants of the corresponding <italic>C. elegans </italic>kinase DKF-1 displayed body paralysis, whereas overexpression caused growth defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila </italic>genome harbors a single PKD homologue. As expected for a multifunctional protein, PKD is broadly expressed during development. A fraction of the PKD protein localizes to the Golgi compartment in agreement with a proposed role in secretory transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Hence, <italic>Drosophila </italic>may serve as model system to investigate the <italic>in vivo </italic>function of PKD. To this end, we have analyzed the phenotypic consequences of overexpression of wild type and mutant PKD variants on the development of a number of tissues, the consequences of tissue specific RNA-interference and the capacity of human hPKD2 and hPKD3 to substitute for <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD. Only slight defects primarily during wing vein development were observed upon overexpression of wild type (WT) or kd-variants, whereas overexpression of a constitutively active form is deleterious to fly development, as is PKD RNAi. Our data are in accordance with a role for PKD in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, cell proliferation and death and hence, the differentiation of various tissues during fly development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PKD overexpression constructs</title><p>Mammalian PKD is a multifunctional kinase regulating diverse processes including proliferation, apoptosis and secretory transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The lack of mutants hampers a direct analysis of PKD's role in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In order to address the possible functions of PKD in the fly, we examined the consequences of overexpression of wild type, presumptive dominant negative and constitutively active PKD variants as well as of PKD depletion by RNA interference. Several UAS-constructs were generated (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) that allow tissue specific overexpression using the Gal4/UAS-system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The PKD-WT construct expresses the PKD wild type protein fused to GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To generate a 'kinase dead' (kd) PKD-construct, lysine K<sub>572 </sub>was replaced by tryptophan in order to destroy the presumptive ATP-binding domain. The resultant PKD protein was expected to be a dominant negative isoform according to earlier reports on respective changes in mammalian PKDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A constitutive active protein PKD-SE was generated by replacing two serine residues S<sub>698 </sub>and S<sub>702 </sub>with glutamate. These two serines are located within the activation loop and are presumably phosphorylated upon activation of PKD in analogy to respective observations on mammalian PKDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Likewise changes have been reported to generate constitutive active forms of human PKD as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Both variants, PKD-kd and PKD-SE were made as C-terminal fusion to GFP in order to facilitate their <italic>in vivo </italic>detection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The human isoforms hPKD2 and hPKD3 (i.e. PKD2 and PKC&#x003bd; respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] were likewise fused to GFP and cloned as UAS-overexpression constructs. They were chosen as a more diverse (hPKD2) and the most similar (hPKD3) in comparison with <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Finally, a large portion of the kinase domain (codons 582 &#x02013; 836) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] was cloned in inverted and direct orientation, split by a small intron into pUAST to generate dsPKD. This construct is expected to produce a double stranded RNA transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], resulting in tissue specific RNA interference and hence, depletion of PKD activity. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> gives an overview of the different constructs. Several independent transgenic lines were generated from each construct and compared for their expressivity. PKD expression was monitored on Western blots and <italic>in situ </italic>in larval tissues making use of the GFP-tag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;E</xref>, and data not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Finally, at least five strains of each construct were compared in overexpression experiments for their phenotypes; typical strains were used in subsequent experiments.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>PKD variants and activity</bold>. A) Schematic representation of <italic>Drosophila </italic>wild type and mutant UAS-PKD variants, PKD-WT, PKD-kd, PKD-SE, dsPKD and human PKD variants, hPKD2 and hPKD3. Apart from dsPKD, all proteins were expressed as GFP fusion proteins. PKD contains a regulatory domain and a kinase domain. The characteristic features include: C1, C2, Zink-fingers 1 and 2; A, acidic domain; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; KD, kinase domain. In addition, hPKD2 contains a proline rich domain (P) at the N-terminal end and a serine rich region between the two zinc fingers (purple box). Two serine residues in the kinase domain (Ser<sub>689</sub>, Ser<sub>702</sub>) are thought to be phosphorylated upon activation of PKD. They were both mutated to glutamic acid in PKD-SE. hPKD2 contains a further possible auto-phosphorylation target within the C-terminus. The presumptive ATP binding site, lysine at the beginning of the kinase domain (K<sub>572</sub>), is highlighted. It was altered to tryptophane in PKD-kd. Numbers refer to codons; they are according to [1] for hPKDs and [13] for <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD. B-E) Fidelity and level of expression for the different variants was analyzed <italic>in vivo </italic>by help of the GFP-tag. Different Gal4-driver lines were used to address tissue specificity of GFP-expression. The examples show specific GFP-expression in the posterior compartment of a wing imaginal disc (right half) as can be achieved by using the en-Gal4 driver line. For better visualization, discs are outlined with dotted lines. The antero-posterior (yellow line) and the dorso-ventral borders (purple line) are indicated in B).

To investigate whether the PKD-kd and -SE variants are interfering with secretory transport, we made use of a plasmid encoding horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fused to a signal sequence. The fusion protein ss-HRP can be used as a reporter for constitutive protein secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We transfected HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding for ss-HRP and PKD-WT, -kd or -SE and measured the secretion of ss-HRP over time. In control cells, secretion of ss-HRP could be detected within 1 hour and increased over time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Co-expression of PKD-kd inhibited the secretion of ss-HRP into the supernatant, whereas co-expression of PKD-SE increased the amount of secreted HRP compared to the control. Expression of PKD-WT had no effect on secretion of ss-HRP in this system. It has been demonstrated, that expression of a kinase dead PKD variant leads to tubularization of the TGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We therefore investigated, whether expression of <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD-kd displays similar effects. Unfortunately, changes in Golgi-morphology are difficult to detect in <italic>Drosophila </italic>cells due to their small size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which hampers an analysis in this system. Therefore we transfected COS7 cells with plasmids encoding <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD-WT, -kd and -SE proteins fused to GFP. PKD-WT and PKD-SE displayed a similar localization; both proteins were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm with a small portion of the protein enriched at a perinuclear structure, which presents the Golgi compartment ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In contrast, PKD-kd was strongly enriched at the Golgi compartment and induced the formation of tubules. This is in accordance with the phenotype induced by expression of mammalian dominant negative PKD-kd variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Activity of PKD-kd and PKD-SE in cell culture</bold>.

The PKD variants were ubiquitously overexpressed using the da-Gal4 driver line and within the posterior wing compartment using the en-Gal4 driver line, respectively. Induction of either PKD-WT or PKD-kd variants interfered with formation of wing veins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B&#x02013;E</xref>). The posterior cross vein was frequently affected and incompletely developed. In addition to massive vein loss, PKD-kd induced ectopic veins, mostly abutting the second and less often the fifth longitudial vein, when overexpressed uniformly during larval development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Defects in wing development upon PKD overexpression</bold>.

B) Ubiquitous PKD-WT overexpression affects the posterior cross vein (arrow). C) A similar defect is observed upon overexpression of PKD-WT just in the posterior compartment (arrow). D) Overexpression of PKD-kd caused loss of veins (arrow) and induced ectopic veinlets (arrowhead). E) In contrast, overexpression of PKD-kd within the posterior compartment only resulted primarily in loss of veins (arrow) and only few ectopic veinlets (arrowhead). F) Overexpression of PKD-SE within the posterior compartment prevented cross vein formation (arrow). G) Depletion of PKD within the posterior wing compartment by RNAi caused loss of wing tissue, resulting in a conspicuous bent of the wing when compared to wild type. It did not affect wing venation; however, the texture of the wing was altered. A dotted line marks the antero-posterior compartment border. H) Tissue loss was not influenced by concomitant overexpression of DIAP1, albeit the total size of the wing was increased (compare with G).

Offspring from a cross of da-Gal4 with UAS-PKD-SE all died at first larval instar larva at 18&#x000b0;C and at 25&#x000b0;C. Most da &#x0003e; dsPKD animals died as prepupae at 25&#x000b0;C and only few started pupation (13 of 207); at 18&#x000b0;C they developed into pharate adults with few attempting to hatch (5 of 164). Induced within the posterior compartment only, PKD-SE was fully lethal at late pupal stage at 25&#x000b0;C and semilethal at 18&#x000b0;C (32 of 224 animals hatched). Many of the eclosed animals were defective in wing inflation; unfolded wings typically showed a complete lack of cross veins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Hence, cross vein formation requires a tight regulation of PKD activity. The ectopic veins that were caused by overexpression of PKD-kd may reflect dominant negative effects.</p><p>Overexpression of dsPKD in the posterior compartment effected slightly undulated wings that were somewhat shorter than the control and bent towards the posterior (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). Wing curvature was a consequence of a smaller posterior compartment (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The overall size of the posterior compartment was decreased by about 20% compared to a wild type wing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, cell number values (cells per area) were unchanged compared to wild type or to the anterior compartment suggesting that cell size remained constant in contrast to overall cell number. Cell numbers could be due to lowered proliferation and/or induction of apoptosis. Tissue loss was rescued by PKD-WT indicating that it was indeed caused by PKD depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We addressed the involvement of apoptosis by concomitant overexpression of <italic>Drosophila </italic>inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (DIAP1). In none of the experiments performed we observed a full rescue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G,H</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and data not shown). However, we noted a slight improvement: although the wing bent remained unchanged despite DIAP1 overexpression, the overall size of the wing was increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>). Comparing the anterior compartments only, en-Gal &#x0003e; dsPKD was 88.6% (&#x000b1; 6.4% SD) of wild type size and increased to 96.1% (&#x000b1; 4.5% SD) by concurrent overexpression of DIAP1.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Rescue of wing defects</bold>.

The F2/F1 ratio was calculated for each wing independently to avoid influence of natural variation on wing size e.g. due to nutritional conditions. B) PKD-RNAi was induced in the posterior compartment at 29&#x000b0;C or 25&#x000b0;C as indicated; concurrently, PKD-WT10-2 or DIAP1 were overexpressed.

When two copies of dsPKD were overexpressed along the antero-posterior border in the wing anlagen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>), the affected tissue, which is normally located between the third and the fourth longitudinal vein, was partially lost in adult wings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D,E</xref>). In addition, the wings were undulated and uneven in texture. In this setting, we could also show a reduction of PKD protein expression indicating that overexpression of the RNAi construct caused indeed a hypomorphic situation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>). However, larval wing imaginal discs appeared fairly normal in size and the strip of cells, where RNAi was induced, appeared as wide as in the control suggesting that the developmental defects occurred primarily during pupal morphogenesis (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B,C</xref>). We noted enrichment of activated Caspase 3 along the antero-posterior boundary indicative of apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F&#x02013;G</xref>). At the same time, we observed a slight decrease in BrdU incorporation, although no conspicuous reduction in the number of mitotic cells was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H&#x02013;K</xref>). Regarding all this, we conclude that both, impaired proliferation as well as increased apoptosis was involved in generating tissue loss in the adult wing. The partial rescue may result from insufficient DIAP1 doses or from additional stronger defects in cell proliferation primarily during metamorphosis, contributing to the tissue loss phenotype. The reduction of tissue size was not restricted to the wing: we observed a dramatic reduction of the adult eye when dsPKD was overexpressed in the eye anlagen using the ey-Gal4 driver line, too (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Loss of tissue upon PKD RNAi</bold>.

Recently, we have found that the expression patterns of <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD are compatible with a role in secretory transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which we aimed to address experimentally. Therefore, we investigated the consequences of a manipulation of PKD activity on the adult retina. During late pupal development, rhodopsin and other phototransduction proteins are transported from the Golgi into rhabdomeres, the light sensitive membranes of the photoreceptor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A block in maturation or trafficking of rhodopsin results in a degeneration of the rhabdomeres and subsequently the retina in a light dependent manner over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This can be shown in sections of adult eyes. We used the gmr-Gal4 driver line to induce the expression of the PKD proteins behind the morphogenetic furrow within cells that enter neuronal differentiation. No effects on the outer eye were observed upon induction of <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD WT, human hPKD2 and hPKD3 or of the PKD-kd variant. However, we noted small black dots that were restricted to single ommatidia when PKD-SE was overexpressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,B</xref>). Induction of dsPKD in the gmr-pattern affected the outer eye more dramatically: about a third of the flies had one or more glossy shining patches in their eyes that turned dark over time (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Patches appeared necrotic and irregular (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). These outer eye phenotypes were largely insensitive to inhibition of apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B&#x02013;E</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Manipulation of PKD activity causes retina degeneration. </bold>A) Eyes of control flies have externally a smooth and regular appearance (left column).

We noted thinner lenses in some ommatidia of gmr &#x0003e; dsPKD flies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The large black patches in older flies were filled with cocci (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Bacterial infection can be an explanation for the darkening and increase in size of these patches with age and their resistance to rescue by DIAP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D,E</xref>; Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The observed lesions in the eye lens may damage the physical barrier of the cuticle, thereby allowing bacterial entry more easily. Accordingly, other obvious infections were not prevalent in dsPKD flies compared to their untreated siblings. Alternatively, PKD could be involved in fly immune response. However, no rescue was seen with UAS-defensin, which has been shown to specifically combat gram<sup>+</sup>bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Retina defects were analyzed in sections. PKD-SE overexpression induced striking elongation and fragmentation of rhabdomeres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), whereas PKD-RNAi resulted in a collapse and disappearance of rhabdomeres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Conspicuous holes were detected between the ommatidia in both cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B,D</xref>). Since the overall ommatidial architecture appeared quite normal at low resolution, we conclude that the retina degenerated during metamorphosis after being established normally during larval and early pupal development. Accordingly, photoreceptor cells appeared normal when visualized with anti-Elav antisera in third instar larval eye discs of gmr &#x0003e; PKD-SE animals (data not shown). Sections revealed a slight improvement by concomitant overexpression of DIAP1; most notably the holes disappeared (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C,E</xref>). However, DIAP1 had little effect on the morphology of the rhabdomeres. Neither could it halt the fragmentation caused by overexpression of PKD-SE nor the disintegrating resulting from PKD-RNAi (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C,E</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that the degeneration of the adult retina is partly caused by apoptosis, yet other mechanisms must contribute as well. This was unexpected since retinal degeneration caused for example by rhodopsin mutations can be prevented by blocking apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>We next asked, whether PKD-mediated retinal degeneration was light and age dependent, which is typical for defects in rhodopsin maturation or trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We set up parallel experiments, in which we overexpressed PKD-SE and dsPKD in complete darkness and in a normal day-night light cycle, and examined the subsequent retinal degeneration at the day of eclosion and 3, 6, 10 and 14 days later, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, and data not shown). We noticed that the effects of PKD-SE were largely independent of age, however, were more severe in the light than in the dark. Whereas the rhabdomeres of the light-reared flies were elongated and often fragmented, those of the dark reared flies appeared swollen and irregular. Fragmentation was less frequent. However, retina degeneration occurred also in the dark albeit it was less severe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). In contrast, the defects caused by PKD-RNAi were both dependent on light and age since the strongest phenotypes were observed in the older flies that were reared in a day-night cycle. In these flies, many rhabdomeres had completely disappeared. In contrast, younger flies or flies reared in the dark showed much milder signs of deterioration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Hence, PKD is important for the formation and the maintenance of rhabdomeres where it seems to be continuously required in light sensitive processes.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Dependence of retinal degeneration on light and age. </bold>Flies were raised in twelve-hour day-night cycle (left column; labelled with black and white bar) or in complete darkness (right column; black bar) and aged for several days at 25&#x000b0;C.

Wing veins are established in several phases during larval and pupal development and require the activity of a number of signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. One example is the Notch signaling pathway. Overactivation of this pathway results in loss of veins indistinguishable of phenotypes observed for example in en &#x0003e; PKD-kd (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, ectopic expression of proneural proteins can induce ectopic veinlets similar to what is seen in the da &#x0003e; PKD-kd wings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Notch activity reduces those veinlets and hence, acts in the opposite direction. Therefore, PKD might positively regulate Notch signaling, whereas the dominant negative activity of PKD-kd might inhibit it. Similar phenotypes can also be a consequence of disturbance of EGFR-signaling. For example, loss of veins is seen in <italic>veinlet (ve) </italic>mutants whereas overexpression of <italic>ve </italic>induces ectopic veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The Ve protein is a positive regulator of EGFR-signaling and is required for the release of the respective ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Hence, PKD might be involved in the negative regulation of EGFR-signaling. Finally, the dpp-pathway plays an important role in the positioning and consolidation of veins and notably, of cross veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Interestingly, vein phenotypes caused by an overactivation of the dpp-pathway are indistinguishable from those caused by the overexpression of PKD-kd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Any of these pathways or all of them may be influenced by PKD, which can be now addressed in more detail. As cross veins are most sensitive towards overexpression of PKD, the dpp-pathway seems to be the most promising candidate. The altered wing texture caused by overexpression of dsPKD appears to be non-autonomous and may reflect defects in the secretion of extracellular matrix or wing cuticle. Shortly after eclosion, wing epithelial cells delaminate and migrate into the thorax. Extra-cellular matrix components are produced presumably by these migrating cells that bond ventral and dorsal wing surfaces once the cells have disappeared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Disturbance of this process interferes with wing unfolding and bonding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The resultant phenotypes are reminiscent of defects seen upon overexpression of either PKD-SE (wing unfolding) or dsPKD (flaccid wings) and in agreement with a role for PKD in these processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Human PKD can replace <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD activity</title><p>Mammals contain three highly related PKD isoforms that, based on their similarity, may be functionally redundant.

The latter raises the possibility of an interference between dsPKD and hPKD mRNA. Stretches of identical sequences are rather short, however, may suffice for interference notably with hPKD2 and less likely with hPKD3 (see Materials and Methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The similarity in rescue of either construct is in agreement with a replacement of <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD function rather than a titration of the generated siRNAs by hPKD mRNA. Strikingly, we observed that both hPKD proteins were predominantly cytosolic in <italic>Drosophila </italic>tissues, just like the <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;E</xref>).

Mammalian cells use specific mechanisms to regulate nuclear import of PKD that may not operate in the fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Nuclear transport of PKD requires PKC and responds to G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In this context, it is noteworthy that the <italic>C. elegans </italic>homologue DKF-1 is stimulated directly by phorbol-esters independent of PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

Apparently, the fly's retina is highly sensitive towards PKD doses. The phenotypes were quite distinct suggesting that they were not just a consequence of interference with the trafficking of rhodopsin. In this case, we would have expected a degeneration of rhabdomeres in a light and age dependent manner that, in addition, should be amenable to rescue by inhibition of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In contrast, the defects caused by the overexpression of the two PKD constructs were only slightly ameliorated by DIAP1. We cannot exclude, however, that the dose of DIAP1 was insufficient for a full rescue. Overall, the retinal degeneration seemed not to be caused primarily by interference with rhodopsin trafficking. Whereas PKD downregulation resembled defects in rhodopsin, the overactivation of PKD caused the elongation and sometimes fragmentation of the rhabdomeres.

Together, these two genes are required to organize a localized actin cytoskeleton and eventually form the microvilli stacks that build up the rhabdomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Based on the similarity of the phenotypes, we propose that manipulation of PKD somehow affects the cytoskeleton and thereby the formation and maintenance of rhabdomeres rather than being involved in rhodopsin trafficking. In fact, rhodopsin itself plays an essential structural role in rhabdomere morphogenesis that involves F-actin and the unconventional myosin ninaC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Accordingly, mutations affecting either rhodopsin, ninaC or components involved in establishment of the microtubule network, i.e. F-actin capping proteins, cause a likewise retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. An involvement of PKD in cytoskeletal dynamics would attribute to both, the gain and the loss of function phenotypes. Interestingly, mammalian PKD1 is associated with the F-actin binding proteins cortactin and paxillin in invasive breast cancer cells where it may regulate cell adhesion and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In the context of photoreceptor axon guidance, Bif is phosphorylated and thereby regulated by the Ser/Thr kinase misshapen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that PKD might likewise regulate Bif, thereby implementing its influence on the actin cytoskeleton. Further investigations on the relationship of PKD and Bif in <italic>Drosophila </italic>may help to elucidate the role of human PKDs in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and metastasis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our overexpression experiments reveal an involvement of <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD in many aspects of development. The effects on vein formation argue for a regulatory input of PKD on one or several signaling pathways, for example dpp-, Notch- or EGFR-pathways. Tissue loss for example in the wing caused by PKD RNAi suggests a role in proliferation and regulation of apoptosis, which is corroborated by respective antibody stainings. A striking degeneration of the adult retina was observed upon downregulation of PKD by RNAi or by overexpression of the presumptive constitutively active PKD-SE isoform. In both cases the formation and maintenance of the rhabdomeres was affected. The observed phenotypes conform to a role of PKD in the regulation of actin dynamics in agreement with similar findings in mammalian cells. Although the eye phenotypes are most likely not a consequence of a disturbed trafficking of rhodopsin, PKD might be involved in the transport of other basolateral cargo for example in extracellular matrix formation of the adult wing. Despite a considerable divergence, human hPKD2 and hPKD3 could largely restore <italic>Drosophila </italic>PKD RNAi-phenotypes. In summary, our studies are in accordance with a role of PKD in the regulation of cell proliferation and death and hence, the differentiation of various tissues during <italic>Drosophila </italic>development. Most interestingly, the potential involvement of PKD in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics may help to unravel the role of human PKDs in cell motility and metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Fly strains and crosses</title><p>Flies were obtained from the Bloomington stock center, if not mentioned otherwise; information on strains can be found in the flybase.
