The FOXO proteins participate in multiple signaling pathways, and their transcriptional activity is regulated by several post-translational mechanisms, including phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination. Because these post-translational modification sites are located within the C-terminal basic region of the FOXO DNA-binding domain (FOXO-DBD), it is possible that these post-translational modifications could alter the DNA-binding characteristics. To understand how FOXO mediate transcriptional activity, we report here the 2.7 &#x000c5; crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of FOXO3a (FOXO3a-DBD) bound to a 13-bp DNA duplex containing a FOXO consensus binding sequence (GTAAACA). Based on a unique structural feature in the C-terminal region and results from biochemical and mutational studies, our studies may explain how FOXO-DBD C-terminal phosphorylation by protein kinase B (PKB) or acetylation by cAMP-response element binding protein (CBP) can attenuate the DNA-binding activity and thereby reduce transcriptional activity of FOXO proteins. In addition, we demonstrate that the methyl groups of specific thymine bases within the consensus sequence are important for FOXO3a-DBD recognition of the consensus binding site.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The forkhead box proteins (FOX proteins) comprise a large family of functionally diverse transcription factors involved in cellular proliferation, transformation, differentiation and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). These proteins, found in various species ranging from yeast to human, have multiple domains that are specific for DNA binding, transactivation or transrepression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). One sub-family of FOX proteins, the &#x02018;O&#x02019; class forkhead proteins (FOXO), are transcription factors that play important roles in several biological processes, including metabolism, cellular proliferation, cell survival and response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10">5&#x02013;10</xref>). To date, the FOXO family in mammals contains four members: FOXO1 (FKHR), FOXO3a (FKHRL1), FOXO4 (AFX) and FOXO6. These proteins share a high degree of evolutionary conservation, especially in the forkhead DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). Among these FOXO proteins, FOXO3a is involved in cell transformation, tumor progression and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of FOXO3a and sequence alignment of its forkhead domain with other FOX proteins.

All FOXO proteins are regulated by insulin or growth factor signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase&#x02013;protein kinase B (PI3K&#x02013;PKB) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). PKB-induced phosphorylation of FOXO proteins generates two binding sites for the binding of 14-3-3 proteins, which results in the translocation of FOXO/14-3-3 complex from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In addition, the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to FOXO is required for FOXO protein dissociation from DNA and prevents re-translocation of FOXO into the nucleus by masking the function of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28 B29">25&#x02013;29</xref>). Recent studies have shown that acetylation of FOXO proteins by cAMP-response element binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and deacetylation by Sir2 are also important regulators of FOXO-mediated transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32 B33">30&#x02013;33</xref>). In FOXO1, CBP-induced acetylation at two basic residues, Lys242 and Lys245 (corresponding to Lys242 and Lys245 in FOXO3a), located in the C-terminal region of the DNA-binding domain, has been shown to reduce its DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>Each member of the FOX family contains a conserved DNA-binding domain (forkhead domain) with a winged-helix fold that recognizes DNA. This so-called &#x02018;winged helix/forkhead domain&#x02019; contains &#x0223c;100 conserved amino acid residues and is characterized by three &#x003b1;-helices packed against each other, three small &#x003b2;-strands, one wing known as &#x02018;wing 1&#x02019; and the C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix or &#x02018;wing 2&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37 B38 B39 B40 B41">35&#x02013;41</xref>). To date, the crystal structures of the forkhead DNA-binding domain bound to DNA have been determined for FOXA3 (also named HNF-3&#x003b3;), FOXK1a and FOXP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Although the DNA-binding domains of FOX proteins share a high degree of sequence homology in the recognition helix (helix 3), their DNA recognition specificity shows notable variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The amino acid compositions in the H2&#x02013;H3 turn, wing 1 and C-terminal region of the DNA-binding domain exhibit apparent sequence deviations. Thus, it has been hypothesized that the variability in DNA recognition specificity is modulated by these non-conserved DNA-binding domain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>Because the PKB phosphorylation site (Ser253), CDK2 phosphorylation site (Ser246 in FOXO1) and CBP acetylation sites (Lys242 and Lys245) are located within the C-terminal basic region of the FOXO DNA-binding domain, it is possible that these post-translational modifications could alter the DNA-binding characteristics by introducing a negative charge or disrupting protein&#x02013;DNA contacts in this region that result in destabilization of the protein&#x02013;DNA complex. Hence, the elucidation of the FOXO&#x02013;DNA complex structure is necessary to understand the molecular basis for FOXO protein recognition of DNA. Here, we report the 2.7 &#x000c5; resolution crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of FOXO3a (FOXO3a-DBD) bound to a 13-bp DNA duplex containing a FOXO consensus binding sequence. Based on a structural feature in the C-terminal region of FOXO3a-DBD, as well as results from biochemical and mutation studies, we discuss the potential phosphorylation and acetylation sites for the C-terminal region of FOXO3a-DBD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of FOXO3a-DBD</title><p>DNA encoding residues 158&#x02013;253 of human FOXO3a-DBD was generated by PCR amplification using full-length FOXO3a cDNA and ligated into pET-21b using the NdeI and XhoI sites.

The typical wing 1 interacted with the phosphate group of the 3&#x02032; flanking region of the consensus sequence without making base-specific contacts. In the C-terminal region of FOXO3a-DBD, the residues following S3 formed a coil structure that aligned to the major groove and interacted with the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). To analyze structural deviations, two FOXO3a-DBD molecules related by pseudo 2-fold symmetry in the asymmetric unit were superimposed. The 0.64 &#x000c5; root mean square deviation (RMSD) for C&#x003b1; atoms of secondary structural elements showed no obvious structural disparity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D shows the electron density map of the interface between the recognition helix and major groove of DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Major groove recognition within the consensus binding site</title><p>In most forkhead proteins, the recognition helices H3 within the DNA-binding domain share a highly conserved amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). As expected, the recognition helix H3 in the FOXO3a-DBD structure docked perpendicular to the major groove and formed extensive contacts with the FOXO consensus binding sequence. The recognition helix H3 centered over the FOXO consensus sequence, with several residues within helix 3 forming direct hydrogen bonds as well as van der Waals contacts with bases of the major groove. Details of the interactions between recognition helix H3 and DNA are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The conserved residues Asn208, Ser215, Arg211 and His212 within H3 were important for DNA recognition. Asn208 bound to the A4 base via two hydrogen bonds. Arg211 recognized T5&#x02032; and T7&#x02032; through van der Waals contacts and contributed to the specificity for G6&#x02032; with a direct hydrogen bond. The side chain of His212 protruded into the major groove and recognized bases T2 and T3&#x02032; through a van der Waals contact and a direct hydrogen bond, respectively. Ser215 recognized T4&#x02032; through a van der Waals contact. Among these interactions, we note that the methyl groups of thymine bases from the FOXO consensus binding sequence were crucial for FOXO3a-DBD promoter recognition. In addition to base recognition, Ser215 also interacted with the phosphate group of T8&#x02032; to further stabilize the complex. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Detailed contacts of the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA interface.

Interestingly, the C-terminal region (242-KSGKAPRRRAVS-253) not only functions as a NLS, but also overlaps with the PKB phosphorylation site, 14-3-3 binding motif and CBP acetylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The three basic residues Arg248-Arg249-Arg250, part of the PKB recognition motif, are highly conserved in other members of the FOXO family. In our structure, this region played an important role in DNA major groove binding, with each of these three residues forming an ion pair with a phosphate group in the major groove of the DNA backbone without base-specific contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Ser253, a PKB phosphorylation site, immediately following the Arg248&#x02013;250 motif also made direct contact with a DNA phosphate group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), implying that Ser253 (when non-phosphorylated) participates in DNA binding. PKB-mediated phosphorylation at this residue may disrupt this contact and thereby inhibit DNA binding by introduction of a negative charge. In addition, previous work has shown that two positively charged residues, Lys242 and Lys245 of FOXO1 (corresponding to Lys242 and Lys245 in FOXO3a) located in the C-terminal region of the DNA-binding domain, are prone to acetylation by CBP, leading to reduced DNA binding and increased sensitivity to PKB-induced phosphorylation at Ser253 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, Lys245 interacted directly with the DNA phosphate group, but Lys242 was too far away from the DNA to participate directly in binding. This is consistent with the results from our mutagenesis study (see below) where a K245A mutation resulted in a greater apparent loss of DNA binding than a K242A mutation. The protein&#x02013;DNA interactions of Lys245 could be explained if the acetylation of Lys residues led to the reduction of the DNA-binding affinity. Interestingly, no apparent intramolecular interaction was found between the C-terminal coil and FOXO3a-DBD, suggesting that the C-terminal region is highly mobile in the absence of DNA. Hence, in the presence of DNA the C-terminal coil may be stabilized by interactions with the major groove. The C-terminal region of FOXO3a thus plays several important roles in DNA binding, and charge variations induced by phosphorylation or acetylation may attenuate the DNA-binding affinity of FOXO proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction between wing 1 and DNA</title><p>The FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex structure revealed that wing 1 of FOXO3a also contributes to DNA binding by interacting with the phosphate backbone in the 3&#x02032;-flanking region of the consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). The terminal amine of Lys230 formed an ion pair with the phosphate group of T7&#x02032;. In addition, the amide group of Ser232 made a hydrogen bond with the phosphate group of G6&#x02032;. Arg222 and Trp234, located at the stem of wing 1, also made contact with the phosphate groups of G6&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Analysis of the amino acid composition of wing 1 of FOX proteins showed that FOXO3a is two residues shorter in the wing 1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The lack of these two residues may change the shape and size of the wing 1 loop, such that wing 1 of FOXO3a is not long enough to push Lys230 far enough into the minor groove for DNA recognition. Thus, although wing 1 of FOXO3a may help to stabilize DNA binding, it does not play a direct role in protein&#x02013;DNA recognition.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural comparison with other FOX proteins</title><p>A superimposition of the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex with the previously reported FOXA3, FOXK1a and FOXP2 DNA complexes showed a high degree of structural similarity in the core region (H1 &#x0223c; H3 and S1 &#x0223c; S3) with RMSDs of 0.64, 0.66 and 0.56 &#x000c5; for C&#x003b1; positions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). However, there are several major structural deviations located in the H2&#x02013;H3 turn, wing 1 and C-terminal regions, as the amino acid compositions and lengths of these regions are not well conserved. In the FOXA3 and FOXP2 complexes, both H2&#x02013;H3 turns formed short &#x003b1;-helices. In contrast, the corresponding regions in FOXO3a and FOXK1a are coil structures. In particular, the H2&#x02013;H3 turn region of FOXO3a has an insertion of five additional residues (198-GDSNS-202) that are solvent-exposed. The function of these extra residues is unknown, because there was no protein&#x02013;DNA interaction in this region within the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex structure. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Structural comparison of FOXO3a-DBD with other FOX/DNA complexes.

In the FOXK1a/DNA complex, wing 1 utilizes Lys73 (corresponding to Lys230 in FOXO3a) to insert into the minor groove to recognize the base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In contrast to FOXK1a, no direct base interaction was found for residue Lys230 in the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex. However, in FOXP2, the five amino acids preceding the corresponding Lys residue were truncated, resulting in a simple turn that did not make any contact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Interestingly, in the FOXP3/NFAT/DNA ternary complex structure, the same Lys residue mediates a protein&#x02013;protein interaction with NFAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Due to the sequence variation in the wing 1 region, we speculate that the differences in length and amino acid composition of wing 1 allow it to play various roles in the mediation of DNA recognition, the stabilization of protein&#x02013;DNA complex or the protein&#x02013;protein interactions in the various FOX proteins.</p><p>The most structurally divergent region of these FOX/DNA complex structures is the C-terminus of the DNA-binding domains, which contains many positively charged residues and functions in DNA binding or recognition specificity. The C-terminal regions of FOXK1a and FOXP2 form an &#x003b1;-helix. In contrast, the corresponding regions of FOXO3a and FOXA3 adopt coiled structures. Although the C-terminal regions of FOXA3, FOXK1a and FOXP2 have different structures, they all position the protein in the same binding orientation, whereas the corresponding region in FOXO3a was in the opposite orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Due to the different arrangement of these coiled structures, FOXO3a interacted with DNA in the major groove whereas FOXA3 interacts with DNA in the minor groove.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA conformation in the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex</title><p>In the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex, the DNA exhibited a bend of 20&#x000b0; toward FOXO3a-DBD, mainly in the major groove, which was bound by the recognition helix. The base steps 2/3 and 6/7 were heavily kinked with roll angles 12.2&#x000b0; and 16.3&#x000b0;, respectively. The major groove was slightly wider (&#x0223c;3&#x02013;4 &#x000c5; wider than the canonical B-DNA) at positions where the recognition helix of FOXO3a-DBD was inserted. The minor groove was also slightly wider in the core sequence region. The helical twist per base pair varied from 24.0&#x000b0; to 40.5&#x000b0;. The DNA was 3.1% shorter than canonical B-DNA with the same number of nucleotides.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutational analyses of FOXO3a-DBD</title><p>To further characterize the roles of the residues involved in protein&#x02013;DNA interactions in the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA structure, we studied the effect of various mutations on the ability of FOXO3a-DBD to bind to a DNA duplex containing either the FOXO consensus binding sequence 5&#x02032;-GTAAACA-3&#x02032; or insulin response sequence (IRS) 5&#x02032;-CAAAATA-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Gel shift studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B) revealed that the FOXO3a-DBD<sub>158&#x02013;240</sub> lacking the C-terminal region almost lost the ability to bind DNA, indicating that the C-terminal region of FOXO3a-DBD contributes significantly to the formation of a stable protein&#x02013;DNA complex. Substitutions of the three basic residues (Arg248 &#x0223c; 250) with alanine also substantially diminished DNA binding. Because Lys242 and Lys245 are located in the C-terminus of FOXO3a-DBD, and Lys245 interacted with the phosphate group, we mutated these Lys residues to alanine and examined their effect on DNA binding. The K245A mutation reduced the DNA-binding ability more than the K242A mutation, consistent with the observed direct interaction between Lys245 and the DNA in the crystal structure. Although Lys242 did not contact the DNA, the K242A mutant showed a slight decrease in DNA affinity. We hypothesize that the K242A mutant impaired DNA binding by destabilizing the C-terminal region. We also examined the effect on DNA binding with the double mutant, K242A/K245A. Interestingly, DNA binding in this double mutant was dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B), suggesting that K242 and K245 might have a synergistic effect on DNA binding. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).

In the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex, Ala246 was close to the DNA major groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). We constructed an aspartic acid substitution mutant, A246D, to mimic the Ser246-phosphorylated state of FOXO1 and to investigate its effect on DNA-binding ability. Indeed, the A246D mutant exhibited substantially decreased DNA binding, indicating that introduction of a negative charge at A246 reduced the DNA-binding ability of FOXO3a by decreasing the stability of the interaction between the C-terminus and DNA. In addition, we also created two mutants, K230A (wing 1 region) and R211A (recognition helix H3), to examine the importance of these residues in DNA binding. Both the R211A and K230A mutants showed an apparent loss of DNA-binding ability, consistent with the crystallographic data showing that both wing 1 and the C-terminal region of FOXO3a-DBD participated in DNA binding. Moreover, the FOXO consensus sequence had higher affinity for DNA than the IRS sequence, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).</p><p>To compare the DNA-binding affinity of the FOXO3a-DBD proteins, we performed fluorescence anisotropy assay to measure the binding ability of these mutant proteins using a fluorescently labeled DNA containing the FOXO consensus binding sequence.

These data support the results of gel shift studies that substitutions of K242 and K245 for alanine reduced the DNA-binding affinity of FOXO3a-DBD. In the structure, residue Ser253 interacted with phosphate group of DNA. To further study the role of PKB-induced phosphorylation at Ser253, we created a S253D mutant to mimic the phosphorylated state. The result showed that S253D mutant caused a decrease on its DNA-binding ability (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 511 &#x000b1; 63 nM), indicating that phosphorylation at Ser253 influences the stability of protein&#x02013;DNA interaction. This effect is also consistent with the result that S256D of FOXO1 (Ser253 in FOXO3a) led a decrease in DNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>).

In the FOXO family, the C-terminal basic region of the DNA-binding domain contains several post-modification sites and is a direct target of the PI3K&#x02013;PKB signaling pathway in response to insulin or growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

These C-terminal post-transcriptional modifications allow for regulation of FOXO-DBD transcriptional activity by altering its DNA-binding affinity. Hence, the goal of this work was to find the molecular basis by which FOXO-DBD interacts with DNA and help explain why the DNA-binding properties of FOXO proteins can be altered by phosphorylation and acetylation within the NLS.</p><sec><title>Regulation of FOXO by the PI3K&#x02013;PKB pathway</title><p>The FOXO family is a key downstream target of the PI3K&#x02013;PKB pathway in response to cellular stimulation by insulin or growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). PKB-induced phosphorylation at three regulatory sites (Thr32, Ser253 and Ser315 in FOXO3a) results in the export of FOXO proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Among these three phosphorylation sites, Ser253 is the primary site located within the NLS of FOXO proteins which overlaps with the 14-3-3 binding motif. PKB-induced phosphorylation at Ser253 and the sequential binding of 14-3-3 proteins have been suggested to prevent the interaction of FOXO with its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, our study showed that replacing a cluster of three basic residues adjacent to Ser253 in the C-terminal region (corresponding to Arg248, Arg249 and Arg250 in FOXO3a) with neutral amino acids effectively disrupted DNA binding by FOXO3a-DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>A, B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These findings are consistent with our FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex structure showing that all three basic residues (Arg248, Arg249 and Arg250) and Ser253 interact with the phosphate groups of the DNA major groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). These interactions may also explain how the binding of 14-3-3 following phosphorylation of Ser253 can mask the interaction of the above four residues to prevent their interaction with DNA, resulting in a decrease in DNA-binding affinity.</p><p>Recently, FOXO protein acetylation was shown to attenuate their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In particular, the three FOXO C-terminal Lys residues Lys242, Lys245 and Lys262, which correspond to Lys242, Lys245 and Lys259 of FOXO3a, can be acetylated by CBP to decrease the DNA affinity and increase the sensitivity for phosphorylation of Ser253 by PKB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The structure of the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex revealed that Lys245 directly interacted with the phosphate group of DNA, but the side chain of Lys242 was exposed to the solvent rather than binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). This result was also in agreement with our mutagenesis study, which showed that the DNA-binding affinity of K245A was much less than that of K242A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>A, B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Therefore, acetylation of K245, located in the C-terminus of FOXO-DBD, may disrupt the protein&#x02013;DNA contacts, resulting in destabilization of this region and providing increased opportunity for PKB to phosphorylate Ser253. In the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA structure, the C-terminus of the DBD formed a random coil that interacted with the negatively charged phosphate groups in the DNA major groove. Interestingly, this proposed coiled structure for the C-terminus of FOXO-DBD is consistent with previous studies where the peptides used to recognize 14-3-3 also adopted coil structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). From these results, we suggest that the C-terminal region of the DNA-binding domain of FOXO proteins is crucial for effective DNA binding and that the sequential events of PKB-induced phosphorylation, the binding of 14-3-3 protein, and CBP-induced acetylation in this region can inhibit binding of the C-terminus to DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequence preference in the FOXO family</title><p>Our study revealed that FOXO3a-DBD bound to a FOXO consensus DNA-binding site. The consensus binding sequence for FOXO proteins is 5&#x02032;-GTAAA(C/T)A-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the characterized FOXO binding sites within promoters of growth factor-responsive genes contain either the FOXO consensus binding sequence or the IRS (5&#x02032;-CAAAA(C/T)A-3&#x02032;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Comparison of the FOXO and IRS sequences showed that both of these sequences encompass a 5&#x02032;-AAA(C/T)A-3&#x02032; binding motif and contain several adenine residues, suggesting that the 5&#x02032;-AAA(C/T)A-3&#x02032; sequence is important for DNA recognition by FOXO proteins. Here, we used this consensus binding sequence in structural and biochemical studies to explain why the preferred DNA-binding sequences of FOXO proteins are AT-rich.</p><p>At the interface between the recognition helix H3 and the major groove, the A&#x02013;T base pair at position 3 (GT<underline>A</underline>AACA) was recognized by His212 via a hydrogen bond to the T3&#x02032; base. Meanwhile, substitution of T3&#x02032; by U caused only a slight decrease in DNA-binding affinity, indicating that the specificity of T3&#x02032; was mainly contributed by His212 via hydrogen bonding rather than van der Waals forces. In the site selection studies, the A&#x02013;T base pair at position 4 (GTA<underline>A</underline>ACA) was highly preferred in some binding sites of the previously characterized FOX proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). In the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex, the A4 base was contacted by the highly conserved residue, Asn208, through two direct hydrogen bonds. In addition, its base-pair partner T4&#x02032; interacted with Ser215, which provided a van der Waals contact with the T4&#x02032; methyl group and resulted in effective discrimination of A from G at this position. Our study also showed that substitution of T4&#x02032; with U decreased DNA affinity. For the A&#x02013;T base pairs at positions 5 and 7 (GTAA<underline>A</underline>C<underline>A</underline>), Arg211 contacted the T5&#x02032; and T7&#x02032; methyl groups only through van der Waals forces. We also substituted U at positions T5&#x02032; or T7&#x02032; and constructed an R211A mutant and analyzed the effects on DNA affinity. These substitutions and the R211A mutant severely impaired the DNA-binding ability of FOXO3a-DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B), suggesting that the methyl groups of base T5&#x02032; and T7&#x02032; are crucial for recognition by Arg211.</p><p>Our results show that the DNA recognition specificity of FOXO3a is due to a series of van der Waals contacts between the methyl groups of thymine bases and the side chains of Arg211, Ser215 and His212 within the recognition helix. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, these residues are absolutely conserved in FOXO proteins, suggesting that similar contacts may be observed in other members of FOXO family. Hence, we speculate that the methyl groups of thymine in the FOXO consensus DNA-binding sequence play an important role in promoter recognition by FOXO proteins.</p><p>In summary, our structure of the FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex provides a good molecular model for FOXO-DBD binding to the consensus DNA-binding sequence. In addition to the recognition helix H3, structural and biochemical analyses also reveal that both wing 1 and the C-terminal regions contribute to DNA binding. The C-terminus of FOXO3a-DBD, which functions as a NLS and contains a PKB phosphorylation site and 14-3-3 binding motif, adopts a coil structure inserted into the major groove of DNA. These results reveal that the C-terminal region of FOXO3a-DBD plays a crucial role in stabilizing the formation of the complex with DNA. The structure of this complex provides insight into how PKB-induced phosphorylation, 14-3-3 protein binding and CBP-induced acetylation can alter the transcriptional activity of FOXO proteins by attenuating DNA affinity.</p></sec><sec><title>PDB accession code</title><p>The atomic coordinates of FOXO3a-DBD/DNA complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2uzk.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge access to the synchrotron radiation beamline 13B1 at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan.
