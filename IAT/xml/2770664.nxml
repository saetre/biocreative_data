We show here using DNA end-joining and exonuclease protection assays that HMO2 binds preferentially to DNA ends. While HMO2 binds DNA with both blunt and cohesive ends, the sequence of a single stranded overhang significantly affects binding, supporting the conclusion that HMO2 recognizes features at DNA ends. Analysis of the effect of duplex length on the ability of HMO2 to protect DNA from exonucleolytic cleavage suggests that more than one HMO2 must assemble at each DNA end. HMO2 binds supercoiled DNA with higher affinity than linear DNA and has a preference for DNA with lesions such as pairs of tandem mismatches; however, comparison of DNA constructs of increasing length suggests that HMO2 may not bind stably as a monomer to distorted DNA. The remarkable ability of HMO2 to protect DNA from exonucleolytic cleavage, combined with reports that HMO2 arrives early at DNA DSBs, suggests that HMO2 may play a role in DSB repair beyond INO80 recruitment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>All organisms depend on efficient repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) to maintain genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The most accurate repair pathway is homologous recombination (HR), which is mainly active during S and G2 as it depends on the presence of sister chromatids, while the more error prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is active throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Both repair pathways must negotiate DNA that is packaged into chromatin, and chromatin remodeling is therefore critical to DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">3&#x02013;7</xref>).</p><p>The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex INO80 has been recently shown to participate in DSB repair in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>). The INO80 complex is recruited to the DSB by interaction with the damage-induced phosphorylated histone H2A (&#x003b3;-H2AX), a phenomenon that requires the high mobility group protein (HMGB) HMO2 (also known as NHP10). HMO2 has been reported to be responsible for interaction with &#x003b3;-H2AX and its inactivation results in reduced INO80 recruitment to the DSB, but not to impaired chromatin remodeling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Since H2A phosphorylation is thought to be an early response to DSB formation, INO80&#x02014;and hence HMO2&#x02014;may contribute to DSB repair by both pathways.</p><p>High mobility group (HMG) proteins are non-histone chromosomal proteins that are classified into three groups, HMGA, HMGB and HMGN depending on their DNA-binding characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). HMGB proteins contain one or more HMG boxes, an &#x0223c;80 amino-acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and are further classified into two groups depending on sequence specificity; the sequence-specific family consists of transcription factors such as lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) and sex-determining factor (SRY), while the non-sequence specific family includes HMGB1, HMGB2 and yeast homologs NHP6A and NHP6B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19">14&#x02013;19</xref>). The HMG box is composed of three &#x003b1;-helices which adopt an &#x02018;L&#x02019; shaped fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Binding to the DNA occurs through the minor groove by partial intercalation of hydrophobic amino acids, resulting in DNA bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), and HMGB proteins preferentially bind to distorted DNA such as cisplatin-modified DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). HMGB proteins participate in stabilizing chromatin structure and play a role in DNA-dependent processes such as recombination and transcription by facilitating nucleoprotein complex assembly. HMGB proteins have also been suggested to contribute to DNA repair, as evidenced for example by DNA end-joining <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of DNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27">24&#x02013;27</xref>)<italic>.</italic></p><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> contains 10 HMGB proteins. The single HMG box proteins NHP6A/B participate in transcription by RNA polymerases II and III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>). HMO1 and HMO2 are more similar to mammalian HMGB proteins by having two HMG-like domains, Box A and Box B. HMO1 has been shown to play a role in plasmid maintenance and normal growth and it also functions in the ribosomal RNA transcription system as well as in regulating ribosomal protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34 B35 B36">31&#x02013;36</xref>). In the &#x0223c;25-kDa HMO2, the two domains Box A and Box B are followed by an acidic C-terminal tail in contrast to HMO1, which has a lysine-rich tail<italic>.</italic> For both HMO1 and HMO2, Box B corresponds to the mammalian Box B while the N-terminal Box A bears little resemblance to mammalian Box A. The HMO1 Box A domain has been shown to contribute to DNA binding and bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>We show here that HMO2 binds to DNA ends, both blunt ends and overhangs, and that it protects DNA from exonuclease digestion. Since protection of DNA ends from exonucleolytic cleavage is essential to minimize loss of genetic information before repair can be initiated, and since HMO2 is thought to arrive early at DSBs in its complex with INO80 components, our data suggests that HMO2 may play a role in DSB repair beyond INO80 recruitment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning, overexpression and purification of protein</title><p>The gene-encoding HMO2 was amplified from yeast genomic DNA using primers NHP10F 5&#x02032;-CACATAAG<underline>CATATG</underline>TCAGTTGAA-3&#x02032; and NHP10R 5&#x02032;-CGTCTTAC<underline>CATATG</underline>TTCAAAGAA-3&#x02032; (NdeI sites underlined) and cloned into the NdeI site of pET14b, resulting in expression of HMO2 with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag. pET14b-HMO2 was transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Rosetta Blue and expression of HMO2 was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at A<sub>600</sub> of 0.2 and induction was carried out for 4 h.

When nicked plasmid was incubated with HMO2 in presence of T4 DNA ligase, HMO2 was found to introduce supercoils to the relaxed DNA. Electrophoresis in the presence of chloroquine indicates the expected introduction of negative supercoils by HMO2 (i.e., a slower migration of topoisomers in the presence of chloroquine; data not shown). This is in consensus with other HMGB proteins which can supercoil relaxed DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The ability of HMO2 to introduce supercoils is consistent with the DNA compaction seen on interaction with plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>DNA binding was analyzed further using EMSA. HMO2 does not form detectable complex with 50-bp DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) most likely reflecting that complexes are unstable and dissociate during electrophoresis since association with longer DNA clearly leads to stable complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Mammalian HMGB was previously shown to bind preferentially to 37 bp DNA containing a pair of loops (tandem mismatches) separated by 9 bp of duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Using the same set of mismatches in the context of 50 bp duplex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp695/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>), HMO2 was seen to form a single stable complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D) indicating preferred binding to the looped DNA construct. Notably, association with the tandem-loop construct leads to enhanced complex formation compared to 50 bp DNA with a single loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C), and binding to the 50 bp duplex containing the CT loop (in which the sequence of the bottom strand contains a 3&#x02032;-CT-5&#x02032;-sequence, resulting in identical opposing bases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) is more stable than the 50 bp duplex with AA loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), perhaps indicating that the sequence of the nucleotides at the loop results in differential DNA distortion, which in turn affects HMO2 binding [an interpretation based on reported differential dynamic properties of DNA with different base mismatches; e.g., ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>)], or inherent sequence preferences of HMO2. Complex formation was generally more defined in presence of detergent as HMO2 self-associates in its absence (not shown); we therefore also had to consider the possibility that equilibrium binding conditions include a contribution from monomeric HMO2 dissociating from a larger aggregate when diluted from a concentrated stock solution, even in the presence of detergent, and we elected not to calculate a binding constant. Such self-association was also noted for the yeast HMGB homolog HMO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). With the 37 bp DNA duplex with tandem loops, HMO2 forms an unstable but detectable complex, while no preferred binding was seen to 37 bp DNA with a single nick, gap or overhang (consistent with the observation that HMO2 binds preferentially to 50 bp DNA with two separate lesions; data not shown). In contrast to HMO1, HMO2 also does not form a detectable complex with 26 bp DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Evidently, HMO2 binds preferentially to DNA with a pair of lesions, but only in duplex DNA of sufficient length. On removal of the N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag, no difference was observed in DNA binding indicating that the presence of the His<sub>6</sub>-tag does not interfere with DNA binding (data not shown). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>HMO2 binds preferentially to DNA with pairs of tandem mismatches.

Evidently, supercoiled DNA competes more efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>); HMO2 forms a distinct complex with the looped DNA while supercoiled DNA competes as indicated by disappearance of the preformed complex. The linearized DNA does not compete at equivalent concentrations whether the DNA has 5&#x02032; overhangs, 3&#x02032; overhangs or blunt ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and data not shown; note that the concentration of free DNA ends is at most 10 nM, well below the concentration of HMO2, while the concentration of internal sites would be more than two orders-of-magnitude higher, assuming a 20 bp site size). This suggests that HMO2 binds to supercoiled DNA with higher affinity compared to linearized DNA. Taken together, our data indicate that HMO2 resembles mammalian HMGB proteins in its preferred binding to supercoiled DNA or DNA with tandem mismatches, but that it distinguishes itself by its requirement for a longer DNA duplex and its preference for DNA with a pair of lesions. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>HMO2 binds preferentially to supercoiled DNA compared to linear DNA.

Also note that failure to join DNA ends is not due to HMO2 merely interacting with the ligase to prevent its activity, as evidenced by the activity of T4 DNA ligase on an internal DNA nick in the presence of HMO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>HMO2 prevents ligation of DNA by T4 DNA ligase.

This is not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Furthermore, we do not observe protection of 50 bp DNA from exonuclease III-digestion in the presence of HMO2 (data not shown). We therefore considered that the 50 bp DNA might be too short to accommodate HMO2 stably at both ends simultaneously. To address this question, plasmid DNA was digested with assorted enzymes to yield fragments of different sizes. When plasmid pET5a is digested with BspHI, four fragments are produced that contain 5&#x02032;-CATG extensions. However, when incubated with HMO2 and exonuclease III, no protection is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, lane 4), while DNA with 5&#x02032;-TA extension is protected from exonucleolytic digestion (lane 8). Consistent with the inability of HMO2 to protect DNA with BspHI-generated 5&#x02032; overhangs, such DNA may be re-ligated in presence of T4 DNA ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 3; lanes 1 and 2 contain DNA without and with T4 DNA ligase, respectively). That ligation products obtained in the presence of HMO2 migrate differently compared to those created in its absence may suggest either that HMO2 still binds with sufficient affinity to the 5&#x02032;-CATG overhangs to compete with ligase for binding or that binding to internal sites results in a DNA conformation that favors formation of a different population of ligation products. Since DNA with 5&#x02032;-AATT extensions is efficiently protected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C), our data suggest that it is the sequence of the overhangs that affects HMO2 binding.

Consistent with this observation, HMO2 was able to protect 339, 692 and 713 bp fragments of pRAD1 linearized with DraI (data not shown). This suggests that not only the size of the DNA but also the sequence of the DNA overhang is important for HMO2 to bind and protect the DNA.</p><p>The failure to protect short DNA from exonuclease III digestion, even if single-stranded overhangs are otherwise compatible with HMO2-binding, predicts that such duplexes should be ligatable in presence of HMO2. We therefore performed an end-joining assay using 105 bp DNA with 5&#x02032;-AATT overhangs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D shows that HMO2 promotes DNA dimer formation in presence of T4 DNA ligase (lanes 3&#x02013;5).

Lane 8 indicates that ligation products with 105 bp obtained in presence of HMO2 cannot be protected from exonuclease III. This experiment not only confirms the inability of HMO2 to associate with the ends of short DNA in a manner that prevents access to ligase and exonuclease III, but it also reveals that HMO2 does not promote cyclization of short DNA. Whether this reflects an inability of HMO2 to bend DNA, the association of several HMO2 protomers causing out-of-phase bending, or preferred binding to DNA ends remains to be determined.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that HMO2 may coat or compact the entire DNA, thereby rendering the majority of the DNA resistant to exonuclease digestion, we assessed whether HMO2&#x02013;DNA complexes are also resistant to endonucleolytic digestion.

Since HMO2 has two domains, Box A and Box B, it would be predicted to require at least a 20 bp DNA site; indeed, the yeast HMGB homolog HMO1, which also features two HMG-like domains, binds poorly to 18 bp DNA, but with significantly higher affinity to 26 bp DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). However, our data suggest that HMO2 binds only weakly to 37 bp DNA with loops (data not shown) and with much greater affinity to 50 bp looped DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). For the Box B domain, which has high homology to mammalian HMGB proteins, interaction with a 10 bp site is a strong prediction. Although the Box A domain differs from consensus HMG sequences, its similarity to the HMO1 Box A domain, which also differs from consensus sequences, yet interacts with an &#x0223c;10 bp site, likewise predicts an &#x0223c;10 bp site. Based on these assumptions about the site sizes for Box A and Box B, a 50 bp DNA construct would be of sufficient length to accommodate a dimer; this interpretation does not necessarily imply that HMO2 likewise binds perfect duplex DNA as a dimer, as the loops may potentially impose a constraint, such as preferred binding to the 4-nt loop by only one of the two protein domains.</p><p>HMGB proteins have been previously shown to bind DNA with loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). The binding preference for DNA with flexure points is a functional correlate of the DNA bend introduced on interaction with an HMG domain, and the prediction is that HMO2 likewise bends its DNA site. HMGB proteins also bind preferably to four-way DNA junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42 B43 B44">42&#x02013;44</xref>); while HMO2 does bind four-way DNA junctions in preference to a linear DNA duplex (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and E), the preference is modest. For mammalian HMGB1, binding to four-way DNA junctions is mediated by the Box A domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). This selectivity arises from using a hydrophobic residue from helix II of the HMG fold as a bending wedge; the greater preference for distorted DNA is due to stacking of this residue on an exposed base pair. In contrast, mammalian HMGB1 Box B has bending wedges in both helices I and II of the HMG fold and is primarily responsible for DNA bending, whereas its affinity for distorted DNA is only modestly higher than that for perfect duplex DNA. By comparison, HMO2 is also predicted to feature a bending wedge (Leu) in helix II of its Box A domain, suggesting that this domain contributes the binding preference for distorted DNA. For HMO2 Box B, a leucine in helix I would be predicted to be the DNA intercalating residue.</p><p>Like other HMGB proteins, HMO2 binds preferentially to supercoiled DNA compared to linear DNA (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The DNA&#x02013;protein complex with highest [HMO2] migrates faster in the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that HMO2 might play a role in DNA compaction. This observation is consistent with the ability of HMO2 to introduce supercoils and with the enhanced staining of HMO2-bound DNA by ethidium bromide that may also reflect DNA unwinding by HMO2. While nuclear HMGB proteins have not been shown to compact DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> as determined by changes in electrophoretic mobility, Abf2p, a protein closely related to the HMG family, has been shown to compact mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Long-range DNA looping created by protein&#x02013;protein contacts, however, has been shown to produce more compact DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA-end binding</title><p>Consistent with its preferred binding to negatively supercoiled DNA, HMO2 produces DNA supercoils, due either to DNA underwinding or out-of-plane bending. And as noted above, its preferred binding to DNA loops likely reflects the energetic advantage to bending DNA with flexible joints. In these interactions, HMO2 emulates properties of mammalian HMGB homologs. What is unique about HMO2 is its remarkable ability to protect certain DNA constructs from exonucleolytic cleavage and to prevent their end-joining in presence of T4 DNA ligase, suggesting preferred binding to these DNA ends. DNA with blunt ends is protected efficiently, while in case of DNA with overhangs, the sequence of the single stranded overhang significantly affects HMO2 binding (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, B, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). Considering the preferred binding of HMO2 to distorted DNA sites, its interaction with DNA ends may likewise be a manifestation of preferred binding to more deformable duplex regions. Mammalian HMGB1 has been reported to bind DNA ends, but not to protect DNA ends from exonuclease III, perhaps reflecting a more dynamic association with the DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The ability of HMO2 to associate more stably with DNA ends is perhaps attributable to the divergent Box A domain which bears little resemblance to mammalian Box A.</p><p>It is also evident that HMO2 requires DNA of a suitable length to bind and protect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Since HMO2 forms stable complex with plasmid DNA, but not with 50 bp perfect duplex, and since it appears to bind only as a dimer to 50 bp looped DNA, complex stability is likely a consequence of both DNA structure and protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Such interactions are likely the reason for protection only of DNA long enough for assembly of several protomers at each DNA end. Self-association was also reported for the yeast HMGB homolog HMO1 as well as for mammalian HMGB1, for which residues in the box B domain critical for its ability to stimulate DNA end-joining were also important for box B self-association on supercoiled DNA and the formation of large nucleoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>If HMO2 were to protect DNA from exonuclease III digestion largely by occluding essentially the entire DNA, except for a limited number of base pairs at the ends, then protection from endonuclease digestion might also be seen. However, no such protection is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). For this interpretation to be considered, one would also expect that all DNA fragments, regardless of sequence of the DNA overhangs, would be protected comparably. This is also not observed, as evidenced by the failure of HMO2 to protect DNA with C- or G-containing overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). We also note that ligation at an internal nick occurs in the presence of HMO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). For HMO2 to bend internal sites, thereby restricting access to exonuclease III and DNA ligase is likewise unlikely; first, attenuated access to endonuclease would again be expected, as would protection of DNA fragments regardless of sequence of DNA overhangs. If significant out-of-phase bending occurred upon HMO2 binding, this could stiffen DNA and prevent net DNA bending, resulting in preferential generation of linear ligation products in preference to circular products, an effect likely to be most pronounced using shorter DNA fragments as opposed to plasmid DNA. Indeed, facilitated cyclization of short DNA fragments in presence of a DNA-bending protein is commonly used as an assay for DNA bending, without internal DNA bends restricting access of DNA ligase to DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In-phase bending might lead to compaction; such compacted DNA may be produced by both HMGB homologs and the bacterial histone-like HU proteins, again without restricting access of DNA ends to DNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Based on these observations and considerations, we therefore conclude that HMO2 exerts its protection against exonuclease III by binding to the DNA ends.</p><p>If DNA with complementary overhangs were to anneal, a duplex with nicks would be produced. However, it can also be ruled out that HMO2 merely binds preferentially to such nicked DNA constructs to prevent their ligation, as short DNA with equivalent overhangs may be ligated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Nicked plasmid DNA may likewise be ligated in the presence of HMO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Indeed, the enhanced ligation of 105 bp DNA in the presence of HMO2 suggests that HMO2 may also bind the ends of the shorter DNA, albeit less stably, as reflected in its inability to protect such duplexes from exonucleolytic digestion. That HMO2 promotes DNA end-joining in the presence of DNA ligase may also be related to the occasional appearance of more slowly migrating DNA species following incubation of linear DNA with both HMO2 and exonuclease III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, lane 8); since these reactions are deproteinized and no ligase is present, we surmise that long single-stranded overhangs generated by exonuclease may invade a complementary duplex in presence of HMO2 to generate a merged structure that is stable to the subsequent manipulations. This possibility is currently under investigation.</p><p>Recently, HMO2 was reported to be a part of the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex INO80 and to be important for recruitment of the INO80 complex to a DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Arrival of the INO80 complex is predicted to be a part of the early response to DSB formation. In both mammalian and yeast cells, a complex containing the Ku heterodimer and DNA ligase is capable of rejoining DNA DSBs with compatible ends via NHEJ, while DNA with damaged ends requires additional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Furthermore, NHEJ and HR events interfere with each other; for example, a Rad51 filament forms on single-stranded DNA in preparation for HR and impedes NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). It is conceivable, therefore, that HMO2, in addition to its role in INO80 recruitment, also contributes to the protection of DNA ends that is essential to preserve the genetic information before DSB repair can be completed. In its complex with INO80 components, HMO2 was reported to interact with phosphorylated histone H2A, indicating that it is not buried in the complex, but accessible for interaction with chromatin. It is therefore likely that it would also be accessible for binding to naked DNA. The preferred binding to DNA with blunt ends or with A+T-containing overhangs may indicate differential functions depending on the type of DNA ends and the DNA repair pathway; for example, yeast Rad51 binds more slowly to single-stranded DNA with AT dinucleotide repeats compared to C- or G-containing dinucleotide repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), perhaps requiring accessory proteins to protect such A+T-rich sequences.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp695/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp695_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp695_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Science Foundation [MCB-0414875 and MCB-0744240 to A.G.].</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
