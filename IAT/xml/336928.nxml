We have isolated cDNAs for a new murine zinc finger encoding gene that has been designated Zfp-37. Northern blot hybridization analysis revealed Zfp-37 transcripts at high levels in the testis, the only adult tissue in which Zfp-37 expression was observed. Zfp-37 was also expressed at lower levels in the mid-gestation embryo and placenta. The major testicular transcripts are 2.3 and 2.6 kb. A 4.0 kb transcript was detected at lower levels in the testis as well as in embryo and placenta. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis revealed that expression of Zfp-37 was most abundant in germ cells which have completed meiosis and are undergoing the complex morphogenetic changes of spermiogenesis. The pattern of expression of Zfp-37 and the presence of the zinc finger domain suggest that Zfp-37 may have a role in regulating spermiogenesis.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0206-a" xlink:role="2830"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0207-a" xlink:role="2831"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0208-a" xlink:role="2832"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2827"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2828"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2829"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2830"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2831"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2832"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2833"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00085-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2834"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
