It functions as a sliding clamp at DNA replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c4">4</xref>) and is also involved in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c6">6</xref>) and cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c9">9</xref>) by interacting with various enzymes and regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c11">11</xref>). Interaction of PCNA with the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) suggests another role in marking of DNA for chromatin assembly during the S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies on the <italic>Drosophila PCNA</italic> and other DNA replication-related genes have revealed that there are at least three common regulatory elements in the promoters of <italic>Drosophila</italic> DNA replication-related genes, DRE (DNA replication-related element) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c17">17</xref>), E2F-recognition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c18">18</xref>) and CFDD [common regulatory factor for DNA replication and DREF (DRE-binding factor) genes] recognition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c19">19</xref>). DRE appears to be an important regulatory element not only for DNA replication-related genes but also for various other cell cycle- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c20">20</xref>) and proliferation-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c22">22</xref>). At least two different protein factors, DREF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c23">23</xref>) and boundary element-associated factor of 32 kDa (BEAF32) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c24">24</xref>) can bind to DRE.</p><p>E2F sites are essential for PCNA gene promoter activity throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c18">18</xref>). However, they themselves do not appear to be sufficient for PCNA gene promoter activity during embryonic and larval stages, since this was completely abolished by deletion of the upstream region containing the DRE sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c18">18</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2F family proteins (dE2F1 and dE2F2) form complexes with their heterodimer partner dDP and bind to E2F sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c28">28</xref>). In addition, transcription of <italic>DNA polymerase</italic> &#x003b1; and <italic>PCNA</italic> is completely lost in dE2F1 or dDP mutant embryos after division cycle 16, indicating that the two proteins are essential for transcription of these DNA replication-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c30">30</xref>). In contrast, a dE2F2 mutant fly demonstrates upregulation of E2F target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c32">32</xref>). Therefore, dE2F1 and dE2F2 appear to have opposing functions during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c33">33</xref>).</p><p>The PCNA gene promoter has three CFDD sites (site 1, 2 and 3), one of these (site 1) could be demonstrated to play an important role in promoter activity in both cultured cells and living flies. CFDD sites are present in promoters of the <italic>DNA polymerase</italic> &#x003b1; and <italic>DREF</italic> genes, although specific CFDD binding factors have yet to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c19">19</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> PCNA gene promoter contains an additional upstream regulatory element (URE) to which a transcription factor Grainyhead (GRH&#x0002f;NTF-1) binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c36">36</xref>). URE in addition to the E2F sites, CFDD sites and DRE appear to be essential for activation of the PCNA gene promoter in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c37">37</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have identified a novel regulatory element in the region between URE and DRE in the PCNA gene promoter. A yeast one-hybrid screening using this element as bait allowed isolation of a cDNA encoding a protein which can bind to the element <italic>in vitro</italic> and which contains a characteristic DNA-binding domain conserved among the regulatory factor X (RFX) family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c42">42</xref>), known to be present in yeast, fungi, nematode, mouse, human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Therefore, we termed this protein dRFX2 and this element the dRFX2 site. The RFX-binding site has been suggested to be involved in regulation of the human <italic>PCNA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c45">45</xref>). The function of some of RFX family proteins might be conserved during evolution. Over-expression of the DNA-binding domain of dRFX2 in imaginal discs inhibited DNA synthesis but exerted no effects on photoreceptor cell differentiation. These results indicate that dRFX2 plays a role in the G1&#x02013;S transition and&#x0002f;or in S-phase progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>The sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing URE (UREL), DRE (DRE-P), CFDD-binding site 1 (CFDD-1) or E2F-recognition sites (E2F-P) in the <italic>PCNA</italic> gene were described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c36">36</xref>).</p><p>The sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the dRFX2 site (&#x02212;124&#x0002f;&#x02212;98) or base-substituted derivatives in the PCNA gene promoter were defined as follows. <list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02212;124WT&#x02003;gatccGTTGGCAGGCCGCTCGCTGCCTGCTATagCAACCGTCCGGCGAGCGACGGACGATAt</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02212;124MUT1&#x02003;gatcc<underline>tggtt</underline>CAGGCCGCTCGCTGCCTGCTATag<underline>accaa</underline>GTCCGGCGAGCGACGGACGATAt</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02212;124MUT2&#x02003;gatccGTTGG<underline>actt</underline>CCGCTCGCTGCCTGCTATagCAACC<underline>tagg</underline>GGCGAGCGACGGACGATAt</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02212;124MUT3&#x02003;gatccGTTGGCAGG<underline>aata</underline>TCGCTGCCTGCTATagCAACCGTCC<underline>ttat</underline>AGCGACGGACGATAt</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02212;124MUT4&#x02003;gatccGTTGGCAGGCCGC<underline>gata</underline>TGCCTGCTATagCAACCGTCCGGCG<underline>ctat</underline>ACGGACGATAt</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02212;124MUT5&#x02003;gatccGTTGGCAGGCCGCTCGC<underline>gtaag</underline>GCTATagCAACCGTCCGGCGAGCG<underline>cattc</underline>CGATAt</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02212;124MUT6&#x02003;gatccGTTGGCAGGCCGCTCGCTGCCT<underline>tagcg</underline>agCAACCGTCCGGCGAGCGACGGA<underline>atcgc</underline>t</p></list-item></list> Nucleotides substituted for the wild-type sequence are shown by small letters with underlining.

To isolate a cDNA encoding a binding factor, we carried out a yeast one-hybrid screen of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> third instar larvae cDNA library using four tandem copies of the sequence spanning from &#x02212;124 to &#x02212;98 as the target binding sequence. On screening 3.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> independent clones, 52 independent positive clones were identified. Nucleotide sequences of these clones were determined.

In addition, using the dRFX2 cDNA as a probe, we screened a <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomic library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c52">52</xref>). On screening 4.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> clones, one containing a sequence of the <italic>dRFX2</italic> gene was isolated and its nucleotide sequence was determined (Supplementary Material 1, DDBJ accession no.: AB190179). Comparison of nucleotide sequences of the dRFX2 cDNA (2526 bp) and the dRFX2 gene suggested that the latter is intronless. The deduced dRFX2 protein consists of 842 amino acids. Multiple alignment with other RFX family proteins from yeast, nematode, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human showed the amino acid sequence from 388 to 463 of dRFX2 to share 33% identity and 57% similarity with hRFX1, the prototype of RFX family proteins, and 39.5% and 61.8% with Sak1, an RFX protein in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Supplementary Material 1). This domain is highly conserved in the RFX family proteins, and demonstrated to be a DNA-binding domain (DBD). Arginine at position 406 (R406), K432, K435, R444, R445, R449, R453, Y454 and Y456 are highly conserved among RFX family proteins, and in a crystallographic structure of the mammalian RFX1 DBD, make direct or water-mediated DNA contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c65">65</xref>).</p><p>We examined the dRFX2 expression pattern during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development by northern blot hybridization. Using dRFX2 cDNA as a probe, a major transcript of 3.4 kb was detected in early embryos and larvae (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f1">1</xref>, second panel). Apparently, no 3.4 kb transcript was detected in pupae, adults and cultured Kc cells. Although the 3.4 kb transcript is barely detectable in third instar larvae, a minor transcript of 6.1 kb was detected in both second and third instar larvae. The 6.1 kb band may represent an alternative form of dRFX2 mRNA such as a transcript derived from an alternative promoter, since the dRFX2 cDNA clone was identified in the one-hybrid screen using a third instar cDNA library as described above. The cDNAs for dRFX and PCNA were used as reference probes. The dRFX mRNA of 4.4 kb was expressed throughout all developmental stages as reported previously, although its level was fluctuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c42">42</xref>). PCNA mRNA of 1.1 kb was found to be expressed in line with cell proliferation during development as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c53">53</xref>). The RP-49 cDNA was used as an internal control to monitor the integrity of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c54">54</xref>).

None of these competitors competed for the binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>A and B). Therefore, the region between &#x02212;124 and &#x02212;98 is specifically required for dRFX2-binding.</p><p>To determine in detail the nucleotide sequence required for binding to dRFX2, various base-substituted mutations were introduced into the region between &#x02212;124 and &#x02212;98 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>A) and the resultant mutant oligonucleotides were used as competitors in the band mobility shift analysis using GST&#x02013;dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> fusion protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>C). The mutant oligonucleotides mut1 and mut2 did not compete at all (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>C, lanes e&#x02013;j), while the other mutant oligonucleotides competed for the binding as effectively as the wild-type &#x02212;124&#x0002f;&#x02212;98 oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>C, lanes b&#x02013;d, l&#x02013;q and s&#x02013;x). These results indicate that the sequence 5&#x02032;-GTTGGCAGG between &#x02212;124 and &#x02212;116 plays an important role in the dRFX2-binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>C).</p><p>We were also interested in whether dRFX can bind to the region between &#x02212;124 and &#x02212;116. When band mobility shift assays were performed using the &#x02212;124&#x0002f;&#x02212;98 oligonucleotide and GST&#x02013;dRFX fusion protein, no band shift was detected (data not shown). Band mobility shift analysis was also conducted with the EP probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c66">66</xref>) carrying the binding consensus sequence for the mammalian RFX family proteins and GST&#x02013;dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> or GST&#x02013;dRFX fusion protein, and EP oligonucleotide or &#x02212;124&#x0002f;&#x02212;98 oligonucleotide was added in the binding reaction as a competitor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>D). EP oligonucleotide competed effectively to binding reaction between EP probe and either GST&#x02013;dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> or GST&#x02013;dRFX fusion protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>D, lanes b and e), suggesting that both dRFX and dRFX2 have strong affinity to EP oligonucleotides. When we used GST&#x02013;dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> fusion protein, the &#x02212;124&#x0002f;&#x02212;98 oligonucleotide competed effectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>D, lanes a and c). However, when GST&#x02013;dRFX fusion protein was applied, the shifted band did not disappear (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>D, lanes d and f). These results suggest that the region between &#x02212;124 and &#x02212;116 is bound exclusively with dRFX2, and we thus termed this the dRFX2 site.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the dRFX2 site in the <italic>dPCNA</italic> gene promoter in living flies</title><p>Previously, we established transgenic flies carrying PCNA [&#x02212;168 to &#x0002b;137) and <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c46">46</xref>).

These fusion genes were then introduced into flies by germ-line transformation. Established transgenic fly lines and their chromosomal linkages are listed in Supplementary Material 2. Activities of the modified promoters were then monitored by quantitative &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays at various developmental stages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f3">3</xref>B).</p><p>In flies carrying the PCNA gene promoter region up to position &#x02212;168, base-substitution mutations in the dRFX2 site (mut1 and mut2) reduced the <italic>lacZ</italic> expression to 50% in embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f3">3</xref>B, panels a&#x02013;c). Much more extensive reduction of the <italic>lacZ</italic> expression was observed in larvae carrying mutations in the dRFX2 site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f3">3</xref>B, panels a&#x02013;c). Especially in second and third instar larvae carrying base-substitution mutations in the region between &#x02212;116 to &#x02212;120, the <italic>lacZ</italic> expression was barely detectable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f3">3</xref>B, panel c). In contrast, only a marginal effect on the <italic>lacZ</italic> expression was observed with a mutation outside the dRFX2 site (mut3) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f3">3</xref>B, panel d). In pupae and adults, there were no remarkable differences between flies carrying the wild-type promoter and those carrying base-substituted derivatives (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f3">3</xref>B). Since the extent of the reduction was most prominent in larvae, &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was demonstrated in dissected third instar larval tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f3">3</xref>C). In transgenic third instar larvae carrying a wild-type construct, high <italic>lacZ</italic>-staining signal was observed in the salivary glands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f3">3</xref>C, panel a). The larvae having mutations in the dRFX2 site (mut1 and mut2) exhibited extensively reduced staining signals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f3">3</xref>C, panels b and c). In contrast, no reduction of staining was observed with lines carrying a mutation outside the dRFX2 site (mut3, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f3">3</xref>C, panel d). We carried out the same examination on probable neuroblasts in the central nervous system (CNS) of third instar larvae and obtained similar results (data not shown).

Band mobility shift assay using the dRFX2 site revealed that the region from amino acid 202 to 480 of dRFX2 contains the DNA-binding activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f2">2</xref>).

Cells behind the MF either leave the cell cycle and differentiate into photoreceptors of the adult ommatidium, or undergo one more cell division. This cell cycle is a final synchronous round, and produces an S-phase band (the second mitotic wave), then these cells form a reservoir of cells for subsequent differentiation events.

Several enhancer trap lines expressing a nucleus-localized form of &#x003b2;-galactosidase depend on the specific enhancer-promoter located nearby the P-element. They were used here to identify each photoreceptor cell. We used three enhancer trap lines, D120 (inserted in <italic>scabrous</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c56">56</xref>), AE127 (inserted in <italic>seven-up</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c57">57</xref>) and P82 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c58">58</xref>), specifically expressing the &#x003b2;-galactosidase marker in photoreceptor cells of early R8, R3&#x0002f;R4&#x0002f;R1&#x0002f;R6 and R3&#x0002f;R4&#x0002f;R7, respectively. The imaginal discs of F1 larvae from mating of each enhancer trap line and transgenic fly expressing dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> in developing eye were immunohistologically stained with an anti &#x003b2;-galactosidase antibody.</p><p>When dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> was expressed in eye imaginal discs, photoreceptors of such flies [early R8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f6">6</xref>A), R3&#x0002f;R4&#x0002f;R1&#x0002f;R6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f6">6</xref>B) and R3&#x0002f;R4&#x0002f;R7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f6">6</xref>C)] showed essentially the same staining pattern as those of control flies (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that ectopic expression of dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> does not interfere with differentiating photoreceptor cells in eye discs.</p></sec><sec><title>Ectopic expression of dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> in eye imaginal discs can induce apoptosis</title><p>Ectopic expression of dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> in eye imaginal discs induced an abnormal S phase. Because it has been reported that disorder of cell cycle progression and disturbance of differentiation processes cause apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c69">69</xref>), we investigated this process in eye imaginal discs expressing dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> by the TUNEL method. In eye discs of flies expressing GAL4 alone, there was very limited cell death (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f7">7</xref>A, panel a). In contrast, eye discs of flies expressing dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> showed a significant increase of apoptotic cells posterior to the MF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh895f7">7</xref>A, panel b).

These results indicate that ectopic expression of dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> in eye imaginal discs can induce apoptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> PCNA gene promoter contains several regulatory elements such as E2F sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c18">18</xref>), DRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c15">15</xref>), CFDD sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c19">19</xref>) and URE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c36">36</xref>). In the present study, we found a novel regulatory element, dRFX2 site in the region between DRE and URE. The nucleotide sequence required for dRFX2-binding was determined to be 5&#x02032;-GTTGGCAGG that matches eight out of nine bases of the sequence 5&#x02032;-GTNRCCNNRG that spans half of the binding consensus sequence for human RFX family proteins, 5&#x02032;-GTNRCC&#x0002f;N-N<sub>0&#x02013;3</sub>-RGYAAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c72">72</xref>). E2F sites, DRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c15">15</xref>) and CFDD sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c19">19</xref>) are found in common in various DNA replication-related genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, while URE appears to be unique to the <italic>PCNA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c73">73</xref>). Although we have searched for dRFX2-binding sequences in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome database, no perfect match was apparent within the region between &#x02212;250 and &#x0002b;50 of DNA replication-related genes such as <italic>orc1-6</italic>, <italic>mcm2-7</italic>, <italic>dup&#x0002f;Cdt1</italic>, <italic>CG5790&#x0002f;Cdc7</italic>, <italic>DNA polymerase</italic> &#x003b1; and &#x003b4;, and <italic>gnf1&#x0002f;RFC140</italic>. PCNA is well known to act as a sliding clamp in DNA replication, but can also interact with many other protein factors involved in various other biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c74">74</xref>). The endogenous dRFX2, therefore, might take a part in regulation of <italic>PCNA</italic> gene expression related to not only DNA replication but also other biological functions.</p><p>We have found that the nucleotide sequence of the dRFX2 site shares 6 out of 9 bases (the region between &#x02212;124 and &#x02212;119 of the <italic>PCNA</italic> gene) with the sequence of the GRH-binding site (URE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c37">37</xref>). In this study, we carried out yeast one-hybrid screening using the sequence spanning from &#x02212;124 to &#x02212;98 as the target site and isolated only a dRFX2 cDNA and not a GRH cDNA. A previous study revealed that the region between &#x02212;130 and &#x02212;123 is more important for GRH-binding than that between &#x02212;122 and &#x02212;118 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c36">36</xref>). On the other hand, in this study, in the band mobility shift assays with GST-dRFX2 and the oligonucleotide &#x02212;124&#x0002f;&#x02212;98 as a probe, the oligonucleotide mut1 containing the mutation in the region between &#x02212;124 and &#x02212;120 did not compete for binding at all. Therefore, the shared nucleotide sequences appear more important for dRFX2- than GRH-binding.</p><p>The full-length dRFX2 cDNA was isolated by conducting 5&#x02032;-RACE and screening of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomic DNA library allowed us to determine genomic clones spanning the <italic>dRFX2</italic> gene and their nucleotide sequences. Although the sequence could not be found in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> database, the FlyBase, Southern blot hybridization analysis revealed that the <italic>dRFX2</italic> is the gene of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. By Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA from <italic>Drosophila</italic> adults cut with BamHI using the dRFX2 cDNA as a probe, a single band of 7.7 kb was detected (data not shown), suggesting the occurrence of a single copy of the <italic>dRFX2</italic> gene per genome. It should be noted that the signal was much weaker than for genes located in euchromatin regions such as the <italic>dPCNA</italic> gene. Genomic DNA in euchromatin region is highly amplified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult tissues. Moreover, nucleotide sequences in and around the <italic>dRFX2</italic> gene contain many repetitive sequences, which are characteristic of the heterochromatin region. The fact that they were found to be five times more frequent in the <italic>dRFX2</italic> gene region than in the <italic>dRFX</italic> gene region suggests that the former is located in heterochromatin.</p><p>Northern blot hybridization analysis revealed the highest expression of dRFX2 in larval stages, correlating with findings for function. Our previous studies indicated that the region containing the transcription initiation site and the E2F sites is sufficient for maternal expression in the ovary. In addition, DRE is required for promoter activity in embryos. In larval stages, the dRFX2 site in addition to the E2F sites, CFDD sites, DRE and URE appear to be essential for activation of the PCNA gene promoter [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c37">37</xref>) and in this study]. Therefore, as development advances, the promoter may require more and more elements to exhibit high activity.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the <italic>dRFX</italic> gene has already been established as an RFX family gene. The <italic>dRFX</italic> gene is expressed in type I sensory neuron lineage of the peripheral nervous system throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c75">75</xref>), and <italic>dRFX</italic> mutants exhibit defects in the morphogenesis of the sensory cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c76">76</xref>). dRFX is homologous to DAF-19 (RFX of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) and to human RFX1 to 3 (hRFX1-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh895c76">76</xref>). The hRFX1 protein was the first representative of the RFX family proteins to be isolated and has been used as the prototype. In addition to the RFX domain, hRFX1 has other conserved domains containing dimerization domain, shared with dRFX. dRFX2 has the RFX domain but lacks these motifs. Therefore, it may be not be likely that dRFX2 forms heterodimer with dRFX. The amino acid sequence of dRFX2 has highest homology with Sak1 and Crt1 (39.5% identity and 61.8% similarity) among RFX family proteins. Therefore, we conclude that dRFX2 is a new member, belonging to a different group from another <italic>Drosophila</italic> RFX proteins.</p><p>To investigate the function of dRFX2 in living flies, we analyzed dominant negative effects. HA-dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> carrying an amino acid sequence containing the RFX domain (DNA-binding domain) was expressed within and posterior to the MF of the eye imaginal discs. Although the HA-dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> is very likely to be a specific dominant negative form active against endogenous dRFX2, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that this form also exerts some effects against endogenous dRFX, since both dRFX2 and dRFX have affinity to the same nucleotide sequence such as EP probe. In eye imaginal discs expressing HA-dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub>, the G1&#x02013;S transition and&#x0002f;or the progression of S phase were&#x0002f;was interrupted, and the ectopic apoptosis was induced, though photoreceptor cells differentiated normally. Since dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> seemed to induce the disturbance of the cell cycle and reduction of the number of cells, cell&#x02013;cell interactions may have been perturbed so that ectopic apoptosis was induced. Expression of dRFX2<sub>202&#x02013;480</sub> might also induce ectopic apoptosis directly. All components of the adult compound eye, including cone cells, bristles and pigment cells are recruited after photoreceptor cell commitment. In either case, these might not be able to develop normally. Specific antibodies against proteins specifically expressed in each of these cells and enhancer trap lines might be useful to identify these cell types. For genetic screening to identify dRFX2-target genes or interacting proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, the transgenic flies established in this study should be useful, and more detailed study of the rough eye phenotype with histological analyses might provide us more information on the roles of endogenous dRFX2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_18_5636__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_18_5636__1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_18_5636__2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="nar_32_18_5636__Supplementary_material_1_sm.jpeg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh895f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Northern blot hybridization analysis: 50 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was loaded in each lane; dRFX2 cDNA was used as a probe (second).
