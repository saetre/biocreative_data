In this study, we describe two alternatively spliced ATF3&#x00394;Zip mRNAs: ATF3&#x00394;Zip2a and ATF3&#x00394;Zip2b. Both variants encoded the same truncated protein of 135 amino acids, which lacked the leucine zipper domain and was incapable of binding to the ATF&#x0002f;CRE motif. The ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 protein was shown to be localized in the nuclei and counteracted the transcriptional repression by the full-length ATF3. Western blot analysis showed that ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 was expressed in cells exposed to A23187. Further study showed that, similar to the full-length ATF3, the expression of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 was induced by a wide range of stress stimuli. However, its expression was not detectable in cancer cells that constitutively over-expressed ATF3. Taken together, our results suggest that ATF3&#x00394;Zip2, a protein derived from alternatively spliced mRNAs, is induced by various stress signals and may modulate the activity of the full-length ATF3 protein during stress response.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x9901180.0x9620688" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos AB078026, AB078027</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA encoding transcription factors is one of the common mechanisms for generating the complexity and diversity of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c3">3</xref>). It produces a variety of functionally distinct isoforms from a single gene by use of different combinations of splice junctions. For example, alternative splicing within the DNA binding domain of Pax-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c4">4</xref>) and Wilm&#x02019;s tumor-associated protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c5">5</xref>) alters their DNA binding specificity. Alternative splicing of the transactivation domains in Pax-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c6">6</xref>), the POU homeodomain family protein Pit-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c7">7</xref>), and the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c8">8</xref>) results in isoforms possessing different activation potencies. Deletion of the activation domain in AML1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c9">9</xref>) and CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c10">10</xref>) by splicing produces variants with dominant negative activity. Thus, additional genetic complexity and diversity might be accomplished by altering regulatory properties through expression of alternatively spliced isoforms of transcription factor.</p><p>Transcriptional repressor activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is one of the immediate early response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c14">14</xref>). It is induced upon exposure of cells to a variety of physiological and pathological stimuli, including seizure, toxic chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c15">15</xref>), anti-cancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c16">16</xref>), proteasome inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c17">17</xref>), genotoxic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c18">18</xref>), homocysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c19">19</xref>) and ischemia-coupled with reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c20">20</xref>). ATF3 is also rapidly induced in regenerating liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c12">12</xref>), or in cells treated by growth-stimulating factors such as serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c22">22</xref>). Furthermore, it is over-expressed in murine melanoma cells with high metastatic potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c23">23</xref>), or esophageal cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c24">24</xref>). Thus, ATF3 functions in both cellular stress response and cell proliferation.</p><p>ATF3 is composed of 181 amino acids and the region from amino acid 40 to 84 has been reported to have the transcriptional repression activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c25">25</xref>). The basic&#x0002f;leucine zipper (bZip) domain from 88 to 147 amino acids is required for dimer formation and specific DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c25">25</xref>). ATF3 forms homodimer with itself and the resulting dimer represses transcription from various promoters with ATF sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>). In addition, this ATF3 homodimer has been demonstrated to repress tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;-induced E-selectin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c26">26</xref>), and arsenite-induced GADD153 gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c28">28</xref>). ATF3 also forms dimers with other bZip proteins. Heterodimers of ATF3 with c-Jun and JunB have been reported to activate transcription in transient transfection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c25">25</xref>). Interestingly, adenovirus E1A induces the expression of ATF3 and leads to the formation of c-Jun&#x0002f;ATF3 heterodimer. Significantly, this activity of E1A is thought to play a role in its ability to transform cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c29">29</xref>). Therefore, ATF3 can activate or repress target genes by forming homo- or heteromeric complexes, and some of these activities have been implicated in significant biological functions.</p><p>Previously, an alternative spliced isoform ATF3&#x00394;Zip was isolated from HeLa cells stimulated by serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>). It lacks the leucine zipper domain and does not bind to the ATF&#x0002f;CRE sequence, but stimulates transcription of reporter driven by promoters with or without ATF&#x0002f;CRE motif, presumably by sequestering co-inhibitory factors away from the promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>). Thus, ATF3&#x00394;Zip regulates the expression of target genes. However, the functional significance of the alternative splice variants, or the presence of other forms of truncated ATF3 remains largely unknown.</p><p>In this report, we describe a novel form of alternatively spliced ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 and characterized its expression in stress response and in cancer cells. ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 expression was highly induced by various stress stimuli, but not in cancer cells over-expressing ATF3. It may regulate gene expression of cells in response to stress stimuli.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Nucleotide sequence accession numbers</title><p>Nucleotide sequences for cDNA of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2a and b have been deposited in DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank with accession numbers AB078026 and AB078027, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>A23187 was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co (Osaka, Japan).

During our analysis by RT&#x02013;PCR using a pair of primers, primer 5&#x02032; and primer 3&#x02032; indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f1">1</xref>A, we observed two bands of 858 and 767 bp in addition to the 546 bp full-length ATF3 mRNA in HUVECs after treatment with A23187 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f1">1</xref>B, lane 3). To test whether these are alternative spliced mRNAs containing the exon D described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>), we performed PCR using primer 5&#x02032; and primer Zip3 localized in exon D (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f1">1</xref>A). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f1">1</xref>B, lane 6, a band of 554 bp was produced, suggesting the presence of an alternatively spliced mRNA containing exon D. However, because two alternatively spliced isoforms were expected from the two bands observed above (858 and 767 bp), we suspected that this pair of primers failed to distinguish the isoforms. Sequence analysis of this PCR product (554 bp) revealed a previously unknown exon, designated as exon D&#x02032; in this report (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f1">1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f2">2</xref>). We then designed a primer called primer Zip4 from the new exon, and performed PCR using primer Zip4 and primer 3&#x02032;. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f1">1</xref>B, lane 9, two bands of 510 and 419 bp were amplified. These bands were produced after reverse transcription using oligo-dT primer, suggesting that the bands were alternative splice variants. Therefore, we determined the sequence of these RT&#x02013;PCR products and compared them with that of the human ATF3 gene. Results showed that the additional two bands in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f1">1</xref>B represented alternatively spliced isoforms of ATF3 mRNA. We named them ATF3&#x00394;Zip2a and b. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f2">2</xref>A, both isoforms utilized a novel 3&#x02032;-acceptor site in the intron C that is at 76 bases upstream from exon D. Therefore, this 76 base sequence was designated as exon D&#x02032; in this study. ATF3&#x00394;Zip2a and b, however, differed in the splicing between exons D and E. Splicing of intron D occurred in ATF3&#x00394;Zip2b as in the full ATF3, but no splicing was observed in ATF3&#x00394;Zip2a, which was amplified as a 91 bp larger fragment than ATF3&#x00394;Zip2b in RT&#x02013;PCR analysis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f2">2</xref>A). This 91 bp sequence was the same as the intron D sequence in the human ATF3 gene (BAC RP11&#x02013;248, accession no. AL606913 in the BAC draft sequence).</p></sec><sec><title>Structure of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2</title><p>In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f2">2</xref>, the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2a and b were aligned and compared with those of full-length ATF3 and ATF3&#x00394;Zip. Both variants of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 encoded the same protein composed of 135 amino acids, among which 1&#x02013;115 amino acids are common to those of full-length ATF3 and ATF3&#x00394;Zip (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f2">2</xref>B). At the C-terminal, the ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 protein contained the basic region but deleted the leucine zipper domain, which was replaced by a novel sequence of 20 amino acids. Therefore, ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is a C-terminally truncated protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Relative expression of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 and full-length ATF3 mRNA in A23187-treated HUVECs</title><p>As the first step to understand the significance of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed semi-quantitative analysis of the relative expression of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f3">3</xref> shows a representative RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of the A23187-treated HUVECs using primer 5&#x02032; and primer 3&#x02032;. The amount of PCR products was analyzed at every two cycles from the 16th to the 24th cycle, and the density of each band was compared. The combined amount of mRNAs for ATF3&#x00394;Zip2a and b was 34 &#x000b1; 4&#x00025; compared with that of full-length ATF3, based on the data at linear range of amplification from the 18th to the 22nd cycle. This indicates that the induction of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is approximately one- third of that for full-length ATF3. We further examined whether ATF3&#x00394;Zip, which is induced in serum-stimulated HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>), was present in the A23187-treated cells. RT&#x02013;PCR using a pair of primer 5&#x02032; and Zip3 for amplifying both ATF3&#x00394;Zip and &#x00394;Zip2, followed by sequence determination, could not detect ATF3&#x00394;Zip (data not shown). Thus, A23187 treatment selectively induced the expression of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2, but not of ATF3&#x00394;Zip. These data indicate that ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is the major alternatively spliced isoform in the A23187-treated HUVECs.</p></sec><sec><title>ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 protein is expressed in the A23187-treated HUVECs</title><p>We next examined whether ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 protein was expressed in the A23187-treated HUVECs. Western blot analysis showed that the full-length ATF3 and a protein of lower molecular weight were induced after treatment with A23187 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f4">4</xref>, lane 3), while these bands were not detected in control cells (lane 2). The lower band showed the same migration mobility as the Flag-tagged ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 (lanes 3 and 4). We note that the anti-ATF3 antibody used in this experiment was generated against the full-length ATF3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>). It could recognize the N-terminal portion of ATF3 and thus both the full-length ATF3 and the ATF2&#x00394;Zip2 proteins. It also detected a non-specific band around 35 kDa in HUVEC cell extracts. The anti-ATF3 antibody C-19 (from Santa Cruz) recognizes the C-terminal region of ATF3 and could not detect the ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 protein (data not shown). These results indicate that ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 protein is expressed in the A23187-treated HUVECs.</p></sec><sec><title>ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is not capable of binding to the ATF&#x0002f;CRE motif, but is localized in nuclei</title><p>To obtain evidence for possible gene regulation by ATF3&#x00394;Zip2, we expressed it as GST fusion protein in <italic>E.coli</italic>, and tested its DNA binding activity. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f5">5</xref> shows that the full-length ATF3&#x02013;GST fusion protein formed the protein&#x02013;DNA complex that was specifically abolished by the wild-type ATF&#x0002f;CRE motif, but not by the mutant sequence (lanes 2&#x02013;5). In contrast, GST&#x02013;ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 did not yield a DNA&#x02013;protein complex, indicating that ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 protein is not capable of binding to the ATF&#x0002f;CRE sequence. Next, we sought to determine subcellular localization of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 protein. For this purpose, we transiently expressed ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 in Cos-7 cells and examined its localization by immunostaining. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f6">6</xref> shows that ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 was localized in nuclei when it was fused to GFP or HA epitope. Full-length ATF3 and ATF3&#x00394;Zip were also localized in nuclei in this assay (data not shown). These data clearly indicate that ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 protein is present in nuclei.</p></sec><sec><title>ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 counteracts the transcriptional repression by full-length ATF3</title><p>We next determined whether ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is capable of regulating gene transcription since ATF3&#x00394;Zip is reported to stimulate transcription, presumably by sequestering co-inhibitory factors away from the promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>). Thus, we tested whether ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 could affect gene expression in a reporter assay. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f7">7</xref> shows that full-length ATF3 repressed the expression of reporter gene containing four repeats of the ATF&#x0002f;CRE motif, while ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 alone had no effect. However, when ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 was co-expressed with full ATF3, it remarkably counteracted the repression by the full-length ATF3 and further stimulated the reporter activity. Since there was no significant difference between the raw and normalized luciferase activity, this result is consistent with that for ATF3&#x00394;Zip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>). The data clearly indicate that ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is capable of regulating the ATF&#x0002f;CRE-dependent gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is induced in response to stress stimuli, but not expressed in ATF3-overexpressing cancer cells</title><p>The expression of ATF3 is induced by a wide range of pathophysiological stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c15">15</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether the expression of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is also induced by stress stimuli other than A23187. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f8">8</xref>A shows that both full-length ATF3 and ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 were induced in HUVECs after treatment by several stimuli including homocysteine, thapsigargin, tunicamycin, hydrogen peroxide and TNF-&#x003b1;, although the level of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 mRNA was variable and most significant in the A23187-treated cells. In Saos2 cells, these stimuli also induced ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f8">8</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;7). We further examined the effect of MMS, MG132 and colchicine, because these agents can induce ATF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c18">18</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f8">8</xref>B, lanes 9&#x02013;11, these agents induced both ATF3 and ATF3&#x00394;Zip2. It is also reported that the expression of ATF3 is elevated in several cancer cells and that its expression correlates with high metastatic potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c24">24</xref>). Thus, several esophageal cancer cells that exhibit high expression of ATF3 were examined. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f8">8</xref>C shows that the ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 mRNA was not detectable in these cancer cells. Taken together, our results indicate that, although ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is co-induced with the full-length ATF3 by many stress stimuli, it is not co-expressed with ATF3 in these esophageal cancer cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Alternative splicing is a powerful and versatile regulatory mechanism that affects gene expression and results in functional diversification of proteins. The primary transcript encoding the ATF3 protein is alternatively spliced to produce ATF3&#x00394;Zip2, which is produced through the activation of alternative splicing between the 5&#x02032; donor site of intron C and the novel 3&#x02032; acceptor site in intron C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f2">2</xref>). We also showed that the truncated ATF3 protein that had the same mobility as ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 was expressed in response to stress stimuli (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f4">4</xref>), providing evidence that ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 mRNA could be translated into a protein. This is of particular importance since mRNA harboring a premature stop codon might be subject to nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in the translational repression of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c35">35</xref>). Nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA is most likely to occur when the premature termination codon is present upstream of the most 3&#x02032; exon&#x02013;exon junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c34">34</xref>). We speculate that ATF3&#x00394;Zip2a mRNA is not a target of decay since its termination codon is present downstream of the most 3&#x02032; exon&#x02013;exon junction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f2">2</xref>). In contrast, ATF3&#x00394;Zip2b mRNA could be a target of decay since the nonsense codon is present upstream of junction of exon D and E. However, more investigation is required to determine whether ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 mRNA is subject to the decay system.</p><p>The expression of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 was induced in cells exposed to various stimuli. These include a wide range of agents, such as genotoxic agents, proteasome inhibitors, oxidative stress, agents that perturb calcium homeostasis, inhibitors of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation, and proinflammatory cytokines. Some of these agents, A23187, thapsigargin, tunicamycin and homocysteine, are inducers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cause the unfolded protein response. Since all the stress stimuli described in this study also induced the full-length ATF3, what is the biological function of co-inducing ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 during stress response? ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 lacks the leucine zipper domain and is incapable of binding to the ATF&#x0002f;CRE motif. Thus, it is defective in forming heteromeric complexes with other factors, such as c-Jun, JunB, ATF2 or GADD153. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf350f7">7</xref>, ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 rescued the reporter activity repressed by the full-length ATF3 in a transient transfection assay. However, when the amount of DNA encoding ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 was increased, it stimulated the reporter activity. This is consistent with the inhibitory co-factor model proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>). In that model, ATF3 represses promoters with the ATF&#x0002f;CRE sites by stabilizing the inhibitory co-factors at the promoters. When not bound to DNA, however, ATF3 could sequester the inhibitory co-factors away from the promoters, resulting in stimulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c21">21</xref>). Since ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is similar to ATF3&#x00394;Zip in that it does not bind to the ATF&#x0002f;CRE sites, our results of stimulation of transcription by ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 may be consistent with the model. It is thus possible that one function of co-inducing ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 is to modulate the transcriptional effects of the full-length ATF3 during stress. Co-induction of alternatively spliced mRNAs that encode proteins with opposite functions has been described previously. One example is the co-induction of &#x00394;FosB with full-length FosB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c36">36</xref>). &#x00394;FosB lacks the C-terminal region of FosB and inhibits the function of FosB and other Fos proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c36">36</xref>). The counteracting effect of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 on ATF3 brings up an important question. What is the physiological significance of ATF3 expression during stress response? Although the answer is not clear, one notion is that ATF3 contributes to the detrimental consequences of stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c15">15</xref>). This notion is mainly derived from the ectopic expression approach. Transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in selective tissues have been demonstrated to have malfunction in the target tissues. As an example, transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in the pancreas have a defect in endocrine function and develop symptoms characteristic of insulin-dependent diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c37">37</xref>). Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in the heart have conduction abnormality and contractile dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c38">38</xref>). Therefore, ATF3 appears to be a part of the cellular response that leads to detrimental outcomes. Due to the intrinsic limitations of the transgenic approach, experiments using different approaches are required to substantiate this notion. However, if the full-length ATF3 protein is indeed a detrimental component of stress response, then the co-induction of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 may be a part of the efforts to alleviate the detrimental consequence.</p><p>In this context, we note that ATF3 is also induced by signals that induce cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c14">14</xref>) and is expressed in certain cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c24">24</xref>). Recently, ATF3 was shown to partially transform chick embryo fibroblasts by promoting growth factor-independent proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c39">39</xref>). It is intriguing that ATF3 expression correlates with high potentials of metastasis in murine melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c23">23</xref>), and its down-regulation by anti-sense oligonucleotides effectively suppressed the growth of human colon cancer cells in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf350c40">40</xref>). In our study, very little or no expression of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 was observed in cancer cells that over-express the full-length ATF3. Therefore, the lack of a built-in mechanism to modulate the activities of the full-length ATF3 protein may be a part of the differences that distinguish cancer cells from cells eliciting stress response. However, at present, it is not known whether this discrepancy of expression of ATF3 and ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 has a functional role in cell proliferation.</p><p>In summary, our demonstration of a novel alternative spliced ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 provides a molecular basis for diverse functions of the immediate early response gene ATF3, and strengthens the pivotal role of alternative splicing during the stress response. Furthermore, this might provide a clue to investigating the molecular device for controlling the stress response and cell proliferation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf350f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of ATF3&#x00394;Zip2 mRNA in A23187-treated HUVECs.
