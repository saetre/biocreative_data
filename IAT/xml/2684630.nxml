We have shown that OGR1 functions as a tumor metastasis suppressor gene when it is over-expressed in human prostate cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. To examine the physiological functions of OGR1, we generated conditional OGR1 deficient mice by homologous recombination. OGR1 deficient mice were viable and upon gross-inspection appeared normal. Consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showing that OGR1 is involved in osteoclastogenesis, reduced osteoclasts were detected in OGR1 deficient mice. A pH-dependent osteoclasts survival effect was also observed. However, overall abnormality in the bones of these animals was not observed. In addition, melanoma cell tumorigenesis was significantly inhibited in OGR1 deficient mice. OGR1 deficient mice in the mixed background produced significantly less peritoneal macrophages when stimulated with thioglycolate. These macrophages also showed altered extracellular <bold><italic>signal</italic></bold>-regulated kinases (ERK) activation and nitric oxide (NO) production in response to lipopolysaccharide. OGR1-dependent pH responses assessed by cAMP production and cell survival in macrophages or brown fat cells were not observed, presumably due to the presence of other proton sensing receptors in these cells. Our results indicate that OGR1's role in osteoclastogenesis is not strong enough to affect overall bone development and its role in tumorigenesis warrants further investigation. The mice generated can be potentially used for several disease models, including cancers or osteoclast-related diseases.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>We have previously cloned OGR1 from an ovarian cancer cell line HEY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Xu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although TDAG8 expression resembles the dynamic regulation described for known modulators of GC-induced apoptosis during thymocyte development, it is dispensable for psychosine-induced formation of multinucleated cells.

Moreover, systemic acidosis has detrimental effects on the skeleton and local acidosis is associated with bone destruction in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.

The functional involvement of OGR1 has mainly been examined using either OGR1 antibody, or a nonspecific OGR1 antagonist Cu<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, or siRNAs against OGR1. Since all these reagents all potentially can have off-target effects, a more specific system is needed to assess the physiological roles of OGR1.</p><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow are capable of differentiating into monocytes, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and adipocytes, among other cell phenotypes. These cell types are important for many biological functions. Under normal physiological conditions, the differentiation processes are tightly controlled. Imbalanced differentiation and/or activation processes lead to pathological conditions and diseases.</p><p>Derived from blood monocytes, macrophages are relatively long lived phagocytotic cells of mammalian tissues. Macrophages are involved in a variety of processes including pathogen destruction, inflammation, tissue repairing and remodeling. They have a highly plastic phenotype and their functional polarization is determined by cytokines and factors found within local microenvironments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Nardin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the functions of macrophages is to provide a defense mechanism against tumor cells. However, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which represent the major inflammatory component of the stroma of many solid tumors, are associated with tumor progression and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Nardin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Brown and white adipose tissues (BAT and WAT) are key players in obesity and related with health problems, such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. BAT-dependent non-shivering thermogenesis significantly affects the body's energy balance. In addition to its energy storage function, the fat tissues also secrete a number of hormones and cytokines, and are involved in the control of body metabolism and energy balance at multiple sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Giordano1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Valverde1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. BAT is of particular importance in neonates, small mammals (such as mice) in cold environments, and animals that hibernate, because its major physiological function is to dissipate stored energy as heat. In human infants BAT comprises up to 5&#x00025; of total body weight, which then diminishes with age to virtually nonexistent levels by adulthood.</p><p>Throughout an animal's life, bone tissue is in a constant state of turnover as a result of the combination of sequential removal of bone tissue by osteoclasts and new bone deposition by osteoblasts. Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing multinuclear giant cells that are derived from hematopoietic mononuclear precursor cells under the control of both M-CSF and RANKL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Yang3">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. These cells aid in absorbing and removing excess bone tissues in the remodeling of growing bones, or damaged bone in the repair of fractures.</p><p>We have generated and characterized OGR1-deficient mice to address several critical issues: 1) the physiological functions of OGR1 in mice; 2) the role of OGR1 in osteoclastogenesis; 3) the OGR1-dependent pH responsiveness using OGR1-deficient cells; and 4) the functions of OGR1 in other bone biological processes when mice are challenged by exogenous stimuli, such as tumor cells. We have found that in consistence with published data, OGR1 is likely to be involved in osteoclastogenesis. In our hands, we observed reduced osteoclasts derived from bone marrow cells of OGR1 deficient mice. A weak pH-dependent osteoclasts survival effect was also observed. However, the overall bone structures of the mice were not affected and a significant pH-regulated and OGR1-dependent biological effect was not generally evidenced in OGR1-expressing cells &#x0005b;including macrophages and brown adipose derived cells (BADCs)&#x0005d;, suggesting a redundant effect of other OGR1 subfamily GPCRs <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, the effect and involvement of host cell OGR1 in tumorigenesis of melanoma cells is of great interest and warrants further investigation. Two additional abnormalities related to peritoneal macrophages and BAT were observed in a mouse background-dependent manner, suggesting involvement of modifying genes in different mouse backgrounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) were from Aventi Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) or Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada).

In brief, A 13.2 kb Bam HI genomic fragment containing OGR1 gene was subcloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone (a kind gift from Dr. Owen Witte's lab at UCLA) into a pBS (KS) II vector (plasmid #182). The 5&#x02032; homology region of the OGR1 locus was PCR-amplified using OGR1 primers #1 and #2 and plasmid #182 as a template. Primer #2 created a new Nco1 site at the beginning of OGR1 (changed the first codon from ATG to CTC). The PCR fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1.TOPO (Invitrogen) to give plasmid #183. Exon 1 of OGR1 was PCR-amplified using primers #7 and #8, while primer #7 introduced a Xba I site for further cloning steps. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1.TOPO to give plasmid #188. This complete OGR1 sequence was confirmed by sequencing analyses. A 6.2 kb genomic fragment of the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of the OGR1 locus was subcloned into plasmid #182 to give plasmid #189. A 1.4 kb floxed&#x02013;neo-cassette was then cloned into plasmid #189 linearized with Stu I to give plasmid #208. Stu I cuts at the 5&#x02032; end of the 3&#x02032; Hind III OGR1 region. The 3xFLAG region encoding three adjacent FLAG epitopes was PCR-amplified from plasmid p3xFLAG CMV-19 using primers #3 and #4 and the latter primer included an Xho I site for further cloning. The 353 bp PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1.TOPO (plasmid #185). A 400 bp Ken I and Xho I fragment from #185 was further subcloned in pBS(KS) II to get plasmid #196. A 2.6 kb Kpn-Nco I fragment (5&#x02032; homoloy region) from plasmid #183 was then subcloned into plasmid #196 in front of the 3&#x000d7; FLAG region (plasmid #199). The loxP site in the 5&#x02032; region of exon 1 was cloned using annealed primers #5 and #6 and ligated into plasmid #199 at the Xho I and Xba I sites. This gave rise to plasmid #204, which was sequenced to confirm the integrity of the 3xFLAG-LoxP-exon 1 junction. A 1.8 kb Xba I-Sac I fragment including OGR1 exon 1 and &#x02018;3&#x02032; untranslated region from plasmid #188 was subcloned into plasmid #203 to generate plasmid #209. A 7.7 kb Hind III fragment of plasmid #208 harboring the neo-cassette flanked by loxP sites and the 3&#x02032; OGR1 homology region was subcloned into plasmid #209 to give the OGR1 targeting vector #218.

Using gene knockout techniques, mice deficient in G2A, GPR4, and TDAG8 have been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Yang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Radu2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Le1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In certain, but not all, cellular and biological assays, pH-sensing activities have been detected in GPR4- and TDAG8-, but not in G2A-deficient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Radu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Yang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Mogi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. A common scenario that has been revealed from these studies is that the pH-dependent activities are highly cell type-, signaling pathway-, and biological activity-specific. We have tested the pH-induced effects in macrophages, osteoclasts, and BADCs, the three major cell types where some alterations have been observed in the OGR1 KO mice. However, these studies showed that there was only a very limited pH-induced cellular effect (osteoclast cell survival) was observed. While this manuscript was in preparation, Mogi <italic>et al</italic> have reported that TDAG8, but not OGR1 is involved in the pH induced inhibitory effect on TNF-&#x003b1; production in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Mogi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, which is consistent with our results. The most likely explanation of these results is that other OGR1 subfamily GPCRs are also expressed in these tested cells and they play certain redundant roles <italic>in vivo</italic>. These questions can only be further clarified when double, triple or even quadruple knockout mice are generated. This subfamily of GPCRs may also be regulated or modulated by a group of lysophospholipids (11, 25, 27, 36, 38). Similar to the pH effects, we did not observed altered lipid effects in WT verses KO cells, which can be interpreted as a redundant effect or lack of lipid effect through OGR1 in these cells.</p><p>Taken together, OGR1 subfamily receptors mediate the effects of and/or are regulated by extracellular pH changes and certain lysophospholipids. These effects are highly cell type-, G protein-, signaling pathway-specific. The systems used to detect these effects are also highly relevant. In particular, the conclusions derived on the functions/signaling pathways of this family of GPCRs from <italic>in vitro</italic> over-expression systems are not completely consistent with the results obtained from knockout mice as described above, emphasizing the importance to study the pathophysiological roles of these receptors <italic>in vivo</italic> and the potential redundant functions among OGR1 subfamily GPCRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>The potential involvement of OGR1 in BAT and macrophages were mouse genetic background-dependent</title><p>We have found that the cell types affected by OGR1 in the mixed or the C57/BL6 background are all potentially derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow, which are capable of differentiating into monocytes, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and adipocytes, among other cell phenotypes. We consistently found higher accumulations of BAT both in terms of dimension and weight in OGR1 KO mice in the mixed background. However, these differences disappeared when mice were in the C57/BL6 background, suggesting that a modifying gene(s) in different mouse background may play a role in regulating BAT. To our knowledge, OGR1 is the first gene showing an affect on the size of BAT in a mouse-background dependent manner. The mechanisms by which OGR1 regulates this phenotype and the identification of the modifying gene warrant further studies. The extent of brown fat abnormality observed in OGR1 KO mice did not clearly affected the mouse physiological function in these mice under normal living conditions. It might be interesting to test whether under different temperatures these mice behave differently from WT mice, since brown fat is mainly involved in thermogenesis.</p><p>The role of OGR1 in macrophages may be related to its function in tumorigenesis of melanoma cells, since reduced TAMs were observed in tumors from KO mice, which also correlated with reduced tumor sizes. However, similar to the BAT phenotype, altered peritoneal macrophages were not consistently observed in mice with a pure C57/BL6 background, suggesting that a modifying gene(s) is likely to be involved.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>OGR1 was likely to be involved in osteoclastogenesis and tumorigenesis</title><p>The phenotypes of OGR1 KO mice related to osteoclast and melanoma tumor formation were consistent in both mixed and C57/BL6 backgrounds. Our results suggested that although OGR1 may play a role in osteoclastogenesis, its effect on overall bone physiology was rather minimal. It is possible that under certain pathological conditions, the defect in osteoclast numbers and/or their response to pH changes will affect some biological functions. This is true when we test tumorigenesis when mice were challenged with melanoma cells in either the mixed and or the C57/BL6 background. The mechanisms by which host cells OGR1 acts to regulate tumorigenesis remains to be further investigated. Intriguingly, we have recently shown that OGR1 over-expression in tumor cells displays a tumor metastasis suppressing role for prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005705-Singh1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. It is highly interesting to further study the apparent opposing roles of OGR1 in tumor <italic>vs.</italic> host cells.</p><p>In summary, similar to other members of this family, OGR1 deficiency did not significantly affect overall mouse physiology. While OGR1 deficiency did not result in a strong phenotype by itself, it may generate interesting and strong phenotypes when mice are challenged, as we report here for melanoma cells. In addition, OGR1 and its subfamily GPCRs may have redundant roles <italic>in vivo</italic>, which can be further revealed when more than one of these genes is depleted. With this report, the initial phenotypic analyses of the four members of OGR1-subfamily GPCRs has now been completed and more interesting results are expected to be generated from double to quadruple deficient mice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Fengchun Yang for her kind advice on osteoclasts analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
