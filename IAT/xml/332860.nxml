The seven novel genes, G12 to G18, are localised in a 160 kb segment of DNA extending from the complement gene cluster towards HLA-DR. The genes were identified by isolation of cDNA clones using cosmid genomic inserts as hybridisation probes, and by the detection of the corresponding transcripts in Northern blot analysis. Characterisation of the cosmid genomic DNA inserts, in conjunction with pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis of uncloned DNA, for the presence of clustered sites for infrequently cutting restriction endonucleases has revealed that at least 5 of the 7 genes are associated with HTF-islands. These unmethylated CpG-rich sequences are frequently found at the 5' ends of ubiquitously expressed genes. Together with previously published data 36 genes have now been defined in a 680kb stretch of DNA within the MHC. With one gene approximately every 20kb of DNA this represents the most densely packed region of the human genome so far characterised, and is of major significance in relation to the mapping and sequence analysis of the rest of the genome.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0050-a" xlink:role="7253"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0051-a" xlink:role="7254"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0052-a" xlink:role="7255"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0052-b" xlink:role="7255"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7251"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7252"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7253"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0051.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7254"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0052.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7255"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7256"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7257"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
