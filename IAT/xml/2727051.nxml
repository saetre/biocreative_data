Although the initiating events leading to SLE pathology are not understood, there is a growing realization that dysregulated cytokine action on immune cells plays an important role in promoting the inflammatory autoimmune state. We applied phospho-specific flow cytometry to characterize the extent to which regulation of cytokine signal transduction through the STAT family of transcription factors is disturbed during the progression of SLE. Using a panel of 10 cytokines thought to have causal roles in the disease, we measured signaling responses at the single-cell level in five immune cell types from the MRL<italic>lpr</italic> murine model. This generated a highly multiplexed view of how cytokine stimuli are processed by intracellular signaling networks in adaptive and innate immune cells during different stages of SLE pathogenesis. We report that robust changes in cytokine signal transduction occur during the progression of SLE in multiple immune cell subtypes including increased T cell responsiveness to IL-10 and ablation of Stat1 responses to IFN&#x003b1;, IFN&#x003b3;, IL-6, and IL-21, Stat3 responses to IL-6, Stat5 responses to IL-15, and Stat6 responses to IL-4. We found increased intracellular expression of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 protein correlated with negative regulation of Stat1 responses to inflammatory cytokines. The results provide evidence of negative feedback regulation opposing inflammatory cytokines that have self-sustaining activities and suggest a cytokine-driven oscillator circuit may drive the periodic disease activity observed in many SLE patients.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a debilitating autoimmune disease that can damage multiple organs, induce chronic renal failure, and lead to severe morbidity and mortality. Current treatment regimens are limited to non-specific immune suppression and management of inflammatory symptoms. A characteristic feature of SLE is the presence of anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA) that form immune complexes with cellular debris and cause end-organ damage. Although the initiating events leading to SLE pathology are not understood, it is accepted that cytokine release from dysregulated immune cells plays a central role in promoting the autoimmune inflammatory state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Ishida1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Liu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One of the key unanswered questions is how cytokines modulate the immune system and subvert its ability to control the autoimmune state &#x02014; in particular, how intracellular signaling networks are &#x0201c;re-wired&#x0201d; by tonic stimulation with extracellular ligands. We hypothesized that abnormal regulation of cytokine signal transduction in immune cells is an integral feature of SLE and that changes in cytokine signaling would parallel disease progression and severity. Most cytokines, including those associated with SLE, signal through the Signal Transduction and Activators of Transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. STAT proteins, upon being phosphorylated at activating residues, translocate from the plasma membrane to the nucleus where they drive numerous gene programs critical to immune function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Leonard1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Murine strains predisposed to developing lupus that are subsequently rendered homozygous for disruption of the IFN&#x003b3; gene or treated with agents that deplete IFN&#x003b3; have a longer life-span, a milder disease course, and far less renal damage than parental strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Balomenos1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Lawson1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> whereas infusions of exogenous IFN&#x003b3; accelerated disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Engleman1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, knocking out the receptor for Type I interferons resulted in later disease onset, milder symptoms, and slower disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Braun1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-SantiagoRaber1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. A central role for cytokines in regulating SLE development is consistent with work in other systems showing that cytokines orchestrate the initiation, execution, perpetuation, and resolution of productive immune responses and play critical roles in coordinating interactions among numerous specialized cell types.</p><p>The most direct evidence that interferons have a causal role in human SLE comes from the high prevalence of SLE-associated symptoms among patients treated with type I interferons for conditions like hepatitis and cancer. In one study, 22&#x00025; of patients treated with IFN&#x003b1; developed a positive blood test for ANA and 19&#x00025; developed frank autoimmunity with one patient meeting the criteria for SLE diagnosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Ronnblom1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, most patients' autoimmune symptoms were reversed when IFN&#x003b1; therapy was withdrawn. These findings show that high levels of IFN&#x003b1; can induce a form of autoimmunity, that this IFN&#x003b1; autoimmunity can be induced in a surprisingly large fraction of humans, and that maintenance of this autoimmunity requires consistently high levels of IFN&#x003b1;.</p><p>This and other research in mice and humans has led to a reevaluation of models in which autoimmunity is portrayed as rare and irreversible, held at bay by flawless tolerance. Central tolerance was shown to be less than perfect by the discovery that autoreactive T and B cells are a part of the peripheral repertoire of healthy individuals and that these cells can be activated when peripheral tolerance is overcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Kotzin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The frequency with which IFN&#x003b1; therapy induces autoimmunity is part of a body of evidence that tolerance can be overcome in a clinical context and raises the possibility that transient, interferon-induced autoimmunity might occur more often than previously thought. For example, IFN&#x003b1; levels can be very high during viral infections, notably higher than in many SLE patients. Thus, it might be that cytokine-driven activation of autoreactive lymphocytes is not unique to SLE patients; however, most individuals do not develop persistent autoimmunity due to intrinsic processes that inhibit the cytokine-driven feed-forward loops that maintain the immune state, thereby allowing the immune system to &#x0201c;stand down&#x0201d; once the pathogen is cleared.</p><p>Although the mechanisms involved in the initiation and early progression of SLE are thought to be key to understanding the disease, these processes occur prior to symptomatic manifestations that drive patients to seek medical assistance. A distinct advantage of murine models of SLE is that animals can be evaluated prior to disease onset and the animals also have relatively consistent disease progression. To test the hypothesis that cytokine signal transduction is modulated in both pathway- and cell-specific manners that correlate with SLE disease status, we analyzed samples collected before disease onset through initiation to the terminally severe phase using the MRL/<italic>lpr</italic> murine model of SLE. MRL mice spontaneously develop autoimmunity with many of the features of human SLE, including a similar autoantibody profile, autoimmune skin and liver disease, and immune-complex glomerulonephritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Liu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Andrews1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Ohteki1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. A spontaneous mutation, <italic>lpr</italic>, arose on the MRL background that greatly accelerated the autoimmune predisposition of MRL mice. In this report, MRL mice homozygous for the <italic>lpr</italic> mutation will be referred to as &#x0201c;<italic>lpr</italic>&#x0201d; and MRL mice homozygous wild type at this locus will be referred to simply as &#x0201c;MRL&#x0201d;. The onset and progression of SLE in female <italic>lpr</italic> mice is extremely consistent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Reilly1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Autoantibody levels are detectable as early as 6 weeks and a pronounced lymphoadenopathy is observed at 12 weeks that is largely due to the proliferation of a population of B220&#x0002b;, TCR&#x003b2;&#x0002b;, CD3&#x0002b; cells that are mostly CD4&#x02212; and CD8&#x02212;. Multiple organs are affected and a steady deterioration of renal function manifests as heavy proteinuria beginning around 16 weeks of age. Very few <italic>lpr</italic> mice live past 28 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Reilly1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, this murine model is well suited for evaluation of processes that underlie each stage of SLE and provides a solid foundation for comparisons with other murine models of this disease as well as progression of the human disease.</p><p>Of the many signaling systems that are likely important to immune function, we chose to focus on cytokine stimuli and signaling pathways thought to have causal or secondary relationships to SLE and that are proximal to initiating events during immune activation. Inasmuch as others have used the production of cytokines as a baseline for how autoimmune processes guide immune cell output, we surmised that phosphorylation of STAT members in response to a panel of cytokines would provide an even more vital understanding of how immune cells change how they process immunomodulatory cues during SLE progression. We observed a strong correlation between SLE disease status and the ability of different subsets of primary immune cells to activate specific STAT signaling pathways in response to a broad range of cytokine stimuli. Notably, there was potent attenuation of IFN&#x003b1;, IFN&#x003b3;, and IL-6 signaling across multiple immune cell subsets that was correlated to periods of increased SLE disease activity, suggesting that previously unrecognized, negative feedback loops oppose critical cytokine activities. As existing models of biological oscillators depend on the presence of negative feedback loops, often coupled with positive feedback loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Tsai1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, our identification of negative feedback regulation of IFN&#x003b1; signal transduction may provide a mechanistic explanation of why many SLE patients oscillate between flare and remission. Our identification of pathway specific and cell specific dysregulation may have significant implications for disease monitoring and treatment of SLE in human patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Phospho-profiling of cells from MRL/lpr mice</title><p>In preparation for subsequent phospho-profiling experiments, we stained splenocytes from MRL and <italic>lpr</italic> mice at varying stages of disease (5&#x02013;20 weeks) with antibodies specific to surface markers considered relevant to disease progression: B220, CD11b, Ly6C, Ly6G, Gr-1, CD19, IgM, CD21, CD3, TCR&#x003b2;, TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;, CD4, and CD8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-MorseHC1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-MandikNayak1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Spleens were harvested from three mice per genotype at 5, 10, 15, and 20 weeks of age to examine four stages of SLE progression.

At each age, the phosphorylation of four Stat proteins (Stat1, Stat3, Stat5, and Stat6) in response to 11 different stimuli (basal, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-21, IFN&#x003b1;, and IFN&#x003b3;) was analyzed in five cell types (B cells, CD11b-hi cells, CD4&#x0002b; T cells, CD8&#x0002b; T cells, and B220&#x0002b;TCR&#x003b2;&#x0002b; cells).

At 20 weeks, however, the Stat3 response to IL-10 in B220- T cells from <italic>lpr</italic> mice roughly doubled compared to the response at 5 weeks and was far greater than that observed in T cells from MRL or BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> and data not shown). At every age, the B220&#x0002b;TCR&#x003b2;&#x0002b; T cells of both genotypes showed a much larger Stat3 response to IL-10 than single positive T cells. Elevated responses to IL-10 are of interest because this cytokine has been implicated in murine and human SLE in a number of studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Ishida1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Llorente1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanistic changes in signaling derived from this dataset are organized by receptor in the diagram shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>.

The most immediate downstream implications of impaired activation of Stat1, a transcriptional regulator, should be reduced induction of target gene transcription by agents that signal through Stat1. Splenic suspensions from 5 and 20 week old BALB/c, MRL, and <italic>lpr</italic> mice were stimulated with IFN&#x003b3;.

Consistent with the Stat1 signaling results, IFN&#x003b3; stimulation strongly induced expression of both target transcripts in 5-week, but not 20-week, <italic>lpr</italic> splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Age did not impair induction of GBP-1 in MRL splenocytes or induction of either transcript in BALB/c splenocytes. Interestingly, significantly less IRF-1 was induced in MRL splenocytes at 20 weeks than at 5 weeks, though induction was stronger at both time points than in <italic>lpr</italic> mice. Although 20 week MRL mice had, as expected, greater Stat1 signaling and target gene induction than age-matched <italic>lpr</italic> mice, the Stat1 response to IFN&#x003b3; was weaker in MRL splenocytes at 20 weeks than at 5 weeks and this reduction in signaling was enough to partially impair induction of IRF-1 expression. Thus, changes in signaling detected by phospho-specific flow cytometry correlated with relevant downstream transcription events in primary immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Elevated SOCS1 protein levels correlate with differential inhibition of STAT activation during SLE progression</title><p>At the single-cell level, the Stat1 and Stat3 pathways were differentially regulated as SLE progressed. This was readily apparent for IL-6, a cytokine whose receptor is responsible for activating both Stat1 and Stat3 pathways in T cells. Basal activation of Stat1 and Stat3 in B220-CD4&#x0002b; and B220-CD8&#x0002b; T cells from <italic>lpr</italic> mice showed little detectable change throughout the course of the disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and no change was see in T cells from age-matched MRL mice.

Cell subset specific analysis shows that Stat3 is strongly phosphorylated after IL-6 stimulation even in B220-CD8&#x0002b; T cells that have an undetectable pStat1 response. A similar effect was observed with B220-CD4&#x0002b; T cells from 10 week old <italic>lpr</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>); however, a large proportion of B220-CD4&#x0002b; T cells from older <italic>lpr</italic> mice had poor pStat1 and pStat3 responses to IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g004">Fig. 4B</xref> column 2, compare row 1 to rows 3 and 4). This inhibition of both pathways in B220-CD4&#x0002b; T cells may be partly explained by reduced expression of the IL-6 receptor on the surface of CD4&#x0002b; T cells from 20 week old <italic>lpr</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Differential regulation of two pathways activated by the same receptor suggested the involvement of inhibitory cytoplasmic factors. This was further supported by the finding of the SLE-associated blockade of Stat1 phosphorylation downstream of other receptors (IL-21, IFN&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3;) making it plausible that Stat1 activation through multiple receptors was being inhibited by a common cytoplasmic factor. Since IL6 receptor levels were maintained on B220-CD8&#x0002b; cells and IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 showed no detectable change in expression on any of the cell types that showed reduced Stat1 responses to IFN&#x003b3; (data not shown), the observed inhibition of Stat1 signaling must involve mechanisms other than receptor downregulation.</p><fig id="pone-0006756-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006756.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Differential inhibition of pStat1 and pStat3 signaling responses to IL-6 correlates with increased expression of SOCS1 protein.</title><p>(A) Basal phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 in B220-, CD4 and CD8 single positive T cells from <italic>lpr</italic> mice at 5, 10, 15, and 20 weeks of age.

SOCS1 levels were low and nearly identical across the three genotypes at 5 weeks of age, but at 20 weeks there were significant differences between the genotypes and, as expected, SOCS1 protein expression inversely correlated with the ability of IFN&#x003b3; to phosphorylate Stat1 and induce target gene transcription. The highest levels of SOCS1 were seen in 20 week <italic>lpr</italic> splenocytes; upon IFN&#x003b3; stimulation these cells showed barely detectable increases in target gene expression. The elevated levels of SOCS1 protein were not simply due to increases in the B220&#x0002b;TCR&#x003b2;&#x0002b; compartment, as purified B220-TCR&#x003b2;&#x0002b;CD4&#x0002b; splenocytes from 20-week <italic>lpr</italic> mice showed high levels of SOCS1.

Thus, the mere presence of an inflammatory state is not sufficient to drive autoimmunity, but aberrant control of immune cell responses to inflammatory cytokines may disrupt the delicate balance between immunity and self-reactivity. In this study, we observed dysregulation of cytokine signal transduction that correlated with disease activity in a mouse model of SLE. In healthy individuals, negative feedback regulation may be required to oppose the inflammatory state and restore homeostasis, but in SLE, regulation may be deficient and a chronic state of aberrant immune activation may result.</p><p>A significant finding of this study was several instances of pathways activated by the same receptor that were differentially regulated at the single-cell level. After the onset of SLE, the Stat1 response to IL-6 and IL-21 was poor in the same T cells that exhibited strong activation of Stat3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This suggests that the observed differential regulation occurs in the cytoplasm, since reduced receptor expression would be expected to inhibit both pathways. We observed an increase in SOCS1 protein levels during SLE progression, suggesting that SOCS1 is a cytoplasmic mediator that plays a role in this pathway-specific regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g004">Fig. 4C&#x02013;E</xref>). Although over-expression studies have shown that SOCS family members are highly promiscuous in their inhibitory activities against JAK proteins, there is growing evidence that at physiological levels SOCS are more specific to particular STAT protein isoforms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Croker1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. SOCS1 was first identified for its potent ability to inhibit JAK2 activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Endo1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and the mechanism for its JAK2 preference over JAK1 was later defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Yasukawa1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

The selective inhibition of the Stat1 response to IL-6 we observed in early SLE could be due in part to moderate levels of SOCS1 that specifically target JAK2 activity while having relatively little influence on JAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). This suggests a model in which SOCS1 levels rise during SLE and inhibit the Stat1 responses to IL-6, IL-21, and interferons with comparatively little influence on Stat3 signaling including the Stat3 responses to IL-6 and IL-10. Consequently, one would expect that genes whose promoters are driven by Stat1 homodimers (or Stat1-Stat3 heterodimers) would be inhibited in their normal regulatory patterns starting from early SLE onset. This provides direct mechanistic consequences for immune activities driven by these transcription factors.</p><p>The MRL/<italic>lpr</italic> model is only one of several models of SLE, all of which are understood to be imperfect representations of human disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Mestas1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. However, <italic>lpr</italic> mice do exhibit many of the features of human SLE, including a similar autoantibody profile, autoimmune skin and liver disease, and immune-complex glomerulonephritis. As with other murine models of SLE, interventions that oppose interferon action reduce the severity of the disease in these mice. In this study, we observed strong negative regulation of signaling responses to cytokines thought to have causal roles in murine and human SLE. Importantly, we found that many of the signaling responses that were ablated during the progression of SLE in the <italic>lpr</italic> mice were also reduced in cells from SLE patients with non-zero SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores (in preparation).</p><p>Given the presumed role of interferon in SLE, it was surprising that the phosphorylation of Stat1 and the transcriptional response to interferons was greatly reduced as SLE progressed in <italic>lpr</italic> mice. Although this seems counterintuitive, both Type I and Type II interferons have been shown to potently induce negative feedback regulation of Stat1, in part by inducing SOCS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Ilangumaran1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Narazaki1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Lehmann1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Fischer1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. SOCS1 levels were elevated in the <italic>lpr</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) and in SLE patients (in preparation). Indeed, a blockade of Stat1 signaling may be the inevitable result of interferon activity and this blockade has been shown to be induced during protective Th1 responses, potentially allowing lymphocytes to survive the deleterious effects of prolonged interferon exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Haring1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Since infection is a leading cause of death for SLE patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Petri1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that a prolonged state of reduced responsiveness to IFN&#x003b1; may further compromise a patient's ability to fight infection. The blockade of Stat1 signal transduction and elevated SOCS1 protein levels we observed in the progression of murine SLE suggest that between 5 and 10 weeks-of-age, strong interferon signaling induces negative feedback regulation of Stat1. Consistent with this, Stat1 basal activation was detectably elevated at 10 weeks-of-age even though exogenous interferon stimulation was not able to induce the high level of Stat1 activation observed in age-matched MRL mice. From 10 weeks onward in <italic>lpr</italic> mice, Stat1 activation in response to exogenous stimulation was greatly reduced compared to MRL mice, but IFN&#x003b3; was still able to induce some expression of target genes GBP-1 and IRF-1, though induction was markedly weaker than when Stat1 signal transduction was strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006756-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p>In the context of SLE, this negative feedback regulation of cytokine signal transduction fails to permanently silence autoimmunity and instead may play a role in destabilizing the immune system. Biological oscillators have been found to require negative feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Tsai1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Different relative contributions of negative and positive feedback result in a bi-stable system, a system that is essentially &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; but has no stable intermediate state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Ingolia1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. An effective immune system is designed to be bi-stable: fully activated in response to pathogen challenge and quickly turning completely off when the pathogen is cleared. It is possible that disturbances in the coupling of negative and positive feedback elements, such as interferon signaling, may destabilize and shift the immune system from a bi-stable system to one that oscillates between flare and remission as observed in many SLE patients. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found negative regulation of the same cytokine signaling pathways reported here is present in a large fraction of SLE patients, and robust changes in cytokine signaling were found to precede flare (manuscript in preparation). Oscillations between flare and remission are not observed in all human patients, or in murine models, therefore a longitudinal study of patients transiting between flare and remission will be required to better understand the role of feedback regulation. Our identification of negative feedback regulation of interferon signaling in this study provides evidence that an interferon-driven oscillator could play a role in cycling between flare and remission.</p><p>In summary, we find that changes in STAT signaling parallel SLE progression in a murine model of SLE. Critically, basal phosphorylation alone did not robustly discriminate disease states from each other or from non-diseased individuals, but interrogation of cells with environmental cues (cytokines) revealed altered signaling nodes that did correlate with disease progression. This is consistent with our observations of human leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006756-Irish1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> where basal signaling was of limited value in predicting clinical outcome, but signaling <italic><underline>responses</underline></italic> were indicative of cell character and were of significant prognostic value. Thus, in conjunction with conventional indicators, quantifying the disturbed nature of cytokine action in SLE could lead to approaches that objectively characterize disease status at the level of single-cell signaling states and may point to therapies that safely modulate the disease by modifying cell and cytokine responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Antibodies against murine CD3 (clone 145-2C11), TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4; (GL-3), TCR&#x003b2; (H57-597), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8 (53&#x02013;6.7), B220 (RA3-6B2), CD19 (ID3), CD21 (7G6), IgM (11/41), Ly6C (AL-21), Ly6G (1A8), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), and CD11b (M1/70) were kindly provided by BD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA).

The remaining cells were cultured as a single cell suspension at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 hours in RPMI-10. The suspensions were then cultured for an additional 2.5 hours in the presence or absence of IFN&#x003b3;. The cells were pelleted and then lysed in Trizol for 15 minutes at room temperature. Samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in Trizol prior to RNA isolation. After extraction from Trizol and isopropanol precipitation, the RNA was further purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was resuspended in water. Transcript quantitation was normalized to &#x003b2;-actin internal controls. Fold induction was calculated as the ratio of transcript abundance after culture in the presence of IFN&#x003b3; to abundance after culture in the absence of IFN&#x003b3;. All western blots were performed with whole cell lysates, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA), and blotted for SOCS-1. Blots were quantified using ImageJ software and were analyzed in parallel using LumiAnalyst3.0 software. As a positive control, 293T cells were transfected with a SOCS1 expression construct in a pcDNA3.1 backbone and lysates were prepared after 24 or 36 hours.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006756.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Changes in splenic immune compartments during SLE.

(A) The human fibroblast line 293T was mock transfected or transfected with a SOCS1 expression construct employing the pcDNA3.1 backbone. Lysates were prepared 24 and 40 hours after transfection, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with different anti-SOCS1 primary antibodies and then with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The membrane shown here was blotted with Zymed 38&#x02013;5200 as the primary. This antibody was used for all SOCS1 expression analysis of SLE material; it correctly recognized a 30 kDa band that was much more intense (&#x0003e;10 fold) in lanes containing lysates from cells transfected with the SOCS1 expression construct than those from control 293T lysates. In contrast, blots using Santa Cruz SC-7001 as primary did not show differential staining in the absence and presence of the SOCS1 expression construct so this antibody was not used in our analysis of SLE material. (B) Comparison of 20 week old BALB/c, MRL, and <italic>lpr</italic> splenic lysates showed differential staining with Zymed 38&#x02013;5200 primary.
