In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the Bruchpilot (BRP) protein is associated with T-shaped ribbons (&#x0201c;T-bars&#x0201d;) at presynaptic active zones (AZs). BRP is required for intact AZ structure and normal evoked neurotransmitter release. By screening for mutations that affect the tissue distribution of Bruchpilot, we have identified a P-transposon insertion in gene <italic>CG11489</italic> (location 79D) which shows high homology to mammalian genes for SR protein kinases (SRPKs). SRPKs phosphorylate serine-arginine rich splicing factors (SR proteins). Since proteins expressed from <italic>CG11489</italic> cDNAs phosphorylate a peptide from a human SR protein <italic>in vitro</italic>, we name <italic>CG11489</italic> the <italic>Drosophila Srpk79D</italic> gene. We have characterized <italic>Srpk79D</italic> transcripts and generated a null mutant. Mutation of the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> gene causes conspicuous accumulations of BRP in larval and adult nerves. At the ultrastructural level, these correspond to extensive axonal agglomerates of electron-dense ribbons surrounded by clear vesicles. Basic synaptic structure and function at larval neuromuscular junctions appears normal, whereas life expectancy and locomotor behavior of adult mutants are significantly impaired. All phenotypes of the mutant can be largely or completely rescued by panneural expression of SRPK79D isoforms. Isoform-specific antibodies recognize panneurally overexpressed GFP-tagged SRPK79D-PC isoform co-localized with BRP at presynaptic active zones while the tagged -PB isoform is found in spots within neuronal perikarya. SRPK79D concentrations in wild type apparently are too low to be revealed by these antisera. We propose that the <italic>Drosophila Srpk79D</italic> gene characterized here may be expressed at low levels throughout the nervous system to prevent the assembly of BRP containing agglomerates in axons and maintain intact brain function. The discovery of an SR protein kinase required for normal BRP distribution calls for the identification of its substrate and the detailed analysis of SRPK function for the maintenance of nervous system integrity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Neurons communicate through release of neurotransmitters at specialized contacts called synapses. Modulation of synaptic transmission likely underlies all higher brain function including feature abstraction, learning and memory, and cognition. The complex molecular machinery that regulates neurotransmitter release has been conserved in evolution but is still incompletely understood. Using the genetic model organism <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we recently discovered a protein of the presynaptic ribbon (T-bar) that was called Bruchpilot (German for crash pilot) because flies with reduced amounts of this protein cannot fly. We now screened various <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants for changes in tissue localization of Bruchpilot and discovered a gene that codes for an enzyme which is similar to mammalian kinases that phosphorylate splicing factors and may co-localize with Bruchpilot at the synapse. Larval nerves of mutants for this gene contain conspicuous accumulations of Bruchpilot that correspond to extensive electron-dense ribbon-like agglomerates surrounded by vesicles. While general axonal transport and basic synaptic transmission at larval nerve-muscle synapses are not affected, adult mutants show reduced life span and impaired flight and walking. The substrate for this kinase and its role in maintaining brain function must now be identified. Its discovery raises important questions about the function of homologous proteins in mammals including humans.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecular characterization of synaptic transmission has become a central theme of neuroscience research. A major contribution to the regulation of neurotransmitter release results from properties and interactions of proteins at the presynaptic active zone (AZ). In recent years several AZ components have been identified for vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Zhai1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Rizo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The large AZ specific proteins Piccolo and Bassoon together with RIM form a scaffold at the presynaptic AZ interacting with CAST/ERC, Munc13 and Liprin-&#x003b1;. Together these proteins form the cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) and are involved in regulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle and plasticity of synaptic transmission. Most presynaptic proteins have been conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Ataman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, with the notable exception of Piccolo and Bassoon. Sequence similarity between CAST/ERC and its insect homologue Bruchpilot (BRP) is largely confined to two N-terminal domains which in BRP are followed by extensive coiled-coil structures of about 1000 amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Wagh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. A present hypothesis proposes that these regions might convey cytoskeletal interactions that in vertebrates could be mediated by Piccolo and/or Bassoon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Wagh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Knock-down by RNAi or deletion of the <italic>brp</italic> gene leads to loss of the presynaptic dense projections (T-bars, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Zhai1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>), reduction of calcium channel density, severe defects in synaptic transmission, and altered short-term plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Wagh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Kittel2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

No information is as yet available on the molecular mechanisms of AZ assembly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> while in vertebrates several active zone proteins are transported to the presynaptic terminal in the form of active zone precursor vesicles termed Piccolo transport vesicles (PTVs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Shapira1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, mammalian serine/threonine kinase SAD-B is associated with synaptic vesicles and with CAZ, it phosphorylates RIM but not Munc13, and interference with SAD-B targeting inhibits synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Inoue1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> SAD homologue (encoded by <italic>CG6114</italic>) apparently has not yet been characterized. By screening for mutants with altered tissue distribution of BRP we now have identified a kinase presumably associated specifically with presynaptic active zones of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

It thus seems possible that the axonal transport of either a special class of vesicles, or of the Bruchpilot protein itself is affected by the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> mutations. We therefore investigated whether the BRP accumulations in the nerve influence synaptic structure or the distribution of Bruchpilot at the active zones of <italic>Srpk79D</italic> mutant larvae.

However, a direct interaction of the two proteins is likely only if they can be shown to co-localize in the same cellular compartment. To investigate this, we generated affinity-purified antisera against the non-overlapping N-terminal parts of the SRPK79D-PB/PE (anti-PB) and &#x02013;PC/PF (anti-PC) isoforms. The specificity of the antisera was tested by Western blots of adult heads of wild type, null mutant, and SRPK79D-PB-eGFP or &#x02013;PC-eGFP overexpressing lines. In the overexpressing lines clear specific Western blot signals were obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000700.s001">Figure S1</xref>). From wild-type heads detectable amounts of the PC isoform could only be obtained after enrichment by immuno-precipitation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000700.s002">Figure S2</xref>). To characterize targeting of the kinase isoforms we panneurally overexpressed GFP-tagged SRPK79D-PB and -PC isoforms and performed double immuno-stainings on larval preparations with anti-BRP (nc82) and the anti-PB or anti-PC antisera or antibodies against GFP (anti-GFP). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref> demonstrates that panneurally overexpressed SRPK79D-PC-eGFP and Bruchpilot co-localize at the presynaptic active zone.

Therefore a direct interaction of the PC isoform and BRP at the presynaptic active zone seems possible.

However, little is known about their assembly into the characteristic active zone structure. The identification of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> active zone protein Bruchpilot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Wagh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, a large protein with significant homology to the vertebrate active zone protein CAST/ERC, has spawned interest in the study of active zone development, structure and function by using the highly accessible larval neuromuscular synapse of the genetic model organism <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Bruchpilot contains large coiled-coil regions similar to vertebrate proteins Piccolo and Bassoon that are lacking in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and thus may combine functions of several vertebrate active zone proteins. Here we have described the identification and characterization of a kinase with high homology to vertebrate SR protein kinases (SRPKs) that is targeted to active zones and is required to prevent the accumulation of Bruchpilot in discrete spots within larval and adult nerves and the formation of large Bruchpilot containing electron-dense agglomerates in neuronal axons. Since the transcripts of the gene located in chromosomal subdivision 79D (and therefore termed <italic>Srpk79D</italic>) have been controversial in successive flybase releases we first analyzed cDNAs by RT&#x02013;PCR.</p><sec id="s3a"><title><italic>Srpk79D</italic> Transcripts</title><p>Using the information provided by the Berkeley <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genome Project (BDGP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Adams1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and flybase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/">http://flybase.org/</ext-link>, release January 2009) we confirmed by RT&#x02013;PCR and sequencing the structure of the RB transcript and of the transcript RC that had been annotated in an earlier release. We extended this information by the detection of an alternatively spliced exon of 159 bp (exon 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This newly identified exon is differentially included in both RB and RC transcripts generating the transcripts RE and RF, respectively. The 53 amino acids encoded by exon 7 are located in the non-conserved spacer region between the two highly conserved kinase sub-domains of the SRPK79D-PE and -PF isoforms. This spacer region was shown to play a role in the subcellular localization of yeast and human SRPKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Tang2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. We find that the overexpressed SRPK79D-PC and -PF (data not shown) but not the -PB isoform are targeted to synaptic active zones while the overexpressed -PB isoform accumulates in clearly defined perikaryal sub-regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This demonstrates that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the non-conserved N-terminal domain of SRPK79D isoforms that is generated by the use of alternative promotors contains important protein targeting information while the additional amino acids encoded by exon 7 for the spacer region do not alter the targeting observed here. Recently, an additional transcript (RD) has been annotated in flybase. This transcript shares the 5&#x02032; region with the RC and RF transcripts, however the entire genomic sequence between exons 6 and 9 is retained as a large exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Translation of this transcript would terminate in intron 6 and lead to a truncated protein of 695 amino acids which contains only the N-terminal half of the kinase domain and thus most likely would be non-functional. Our RT&#x02013;PCR experiments did not detect the RD transcript in adult flies. The RD transcript is based on the existence of a cDNA clone (GH08190), which was generated in a high-throughput approach to produce cDNA clones for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Rubin1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. We propose that this cloned cDNA was reverse-transcribed from an incompletely spliced RNA. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the amino acids of the hypothetical PD isoform encoded by intron 6 show no homology to any known proteins and are not conserved among diptera.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>SR protein kinases</title><p>BLAST searches revealed that the kinase domain common to all four <italic>Dm</italic> SRPK79D isoforms shows high homology to the conserved family of SR protein kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Wan1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Tang2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

The kinase domain of all SR protein kinases consists of two highly conserved sub-domains, divided by a non-conserved spacer. Since homologies to all other kinases are considerably lower and a typical SR protein is readily phosphorylated by both <italic>Dm</italic> SRPK79D-PB and -PC isoforms we conclude that SRPK79D isoforms are members of the family of SR protein kinases. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> there are three genes (<italic>Srpk79D</italic> (<italic>CG11489</italic>); <italic>CG8174</italic>; <italic>CG8565</italic>) with very high homology to the three human SR protein kinase coding genes (<italic>hs Srpk1-3</italic>) but little is known about the role of these genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> so far. Recently the LAMMER kinase DOA (gene <italic>CG33553</italic>) which shows intermediate level of homology to SRPKs has been shown to phosphorylate the SR protein DX16 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Mount1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, increasing the number of putative <italic>Srpk</italic> genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to four.

However, the differences in homology to mammalian SRPKs are small and may not be significant. The various phenotypes of the <italic>Drosophila Srpk79D</italic> mutants and their rescue by panneural RC/RF-cDNA expression demonstrate that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> SRPK79D-PC/PF function is relevant in the nervous system. Antisera raised against the different N-terminal domains of PB/PE and PC/PF isoforms expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> recognize the respective overexpressed proteins both in larvae and adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g006">Figure 6</xref> and data not shown) but fail to detect the endogenous proteins, indicating that the expression level of the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> gene is very low. It is unlikely that posttranslational processing eliminates recognition of the endogenous kinase (PC/PF-isoform) by the anti-PC antiserum since a signal at the expected size can be detected after enrichment of the kinase by immunoprecipitation using the PC antiserum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000700.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>SRPK79D function</title><p>In this report we show that mutation of the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> gene leads to accumulations of the active zone protein Bruchpilot in discrete spots in larval and adult nerves and demonstrate that these accumulations correspond in neuronal axons of larvae to large electron-dense structures surrounded by clear vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The speculation that these electron-dense structures are molecularly related to T-bars is supported by their ribbon-like appearance, by the observation that the anti-BRP antibody nc82 binds to the periphery of the ribbons similar to what has been shown by STED microscopy for synaptic T-bars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Kittel2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and by the fact that they apparently are able to bind clear vesicles. Photoreceptor terminals of Bassoon knock-out mice contain synaptic ribbons detached from active zones. These &#x0201c;floating&#x0201d; ribbons are associated with vesicles, presumably synaptic vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Dick1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, in axons of young rat hippocampal cultures aggregates of dense-core and clear vesicles are observed which label positively for synaptic vesicle markers like synaptobrevin, SV2, synaptotagmin and synapsin-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-TaoCheng1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. We excluded that the clear vesicles associated with the axonal agglomerates described here are mature synaptic vesicles because they are not labelled by various antibodies against synaptic vesicle proteins, like cysteine string protein (CSP), synapsin, synaptobrevin, and synaptotagmin. No difference in the staining of larval nerves between wild type and <italic>Srpk79D</italic> mutants is observed with these antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g003">Figure 3Q and 3R</xref>, and data not shown). These experiments also exclude a general impairment of the axonal transport machinery as cause for the BRP accumulation phenotype because synaptotagmin and CSP have been shown to accumulate in the axons of mutants known to affect axonal transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Hurd1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Gindhart2">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, light microscopical morphology of the larval neuromuscular junction and the qualitative distribution of BRP as reflected by the number of presynaptic boutons and the number of BRP-positive active zones is not altered in our <italic>Srpk79D</italic> mutants compared to wild type. We have not attempted to quantify the amount of BRP at the active zones. In a report published simultaneously a different mutant allele <italic>Srpk79D<sup>ATC</sup></italic> of the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> gene is characterized which contains a P-element insertion in intron 8 of the gene and thus disrupts all four transcripts. This mutation causes very similar accumulations of BRP in larval nerves and the authors report a 30&#x00025; reduction of BRP immuno-fluorescence at the larval neuromuscular active zones in homozygous <italic>Srpk79D<sup>ATC</sup></italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Johnson1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.

This observation indicates either that the N-terminus of SRPK79D-PC and -PF isoforms contains targeting signals for active zone localization or that these kinase isoforms can bind to active zone proteins during transport. Thus, a direct interaction of SRPK79D-PC/PF and BRP at the active zone seems possible although co-immuno-precipitation experiments for the two proteins were unsuccessful (data not shown). The obvious question of whether there are SR proteins at active zones and whether RNA splicing can occur at presynaptic active zones has now to be investigated. There is increasing evidence that presynaptic mRNA translation may contribute to synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Zhang1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Lyles1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since overexpressed GFP-tagged SRPK79D-PB is not found at active zones but nonetheless rescues the BRP accumulation phenotype in larval nerves of <italic>Srpk79D<sup>VN</sup></italic> null mutants our data do not support the hypothesis that mRNA splicing at active zones might be required to prevent the axonal BRP accumulations.</p><p>We have not observed a clear functional difference for the different SRPK79D isoforms. The striking axonal BRP accumulation phenotype is seen both in the <italic>Srpk79D<sup>P1</sup></italic> mutant (lacking isoforms PC/PF and showing reduced expression of isoforms PB/PE) and in the <italic>Srpk79D<sup>VN</sup></italic> null mutant (lacking all isoforms). Since it can be rescued in both mutants by all three available rescue cDNA constructs, RB, RC and RF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g003">Figure 3F, 3I, 3L</xref>, and data not shown), we conclude that <italic>the expression level</italic> of the kinase is important, not which N-terminus it contains nor apparently whether it is localized at the active zones.

The reasons why the BRP accumulation phenotype of our deletion mutant <italic>Srpk79D<sup>VN</sup></italic> is rescued by our RB cDNA construct but not the very similar phenotype of the <italic>Srpk79D<sup>ATC</sup></italic> allele of Johnson et al. (in press) by their RB cDNA construct has now to be investigated.</p><p>Interestingly, mutation of the serine/threonine kinase Unc-51 that recently has been shown to regulate the localization of Bruchpilot to sites opposing the glutamate receptor fields in the postsynaptic membrane also causes BRP accumulations in larval nerves similar to the ones described here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Wairkar1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. These authors interpret the BRP accumulations as axonal transport defects. However, a general axon transport defect can be excluded for the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> mutants. Yet another condition leading to BRP accumulations in larval nerves similar to the ones described here is the overexpression of BRP itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g003">Figure 3S</xref>). We excluded that mutation of the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> gene influences the expression level of the <italic>brp</italic> gene by semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR (data not shown) and by immuno-blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000700.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We also found no evidence for changes in splicing of <italic>brp</italic> transcripts in the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> mutant by RT&#x02013;PCR (data not shown) or by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000700.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus we speculate that an unknown factor co-transported with BRP along neuronal axons may have to be present at a correct stoichiometric ratio with BRP to prevent the axonal assembly into the large electron-dense structures seen in the electron microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This ratio can be disturbed by BRP overexpression or by reduced expression of the unknown factor. Alternative splicing to regulate transcription factor activities and hence gene expression (e.g. for the unknown factor) is a general mechanism known from early <italic>Drosophila</italic> development or sexual differentiation and from cell cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Jang1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. By this hypothesis a link between the available information about SRPK79D function and the larval BRP accumulation phenotype could be proposed. Attempts to prevent the formation of BRP accumulations by simultaneous overexpression of both BRP and SRPK79D-PC failed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000700.s006">Figure S6</xref>). However, the correct wild-type stoichiometric ratio of the unknown factor and BRP is perhaps difficult to restore.</p><p>The adult <italic>Srpk79D</italic> mutant flies show general behavioral impairments like locomotor defects and reduced life time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The effect of the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> mutation on the distribution of BRP in adults is similar to the larval phenotype in that BRP accumulates in various nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g003">Figure 3T</xref> and data not shown). The expressivity of this phenotype is however rather variable such that further experiments are required to clarify the cause of this variability. Thus at present we have no evidence that the altered BRP distribution is indeed responsible for the behavioral phenotypes. Altered expression of the unknown factor mentioned above due to defective splicing could of course explain these phenotypes. Since no clear electrophysiological defects are observed in larval nerve-muscle preparations of the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g004">Figure 4</xref>) we cannot offer a more specific hypothesis. On the other hand, subtle synaptic defects which may well play a role in central brain network function cannot be excluded because they may go unnoticed at the robust neuromuscular junction with its huge complement of reserve pool vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Delgado1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, since larval nerves contain both sensory and motor axons, we cannot be certain that the BRP accumulations are found in motor axons. The typical large BRP accumulations are not seen in the motor axons just before they branch to form the synaptic boutons. However, the fact that the behavioral defects of the <italic>Srpk79D<sup>P1</sup></italic> mutant are reverted after precise excision of the P-element insertion and can be fully or partially rescued by panneural expression of the SRPK79D-PF isoform in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g007">Figure 7</xref>) clearly link the phenotype to the <italic>Srpk79D</italic> gene and rule out genetic background effects. The rescue experiments also demonstrate that the eGFP moiety at the C-terminus does not impair the SRPK79D function required for prevention of the BRP accumulations. The observation that the rescue of the axonal BRP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g003">Figure 3F and 3I</xref>) and of the reduced life span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000700-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) is incomplete, may be due to the fact that the three other isoforms are missing in the rescue animals or to the incorrect amount and/or distribution of the transgenically expressed protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present results demonstrate an important role of the kinase SRPK79D for the proper distribution of the active zone protein Bruchpilot. In larval and adult nerves the kinase is required for preventing the formation of conspicuous BRP-containing electron-dense ribbon-like agglomerates observed by electron microscopy in the <italic>Srpk79D<sup>VN</sup></italic> mutant but not in wild-type controls. It is tempting to speculate that these ribbons may be molecularly related to T-bars beyond the association with BRP and that the kinase prevents the premature assembly of T-bars in peripheral axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Johnson1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether BRP is also involved in generating the behavioral and survival defects observed when SRPK79D-PC/PF isoforms or all SRPK79D isoforms are missing is not known. Since BRP does not contain any serine-arginine rich domains it seems unlikely that BRP is a substrate for these kinases. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation data suggest that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> SRPK79D isoforms modify SR proteins and thus may be involved in splicing regulation. It will now be necessary to identify the endogenous substrates of the SRPK79D kinase and study the mechanisms by which the formation of the extensive BRP-containing electron-dense agglomerates in wild-type axons is prevented. The characterization of an SR protein kinase that appears to be localized at presynaptic active zones and has dramatic effects on the distribution of an active zone protein is likely to modify current views on vertebrate SRPK function and may initiate new approaches to the study of active zone assembly and function.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly stocks</title><p><italic>P{lacW}Csp<sup>P2</sup></italic> line was generated in this lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Zinsmaier1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Eberle1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>, <italic>w,elav-Gal4</italic>, <italic>w;actin-Gal4/CyO</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;2&#x02013;3<sup>Ki, p</sup></italic> jump starter and balancer lines were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center, <italic>Srpk79D</italic>-RNAi line (ID 8451) was obtained from the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi Collection.

Larval olfactory conditioning was assayed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000700-Gerber1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, a group of 30 to 35 larvae was exposed for 5 min to vapor from undiluted 1-octanol (O<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) while crawling on 1&#x00025; agarose containing 2 M fructose, transferred to pure 1&#x00025; agarose and exposed for 5 min to vapor from n-amyl acetate (A) (diluted 1&#x02236;50 in paraffin oil). This procedure was repeated 3 times, after which they were transferred to pure 1&#x00025; agarose in the presence of antagonistic gradients of both odors. After 3 min the number of larvae closer to each odor source was counted and the preference index PI<sub>O&#x0002b;</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(# near O&#x02212;# near A)/total # was calculated. Next a new group of larvae was treated equivalently, only now A instead of O was presented in the presence of fructose and PI<sub>A&#x0002b;</sub> was calculated. The total procedure was repeated 10 times and the learning index LI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(PI<sub>O&#x0002b;</sub>&#x02212;PI<sub>A&#x0002b;</sub>)/2 was calculated. Prior to the experiment the <italic>Srpk79D<sup>VN</sup></italic> mutant had been backcrossed to wild type CS for 6 generations to minimize genetic background effects. The experiments were done blind with respect to the genotype.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000700.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Antisera against SRPK79D-PC and -PB recognize the respective overexpressed isoforms.
