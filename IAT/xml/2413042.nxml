The &#x0201c;biogenesis&#x0201d; model for MLIV pathogenesis suggests that TRP-ML1 modulates postendocytic delivery to lysosomes by regulating interactions between late endosomes and lysosomes. This model is based on observed lipid trafficking delays in MLIV patient fibroblasts. Because membrane traffic aberrations may be secondary to lipid buildup in chronically TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells, we depleted TRP-ML1 in HeLa cells using small interfering RNA and examined the effects on cell morphology and postendocytic traffic. TRP-ML1 knockdown induced gradual accumulation of membranous inclusions and, thus, represents a good model in which to examine the direct effects of acute TRP-ML1 deficiency on membrane traffic. Ratiometric imaging revealed decreased lysosomal pH in TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells, suggesting a disruption in lysosomal function. Nevertheless, we found no effect of TRP-ML1 knockdown on the kinetics of protein or lipid delivery to lysosomes. In contrast, by comparing degradation kinetics of low density lipoprotein constituents, we confirmed a selective defect in cholesterol but not apolipoprotein B hydrolysis in MLIV fibroblasts. We hypothesize that the effects of TRP-ML1 loss on hydrolytic activity have a cumulative effect on lysosome function, resulting in a lag between TRP-ML1 loss and full manifestation of MLIV.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: apoB, apolipoprotein B; CO, cholesteryl oleate; HA, hemagglutinin; LacCer, BODIPY-C5-lactosylceramide; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LPDS, lipoprotein-deficient serum; MLII, mucolipidosis type II; MLIV, mucolipidosis type IV; NPC, Niemann-Pick type C; TCA, trichloroacetic acid; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine; TRP-ML1, transient receptor potential&#x02013;mucolipin-1.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>The gene <italic>MCOLN1</italic>, coding for transient receptor potential&#x02013;mucolipin-1 (TRP-ML1), is mutated in the rare lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), which is clinically characterized by severe developmental delays and psychomotor retardation, constitutive achlorohydria, and retinal degeneration and corneal opacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). As in all lysosomal storage disorders, MLIV is characterized at the cellular level by the buildup of membranous and electron-dense organelles containing undigested lipid products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). However, the stored lipid products are more heterogeneous than in most storage disorders and include gangliosides, sphingolipids, phospholipids, acidic mucopolysaccharides, and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Lipid accumulations in other lysosomal storage disorders are a result of the abnormal targeting and/or activity of individual hydrolases involved in lipid processing. Although which lipid products accumulate in MLIV have been identified, there is no clear consensus as to which enzyme activities are compromised. A previous report suggested that there is deficient ganglioside sialidase activity associated with MLIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), whereas others argued against this enzyme deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Although some reports demonstrate that both phospholipase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and acid lipase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) activities are normal in MLIV patient cells, other data suggest deficits in activities of these enzymes in MLIV cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). It is possible that such differences reflect variations between the primary fibroblasts used in these studies or compensatory changes in enzyme activity at the gene expression level.</p><p>Both immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies demonstrate that TRP-ML1 is localized to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), and it is thought that lipid accumulations associated with MLIV are a result of imbalanced ion homeostasis along the endocytic pathway resulting from TRP-ML1 dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). A consensus on TRP-ML1 permeability characteristics is only beginning to emerge, whereas native TRP-ML1 activity has not been studied. Recombinant TRP-ML1 was characterized in the plasma membrane, where it is targeted under overexpression conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), and in artificial lipid bilayers using TRP-ML1 purified from overexpressing cells or synthesized in a cell-free system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). These experimental systems yielded outwardly rectifying monovalent cation-permeable channels. On the other hand, &#x0201c;activating&#x0201d; mutations in TRP-ML1 resulted in an inwardly rectifying current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Such mutants were permeable to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, which is similar to some previously published data on wild-type TRP-ML1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), whereas other studies have demonstrated a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block of TRP-ML1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><p>The &#x0201c;biogenesis&#x0201d; model for MLIV progression suggests that TRP-ML1 regulates lipid trafficking by mediating specific fission and/or fusion events between late endosomes and lysosomes that occur during the process of lysosome biogenesis, a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). In the absence of functional TRP-ML1, endocytosed material destined for degradation accumulates because of impaired access to the hydrolases necessary for catabolism. Moreover, this model predicts that there will be a global defect in the postendocytic delivery of both lipids and proteins to lysosomes. The notion that TRP-ML1 directly regulates membrane traffic is based on the observations that TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells display aberrant mixing of lysosomal and endosomal content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>) and that trafficking of a fluorescent conjugate of BODIPY-C5-lactosylceramide (LacCer) along the endocytic pathway is delayed in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). This model is also supported by studies performed in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> in which the functional TRP-ML1 orthologue CUP-5 has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Knockout of the <italic>cup-5</italic> gene has been associated with defects in lysosome biogenesis. There is increased colocalization of late endosomal and lysosomal markers in <italic>cup-5</italic> mutants, and loss of this gene results in the abnormal accumulation of vacuolar structures that are interpreted to represent hybrid late endosomal&#x02013;lysosomal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Again, the observed endocytic abnormalities observed in <italic>cup-5</italic> mutants were alleviated by exogenous expression of functional human TRP-ML1.</p><p>The &#x0201c;metabolic&#x0201d; model suggests that, similar to the ClC channels, TRP-ML1 regulates lysosomal ion homeostasis and thus directly affects the activity of lysosomal digestive enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). It was hypothesized that TRP-ML1 functions as a H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> leak pathway to prevent the overacidification of the lysosomal lumen, and that the activity of lysosomal lipases are disrupted as a consequence of the ionic imbalance in TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>An additional complexity that must be clarified to properly describe MLIV pathogenesis and TRP-ML1 function is whether any defects in membrane traffic or lipid metabolism are the primary cause of MLIV, or are instead secondary effects caused by the chronic accumulation of undigested lipids in these cells. The membrane trafficking studies discussed earlier in this section were performed in chronically TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient fibroblasts. It is possible that the buildup of lipids and other undigested materials in these cells eventually impedes the entry of trafficking markers into lysosomes and manifests as delays in membrane traffic. Indeed, exactly the same lipid traffic delays were reported in several lysosomal storage disorders, whose main causes are entirely metabolic and are not directly related to membrane traffic (GM1 and GM2 gangliosidoses, Fabry's disease, and Niemann-Pick types A or B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). To circumvent this issue, we used an siRNA approach to examine the consequences of acute down-regulation of TRP-ML1 function on postendocytic delivery to lysosomes.</p><p>Understanding whether TRP-ML1 regulates membrane traffic or lipolysis is a key step in determining whether enzyme replacement therapies will be effective as treatment for MLIV. A finding that TRP-ML1 directly regulates membrane traffic will make it unlikely that enzyme replacement therapies for MLIV will succeed. If, however, TRP-ML1 regulates lysosomal ion homeostasis, then replacement therapies, perhaps based on enzymes modified to work in an MLIV-specific lysosomal environment, are likely to be useful.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>siRNA-mediated TRP-ML1 knockdown</title><p>We identified two siRNA oligonucleotides specific for TRP-ML1 and tested their ability to knock down endogenous as well as heterologously expressed hemagglutinin (HA) epitope&#x02013;tagged TRP-ML1 in HeLa cells. Cells were transfected with control (nonsilencing) or with one of two TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA oligonucleotides. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis. We previously demonstrated that the 65-kD full-length TRP-ML1 is intracellularly cleaved into two fragments of roughly equal molecular mass (40 and 37 kD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Because it contains only a single transmembrane domain, the N-terminal fragment is less prone to aggregation than the full-length protein or C-terminal half, and is thus easier to detect upon SDS-PAGE. The arrowhead in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> marks the migration of the N-terminal fragment of TRP-ML1. Transfection with either of the TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA duplexes resulted in virtually complete knockout of native TRP-ML1. Similarly, knockdown of exogenously expressed TRP-ML1 was observed when cells transfected with siRNA were later retransfected with an HA-tagged version of TRP-ML1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Under these overexpression conditions, we could detect both the full-length protein and the HA-tagged cleaved fragments on Western blots of cells transfected with control but not with TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA duplexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>siRNA-mediated knockdown of TRP-ML1.</bold> (A) HeLa cells were transfected with either nonsilencing control or TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA oligonucleotides. Cells were harvested for Western blot analysis after 24 h. Equal amounts of total protein were loaded for SDS-PAGE, as determined by protein assay. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted to detect endogenous levels of TRP-ML1 using an antibody directed against the first extracellular loop of the protein. The arrowhead denotes the migration of the cleaved form of TRP-ML1. (B) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding HA epitope&#x02013;tagged TRP-ML1 24 h after initial transfection with either control or TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA duplexes. After an additional 24-h incubation, cells were solubilized and equal amounts of total protein were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibodies. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed using horseradish peroxidase&#x02013;conjugated anti-HA antibody. 10% of the cell lysate was saved before immunoprecipitation and immunoblotted using antitubulin antibody as an additional loading control (bottom). (C) HeLa cells were transfected with either nonsilencing control or TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA oligonucleotides and were harvested for Western blot analysis 1, 3, or 5 d after transfection (top), or were retransfected with siRNA duplexes after 2 d and were harvested for Western analysis at 3 or 5 d (bottom). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted to detect endogenous TRP-ML1.

To determine the duration of TRP-ML1 knockdown, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis at 1, 3, or 5 d after transfection with either a nonsilencing control siRNA duplex or with TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific oligonucleotides. As before, knockdown was virtually complete within 1 d of transfection; however, native TRP-ML1 reappeared within 3 d after the initial siRNA duplex transfection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, top). To overcome this, we performed a similar experiment except that the 3- and 5-d samples were retransfected with TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific or control siRNA duplexes 48 h after the initial transfection, and were subsequently harvested for Western blot analysis at 3 or 5 d. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> (bottom), using these conditions, we were able to knock down TRP-ML1 almost completely during this time course.</p><p>With specific TRP-ML1 knockdown conditions in place, we next sought to determine the onset of MLIV-like lipid inclusion formation over a 5-d knockdown period in HeLa cells. Electron microscopic analysis of cells transfected with either control or TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA revealed the progressive accumulation of pleomorphic inclusions scattered throughout the cytoplasm of cells transfected with TRP-ML1 siRNA, whereas very few such inclusions were observed in control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). These inclusions are reminiscent of those observed in patient-derived MLIV fibroblasts, some of which contain multilamellar membranes, whereas others are filled with electron-dense, gray material (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Quantitation of the accumulation of storage bodies in both control and TRP-ML1 siRNA&#x02013;transfected cells is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>. In TRP-ML1 siRNA&#x02013;treated cells, inclusions begin to accumulate as early as 1 d after siRNA transfection and gradually increased over the 5-d period. It should be noted that even after 12 d of siRNA treatment, the mean number of inclusions observed in HeLa cells (69 inclusions per cell slice; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) was much lower than that previously determined for MLIV fibroblasts using the same method (&#x0223c;720 inclusions per cell slice; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Time course of lipid inclusion formation in TRP-ML&#x02013;deficient cells.</bold> (A and B) Electron micrographs of HeLa cells after either 1 or 5 d of TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific or control siRNA oligonucleotide transfection.

HeLa cells were transfected with either control or TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA, as indicated. 24 h after siRNA treatment, cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding GFP and either HA-ML1 (non-siRNA resistant) or HA-ML1<sub>R</sub> (siRNA resistant). The next day, cells were sorted by FACS analysis to identify GFP-positive (transfected) cells and were subsequently retransfected with the appropriate siRNA and returned to culture for 48 h. Cells were harvested, and 30 &#x003bc;g of total protein was loaded for SDS-PAGE.

Because transfection with cDNA was only &#x0223c;30% efficient in these cells, we cotransfected them with GFP-expressing plasmid and, the following day, enriched for GFP-expressing cells using FACS. The cells were then transfected with TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA oligonucleotides and processed for electron microscopic analysis 48 h later. Knockdown of endogenous TRP-ML1 knockdown and expression of the siRNA-resistant HA-ML1<sub>R</sub> construct were confirmed by Western blotting of duplicate samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>, siRNA-treated cells expressing HA-ML1<sub>R</sub> displayed a marked decrease in the number of inclusions compared with TRP-ML1 knockdown cells that were not transfected with cDNA, suggesting that HA-ML1<sub>R</sub> expression rescues or prevents inclusion formation in TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells. These studies confirm that inclusion formation is TRP-ML1 specific. Thus, this experimental system represents an appropriate model in which to study the early stages of MLIV progression. As a result, this approach will enable us to assess the function of TRP-ML1 under conditions that are unbiased by the chronic accumulation of undigested lipid material that may itself have adverse effects on specific lipid and protein trafficking events.</p></sec><sec><title>Lipid inclusions in TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells are lamp-1 positive and receive endocytosed cargo</title><p>To examine whether the inclusions that accumulate in TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells represent active components of the endocytic pathway, control and 5-d TRP-ML1 siRNA&#x02013;treated cells were labeled en bloc with antibodies directed against the lysosomal membrane protein lamp-1, and were subsequently labeled with biotinylated secondary antibodies.

In other studies, lysosomal pH in MLIV cells has been reported to be either more acidic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) or unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>) compared with control cells. One unifying feature in all these studies is that they were performed using isolated patient fibroblasts. These cells are not necessarily appropriate for such experiments because of the long-term accumulation of undigested lipids that induce autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), which may interfere with dye loading and/or retention, and which may induce compensatory changes in these cells at the level of protein expression. Therefore, we examined lysosomal pH in cells treated with TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA for 5 d, allowing us to measure pH in TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells without any potential effects caused by long-term lipid accumulation. To quantitatively determine lysosomal pH in cells treated with control or TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA, cells were loaded for 12 h simultaneously with FITC- and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-conjugated 10-kD dextrans (3 mg/ml) to allow for accumulation in lysosomes. In separate experiments, we confirmed that both dextrans trafficked together and localized in lysosomes after the specified chase period (unpublished data). The FITC-conjugated dextran was used as a pH indicator, whereas the TMR-conjugated dextran provided a pH-insensitive readout for the ratiometric pH measurements. After dextran loading, measurements of lysosomal pH were obtained by calculating the ratio of TMR/FITC fluorescence and fitting these to a standard curve constructed as described in Materials and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). As shown in a representative experiment in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, TRP-ML1 knockdown was associated with lysosomal acidification. In this experiment, the mean lysosomal pH in cells treated with control siRNA was 5.44 &#x000b1; 0.06, whereas in cells treated with TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA, the mean pH was estimated to be 4.04 &#x000b1; 0.09. Over the course of four experiments using identical imaging conditions, the mean difference in pH between control and TRP-ML1 siRNA&#x02013;treated cells was 1.12 &#x000b1; 0.16 pH units. These results indicated that loss of functional TRP-ML1 in cells results in a reduction of lysosomal pH even after a short period of TRP-ML1 knockdown, and that even lysosomes that have not yet accumulated significant amounts of undigested material are functionally affected by loss of TRP-ML1.</p></sec><sec><title>Lysosomal delivery of LacCer is unimpaired in TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells</title><p>Numerous studies have reported that trafficking of the fluorescent lipid analogue LacCer is impaired in MLIV fibroblasts as well as in primary fibroblasts from several other lysosomal storage diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).

As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, LacCer staining in cells transfected with a control siRNA oligonucleotide was tightly clustered around the nucleus, consistent with efficient delivery to the Golgi complex (top).

Although our previously published data did not support this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), a detailed analysis of the membrane traffic in MLIV fibroblasts performed by Pryor et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) suggested a delay in transfer of the endocytosed material from late endosomes to lysosomes. However, because these studies were performed in MLIV fibroblasts, this effect could be a secondary result of undigested lipid buildup. Therefore, we performed a series of experiments to quantitate the rate of protein and lipid delivery to lysosomes in control and TRP-ML1 knockdown HeLa cells. The premise of these experiments was that if TRP-ML1 directly regulates the delivery of endocytosed material to lysosomes, then acute TRP-ML1 down-regulation would result in prelysosomal buildup of endocytosed material, whose entry into lysosomes will be significantly delayed.</p><p><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> shows the results of our experiments. Control and siRNA-transfected cells were loaded with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml LacCer for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C to incorporate LacCer into the plasma membrane. The cells were washed and chased for brief periods (up to 60 min) in the presence of 5 mg/ml BSA. After the chase, cells were loaded with LysoTracker Red to identify lysosomes, and confocal images of cells were analyzed for overlap between LacCer and LysoTracker Red to quantify lysosomal delivery of LacCer. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, we found no difference in kinetics of lysosomal delivery of LacCer in control versus TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells. As a positive control, we pharmacologically suppressed membrane fusion and confirmed that this induces an observable delay in lipid traffic. To do this, we loaded untransfected HeLa cells with 1 &#x003bc;M of the cell-permeable Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> chelator BAPTA-AM. Because vesicular fusion in the endocytic pathway requires Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, chelation with BAPTA should suppress membrane fusion and, thus, replicate the conditions predicted by the biogenesis model associated with the loss of TRP-ML1 Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> conductance. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> shows that, unlike TRP-ML1 down-regulation, BAPTA-AM inhibited delivery of LacCer to lysosomal compartments.

Previous studies in MLIV fibroblasts have specifically probed lipid metabolism along the LDL receptor&#x02013;mediated pathway of lysosomal degradation using radiolabeled forms of both sphingomyelin and cholesteryl oleate (CO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). These studies found that MLIV fibroblasts metabolize both lipids more slowly compared with control cells. Therefore, our first approach was to examine whether delivery of LDL to lysosomes in TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells was impaired. To determine this, we used fluorescence microscopy to examine and quantitate the delivery of DiI-labeled LDL to lysosomes of HeLa cells transfected with TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA. In these studies, cells were treated with either control or TRP-ML1 siRNA duplexes for 5 d. Alexa Fluor 647&#x02013;conjugated dextran was preaccumulated in lysosomes during a 12-h preincubation before the start of the experiment.

At either time point, cells were fixed and coverslips were mounted for analysis. Delivery of DiI-LDL to lysosomes was measured by quantifying the percentage of overlap between DiI-LDL and the preloaded Alexa Fluor 647&#x02013;dextran expressed as the amount of Di-LDL present in dextran-positive compartments.

We also did not observe a delay in parallel studies quantifying DiI-LDL delivery in MLIV and MLII fibroblasts relative to control cells, suggesting that chronic lipid buildup in these cells does not affect LDL delivery to lysosomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>).

The efficiency of these processes depends on the maintenance of specific ionic environments that are established by the combination actions of ion channels and pumps residing in endocytic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). New information about these ion transporters regularly emerges from studies on the genetic determinants of lysosomal storage diseases. MLIV is one of several examples of lysosomal storage diseases caused by a dysfunction in the ionic balance of the endocytic machinery. The severity of this disease is compounded by the fact that no unified model exists for MLIV pathogenesis, thus hindering the development of pharmacological interventions.</p><p>Because the identification that mutations in the <italic>MCOLN1</italic> gene are responsible for the MLIV disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), it has become apparent that this lysosomal cation channel plays a key role in the maintenance and regulation of postendocytic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). As described in the Introduction, two models exist to explain the primary defect in MLIV. The biogenesis model suggests that MLIV is caused by delayed membrane traffic to lysosomes as a result of impaired endosome&#x02013;lysosome fusion or fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). The metabolic model postulates that MLIV results from an ionic imbalance in lysosomes that precludes efficient processing of internalized lipids and other molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>In principle, a comprehensive model for the regulation of TRP-ML1 channel activity would enable the discrimination between these models. Fusion between various membrane-bound vesicular endocytic compartments is regulated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration in the vicinity of these compartments, whereas the trafficking and activity of various proteases and lipases depends on the acidic environment maintained within both endosomal and lysosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). TRP-ML1 has been reported to be permeable to both Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and to H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; however, electrophysiological characterization of TRP-ML1 activity under physiological conditions has yet to be performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>).</p><p>In the present studies, we sought to determine whether MLIV results from aberrant membrane traffic to lysosomes. An additional issue is whether any observed defects in membrane trafficking or lipid metabolism are a primary result of MLIV pathophysiology, or are instead secondary effects that result from the chronic accumulation of undigested lipids in TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient cells. Our goal was to design an experimental system in which we could examine these membrane-trafficking steps in cells that lacked TRP-ML1 but that had not yet chronically accumulated undigested lipids. Because MLIV has been unequivocally identified as a &#x0201c;single-gene disorder&#x0201d;, acute TRP-ML1 knockdown using siRNA is a valid model for the early stages of MLIV pathogenesis. Using this approach, we were able to down-regulate TRP-ML1 expression in cells over a period of several days. During this time, lysosomes from these cells gradually accumulated lipid inclusions, but at a level significantly less than previously described in MLIV fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Formation of inclusions was efficiently rescued by transfection of an siRNA-resistant version of TRP-ML1. Lipids accumulated in lamp-1&#x02013;positive organelles, suggesting that the inclusions are of lysosomal origin. Furthermore, colloidal gold internalized by fluid-phase endocytosis could access inclusions in both isolated patient fibroblasts and in siRNA-treated cells, demonstrating that these organelles remain active components of the endocytic pathway.</p><p>Several studies have reported that the trafficking of fluorescent conjugates of LacCer is hindered in MLIV fibroblasts as well as in other lysosomal storage diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Consistent with these observations, we observed a similar defect in LacCer handling in cells treated with TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA. However, we observed no difference in the delivery of this lipid to lysosomes in control and TRP-ML1 knockdown cells. Therefore, the altered trafficking of LacCer may represent an effect on postlysosomal membrane traffic and/or lipid metabolism in cells after prolonged accumulation of undigested materials. These results are consistent with a recent report by Thompson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>) suggesting that the primary defect in MLIV lipid handling may be the exit of internalized lipids from lysosomes. We found no effect of acute TRP-ML1 knockdown on the rate of LDL delivery to lysosomes or on the degradation of both the lipid and protein components of this complex. Collectively, these data argue strongly against the biogenesis model for MLIV progression, which predicts that acute loss of TRP-ML1 function will result in a global defect in the delivery of both internalized lipids and proteins to lysosomes.</p><p>The role of TRP-ML1 in lysosomal ion homeostasis is currently disputed. Increased accumulation of acridine orange in MLIV fibroblasts has previously been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), consistent with increased acidity of these organelles; however, quantitation of lysosomal pH in MLIV fibroblasts by other groups has yielded discrepant results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Similar to Pryor et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), we were unable to document any difference in lysosomal pH between control and MLIV fibroblasts by fluorescence ratio imaging; however, our studies were compromised by the intense autofluorescence in MLIV lipid inclusions that has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). However, we reproducibly observed that lysosomal pH in HeLa cells lacking functional TRP-ML1 was more acidic than control (a decrease of &#x0223c;1.12 pH units). In principle, this finding is consistent with the metabolic model for MLIV pathogenesis, which postulates that the increased acidity of lysosomes disrupts lipid hydrolysis.</p><p>Previous groups have demonstrated defects in lipase handling in MLIV fibroblasts, including delayed deesterification of cholesterol esters and decreased lysosomal acid lipase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that the release of free fatty acids from [<sup>14</sup>C]CO-labeled LDL was slowed in MLIV fibroblasts. Surprisingly, however, we did not detect a deficit in cholesterol metabolism in siRNA-treated cells (after 1, 5, or 12 d).</p><p>The apparently normal hydrolysis of LDL cholesterol upon acute loss of TRP-ML1 function demonstrates that the increased lysosomal acidity observed in these cells does not critically impair acid lipase activity. Rather, there appears to be a gradual effect on lysosomal hydrolysis that manifests as a lag period between loss of TRP-ML1 function and the full elaboration of the MLIV disease phenotype. It is possible that a minor deficit in lipid hydrolysis that is undetectable early after TRP-ML1 loss has a cumulative effect whose consequences slowly develop as the disease progresses. Indeed, other lysosomal storage disease models such as Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>) teach us that a defect in a single component of lysosomal machinery may sabotage processing of unrelated classes of lipids. NPC disease is caused by the mutation in either the late endosomal membrane protein NPC1 or the soluble lysosomal protein NPC2, and results in abnormal cholesterol transport along the late endocytic pathway. Similar to MLIV, NPC is caused by defective cholesterol trafficking rather than by a specific enzymatic abnormality. Although the primary defect is in cholesterol transport, the accumulation of other lipids, including sphingolipids, has also been demonstrated in NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that TRP-ML1 does not directly regulate membrane traffic; thus, enzyme replacement therapies remain a potentially viable treatment option for MLIV. Future studies are needed to determine whether TRP-ML1 plays an essential role in maintaining lysosomal ion homeostasis directly so that replacement enzymes may be designed to operate in the unique environment of the TRP-ML1&#x02013;deficient lysosome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cell lines and reagents.</title><p>HeLa SS6 cells were maintained in DME (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen).

To generate the siRNA-resistant construct HA-ML1<sub>R</sub>, the codons encoding amino acids IQEC starting at position 281 of TRP-ML1 (targeted by siRNA no. 1) were mutated from CATCCAGGAGTG to TATTCAAGAATG to create siRNA resistance without affecting the corresponding amino acid sequence. For knockdown of endogenous TRP-ML1, HeLa SS6 cells were plated in 24-well dishes and allowed to grow to &#x0223c;50&#x02013;60% confluence. Cells were transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA duplex (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TRP-ML1&#x02013;specific siRNA duplexes. For each individual well, 3 &#x003bc;l of 20 &#x003bc;M siRNA oligonucleotide and 4.5 &#x003bc;l TransIT-TKO oligonucleotide transfection reagent (Mirus) were used. Cells were harvested for protein concentration or Western blot analysis 1, 3, or 5 d after transfection. For cells transfected with siRNA twice over the 5-d knockdown period, 2 d after initial transfection, cells were replated onto 24-well plates, retransfected as described the same day, and harvested for analysis either 24 or 72 h later. For knockdown of exogenously expressed HA epitope&#x02013;tagged ML1 (HA-ML1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), cells were plated and transfected with siRNA as described. 24 h after siRNA transfection, cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding HA-ML1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and harvested for Western blot analysis 24 h later. Samples were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Electron microscopy.</title><p>Cells grown on plastic dishes were fixed by a 30-min incubation with a solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M Na-cacodylate, washed with 0.1M Na-cacodylate, postfixed with a solution containing 1% OsO4, washed with PBS, and stained en bloc for 30 min with 2% uranyl acetate. After dehydration by immersion in 30&#x02013;100% ethanol, the samples were embedded in resin by immersion in 30&#x02013;100% resin/propylene oxide mixtures. Fixed samples were mounted on grids and analyzed with a transmission electron microscope (100CX; JEOL Ltd.). For immunostaining with lamp-1 antibodies, after fixation and freeze&#x02013;thaw permeabilization of the membranes at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C in a cryoprotectant solution containing glycerol and sucrose, cells were blocked in BSA with goat serum, incubated overnight with monoclonal anti&#x02013;lamp-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and rinsed, and biotinylated secondary antibodies were added. After an extensive wash, the samples were incubated with avidin&#x02013;peroxidase complexes for 30 min, followed by another wash. Next, 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were added for 4&#x02013;10 min and, after another wash, the samples underwent secondary fixation with 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> for 1 h. This procedure yields the dark stain associated with lamp-1 immunoreactivity.</p><p>For colloidal gold uptake experiments, 10-nm gold particles were incubated with gelatin and BSA (pH 5), to coat the particles.

HeLa cells treated with siRNA for 5 d were plated onto 0.17-mm &#x00394;T live-cell cover glass dishes (Biotechs). 12 h before the start of imaging, cells were loaded with 3 mg/ml each of FITC- and TMR-conjugated 10,000-kD dextrans (Invitrogen) to allow accumulation in lysosomes. To measure pH differences between cells, a standard curve was determined for each experiment. Before imaging for the standard curve, cells were rinsed once with MES buffer (115 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM MES) that had been calibrated using a pH meter (Accumet; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. After rinsing, the cells were imaged in the same buffer supplemented with 10 &#x003bc;M nigericin and 10 &#x003bc;M monesin to equilibrate intracellular and extracellular pH. Experimental dishes were imaged in DME without sodium bicarbonate. Images were taken using a microscope (IX81; Olympus) with a 60&#x000d7; 1.4 NA PlanApo oil-immersion objective. Pairs of images were captured from random fields of cells using a spinning disc confocal system (Perkin Elmer). Images were acquired and analyzed with Metamorph software (MDS Analytical Technologies). For analysis, equivalent FITC and TMR images were subjected to a morphological filter (Tophat) to remove background fluorescence. A binary mask was applied so that only matched spots from each image were compared. After applying a threshold, the total gray value for each image was recorded for both channels, and the TMR/FITC ratio was determined. TMR/FITC ratios were plotted against pH values, and curves were fitted using linear regression analysis. At least 20 images were analyzed for each condition in four independent experiments. The Student's <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine statistical significance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>LacCer traffic.</title><p>To examine LacCer trafficking at long chase times, HeLa cells were labeled with 5 &#x003bc;M LacCer complexed to BSA in serum-free DME for 60 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells were gently washed three times with PBS and incubated with DME plus 10% FCS for 5 h at 37&#x000b0;C. After chase, cell-surface LacCer was back-extracted by washing cells for 30 min in DME without bicarbonate supplemented with 2% (wt/vol) fatty acid&#x02013;free BSA at 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were washed briefly with PBS, and images were acquired in DME without bicarbonate at 20&#x000b0;C. Images were acquired using the Olympus IX81 equipped with a spinning disc confocal microscope system (UltraVIEW; PerkinElmer). Cells were imaged using a 60&#x000d7; objective, and the LacCer was excited using a 488-nm laser, whereas the dextran was excited using a 647-nm laser. These two excitation filters were used to account for the aggregation-dependent shift in red fluorescence that is characteristic of the BODIPY fluorophore. Under these experimental conditions, little red LacCer fluorescence was observed, so LacCer images in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> were acquired using only the 488-nm laser.</p><p>For shorter experiments examining lysosomal delivery kinetics, HeLa cells were loaded with LacCer (Invitrogen) and analyzed as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).

The next day, cells were incubated with 20 &#x003bc;g/ml DiI-LDL (Invitrogen) on ice for 60 min to allow LDL binding. Cells were subsequently washed in PBS and chased in fresh DME for either 30 or 120 min at 37&#x000b0;C. At the end of the time course, cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) solution diluted in PBS for 10 min and mounted for image analysis. Confocal imaging was performed on an Olympus IX81 equipped with an UltraVIEW spinning disc confocal head, and an argon&#x02013;ion, argon&#x02013;krypton, and helium&#x02013;cadmium laser combiner. Images were acquired with a 100&#x000d7; plan-apochromat objective (NA 1.4) and the appropriate filter combination. The extent of colocalization between Alexa Fluor 647&#x02013;dextran and DiI-LDL&#x02013;positive compartments was determined using image analysis software (Metamorph; MDS Analytical Technologies).
