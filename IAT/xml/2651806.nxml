Genes, both previously known to be involved and not known to be involved in drug disposition, with PXR response elements (PXREs) located upstream, within or downstream from their potentially associated genes, were identified. Validation experiments identified several new drug disposition genes with PXR binding sites. Of these, only CYP4F12 demonstrated increased binding in the presence of rifampicin. The role of PXR in the basal and inductive response of CYP4F12 was confirmed in hepatocytes in which PXR was silenced. We also assessed the association of PXR-coactivators and -corepressors with known and newly identified PXREs. Both PXR and the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC-1) were found to bind to PXREs in the absence of rifampicin, although binding was stronger after rifampicin treatment. We observed promoter-dependent patterns with respect to the binding of various coactivators and corepressors involved in the regulation of CYP4F12, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, UGT1A1 and P-glycoprotein. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PXR is involved in the regulation of CYP4F12 and that PXR along with SRC1 binds to a broad range of promoters but that many of these are not inducible by rifampicin.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human pregnane-X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) is an essential regulator of a large and growing array of drug disposition genes which correspond to all phases of drug metabolism. These include phase I enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP), phase II enzymes such as uridine-5&#x02032;-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and transporters such as the multidrug resistance protein MDR1 P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). A large body of literature has revealed that PXR activation by xenobiotics, in the liver and intestine, results in a significant increase in the expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). In addition to increased gene expression, PXR can repress gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), indicating that gene regulation via PXR is complex. Although PXR functions as a defense mechanism against toxic insults, it also represents the molecular basis for pharmacokinetic drug&#x02013;drug interactions. For example, if one drug activates PXR, administration of this drug can promote its own elimination (autoinduction) or the elimination of other coadministered drugs that are metabolized and eliminated by PXR-target gene products, thereby reducing the efficacy of drug therapies in patients on combination therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>).</p><p>As a prototypical nuclear receptor, PXR has a DNA-binding domain (DBD) at the N-terminus and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) at the C-terminus. The DBD is responsible for binding to regulatory DNA sequences such as the AGGTCA-like direct repeats spaced by 3, 4 or 5 bases (DR3, DR4 and DR5), and the everted repeats separated by 6 or 8 bases (ER6 and ER8) located in the PXR target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The LBD is multifunctional in that it is capable of ligand binding, dimerization, transcriptional activation, and interactions with transcriptional co-factors. The C-terminal helix termed AF-2 is responsible for transcriptional activation by recruiting coactivators through conformational rearrangement, or gene repression by interactions with transcriptional corepressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Understanding of coactivators and corepressors of PXR in the expression of target genes is relatively limited. Recently, Moore <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) reviewed some of the key coactivators and corepressors involved in the PXR regulation of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Small heterodimer partner (SHP/NC0B2) and nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCoR2/SMRT) were identified as corepressors, while steroid receptor coactivators 1 (SRC1/NCOA1) and 2 (SRC2/GRIP1), nuclear receptor interacting protein 1 (NRIP1/RIP140), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC-1), and Forkhead transcription factor FKHR (FOXO1) were reported as coactivators.</p><p>While NCoR, SHP and SMRT are known to be corepressors of genes, studies undertaken by several groups using transfection assays in CV1, HepG2, HEK293 and yeast cells indicate that only SHP and SMRT are involved in transcriptional repression of PXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16">13&#x02013;16</xref>). Ourlin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) demonstrated in HepG2 cells that SHP blocks PXR binding to DNA in a ligand-dependent manner. In addition, their studies using transient transfection assays proved that increased expression of SHP resulted in a decrease in PXR activation in the presence of rifampicin.</p><p>Tirona <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) highlighted the critical involvement of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4&#x003b1; (HNF4&#x003b1;), together with PXR in the regulation of CYP3A4. Using mammalian two-hybrid assays Li and Chiang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) showed that HNF4&#x003b1; and SHP compete to interact with PXR. These studies also revealed that SHP only partially blocked the PXR/SRC1 interaction and was unable to block the PXR/PGC-1&#x003b1; interaction. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation <bold>(</bold>ChIP) analysis, they observed that rifampicin increased the recruitment of HNF4&#x003b1; and SRC1 to the CYP3A4 chromatin but reduced PGC1&#x003b1; recruitment.</p><p>In most studies referenced above, cell lines in which proteins were overexpressed were not of hepatic origin and promoter elements were outside of their natural chromatin environment. In addition, to assess DNA&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;protein interactions researchers used electro mobility shift assays that make use of &#x02018;naked&#x02019; DNA as a probe, whereas in living cells much of the DNA is covered by nucleosomes. Thus, many binding sites for a protein in living cells could be masked by the presence of nucleosomes, but they would be scored as positive by the biochemical assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>The goals of the experiments presented in this manuscript were 3-fold: First, using ChIP, we searched for new PXR target genes in cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes treated with rifampicin. Second, using ChIP-based assays, we studied binding of PXR, as well as PXR-corepressors and -coactivators to newly identified and established PXR response elements (PXREs) before and after treatment with rifampicin. Third, we investigated whether newly identified genes in the ChIP experiments were bona fide PXR target genes by measuring mRNA levels after small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of PXR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Cryopreserved human hepatocytes, antibiotic/antimycotic Torpedo Mix, In VitroGRO-CP Media and In VitroGRO-HI Incubation Media were purchased from In Vitro Technologies (Baltimore, MD, USA).

The batches of hepatocytes used in these studies were selected for high inducibility of CYP3A4 mRNA (45- to 75-fold relative to vehicle control) after treatment with rifampicin (10 &#x003bc;M) for 48 h (data not shown). To validate the polyclonal anti-PXR antibody used for ChIP, the ability to detect known PXR target genes was determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>): Enrichment of <italic>CYP3A4, CYP2B6, UGT1A1</italic> and <italic>MDR1</italic> PXRE were 3.9-, 4.2-, 2.2- and 1.5-fold higher in rifampicin as opposed to vehicle (control; 0.1% DMSO)-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Remarkably, binding of PXR to all PXREs was also detected in the absence of rifampicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), although binding was significantly lower than that after treatment with rifampicin. Measuring of PXR interaction to two untranscribed regions (Untr) served as negative controls. While ChIPs with a control IgG are often conducted as a negative control, our findings (data not shown) suggested that the values obtained using this approach provided a less reliable baseline than assaying negative control regions (Untr) with the experimental antibody. Also, we have observed that different antibodies have different levels of background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Our unpublished data also suggest that antibody titration experiments do not necessarily show the expected concentration-dependent increase and then plateau, but one continues to see some increase (but not linear or proportional with the antibody amount) upon increasing the antibody amount. In our studies, we could not utilize much higher antibody amounts which we believe were already in excess. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>PXR (<bold>A</bold>) and SRC-1 (<bold>B</bold>) binding to several known PXRE-containing promoters including CYP3A4, CYP2B6, UGT1A1, MDR1 and Untr 5 and 20.

Approximately 5000 of these sequences produced acceptable genomic alignments from which 32.7% (or about 1/3) did not map within 10 kb of any gene. The number of genes that had at least one tag alignment within 10 kb was 3745 (using the NCBI gene database). Of these 3745 genes, 500 had two or more tag alignments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1047/DC1">Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Data</ext-link>). For these 500 genes, there were a total of 1244 aligns (within &#x000b1;10 kb), of which 877 (70.5%) mapped inside genes, 190 (15.3%) upstream and 177 (14.2%) downstream. Our analysis included all of these tags since PXRE sites may be important wherever they lie within the gene and do not necessarily need to be located in the 5&#x02032; UTR. Because ChIP fragments were &#x0003c;600 bp, 1200 was set as the maximal distance between two tags representing the same binding site, such that &#x0223c;500 tags generated 182 clusters consisting of two or more distinct alignments within 1200 bp).

The use of ChIP can detect the direct association of PXR and coactivators/corepressors with promoter elements. This is different from gene profiling experiments with cells treated with PXR-activators where it cannot be excluded that the induction of genes is a secondary effect of PXR activation. Our studies indicate that PXR binds to PXREs in the presence and absence of rifampicin, and that binding of PXR to many of the newly identified genes does not increase after treatment with rifampicin. The ability of PXR to regulate the basal expression and inducibility of one of these new genes, <italic>CYP4F12</italic>, was confirmed by hepatocytes depleted of PXR by siRNA. Finally, we extended our studies and also found that binding of SRC1 correlates with transcriptional activation of PXR target genes, whereas this was not found for other coactivators or corepressors studied.</p><p>Using a ChIP-based discovery approach, we were able to identify genes containing PXR binding sites which were mapped against the entire human genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1047/DC1">Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary data</ext-link>). Tags were identified which were localized large distances upstream from, within or downstream of their potentially associated genes. The identified tags were located on all 23 chromosomes and included drug metabolizing and transporter genes as well as genes not involved in drug disposition. The presence of PXR-binding sites on genes not involved in drug disposition is not unexpected given that recent evidence suggests that PXR plays a role in hepatic lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). For instance, PXR binds to FOXA2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1047/DC1">Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Data</ext-link>) and represses its&#x02019; activity and the genes encoding the key enzymes in energy metabolism. Furthermore, Dai <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) observed that ACC1 (Acetyl CoA carboxylase 1), which is a lipogenic enzyme, was consistently lower in PXR-null mice than wild-type mice. Their data indicated that PXR is involved in the regulation of <italic>ACC-1</italic> gene expression during liver regeneration.</p><p>Using the data obtained in the ChIP-based discovery approach we were able to confirm that several previously unidentified drug disposition genes contain PXREs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). These included phase I (CYP4F12) and phase II (SULT1B1 and UGT1A5) drug metabolizing enzymes, as well as transporters (SLC40A1 and ABCB4). In addition, our data also confirmed previous studies which indicated that <italic>CYP3A5</italic>, <italic>CYP2C8</italic> and <italic>GSTT1</italic> were PXR-target genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Similar to what we observed for the genes with known PXR-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), PXR binding to the PXREs on 11 genes analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A also occurred in the absence of rifampicin. To ensure that our findings were not due to the high inducibility of PXR in the cells we used in our experiments, we have looked at binding to several targets in two to three batches of hepatocytes. The data indicated that results were consistently in agreement. While our discovery approach identified many new genes binding to PXR, the number of tags sequenced likely did not reach saturation, and therefore more PXR target genes may be identified in the future.</p><p>As expected, in our PXR antibody validation studies with known PXR-binding sites, all four genes showed significantly higher PXR binding than was observed for the control regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Similar to what we observed during the discovery approach, binding of PXR to these PXREs was also detected in the absence of rifampicin in which the binding to MDR1 was much higher than that to UGT1A1, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Our PXR knockdown studies add additional evidence of PXR binding to PXREs in the absence of ligand and the subsequent reduction in the basal expression of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, UGT1A1, Pgp and CYP4F12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This is in line with findings by Squires <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) that PXR was present in the nucleus of mouse liver cells prior to the addition of a ligand. Similarly, in primary human hepatocytes in which PXR was knocked down using the hPXR-siRNA&#x02013;adenovirus expression system, Kojima <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) observed a reduction in the basal expression of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 mRNA levels.</p><p>Our studies did confirm that addition of rifampicin significantly increased the binding of PXR to the PXREs of CYP3A4, MDR1, UGT1A1 and CYP2B6. Interestingly, the fold increase of PXR binding to PXRE was several-fold higher for CYP3A4 than was observed for MDR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). This may explain why minimal induction of MDR1 was observed after treatment with rifampicin compared to CYP3A4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Also of interest was the finding that PXR binding to PXREs did not always significantly increase in the presence of rifampicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) which subsequently did not result in an increase in gene transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This phenomenon is difficult to explain and could be related to the fact that PXR binding to PXREs occurs in the absence of the ligand which could lead to saturation of PXREs on specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). It should also be noted that PXR binding to PXREs is not the only determinant of an increase in gene transcription but involves numerous corepressors and coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Using ChIP we identified CYP4F12 as having PXR-binding sites. We confirmed the involvement of PXR in the regulation of CYP4F12 by assessing its&#x02019; basal expression and inducibility in human hepatocytes in which PXR was knocked down. CYP4F12 mRNA has been detected in several major tissues involved in drug disposition including the liver, kidney and small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). It is the only member of the CYP4F family involved in xenobiotic metabolism. In particular, CYP4F12 has been shown to be highly efficient toward metabolism of antihistaminic compounds, such as ebastine and terfenadine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In addition to xenobiotics, CYP4F12 is also involved in the oxidation of arachadonic acid and stable prostaglandin H2 (PGH<sub>2</sub>) analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have highlighted the importance of the coactivator SRC-1 in PXR activation and the subsequent increase in gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Our studies confirmed that the SRC-1 binding pattern mirrors that observed with PXR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Similar to PXR, SRC-1 binding was increased after treatment of hepatocytes with rifampicin. This is in line with crystallographic studies which demonstrated that SRC-1 binds to PXR and stabilizes the PXR-LBD and together with the ligand exerts an additive effect on the stability of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Binding of SRC-1 to the surface of PXR limits the ability of the receptor to continuously change its conformation and helps trap a single, active conformation of the ligand.</p><p>In addition to SRC-1, several other PXR-coactivators and -corepressors have been implicated in PXR-mediated gene regulation. These include the coactivators GRIP1, PGC1&#x003b1;, FKHR and RIP140, and the corepressors SMRT and SHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Analysis of these coactivators and corepressors did, in most cases, show significant binding to the promoter elements of the target genes in the absence of rifampicin compared to the control Untr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Treatment of the hepatocytes with rifampicin did not result in a consistent increase in binding in the case of coactivators or decreased binding in the presence of corepressors. This may be related to our studies being conducted in human hepatocytes and not in a recombinant <italic>in vitro</italic> system. In comparison, studies by others were conducted in cell lines in which proteins were overexpressed and were outside their natural chromatin environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16">13&#x02013;16</xref>). Overall, however, our data suggests that binding of the coactivators and corepressors studied were involved in the regulation of gene expression as binding was higher than to the negative control and, with few exceptions, the overall pattern of binding to the various promoter elements studied were similar. An important point to consider is that all our analyses were done after treatment of hepatocytes with rifampicin and we cannot exclude that different binding behavior could be found in the presence of other PXR activators.</p><p>HNF4&#x003b1; has been shown to cooperate at the &#x02212;7.8 kb XREM in the PXR-dependent induction of CYP3A4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Even though HNF4&#x003b1; binding was detectable in the presence and absence of rifampicin, it was unexpected that we observed a decrease in binding of HNF4&#x003b1; in the presence of rifampicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The role of HNF4&#x003b1; in PXR-mediated gene activation is not clear as Li and Chiang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and Tegude <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) have shown that binding of HNF4&#x003b1; to the XREM-DR1 element is not required for gene activation of the CYP3A4 promoter. This was confirmed in a study by Kamiyama <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) in which HNF4&#x003b1; was knocked down using an adenovirus expressing system in human hepatocytes. They observed that hHNF4&#x003b1;-siRNA did not significantly affect the fold-induction of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 mRNA levels following treatment with CYP inducers, such as phenobarbital, rifampicin and dexamethasone. There is strong evidence, however, that HNF4&#x003b1; is involved in regulating basal expression of CYP3A4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, in cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes we identified several new genes containing PXR binding sites. We confirmed the involvement of PXR in the regulation of CYP4F12 using siRNA. We also found that the SRC-1 binding pattern is very similar to PXR and that both bind to promoter elements in the absence of ligand. Finally, we did not observe a pattern correlating with rifampicin treatment with respect to other PXR coactivators/corepressors involved in gene regulation in the presence of rifampicin.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
