However, unlike TAG synthesis that also occurs at high levels in liver for VLDL production, lipolysis for the provision of fatty acids (FAs) as an energy source for use by other organs is unique to adipocytes. The release of FA from TAG proceeds in an orderly and regulated manner. TAG is hydrolyzed first to form diacylglycerol (DAG) and then monoacylglycerol (MAG) that is hydrolyzed to liberate the final FA and glycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>We and others have recently identified a TAG lipase that belongs to the patatin-like domain-containing family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). We named this enzyme desnutrin (also called PNPLA2, adipose triglyceride lipase, TTS2.2, and iPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b6;) because it is induced during a low nutritional state in mice (i.e., fasting) and it belongs to the same patatin-like domain-containing family as another nutritionally regulated protein, adiponutrin. Desnutrin is highly expressed in adipose tissue but is also found at low levels in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Understanding the role of desnutrin in fat metabolism, specifically in adipose tissue, is of critical importance, because dysregulated adipocyte TAG lipolysis may cause elevated circulating FA concentrations that are associated with severe metabolic derangements, including the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Central to this understanding is the question of the metabolic fate of FAs derived from desnutrin-mediated TAG lipolysis, particularly when the release of these FAs is dissociated from the energy requirements of other organs.</p><p>FAs liberated from adipocyte TAG can enter several possible metabolic pathways. Primarily, they are released to the systemic circulation, providing oxidative substrates for use by other tissues during energy deprivation and therefore maintaining whole-body energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Alternatively, however, FAs hydrolyzed from TAG can also be used directly within the adipocyte in re-esterification reactions producing TAG or other lipid species or in oxidative metabolism. FA oxidation occurs in the mitochondria and peroxisomes. Although mitochondrial FA oxidation is normally tightly coupled to ATP synthesis, uncoupling of this process can result in energy wasting and heat production. Peroxisomal FA oxidation is always poorly coupled, generating heat instead of ATP.</p><p>To investigate the adipocyte-specific function of desnutrin and the metabolic fate of FAs released from lipolysis, we generated transgenic mice constitutively overexpressing desnutrin in adipose tissue and also used adenoviral-mediated overexpression of desnutrin in differentiated 3T3-L1CAR&#x00394;1 adipocytes. We report that desnutrin-mediated lipolysis attenuates diet-induced obesity and, surprisingly, does not result in ectopic TAG storage or increased serum nonesterified FA (NEFA) levels. Rather, desnutrin overexpression increases apparent cycling between TAG and DAG (and/or MAG) in adipose tissue and promotes FA oxidation specifically within adipocytes. As a result, aP2-desnutrin mice are leaner and resistant to diet-induced obesity with improved insulin sensitivity.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Transgene construct and generation and maintenance of transgenic mice.</title><p>The 1.7 kb coding sequence for hemagluttinin (HA)-tagged desnutrin, including a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence, was subcloned under control of the 5.4-kb adipocyte FA-binding protein (aP2) promoter and microinjected into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 &#x000d7; CBA mice. aP2-desnutrin mice and their wild-type littermates were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (45 kcal% fat, 35 kcal% carbohydrate, and 20 kcal% protein; Research Diets) ad libitum at weaning.

Results reported here are a comparison between mice from the founder line with the highest desnutrin transgene expression and their littermates. Similar results were obtained from an additional founder line (data not shown). RT-PCR analysis indicated that expression of the transgene was limited to WAT and brown adipose tissue (BAT) and was not detected in any other tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Desnutrin was expressed 4.8-fold and 3.4-fold above endogenous levels in gonadal WAT and BAT, respectively, as analyzed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>).

The net in vivo lipolytic rate over 2 weeks, which represents the complete turnover of TAG to glycerol and FA, was elevated in adipose tissue from aP2-desnutrin mice. Findings were also consistent with increased re-esterification of DAG (and/or MAG) to TAG predominantly with newly synthesized FAs and suggested that although desnutrin overexpression increased the hydrolysis of TAG to DAG, a major fate of that DAG was retention within adipocytes. This finding also suggests that TAG lipolysis to DAG occurred at an even greater rate than that which is apparent from measures of the complete hydrolysis of TAG to free glycerol.</p><p>Despite the marked increase in lipolysis in adipose tissue of aP2-desnutrin mice, serum NEFA levels were not increased. FA levels in the blood represent a balance between liberation from adipose tissue and uptake by peripheral tissues, and therefore a number of factors may play a role in regulating serum NEFA concentrations. Net FA liberation is likely lower than expected in aP2-desnutrin mice, because adipose tissue mass is substantially reduced compared with wild-type mice. Increased removal of FA from the bloodstream by other organs may also have contributed, although TAG content was not increased in any tissues measured and was, in fact, significantly decreased in livers of aP2-desnutrin mice. Results from our heavy water labeling study suggest that, at least in part, increased re-esterification may have limited the release of FAs from adipose tissue in vivo. However, because re-esterification appeared to involve the incorporation of newly synthesized FAs to a greater extent than pre-existing fatty acids, and because aP2-desnutrin mice had reduced adipose TAG content, increased loss of the hydrolyzed FA from adipose tissue was also indicated. Although there was no change in oxidative gene expression in skeletal muscle or liver, there was a substantial upregulation in aP2-desnutrin WAT of genes involved in mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation such as CPT-1&#x003b2;; in peroxisomal &#x003b1;-oxidation such as AOx, PhyH, and catalase; and in thermogenesis such as PPAR&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b4;, and PGC-1&#x003b1;. The most striking change was a 7.1-fold upregulation of UCP-1 expression. Measurement of FA oxidation by adipocytes isolated from aP2-desnutrin mice indicated a marked increase compared with their wild-type littermates and confirmed increased use of FAs directly within adipose tissue. Notably, UCP-1 induction results in increased heat production at the expense of ATP synthesis, as does peroxisomal FA &#x003b1;-oxidation, and aP2-desnutrin mice had significantly higher body temperatures over the course of the day, corresponding to a significantly higher rate of oxygen consumption. Taken together, our findings indicate that increased thermogenesis resulting from oxidation of hydrolyzed FAs within adipose tissue of aP2-desnutrin mice contributed to the leaner phenotype and, at least in part, to the absence of a rise in serum NEFA in these mice.</p><p>Although the present study is the first to demonstrate regulation of FA oxidation after overexpression of a TAG lipase, others have suggested that increased oxidation in adipocytes may contribute to protection against the development of diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). For example, overexpression of UCP-1 in WAT of mice has been shown to increase respiratory uncoupling specifically in WAT, resulting in a leaner phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and hyperleptinemia in rats was found to increase WAT UCP-1 and adipocyte FA oxidation, resulting in dramatic fat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Perilipin null mice also have elevated adipocyte FA oxidation and a leaner phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). These studies support our finding of leanness in aP2-desnutrin mice that have increased UCP-1 expression and adipocyte FA oxidation.</p><p>In association with their leaner phenotype, aP2-desnutrin mice demonstrate improved insulin sensitivity in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamping studies attributable primarily to increased insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake and suppression of hepatic glucose production. Decreased liver TAG content may have contributed to the improved hepatic insulin sensitivity in these mice. Despite abundant evidence of increased lipolysis in aP2-desnutrin mice, circulating NEFA levels were unchanged and therefore cannot be a factor in mediating changes in insulin sensitivity. Adiponectin and leptin levels, which are associated with insulin sensitivity, were also unchanged in these mice. Thus, our aP2-desnutrin mice represent a new model in which a long-term increase in adipocyte lipolysis results in metabolic adaptations, including increased FA oxidation, leanness, and improved insulin sensitivity. In this regard, mice overexpressing UCP-1 in adipose tissue also exhibit leanness and increased adipocyte FA oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), as well as an unexplained improvement in insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Given the similarities of the two models, it is possible that investigation of yet to be identified factors linking increased energy use in WAT to insulin sensitivity may provide new insight into understanding obesity/diabetes.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that, by increasing lipolysis, overexpression of desnutrin in adipose tissue causes reduced adipocyte TAG content and attenuation of diet-induced obesity, at least in part, by promoting FA oxidation and re-esterification within adipocytes. Overexpression of desnutrin in adipocytes also causes improved insulin responsiveness resulting from increased peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity that occurs independent of changes in circulating NEFA levels.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.
