It binds specifically to its receptor, which is composed of a cytokine-specific &#x003b1;-chain (GM-CSF receptor &#x003b1;-chain, GMR&#x003b1;) and a &#x003b2;-chain shared with the receptors for interleukin-3 and interleukin-5. In this report, we present a comprehensive study of GMR&#x003b1; in the mouse. We have found that the mouse GMR&#x003b1; is polymorphic and alternatively spliced. In the absence of specific antibodies, we generated a novel chimeric protein containing the Fc fragment of human IgG1 coupled to mouse GM-CSF, which was able to specifically bind to GMR&#x003b1; and induce proliferation of GMR&#x003b1;-transduced Ba/F3 cells. We used this reagent to perform the first detailed FACS study of the surface expression of mouse GMR&#x003b1; by leucocytes. Highest expression was found on monocytes and granulocytes, and variable expression on tissue macrophages. The GM-CSF receptor in mice is specifically expressed by myeloid cells and is useful for the detection of novel uncharacterised myeloid populations. The ability to detect GM-CSF receptor expression in experimental studies should greatly facilitate the analysis of its role in immune pathologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>Cytokines</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Macrophages</kwd><kwd>Neutrophils</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was first isolated from mouse lung cell-conditioned media as a small glycoprotein (24&#x02013;33 kDa) able to generate both macrophage and granulocyte colonies from mouse bone marrow precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. However, a variety of studies have shown other relevant functions including its capacity to enhance host defense mechanisms against bacterial and fungal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>], its contribution to dendritic cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>], and its involvement in the catabolism of pulmonary surfactant to maintain homeostasis in the alveoli of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. GM-CSF can modulate effector functions not only on myeloid cells but also on other cell types expressing the GM-CSF receptor including type II alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>], CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>], uterine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>], vascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>] and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>].</p><p>GM-CSF binds specifically to its receptor, which is composed of a cytokine-specific &#x003b1;-chain (GM-CSF receptor &#x003b1; chain, GMR&#x003b1;) and &#x003b2;-chain (&#x003b2;c), which is shared with the receptors for interleukin (IL)-3 and IL-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. It associates with GMR&#x003b1; with low affinity and rapid dissociation kinetics, but the formation of the &#x003b1;&#x003b2; heterodimeric complex mediates a stable interaction with high affinity and slow dissociation kinetics. Besides enhancing cytokine binding, the &#x003b2;c plays a key role in signal transduction, which can also be modulated by IL-3 and IL-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>] In the mouse, there are two homologous &#x003b2;c, AIC2A and AIC2B. IL-3 can induce the formation of the &#x003b1;&#x003b2; complex using either AIC2A or AIC2B, but only AIC2B is able to create the &#x003b1;&#x003b2; complex for GM-CSF and IL-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>].</p><p>Molecular cloning of the mouse GMR&#x003b1; cDNA revealed a single transmembrane polypeptide of 387 amino acids with relatively low homology to its human counterpart (less than 35%). It is a type I membrane protein subdivided into three regions: an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain shares conserved structural features of the cytokine receptor superfamily containing three fibronectin type III (FN-III)-like domains, four cysteine residues involved in heterodimerization of the receptor, and an imperfect WSXWS box (WGEWS), which is required for protein folding and cell surface receptor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>]. The cytoplasmic domain is short and characterised by the presence of a highly conserved proline-rich domain (PPXP), which is adjacent to the plasma membrane and involved in signal transduction (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]).</p><p>Several studies on the human GMR&#x003b1; have demonstrated that as consequence of alternative splicing or metalloproteinase activity, GMR&#x003b1; loses its tramsmembrane domain resulting in a soluble isoform, which is able to antagonise GM-CSF binding and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. However, alternatively spliced isoforms of the murine receptor have not been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>].</p><p>In spite of the obvious importance of GM-CSF and the wide use of mice in immunological studies there are no useful reagents for the detection of the mouse GMR&#x003b1; or extensive studies of its expression and function. In this report, we present a comprehensive study of GMR&#x003b1; in the mouse. We have found that the mouse GMR&#x003b1; is polymorphic and alternatively spliced. Due to the restricted availability of specific antibodies against the extracellular domain of GMR&#x003b1;, we coupled the mouse GM-CSF to the Fc fragment derived from human IgG (GM-Fc) to characterise surface expression of the mouse GMR&#x003b1; on distinct leucocyte populations. GM-Fc is able to bind and activate the receptor, and thereby, provides a novel way to examine the regulation and expression of GMR&#x003b1; during steady state and immunological challenge.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The mouse GM-CSF receptor is alternatively spliced and polymorphic</title><p>Early studies on the characterisation of the murine GMR&#x003b1; failed to detect alternatively spliced isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>] but a soluble receptor able to block GM-CSF function has been identified for the human counterpart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. Using cDNA from bone marrow cells, we identified full-length transcripts with open reading frame of 1167 bp (388 amino acids) for Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice, which are polymorphic at amino acid residue 227 (Asp and Gly, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). We also found alternative splice forms in C57BL/6: a deletion isoform (&#x025b5;223&#x02013;247), which lacks part of the FN-III domain, and a truncated isoform that would be predicted to be soluble due to the absence of a transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). These sequences have been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers: EF114317 and EF114318).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Characterisation of GMR&#x003b1; in the mouse model.

The deletion isoform appears to be created by skipping of the splice acceptor of exon 6 and aberrant splicing into the coding sequence of exon 6.

We cultured Ba/F3 cells (transduced with empty vector or GMR&#x003b1;-encoding vectors) in the presence of IL-3 or GM-CSF, and assessed cell proliferation daily by determining the percentage of reduction of Alamarblue, an oxidation-reduction indicator that changes color in response to metabolic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>].</p><p>We found that empty vector-transduced control cells (Ba/F3:pFB), like untransduced Ba/F3 cells (data not shown), proliferated only in the presence of IL-3, but GMR&#x003b1;-transduced Ba/F3 cells (Ba/F3:GMR&#x003b1;) could proliferate in either IL-3 or GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). Using these conditions, we were able to detect significant proliferation of Ba/F3:GMR&#x003b1; after 5 days in culture with a concentration of GM-CSF as low as 0.032 ng/mL. Since we did not have a reagent to monitor expression of the polymorphic forms of GMR&#x003b1;, we calculated a ratio of proliferation to compare the functional activity of the polymorphic variants of GMR&#x003b1; in response to both GM-CSF and IL-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). We found a similar proliferation ratio for both polymorphic forms of GMR&#x003b1;, indicating that the polymorphism does not affect responsiveness of the cell to GM-CSF.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Functionality of polymorphic forms of GMR&#x003b1;.

Population 1 exhibits the classic F4/80<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>high</sup> phenotype of resident peritoneal macrophages.

The peritoneal cavity contains a variety of immune cells, which have traditionally been considered as the first line of defence against invasion of micro-organisms in the peritoneum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. We used GM-Fc to identify GMR&#x003b1;-expressing cells in the resting peritoneal cavity, and the positive population was further analysed by expression of the additional myeloid markers F4/80 and CD11b. The peritoneal GMR&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells corresponded predominantly to lymphocytes, mainly B cells (data not shown).</p><p>We were able to clearly differentiate three distinct populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7C</xref>). The most common population representing about 30&#x02013;40% of peritoneal cells had the classic phenotype of resident peritoneal macrophages (CD11b<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>high</sup>, population 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7C</xref>). A sparse population, which expressed moderate levels of both CD11b and F4/80, had high SSC and shared additional markers with eosinophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7C</xref> and data not shown). Most interesting was the identification of an apparently novel cell type, which represented between 1 and 5% of the peritoneal cells depending on mouse strain and had a CD11b<sup>high</sup>, but F4/80<sup>low</sup> phenotype. We subsequently purified and began the functional characterisation of these cells. They express high levels of MHC class II and can present antigen to ovalbumin-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from naive DO11.10 mice indicative of a dendritic cell-like phenotype (Dioszeghy <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The structure and function of the human GMR&#x003b1; has been broadly investigated, and several studies using mice lacking either GM-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>] or the &#x003b2;c of its receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>], as well as administration of GM-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>] or neutralising antibodies against the cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>] have been used in models of disease. However, fundamental knowledge about the nature of expression and function of the mouse GMR&#x003b1; is lacking.</p><p>In this study, we cloned GMR&#x003b1;-coding sequences from Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice. We found that mouse GMR&#x003b1; is polymorphic at amino acid residue 227 (Asp and Gly, respectively) and alternatively spliced. As well as amplifying full-length clones, we identified two alternatively spliced isoforms that have not been previously described. These alternatively spliced isoforms were expressed in bone marrow cells, where the predominant expression of GMR&#x003b1; is by neutrophils and monocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We retrovirally transduced the IL-3-dependent AIC2A/AIC2B-expressing Ba/F3 cell line with the full-length GMR&#x003b1; clones from Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice. The Ba/F3:GMR&#x003b1; cells were able to proliferate in response to GM-CSF, unlike the control vector-transduced cells, and comparative analysis of the responses to cell lines to IL-3 and GM-CSF indicated that the polymorphism did not significantly affect receptor function. Apart from the polymorphic residue mentioned above, our sequences were identical to the published cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>].</p><p>Since there are no commercial reagents for the detection of mouse GMR&#x003b1; at the cell surface, we designed a chimeric protein (GM-Fc) which had mouse GM-CSF fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). GM-Fc bound specifically to GMR&#x003b1;-transduced Ba/F3, but not control transduced cells, confirming its specificity as a receptor-detecting reagent. However, GM-Fc was not suitable for immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of GMR&#x003b1; in fixed tissue sections, most likely because of the need for heterodimeric receptor for high-affinity binding. GM-Fc was also able to support the proliferation of the GMR&#x003b1;-transduced Ba/F3 cells, indicating that the reagent functioned in a comparable way to the natural cytokine making possible its implementation in functional studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. GM-Fc was thus a specific and sensitive immunological tool to study the expression of the murine GMR&#x003b1; on a variety of cell types.</p><p>One of the mouse GMR&#x003b1; isoforms lacked the transmembrane region (truncated isoform, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), which by analogy to the human receptor isoforms could be secreted into the extracellular environment as a soluble receptor capable of antagonizing receptor functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. Consistent with this we were unable to detect this isoform on the surface of transduced cells with GM-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>). The second isoform contained a deletion (&#x025b5;223&#x02013;247) within the FN-III domain, but had an intact transmembrane domain and would be predicted to be expressed at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). We were unable to detect GM-Fc binding on cells transduced to express this isoform, suggesting that it was incapable of cytokine binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>). The biological relevance of these isoforms remains to be established but they could be significant in the regulation of GMR&#x003b1; expression and in the study of diseases associated with deficiency of GM-CSF:GM-CSF receptor, such as pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>].</p><p>We have used GM-Fc for the first sensitive assessment of the surface expression of GMR&#x003b1; on primary leucocytes derived from different mouse tissues. Similarly to human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>], macrophages [alveolar and peritoneal, both resident and inflammatory (thioglycollate- or biogel-elicited)], were the highest GMR&#x003b1;- expressing cells followed by both Gr-1<sup>+</sup> and Gr-1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> monocytes (from blood, spleen and bone marrow). Neutrophils and eosinophils (from blood, spleen, bone marrow and peritoneal lavage) as well as circulating basophils expressed reasonable levels of GMR&#x003b1; but less than those expressed by macrophages or dendritic cells. Lymphoid cells (B cells, T cells and NK cells) derived from blood, spleen and bone marrow did not express GMR&#x003b1;. In the same way, human lymphocytes (B cells, T cells and NK cells) do not express GMR&#x003b1; but its presence has been demonstrated in some malignancies like the hairy-cell leukaemia, breast and lung carcinomas as well as on several hemopoietic cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>]. These data are also consistent with studies on hematopoietic commitment and differentiation, which have revealed that GMR&#x003b1; expression contributes to the development of myeloid cells while its expression impacts negatively on the lymphoid lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>].</p><p>We were unable to detect expression on non-hemopoietic cell lines such as b.END-3, NIH3T3 and, perhaps more interestingly given the role of GM-CSF in the lung homeostasis, LA-4 respiratory epithelial cells (data not shown). We extended these studies by applying GM-Fc to the study of the macrophage inflammatory response by determining changes in the surface expression of GMR&#x003b1; in response to microbial stimuli. The Toll-like receptor agonists Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub>, flagellin, zymosan and LPS all induced an up-regulation of GMR&#x003b1; surface expression, validating the use of GM-Fc as a sensitive way to monitor the regulation of GMR&#x003b1; expression by immune cells.</p><p>We were interested in the resident cells dwelling in the peritoneal cavity, which are thought to be essential in the local defensive response against infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. The peritoneal cavity has been extensively exploited to study inflammation but the resident myeloid cells have not been well characterised. We defined three populations of GMR&#x003b1;-expressing cells in the peritoneal cavity by their CD11b and F4/80 profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7C</xref>). The major population, representing 30&#x02013;40% of the normal peritoneal cells, had the classic phenotype of peritoneal macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. We also identified a second population (CD11b<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>low</sup>), not previously described, which after further functional analysis appears to comprise dendritic-like cells, as determined by the expression of MHC class II and ability to present antigen to naive T cells (Dioszeghy <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation). Several studies have suggested the presence of dendritic cells in the peritoneal cavity but they have demonstrated a capacity to demonstrate antigen only after <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>]. The third and rarest population shared an antigen phenotype with eosinophils (data not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, this characterisation of the mouse GMR&#x003b1; as well as its expression on leukocytes from different tissues provides fundamental information that can be applied to many immunological studies. The receptor is polymorphic and importantly alternatively spliced, indicating that the regulation of its function in mouse models of disease may be as complex as its human counterpart. In the absence of antibodies, GM-Fc provides a sensitive and specific tool for the study of murine GMR&#x003b1; and its regulation during immunological challenge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice and reagents</title><p>Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from our own breeding colonies, kept and handled in accordance with institutional and UK Home Office guidelines.

After this time, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% heat-inactivated rabbit serum, 0.5% BSA and 2 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>) for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were stained <italic>in situ</italic> using GM-Fc or control-Fc (as described above). After staining, the cells were lifted with a scraper and transferred to a FACS tube in 1% formaldehyde. FACS acquisition and analysis were performed as indicated above. The data from four independent experiments were analysed for statistically significant differences by one-way repeated measures ANOVA test with Dunnett's multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the binding of GM-Fc to GMR&#x003b1; isoforms</title><p>For analysis of the binding efficiency of GM-Fc to the polymorphic variants of GMR&#x003b1;, a range of concentrations of GM-Fc were incubated with GMR&#x003b1;-transduced Ba/F3 cells for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The cells were washed and the bound protein was detected as described above using anti-human-allophycocyanin and flow cytometry. Specific binding was determined by subtraction of the non-specific binding of GM-Fc to control pFBneo-transduced Ba/F3 cells. Binding data were analysed by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the staff of our animal facility for the care of the animals used in this study.
