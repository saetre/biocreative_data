To determine whether this effect was conserved between zebrafish and human cells, and to address this phenotype at the molecular level, we investigated the role of EWSR1 in Hela cells. These studies were facilitated by a number of antibodies to the human mitotic components. EWSR1 localized to the nucleus in non-mitotic Hela cells, and to the entire cell during mitosis when the nuclear envelope breaks down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000979-g008">Figure 8 A</xref>). This observation is consistent with a role for EWSR1 in mitosis. To address the detailed molecular events in mitosis, we utilized EWSR1 siRNA. Hela cells were transfected with EWSR1 siRNA or control siRNA and analyzed by western blotting. The EWSR1 siRNA transfected cells exhibited marked reduction of the EWSR1 protein level compared to cells transfected with control siRNA or untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000979-g008">Figure 8 B</xref>, top panel). To determine whether the mitotic defect phenotype observed in Ewsr1 knockdown zebrafish embryos was conserved in human cells, mitotic spindles in Hela cells were visualized by anti-&#x003b1; tubulin staining. The EWSR1 siRNA transfected Hela cells exhibited a significantly higher incidence of abnormal spindles (30&#x00025;), including multipolar spindles, compared to untransfected (4&#x00025;) and control siRNA transfected Hela cells (4&#x00025;) (N&#x0003e;50 mitotic cells).

This is especially important for analysis of <italic>ewsr1</italic> gene function since gene targeting of EWSR1 in the mouse resulted in an unexplained early post-natal lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000979-Li1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. To analyze the role of the <italic>ewsr1</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic> during zebrafish embryonic development, we isolated two <italic>ewsr1</italic> zebrafish homologs, <italic>ewsr1a</italic> and <italic>ewsr1b,</italic> and demonstrated that both zebrafish <italic>ewsr1</italic> genes were expressed maternally, and continued to be expressed ubiquitously during early development. MO knockdown of either <italic>ewsr1</italic> gene led to P53-mediated apoptosis in the brain and the spinal cord at the mid-somite stage, indicating that the Ewsr1 proteins are required for cell survival in the CNS. There were increased numbers of aberrant mitotic spindles prior to the apoptotic cell death, suggesting that the <italic>ewsr1</italic> genes are necessary for proper mitotic spindle integrity, which in turn is required for cell survival.</p><p>Despite ubiquitous expression of <italic>ewsr1a</italic> and <italic>ewsr1b</italic> at the mRNA level, MO knockdown experiments of each zebrafish <italic>ewsr1</italic> gene leads to defects in the brain and spinal cord. However, silencing of EWSR1 in Hela cells leads to mitotic defects, suggesting that the mitotic defect caused by silencing of EWSR1 is not limited to the CNS cells. It is possible that apoptosis occurs first in CNS cells followed by non-CNS cells. It is unknown why the CNS cells are prone to apoptosis by Ewsr1 knockdown. One possibility may be the interaction between the Ewsr1 and a neuronal specific factor. In this regard, EWSR1 has been reported to activate the promoter of the neuronal specific POU transcription factor Brn-3a through the formation of a heterodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000979-Gascoyne1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000979-Ensor1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000979-Smith1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Bcl-2 is also required for cell survival.

This altered cell alignment may cause differentiation defects in neuronal tissues. During the gastrula and neurula stages in zebrafish embryos, the orientation of cell division is tightly regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000979-Concha1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. At these stages, the embryo is dramatically increasing its size through increasing cell number, and is organizing these cells by dynamic cell movements. The orientation of the cell division plane defines the location of daughter cells after each cell division, and this orientation is determined by the orientation of the spindles. For example, dividing cells are oriented in parallel to the neuroepithelium plane, while cell divisions in the neural keel are perpendicular due to a 90&#x000b0; rotation of the mitotic spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000979-GeldmacherVoss1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In Ewsr1 knockdown embryos, we observed an increased number of aberrant spindles including aneuploidy, tetraploidy and abnormal spindle structure at the bud stage, a time immediately after the three germ cell layers are specified. The aberrant spindle assembly may also affect the position of the daughter cells, and ultimately affect its cell organization and differentiation in tissues. Thus, it is possible that the disorganization of the neuronal network in the <italic>ewsr1</italic> knockdown embryos is derived from disorganized spindles.</p><p>We demonstrated mislocalization of the Aurora B kinase in EWSR1 siRNA transfected Hela cells.

Mislocalization of Aurora B may lead to defects in checkpoint function during mitosis. Currently, it is unknown whether EWSR1 is influencing Aurora B localization directly or indirectly. It is possible that the mitotic defect is triggered by DNA pairing or repair/recombination defects in EWSR1 deficient cells as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000979-Li1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In future studies, it will be important to examine the influence of EWSR1 on Aurora B localization at the molecular level.</p><p>In EWSR1 fusion gene expressing sarcomas, one <italic>EWSR1</italic> allele is disrupted as a result of chromosomal translocation. If this loss results in haploinsufficiency, this may lead to mitotic defects and genomic instability such as we have demonstrated in zebrafish embryos and human cells.
