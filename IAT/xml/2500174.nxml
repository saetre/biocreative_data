This observation raises the intriguingly possibility of yet unexplored direct molecular links between cell-cell contact regulators and cells that specifically retain pluripotency. Investigation of such a mechanism may illuminate our understanding of how cells develop multicellular communication systems during early embryogenesis. This in turn may lead to the developing new technologies for engineering the basic growth nature of pluripotent stem cells.</p><p>Rho family GTPases are the intracellular signal processors that convert the signaling input into mechanical forces essential for the regulation of cell-cell adhesion, polarity, mitosis, and migration, functions conserved from primitive amoeba to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003001-Jaffe1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003001-Fukata1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The most studied Rho family members include Cdc42, Rac, and Rho. Biochemically they are characterized by the Rho GTPase domain cycling between the GTP-bound active form and the GDP-bound inactive form. As only the active form can signal to the downstream pathways, they are considered the molecular switch that spatiotemporally integrates actin cytoskeletons and molecular motors.

Strikingly, mES cells treated with C3 exoenzyme demonstrated a remarkable decrease in cell-cell contact as compared with control cells and showed long tail-like cytoplasmic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003001-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar results were obtained from three independent mES lines (data not shown). To clarify the state of cell-cell contact at a high resolution, ultrastructural analysis was conducted. Cells grown under the control condition established multilayered integrated cell assemblies with large areas of physical cell contacts. Cells especially in the outer layer of the colony were mutually interconnected by specialized junctional complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003001-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

In order to identify which pathway downstream of Rho is responsible for this cell phenotype, we used short interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. Robust transfection efficiency, a prerequisite to address the direct effect of siRNA at the individual cell level, was confirmed by using a control siRNA carrying green fluorophore (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003001.s005">Figure S2</xref>). mES cells transfected with siRNAs targeting both Rock I and Rock II isoforms exhibited striking cell-cell disintegration comparable to that seen in C3 toxin-treated cells whereas cells transfected with both Dia1 and Dia2-targeting siRNA showed only weak effects on cell-cell contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003001-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The efficiency of each siRNA was verified by QPCR or Western analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003001.s005">Figure S2</xref>). These results indicate that in mES cells, Rock plays a major role in cell-cell adhesion downstream of Rho which contrasts with the essential role of Dia rather than Rock in non-pluripotent cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003001-Sahai1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003001-Carramusa1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to manipulate the Rock activity throughout the experimental period in a consistent manner, we decided to use a chemical compound, Y27632, which specifically blocks the Rock activity at low concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003001-Riento1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. mES cells treated with Y27632 at different concentrations showed substantially decreased cell-cell integrity, which precisely emulated the phenotype seen in the cells treated with Rock-specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003001-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), also verified by the ultrastructural analysis (data not shown).

The reduction of the endogenous Rock activity in the compound-treated cells was determined by the Rho-kinase assay method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003001-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). In order to capture the dynamic transition of cell-cell contact states, time-lapse microscopic analysis was conducted. It was prevailed that the tightly integrated cells in colonies disassembled their intercellular connections while unlocking their concealed motile nature, suggesting that Rho-Rock signaling may also regulate cell motility besides physical cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003001-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003001.s006">S3A</xref>, and data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Myosin II is the predominant effector downstream of Rock that mediates cell-cell adhesion</title><p>Cell-cell contact is directly regulated by various types of adhesion molecules and interconnected cytoskeletal machineries including myosin, ATP-driven molecular motors, which also determines cell architectures and polarized cell functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003001-Gumbiner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003001-Nelson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Myosin II, the two-headed conventional myosin, consists of three isoforms, IIA, IIB, and IIC, of which all, except IIC, are expressed in ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003001.s005">Figure S2</xref> and data not shown) whereas differentiated cells express all three isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003001-Ivanov1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Strikingly when myosin IIA and IIB isoforms were simultaneously depleted, cells showed remarkable disintegration of the cell-cell contact phenocopying that was seen in cells with loss of function of Rho or Rock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003001-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In order to clarify that the myosin activity on cell adhesion is under the Rock regulation at the functional level, we focused on myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), one of the major downstream targets of Rock that negatively regulates myosin function through dephosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003001-Kimura1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Rock phosphorylates and inactivates MYPT1 to protect the phosphorylated, active form of MRLC that drives myosin II function. MYPT1 was found to be exclusively localized to cell-cell contact sites in mES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003001-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). If Rock controls the myosin function through inhibition of MYPT1 in mES cells, depletion of MYPT1 would rescue the intrinsic cell-cell communications from the robust effect of the Rock inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003001-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, depletion of MYPT1 before or after the inhibitor treatment resulted in significant protection or restoration of cell-cell contact, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003001-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

Virtually almost all cells incorporated fluorophore-tagged siRNA. Inset denotes the phase contrast image.
