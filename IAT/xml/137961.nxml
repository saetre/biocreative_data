In yeast mitochondria the hSUV3 orthologue is a component of the degradosome complex and participates in mtRNA turnover and processing, while in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> the hSUV3 orthologue is necessary for viability of early embryos. Using immunofluorescence analysis, an <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial uptake assay and sub-fractionation of human mitochondria we show hSuv3p to be a soluble protein localised in the mitochondrial matrix. We expressed and purified recombinant hSuv3p protein from a bacterial expression system. The purified enzyme was capable of hydrolysing ATP with a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 41.9 &#x000b5;M and the activity was only modestly stimulated by polynucleotides. hSuv3p unwound partly hybridised dsRNA and dsDNA structures with a very strong preference for the latter. The presented analysis of the hSuv3p NTPase&#x0002f;helicase suggests that new functions of the protein have been acquired in the course of evolution.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Our research is focused on the structure and function of human hSuv3p protein belonging to the class of putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases from the DExH-box family. Sequence database analyses imply that Suv3p is encoded by a very ancient gene and highly conserved during evolution. Orthologues have been found in, for example, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the hSUV3 orthologue encodes a subunit of the yeast mitochondrial degradosome (also known as mtEXO), which exhibits 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exoribonuclease activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c1">1</xref>). The degradosome complex consists of two proteins encoded by nuclear genes and is imported into mitochondria from the cytosol: the DSS1 gene codes for a protein with domains characteristic for RNase II activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c2">2</xref>) while the SUV3 gene encodes a protein with a putative RNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c3">3</xref>). The SUV3 null mutant lacks mtEXO RNase activity, which leads to abnormal phenotypes associated with RNA metabolism, including accumulation of excised group I introns, instability of intron-containing and intronless mitochondrial transcripts and aberrant processing of the precursors of the mitochondrial transcripts. Therefore, SUV3 knock-out strains are respiratory incompetent, show no mitochondrial translation and their mitochondrial genomes are quickly lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c6">6</xref>).</p><p>Our recent data indicate that the yeast mitochondrial degradosome is associated with mitochondrial ribosomes and that RNA helicase activity of the complex precedes the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exoribonucleolytic activity. The physiological function of the degradosome is not intron-related, the complex ensures proper turnover of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) and is involved in mtRNA surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c7">7</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>A.thaliana</italic> the AtSuv3p protein has a predicted molecular weight of 63.6 kDa. Subcellular fractionation experiments with transgenic plants allowed localisation of AtSuv3p to mitochondria. The N-terminal domain of AtSuv3p contains the motifs characteristic of RNA helicases and exhibits a low endogenous ATPase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> which can be stimulated by the presence of mtRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c8">8</xref>). In <italic>C.elegans</italic> the activity of the SUV3 orthologue was found to be necessary for survival of early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Previously we cloned and initially characterised the cDNA of the human orthologue of SUV3. The gene was named SUPV3L1 and herein is referred to as hSUV3. We assigned hSUV3 to human chromosome band 10q22.1 by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c10">10</xref>). Sequence analysis showed that the hSuv3p protein possesses a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence. The human gene is expressed in all tissues analysed. The highest levels of expression were found in liver and the lowest in lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c11">11</xref>).</p><p>In this paper we present more detailed studies on human hSuv3p. The protein was found to differ significantly from its yeast orthologue Suv3p. Using immunofluorescence, an <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial uptake assay and sub-fractionation of human mitochondria we show that hSuv3p is localised in the mitochondrial matrix and is not membrane bound, as in yeast. Unexpectedly, enzymatic studies revealed that hSuv3p, in addition to its previously predicted RNA helicase activity, has much stronger DNA unwinding activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>DNA oligonucleotides were synthesised by Dr M.

Fragments of the hSUV3 cDNA encoding the full-length hSuv3p protein (2358 bp, 786 amino acids) or the form lacking the predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence (2304 bp, 768 amino acids), respectively, were PCR amplified using the forward primer 5&#x02032;-GCA <underline>TCT AGA</underline> CAC GAT GGC CTT CTC CCG TGC CCT ATT GTG G-3&#x02032; (for pchSUV3myc) or 5&#x02032;-CTA G<underline>TC TAG A</underline>AT GGG CCA CCG GGC AGC CAT CTG C-3&#x02032; (for pc&#x00394;mthSUV3myc), both introducing a <italic>Xba</italic>I site (underlined).

Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as follows. Twenty-four hours after transfection Mitotracker CMX-Ros (300 nM) was added to the medium and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4&#x00025; formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 20&#x000b0;C and then permeabilised with 1&#x00025; Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were then incubated with anti-hSuv3p serum (diluted 1:200 in PBS with 10&#x00025; FCS) (see below) for 1 h, washed in PBS and the bound antibody was detected with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) (Molecular Probes). Specimens were examined using a MRC Bio-Rad confocal microscope.</p><p>In order to determine the subcellular localisation of the overexpressed hSuv3p protein HeLa or COS-1 cells were plated as described above and transiently transfected with pchSUV3myc or pc&#x00394;mthSUV3myc using FuGene6 reagent (Roche). Detection of the protein was performed as described above using anti-c-myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) (Molecular Probes).</p></sec><sec><title>Import of hSuv3p into isolated mitochondria</title><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> import assay was performed essentially as described by Tokatlidis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c12">12</xref>). Briefly, yeast mitochondria (100 &#x000b5;g protein) were incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-labelled proteins (synthesised <italic>in vitro</italic> using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system; Promega) for 15 min at 30&#x000b0;C in 200 &#x000b5;l of import buffer (IB) containing 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, 1.2 M sorbitol, 4 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 100 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM <sc>l</sc>-methionine and 2 mg&#x0002f;ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin supplemented with 5 mM NADH. Mitochondria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 &#x000b5;l of IB supplemented with 0.1 mg&#x0002f;ml trypsin and incubated on ice. After 30 min trypsin was inhibited by addition of soy bean trypsin inhibitor to a concentration of 0.2 mg&#x0002f;ml and incubation for 15 min on ice. In order to generate mitoplasts by hypotonic swelling, mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 30 &#x000b5;l of IB, diluted with 210 &#x000b5;l of 20 mM HEPES&#x02013;KOH, pH 7.4, and incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation mitoplasts were precipitated from the supernatant with TCA and resuspended in 100 &#x000b5;l of IB containing 30 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml proteinase K. After 15 min incubation on ice proteinase K was inhibited by incubating with 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl flouride (PMSF) for 10 min on ice. For alkali extraction, mitoplasts were sedimented by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 &#x000b5;l of 100 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mM PMSF (ice-cold) and incubated for 30 min on ice. The supernatant (matrix) and the pellet (membranes) were separated by centrifugation at 70 000 r.p.m. (TL100) for 30 min. The matrix proteins were TCA precipitated and all the fractions were resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and visualised by autoradiography (Fuji Bas Station v.1.3). Subsequently the blots were analysed using antibodies specific to endogenous yeast mitochondrial proteins: anti-porin for the outer membrane, anti-mtHsp70p for the matrix and anti-Cytb<sub>2</sub> for the inter membrane space. These antibodies were prepared against purified yeast mitochondrial proteins and originated from the laboratory collection of Dr G. Schatz (also available in the laboratory of K. Tokatlidis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c13">13</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and fractionation of mitochondria from HeLa cells</title><p>Mitochondria were isolated as described by Gaines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c14">14</xref>) with the following modifications. Briefly, exponentially growing HeLa cells (conditions as described above) were trypsinised, washed twice in PBS and then twice with the washing buffer (1 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.0, 0.13 M NaCl, 5 mM KCl and 7.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). The cell pellet (&#x0223c;1.5 ml) was resuspended in 0.75 ml of 0.1&#x000d7; IB (4 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and homogenised using a Potter homogeniser. The homogenate was immediately mixed with 0.17 ml of 10&#x000d7; IB. The unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by three consecutive low speed centrifugations (700 <italic>g</italic> for 3 min). The remaining supernatant was centrifuged at 18 000 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min. The pelleted proteins served as a crude mitochondrial fraction and the supernatant as a cytosolic fraction. The identity of the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions was verified by the presence of specific marker enzymes. When the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in the starting cell homogenate was taken as 100&#x00025;, 84&#x02013;90&#x00025; of the activity was recovered in the cytosolic fraction as measured according to the method described in Bergmeyer and Bernt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c15">15</xref>). The recovery of the matrix enzyme citrate synthase in the mitochondrial fraction, measured as described in Graham and Rickwood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c16">16</xref>), was in the range 75&#x02013;82&#x00025;.</p><p>For sub-fractionation experiments the crude mitochondrial fraction was further purified. The crude mitochondria were resuspended in TES buffer &#x0005b;10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 2 mM PMSF&#x0005d;, layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient made by successive layering of 1.5 M and 1.0 M sucrose and centrifuged at 60 000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h. The phase between the 1.5 and 1.0 M sucrose layers (mitochondrial fraction) was collected and washed twice with TES buffer.</p><p>The sub-fractionation of mitochondria and preparation of mitoplasts was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c17">17</xref>). Briefly, 3 mg of freshly prepared mitochondria in 1 ml of TES were sonicated and then centrifuged at 320 000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was TCA precipitated and used as the mitochondrial soluble fraction; the pellet served as the mitochondrial membrane fraction. To obtain mitoplasts, mitochondria (3 mg) in 0.3 ml of TES were diluted 10-fold with buffer containing 5 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA and centrifuged at 14 000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of the same hypotonic buffer and left to stand on ice for 20 min. The suspension containing mitoplasts was centrifuged at 14&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C and washed three times with 3 ml of the hypotonic buffer. All supernatants were pooled and proteins were TCA precipitated. Sub-fractions were additionally verified by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to human mitochondrial proteins: anti-Hsp60p (monoclonal antibody purchased from Sigma) and anti-cytochrome c (rabbit polyclonal antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology).</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of hSuv3p</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain DH5&#x003b1; transformed with pQE&#x00394;mthSUV3his or pQE&#x00394;mthSUV3G207Vhis expression plasmid (see Construction of plasmids) was cultured and induced with isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactoside according to the protocol for the QIAexpress Expression System (Qiagen).</p><p>In order to obtain the antigen for immunisation of rabbits the hSuv3p protein was purified under denaturing conditions as follows. Bacteria were lysed at 100&#x000b0;C using a buffer containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 2&#x00025; Triton-X, pH 8.0. After binding to Ni&#x02013;NTA resin the protein was eluted at pH 4.2.

The matrix was transferred onto a column and washed with the same buffer supplemented with 200 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole. The bound protein was eluted with the above buffer containing 0.5 M imidazole. The purity of the obtained protein was &#x0223c;70&#x00025; as judged by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. The eluted fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration on a 30 kDa membrane (Millipore) and fractionated on a Superdex-200 column (Hi-Load; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with TGT buffer (20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.5, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 0.05&#x00025; Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol). Fractions containing the highest ATPase and helicase activities were pooled and analysed for the enzymatic properties of the NTPase&#x0002f;helicase (storage in 30&#x00025; glycerol at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C).

After the fourth injection &#x0223c;50 ml of serum was taken, salted out twice using 50&#x00025; ammonium sulphate and the resulting pellet resuspended and dialysed against PBS, pH 7.4.

COS-1 and HeLa cells were stained with the primary anti-hSuv3p serum and visualised with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the signal originating from hSuv3p co-localised with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker CMXRos in both COS-1 and in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f1">1</xref>A). This analysis also revealed faint nuclear staining patterns for both of the examined cell types. However, when a control staining with preimmune serum was carried out we could observe a weak signal with a cytoplasmatic and nuclear pattern (not shown). Therefore, we concluded that the majority of the hSuv3p protein localises in mitochondria. In order to exclude a possible double, nucleo-mitochondrial localisation, the hSuv3p protein was C-terminally tagged with c-myc epitope 9E10 and its subcellular localisation was studied in transiently transfected COS-1 and HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f1">1</xref>B). The mitochondrial localisation was confirmed by using the mitochondria-specific dye MitoTracker CMXRos.</p><p>We used SignalP v.2.0 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c26">26</xref>) in order to predict the presence and localisation of signal peptide cleavage sites in the amino acid sequence of hSuv3p. The most probable cleavage site of the mitochondrial leader in hSuv3p was found between the residues at positions 18 and 19 (in the hSuv3p sequence &#x02026;RQA&#x02193;GH&#x02026;; cleavage site marked by arrow). We constructed hSuv3p truncated N-terminally of 18 amino acids and incorporated a c-myc tag at the C-terminus. When this tagged protein was transiently expressed in COS-1 and HeLa cells, co-localisation with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker was significantly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f2">2</xref>). It therefore appears that the N-terminal part of hSuv3p is responsible for targeting of the protein to human mitochondria whilst the protein lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence is retained in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>Localisation of hSuv3p in the mitochondrial matrix</title><p>In order to determine the localisation of hSuv3p within mitochondria yeast mitochondria were used. Published data indicate that the transport machinery in yeast and human mitochondria do not differ significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c27">27</xref>). Radiolabelled hSuv3p synthesised <italic>in vitro</italic> using the rabbit reticulocyte transcription and translation system was subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial import followed by fractionation of the mitochondria into separate compartments. In parallel, mitochondrial uptake and fractionation of two well characterised mitochondrial proteins, pSu9&#x02013;DHFR and AAC, was performed. pSu9&#x02013;DHFR is a chimeric protein that contains the first 69 amino acids of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase subunit 9 fused to murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). After the import of pSu9&#x02013;DHFR the pre-protein is cleaved, liberating the mature form which localises in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c28">28</xref>). AAC is an ADP&#x0002f;ATP carrier protein localised in the mitochondrial inner membrane. In contrast to pSu9&#x02013;DHFR, AAC does not have a cleavable pre-sequence and its targeting information is contained within its internal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c29">29</xref>). When &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine-labelled hSuv3p was incubated with yeast mitochondria the protein was transported across the mitochondrial outer membrane and became inaccessible to trypsin. AAC and mature pSu9&#x02013;DHFR were also imported and resistant to proteolysis. In contrast to this, hSuv3p without the mitochondrial targeting sequence (see above) was not imported into the mitochondria and hence was susceptible to the added protease (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f3">3</xref>A, lane 1). To sub-fractionate mitochondria the outer membrane was disrupted by osmotic shock, which released components of the inter-membrane space. The resulting mitoplasts were additionally treated with proteinase K. Under these conditions full-length hSuv3p along with mature pSu9&#x02013;DHFR and AAC remained associated with the mitoplast pellet and were protected from proteinase K enzymatic digestion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f3">3</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3). No hSuv3p was detected in the intermembrane space fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f3">3</xref>A, lane 6). Alkali extraction of the mitoplasts with Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> showed that hSUV3p was imported mainly into the mitochondrial matrix and is not embedded in the membrane, just like mature pSu9&#x02013;DHFR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f3">3</xref>A, lane 4), whereas AAC was inserted into the inner membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f3">3</xref>A, lane 5). The submitochondrial fractionation after hSuv3p import was confirmed by immunoblotting using antibodies against endogenous marker mitochondrial proteins localised in different mitochondrial subcompartments: anti-porin for the outer membrane, anti-mtHsp70p for the matrix and anti-Cytb<sub>2</sub> for the inter-membrane space (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f3">3</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c13">13</xref>).</p><p>In order to confirm the localisation of hSuv3p in the mitochondrial matrix in human cells the sub-fractions of mitochondria from HeLa cells were examined for the presence of hSuv3p by immunoblotting using the anti-hSuv3p serum. The hSuv3p-specific band was detected predominantly in the crude mitochondrial fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f4">4</xref>A, lane 1). Subsequently purified human mitochondria were sub-fractionated into membrane and soluble fractions. When the submitochondrial fractions were examined by immunoblotting, the hSuv3p-specific band was detected almost exclusively in the soluble fraction, along with the mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp60p, which was used as a marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c30">30</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f4">4</xref>B, lane 3). Soluble mitochondrial fraction contained both matrix and inter-membrane space components. Therefore, to investigate whether mitochondrial hSuv3p is localised in the inter-membrane space or in the matrix, mitoplasts and the post-mitoplast supernatant were analysed by immunoblotting. hSuv3p was retained exclusively in the mitoplasts, similarly to Hsp60p matrix marker protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f4">4</xref>C, lane 3). Cytochrome c, an inter-membrane space marker protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c31">31</xref>), was recovered in the post-mitoplast supernatant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f4">4</xref>C, lane 2).

After disruption of the bacteria, the pool of enzyme present in the Triton X-100 solubilised fraction was purified by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> affinity chromatography under non-denaturing conditions. In addition to the expected 87 kDa protein, the imidazole-eluted fraction contained an induction-specific protein that migrated at &#x0223c;55 kDa and some background of bacterial proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f5">5</xref>A, lane 2).

The void volume fraction analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE contained a mixture of both 55 and 87 kDa proteins (not shown). The second peak of the ATPase and helicase activities consisted of a homogeneous preparation of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 87 kDa, which is in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of monomeric form hSuv3p-his protein (86.4 kDa) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f5">5</xref>A, lane 3).</p><p>The identity of the purified protein was verified by immunoblotting with anti-hSuv3p antiserum and with anti-his tag antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f5">5</xref>C, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The identity of the 55 kDa protein could also be determined. The protein was reactive with both antibodies, i.e. with anti-hSuv3p serum and with anti-his tag antibody, in immunoblots (data not shown). Since the his tag was attached to the C-terminus of hSuv3p protein we concluded that the 55 kDa protein represented the N-terminally degraded fragment of the intact 87 kDa polypeptide.</p><p>The above purification procedure was applied to the <italic>E.coli</italic> strain expressing the hSuv3p mutant with the replacement of Gly207 by valine &#x0005b;named hSuv3p(G207V)&#x0005d; within the N-terminus of the Walker A motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c32">32</xref>).

These investigations were performed with the 87 kDa polypeptide present in the fractions obtained from the Superdex-200 column corresponding to the monomeric form of the protein.</p><p>The ATPase activity of the enzyme was monitored in a standard assay by determination of the <sup>33</sup>P<sub>i</sub> released from &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>33</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP due to enzyme-mediated hydrolysis as described in Materials and Methods. Using this method we estimated the optimum reaction conditions for the ATPase activity of hSuv3p NTPase&#x0002f;helicase. The optimal ATP hydrolysis was at 30&#x000b0;C. The monovalent cations Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> did not exert any effect on the ATPase activity of the enzyme up to a concentration of 150 mM. Higher salt concentrations inhibited ATP hydrolysis with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 280 and 200 mM for Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, respectively. The ATPase activity of the hSuv3p NTPase&#x0002f;helicase was tested as a function of increasing concentrations of the divalent ions Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The two metal cations revealed optimal activity of the protein at 1&#x02013;5 mM for Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and 0.2&#x02013;1 mM for Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Under the optimised reaction conditions the Lineweaver&#x02013;Burk plot was linear up to ATP concentrations of 100 &#x000b5;M and yielded a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value of 41.9 &#x000b5;M. At saturating concentrations of ATP 1 mol of the enzyme hydrolysed 0.32 mol ATP per second.</p><p>An interesting phenomenon was observed when the ATPase activity of the enzyme was measured in the presence of 1-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide-5&#x02032;-triphosphate (ribavirin-TP). Ribavirin-TP was previously reported to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) NTPase&#x0002f;helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c19">19</xref>). At lower ATP concentrations (&#x0003c;&#x0003c;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) ribavirin-TP exerted a strong inhibitory effect on the ATPase activity of the hSuv3p NTPase&#x0002f;helicase. Reduction of the ATP concentration increased the inhibitory effect of ribavirin-TP. Thus, at an ATP concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup> &#x000d7; <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (42 nM) an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3&#x02013;5 &#x000b5;M was measured. On the other hand, increasing the ATP concentration in the reaction mixture reduces the inhibitory effect of ribavirin-TP. At ATP concentrations corresponding to the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value ribavirin-TP does not inhibit and even activates ATP hydrolysis. Increasing the ATP concentration could further enhance this activating effect. For example, at an ATP concentration equal to 100 &#x000d7; <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (4.2 mM) and 300 &#x000b5;M ribavirin-TP an activation of 250&#x00025; was measured.</p><p>Analogous results were obtained with a range of slowly hydrolysed or non-hydrolysable nucleoside 5&#x02032;-triphosphate analogues, like adenosine 5&#x02032;-&#x003b3;-thiotriphosphate (ATP-&#x003b3;-S), 5&#x02032;-adenylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) and &#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-methyleneadenosine 5&#x02032;-triphosphate (AMP-PCP).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f8">8</xref>A presents the modulation of the ATPase activity by AMP-PNP measured at different ATP concentrations. Analysis of the AMP-PNP-mediated inhibition, measured at strongly reduced ATP concentrations, by mean of a graphic method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c37">37</xref>) revealed pure competitive inhibition with regard to ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f8">8</xref>B).</p><p>A common property of numerous NTPase&#x0002f;helicases is their activation and even dependency of the ATPase activity on RNA, DNA or homopolymeric polynucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c36">36</xref> and references therein). Under optimal reaction conditions we analysed the effect of various ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides on the ATPase activity of the hSuv3p NTPase&#x0002f;helicase. However, in contrast to the enzymes described previously the ATPase activity of hSuv3p protein is only moderately affected by the polynucleotides tested; the highest activation was observed with poly(U) (140&#x00025; of control) and DNA (120&#x00025; of control) with optimum concentrations of 330 and 120 &#x000b5;M of nucleotide base, respectively.</p><p>The unwinding activity of hSuv3p protein was monitored and characterised with RNA and DNA substrates. Both substrates consisted of two partially hybridised oligonucleotides; a 26mer, the release strand, and a 40mer, the template strand. The same substrates were previously used to characterise the helicase activity of West Nile virus (WNV) and HCV NTPase&#x0002f;helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c38">38</xref>).

To compare the catalytic efficiency of the unwinding activity of hSuv3p NTPase&#x0002f;helicase towards RNA and DNA substrates we performed a strand displacement experiment in which decreasing concentrations of enzyme were added at the constant non-saturating concentration of 4.7 pM of RNA or DNA substrate. Although the hSuv3p NTPase&#x0002f;helicase separated the dsDNA with an &#x0223c;10 000 higher activity compared to dsRNA, it unwound 95&#x00025; of the DNA substrate but 100&#x00025; of RNA substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf647f9">9</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Proteins involved in mitochondrial mRNA processing and degradation in humans have yet to be characterised.

Previously we cloned the cDNA coding for the human orthologue of the putative yeast RNA NTPase&#x0002f;helicase Suv3p, a component of the yeast mitochondrial degradosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c11">11</xref>). Both yeast and human proteins display high homology (35&#x00025; identity, 53&#x00025; similarity over 567 residues), but sequence similarity does not allow prediction of the precise function of the human orthologue. The properties of the human protein may have been modified during the course of evolution and in humans hSuv3p might be now associated with different molecular mechanisms.</p><p>There are indications that the metazoan SUV3 gene is indispensable for proper cellular function. The data obtained in a large-scale analysis of SUV3 function in <italic>C.elegans</italic> (47&#x00025; identity and 65&#x00025; similarity over 669 residues on the protein level between <italic>C.elegans</italic> and <italic>H.sapiens</italic>) by high throughput RNAi showed that inactivation of the gene caused embryo development to arrest 24 h post-inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c9">9</xref>). In addition, no rearrangements have been found in the band 10q22.1 of human chromosome 10, to which the hSUV3 gene was assigned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c40">40</xref>). This could be an indication that hSuv3p in its intact functional form is also essential for human cells.</p><p>In order to investigate the possible function of hSuv3p we decided first to analyse the precise cellular localisation of hSuv3p in mammalian cells and to study the enzymatic activity of the protein <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and thus have to be synthesised in the cytosol and then imported into mitochondria. Protein translocation across and into the mitochondrial membranes is a multistep process facilitated by the coordinated action of specialised translocation systems in the outer and inner membranes of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c41">41</xref>). Previous analysis of hSuv3p for the presence of a mitochondrial targeting sequence indicated that hSuv3p might be imported into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c11">11</xref>). However, the localisation of the protein <italic>in vivo</italic> in human cells remained to be shown. Immunofluorescence microscopy clearly demonstrates that hSuv3p is localised in mitochondria of human and simian cells. The N-terminal part of hSuv3p was also shown to be necessary for mitochondrial import, since a mutant form of hSuv3p lacking the 18 residues at the N-terminus was not targeted to the mitochondria.</p><p>The classical mitochondrial targeting N-terminal pre-sequences consist of positively charged, hydrophobic and hydroxylated amino acids that can form an amphiphilic &#x003b1;-helix and function as a matrix-targeting signal. However, pre-sequence-like signals are also used by several pre-proteins that are destined for the three other mitochondrial subcompartments: the outer membrane, the inter-membrane space and the inner membrane. In these cases the pre-sequences are complemented by other sorting signals that lead to a specific arrest of the pre-proteins in the respective compartment (stop-transfer signals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c13">13</xref>). The presence of a functional mitochondrial targeting presequence on the N-terminus and the lack of other predicted sorting signals (e.g. a hydrophobic membrane anchor) suggested that hSuv3p is imported to the mitochondrial matrix space. Two sets of experiments support this point: (i) an import assay into isolated yeast mitochondria followed by separation of mitochondrial subcompartments; (ii) immunoblotting of human mitochondrial subfractions with hSuv3p specific antiserum. Using yeast mitochondria to study the import of human proteins has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c43">43</xref>).</p><p>A number of yeast mitochondrial proteins have their homologues in human mitochondria. Thus, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> is considered as a particularly suitable simple organism widely used for studying the function of human proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c44">44</xref>). However, because of differences in mitochondrial DNA organisation and expression between human and yeast mitochondria, it cannot be assumed <italic>a priori</italic> that given orthologues play identical biological functions. For example, in mitochondrial DNA replication orthologic DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c45">45</xref>) but unrelated DNA helicases are involved in yeast and humans. Human mitochondria contain a T7-related DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c46">46</xref>) that has no orthologue in yeast.</p><p>The results presented suggest important differences between the human and yeast SUV3 gene products. hSuv3p was shown to be a soluble protein localised in the human mitochondrial matrix space, whereas our recent experiments have revealed that in yeast mitochondria the complex consisting of Suv3p helicase and Dss1p RNase is associated with mitochondrial ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c37">37</xref>), which are thought to be associated with the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c47">47</xref>). Additionally, no orthologue of Dss1p has been found in the human genome and we were not able to complement the yeast SUV3 knock-out by its human orthologue (not shown), although hSuv3p is properly imported into yeast mitochondria <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results suggest that in humans, in spite of high conservation through evolution, hSuv3p might be involved in different mitochondrial processes than its yeast counterpart.</p><p>For most proteins defined as NTPase&#x0002f;helicases on the basis of their amino acid sequences, no biochemical studies have been performed. Up to now there were also no data about the enzymatic activity of hSuv3p. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the protein revealed a range of conserved motifs, which are associated with NTP and&#x0002f;or polynucleotide binding characteristic of NTPase&#x0002f;helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c49">49</xref>). The best conserved are motifs I and II, the so-called &#x02018;Walker motifs A and B&#x02019;, that are present in all NTPase&#x0002f;helicases as well as in a wide variety of other NTP-utilising proteins. The functions of these motifs, which compose the NTP-binding pocket of the proteins, are association of the terminal phosphate groups of NTP (Walker motif A) and chelatation of the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> of the Mg-NTP complex (Walker motif B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c32">32</xref>). There are a number of reasons to classify hSuv3p in superfamily 1 (SFI) of NTPase&#x0002f;helicases: (i) the amino acid sequence of the hSuv3p Walker A motif (G-P-T-N-S-G-K-T) is characteristic of DNA SFI NTPase&#x0002f;helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c48">48</xref>); (ii) the presence of a hydrophobic isoleucine residue within the Walker B motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c35">35</xref>); (iii) lack of a typical SAT motif, unique to SF2 NTPase&#x0002f;helicases. Membership of a particular superfamily has, however, no clear predictive value regarding the key properties of the enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c36">36</xref>).</p><p>The hSuv3p enzyme utilises both RNA and DNA substrates with a strong preference for the latter. To our knowledge there are only a few NTPase&#x0002f;helicases that show an exclusive RNA or DNA specificity. The explanation for this lack of specificity might be the fact that the interaction between the protein molecule and the DNA or RNA substrate is mainly mediated by phosphate groups and not by the nucleotide base or sugar moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c52">52</xref>). Although hSuv3p protein was previously referred to as a putative RNA NTPase&#x0002f;helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c11">11</xref>), the sequence characteristics mentioned above characterise the protein rather as a DNA enzyme. Our enzymatic data show that hSuv3p unwinds dsDNA 10<sup>4</sup> times more efficiently than dsRNA. This seems to be in contrast to yeast Suv3p protein, which was shown to function as an RNA helicase participating in RNA degradation and 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; processing of mtRNA. The observed reaction rates for the enzyme&#x0002f;substrate ratios used in our experiments are similar to published results obtained for <italic>in vitro</italic> helicase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c53">53</xref>). It is obvious, however, that characteristics of a recombinant protein in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay may differ from those <italic>in vivo</italic>. We do not know yet if hSuv3p protein forms a complex with another protein(s) in mitochondria and what its physiological function is. The observed strong preference for dsDNA substrates might indicate the participation of hSuv3p in DNA replication, but more research is needed to prove this hypothesis.</p><p>The NTPase&#x0002f;helicase nature of hSuv3p was verified by site-directed mutagenesis experiments in which Gly207 was replaced by valine. The Gly207 residue represents the N-terminus of the Walker A motif (see above). As mentioned above, the glycine residue in the first position of the Walker A motif is highly conserved between DNA NTPase&#x0002f;helicases of SF1 and numerous ATPases and GTPases, whereas RNA NTPase&#x0002f;helicases have in most cases an alanine in this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c55">55</xref>). Substitution of alanine by glycine in the translation factor Tif1 from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> was shown to have no effect on the growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c33">33</xref>). An analogous exchange performed on the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF-4A) RNA NTPase&#x0002f;helicase even increased its ATP binding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c34">34</xref>). Such an effect could be expected since both amino acids have uncharged and unbranched side chains. However, the introduction of the isopropyl moiety of valine in this position causes dramatic inhibition of the functions of the RNA helicase activity in the translation factor Tif1 from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and is lethal for the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c33">33</xref>). The respective substitution dramatically reduces ATP binding by the eIF-4A RNA NTPase&#x0002f;helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c34">34</xref>). Also, for hSuv3p replacement of the glycine of the Walker A motif with valine abolished both the ATPase and helicase activities of the enzyme.</p><p>In the helicase assays the hSuv3p enzyme was added in a vast excess over the substrate, therefore one could speculate that the unwinding reaction mediated by hSuv3p would be non-enzymatic. This possibility is, however, excluded by the experiments with a mutated protein, hSuv3p(G207V), which could not utilise ATP. The mutated protein was unable to separate the dsDNA or dsRNA substrates. Additionally, corroborating this are our observations with a second mutant enzyme in which the Walker motif B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c32">32</xref>), DEIQ, was replaced by DAIQ &#x0005b;hSuv3p(E292A) mutant&#x0005d;. The protein was not able to hydrolyse ATP and to separate dsDNA or dsRNA used as substrates (manuscript in preparation).</p><p>The majority of the NTPase&#x0002f;helicases characterised to date exhibit polynucleotide-dependent and polynucleotide-independent NTPase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c56">56</xref>). The enzymes differ dramatically in the extent of nucleic acid-induced stimulation of their NTPase activity. For example, poly(rU) enhanced the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> value of HCV ATPase up to 30-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c56">56</xref>). In contrast, the ATPase activities of bacterial helicases such as Rep and helicase II are increased over 1000-fold by single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c57">57</xref>). In contrast, the hSuv3p ATPase activity displays rather modest stimulation by polynucleotides (1.4-fold). The weak response of hSuv3p to nucleic acids is, however, not unique. There are several known viral NTPase&#x0002f;helicases whose ATPase activity is stimulated only weakly by polynucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c35">35</xref>). This apparent difference might result from different reaction conditions used; differences in purity of the enzyme preparation or source of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c60">60</xref>). On the other hand it is possible that <italic>in vivo</italic> a specific RNA or DNA cofactor(s) exists, as for the ATPase activity of protein Slt22p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c61">61</xref>), that in the case of hSuv3p remains to be discovered.</p><p>Non-hydrolysable ATP analogues are effective inhibitors of the NTPase activity of the hSuv3p enzyme, although the inhibition occurred only at low ATP concentrations. Higher concentrations of ATP abolished the inhibition and even stimulated the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is that hSuv3p protein has two binding sites for nucleosides and nucleotides, as previously postulated for the HCV enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c62">62</xref>). The first one is equipped with Walker motifs (where the ATP normally binds) and is, therefore, more specific for nucleoside 5&#x02032;-triphosphate substrates. The second could be an allosteric binding site less specific for nucleosides or nucleotides. According to this hypothesis, at low ATP concentrations (less than the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value of the specific NTPase reaction) ribavirin-TP, as well as other nucleoside 5&#x02032;-triphosphate analogues, competes against ATP for the first site containing Walker motifs and thus causes competitive inhibition of the NTPase. At high concentrations of ATP along with ribavirin-TP or nucleoside 5&#x02032; triphosphate analogues the second site becomes more and more occupied and there is a consequent conformational change occurring in the NTPase, which ultimately leads to its activation. A similar pattern of interaction of ATP, ribavirin-TP and NTPase&#x0002f;helicase was previously described by us for some members of SFII family of enzymes, like HCV and WNV NTPase&#x0002f;helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf647c23">23</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we biochemically characterised the nuclear encoded RNA and DNA helicase present in the mitochondrial matrix of human mitochondria. Our results indicate that the human enzyme significantly differs from its yeast orthologue. While from numerous studies in different laboratories the involvement of yeast Suv3p in RNA turnover seems to be very well proven, the human protein shows a strong preference for dsDNA and is present exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix. Further research is in progress to answer the question whether hSuv3p protein is part of the mitochondrial RNA degrading machinery or has acquired new features during evolution.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf647f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Mitochondrial localisation of hSuv3p in mammalian cells.
