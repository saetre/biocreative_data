Because disruption of spindle formation can promote genomic instability, an understanding of MAP function and regulation is central to dissecting basic mechanisms of tumorigenesis and would be invaluable in designing new therapies for the treatment of cancer. Although much progress has been made in understanding the functions of spindle-associated MAPs in the last few years, many aspects of their role or regulation remain to be fully elucidated. Human hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP) has been described as a highly charged MAP that can bind directly to MTs in vitro and enhance their polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Santarella et al., 2007</xref>). In vivo, HURP is part of a Ran-dependent complex that stabilizes mitotic MTs and is required for the formation and function of bipolar mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koffa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sillje et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wong and Fang, 2006</xref>). However, it is not known how HURP-associated proteins functionally interact with one another in a developmental context to support normal cellular function.</p><p>Mars, a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sequence homologue of HURP, was previously identified as a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding protein, implicating reversible phosphorylation in the control of Mars or Mars-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Alphey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). In this paper, we report the essential role of <italic>mars</italic> during early embryogenesis, its interactions with other MAPs, and its key role in promoting protein dephosphorylation on mitotic spindles to ensure spindle stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>HURP is a component of the mitotic spindle apparatus. To determine the cell cycle distribution of Mars, we generated a Mars-specific antibody and used it to stain syncytial embryos undergoing nuclear division. In prophase, Mars antibody staining was predominantly around the centrosome. In metaphase and anaphase, Mars was localized on spindle MTs in a gradient along the pole-to-pole axis with more intense staining at the centrosome-proximal regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This is distinct from the distribution of HURP, which has been shown to be predominantly at chromatin-proximal regions until telophase, when levels sharply decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koffa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sillje et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wong and Fang, 2006</xref>). In telophase, we observed a low level of discrete Mars staining at the midbody (not depicted), but the majority of Mars protein appeared to be spread over the nuclear envelope where it persisted during interphase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712080/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712080/DC1</ext-link>). Double staining for Mars and either Klp10A, which is primarily localized at focused minus ends where it promotes depolymerization and poleward flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>), or &#x003b3;-tubulin, which marks the face of the centrosome and nucleates MT polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jeng and Stearns, 1999</xref>), confirmed that Mars is localized at MT minus ends but not at the centrosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Mars' localization during mitosis was completely disrupted upon treatment with colchicine to depolymerize MTs, indicating that Mars associates with spindle MTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Mars localizes to spindle MTs.</bold> (A) Fixed wild-type embryos stained to reveal the distribution of Mars (green), &#x003b1;-tubulin (red), and DNA (blue) during mitosis.

As we were able to visualize sperm tails in early-arrested embryos laid by <italic>mars</italic> mutant females (unpublished data), we conclude that the sterility observed in <italic>mars</italic> mutants is caused by arrest in embryogenesis after fertilization. The viability of embryos laid by <italic>mars</italic> mutant mothers was restored by moderate overexpression of <italic>mars<sup>WT</sup></italic> (wild-type <italic>mars</italic>) in the female germline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), indicating that the failure of <italic>mars</italic> mutant embryos to develop is caused by disruption of the <italic>mars</italic> transcription unit.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular defects in <italic>mars</italic> mutants.</bold> (A) <italic>mars</italic> genomic region in <italic>mars<sup>P</sup></italic>, wild type, and <italic>mars<sup>1</sup></italic>.

Embryos lacking maternal <italic>mars</italic> arrested during early embryogenesis after no more than five nuclear divisions. 81.9% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 144) of 15&#x02013;45-min embryos laid by <italic>mars<sup>1</sup></italic> mothers exhibited at least two discrete DNA-containing regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). The first of these was localized to the embryonic cortex and resembled a polar body, most likely containing the unused products of meiosis II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wilson and Borisy, 1998</xref>). One or more additional DNA-containing regions, each surrounded by a bipolar spindle, were also observed more centrally, indicating that the vast majority of mutant embryos pass through meiosis to form one or more mitotic figure. Notably, the spindle structures in <italic>mars<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant embryos were very small and weak, albeit still bipolar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Most spindles had at least one detached centrosome, possibly because of weakened spindle&#x02013;centrosome interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C&#x02013;E</xref>). We also observed unaligned chromosomes in the <italic>mars<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant, which is indicative of insufficient MT attachment or tension (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712080/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712080/DC1</ext-link>). Embryos laid by <italic>mars<sup>1/P</sup></italic> mothers resembled those from <italic>mars<sup>1</sup></italic> mothers, except the phenotypes were somewhat less severe (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C&#x02013;E</xref>). Quantitation of &#x003b1;-tubulin staining revealed no significant difference between astral MTs in embryos laid by wild-type and <italic>mars<sup>1/P</sup></italic> mothers (P &#x0003d; 0.416), whereas cold-resistant kinetochore MTs were destabilized in embryos laid by <italic>mars<sup>1/P</sup></italic> mothers (Fig. S2 B). Approximately 51% of embryos laid by <italic>mars<sup>P</sup></italic> homozygous mothers (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 264) failed to develop beyond embryogenesis. Many showed terminal phenotypes at or shortly after gastrulation, presumably as a consequence of primary defects during the early cleavage divisions. Collectively, analysis of loss-of-function mutants suggest that <italic>mars</italic> has a role in spindle MT stabilization. HURP has bundling activity in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koffa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sillje et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wong and Fang, 2006</xref>).

To verify interactions with PP1, we performed pulldown experiments between Mars and PP1&#x003b1;87B, the major <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> PP1 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dombr&#x000e1;di et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baksa et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kirchner et al., 2007</xref>). We found that GST-tagged full-length Mars<sup>WT</sup> interacted efficiently with HA-tagged PP1&#x003b1;87B from crude <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryo extracts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), whereas cells expressing GST alone did not bind (not depicted). We also observed efficient binding between endogenous PP1 and FLAG-Myc (FM)&#x02013;tagged Mars<sup>WT</sup> by coimmunoprecipitation from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryo extracts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). To assess the importance of the putative PP1 binding motif for interaction with PP1, we tested a mutant form of Mars in which phenylalanine 839 was replaced with alanine (Mars<sup>F839A</sup>) in our pulldown assay. The ability of Mars<sup>F839A</sup> to bind PP1 was greatly reduced compared with wild-type Mars (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), indicating that Phe839 is crucial for interaction with PP1. Immunoprecipitation with an HURP antibody followed by immunoblotting with PP1 antibody showed that endogenous human PP1 and HURP also interacted efficiently with each other in HeLa cell extracts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), suggesting that binding to PP1 is an evolutionarily conserved property of HURP proteins.</p><p>Binding to PP1 prompted us to test functional interactions between <italic>mars</italic> and <italic>PP1</italic> in vivo. The ability of embryos laid by <italic>mars</italic> or <italic>PP1a87B</italic> heterozygotes to hatch resembled that of the wild type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Embryos laid by flies transheterozygous for <italic>mars</italic> and <italic>PP1a87B</italic> showed a significantly reduced hatch ratio (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). PP1 is a pleiotropic enzyme. To test the specific role of Mars-bound PP1, we introduced FM-tagged <italic>Mars<sup>F839A</sup></italic> into flies to create Mars complexes lacking PP1. Ectopic expression of <italic>mars<sup>F839A</sup></italic> at comparable levels to those of <italic>mars<sup>WT</sup></italic> failed to rescue the embryonic lethality of embryos laid by <italic>mars<sup>1</sup></italic> or <italic>mars<sup>1/P</sup></italic> mothers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that binding to PP1 is critical for <italic>mars</italic> function. Identical distributions of Mars<sup>F839A</sup> and Mars<sup>WT</sup>, as determined by FLAG antibody staining, indicate that PP1 binding is not necessary for normal Mars localization on the mitotic spindle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>).</p><p>HURP has been shown to interact with other MAPs, including TPX2 and XMAP215 in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koffa et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that its role in the stabilization of spindle MTs may be partly mediated via interactions with other spindle assembly factors. In immunoprecipitation assays, we found that Mars associates with two proteins that are known to cooperate with each other to stabilize MTs during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lappin et al., 2002</xref>): the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> XMAP215 homologue encoded by <italic>minispindles</italic> (<italic>msps</italic>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> transforming acidic coiled-coil (dTACC) protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). In syncytial embryos, dTACC is concentrated at centrosomes during mitosis but is also found on spindle MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gergely et al., 2000</xref>) where it colocalizes with Mars (unpublished data). Mars staining was not affected in embryos that produce no detectable dTACC protein (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712080/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712080/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). Conversely, the ability of dTACC to associate with MTs was largely unaffected in <italic>mars<sup>1/P</sup></italic> mutant embryos (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>).

The role of dephosphorylated TACC is not known, but it may function to stabilize MTs through lateral interactions with MTs or interactions with MT plus ends.

When we examined hatching of these embryos, we found that the lethality of embryos laid by <italic>mars<sup>1/P</sup></italic> mothers was rescued by <italic>dTACC<sup>S863L</sup></italic> but not <italic>dTACC<sup>WT</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that dephosphorylation of dTACC on the spindle is an essential function of <italic>mars</italic>. Homozygous <italic>mars<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants were not rescued by <italic>dTACC<sup>S863L</sup></italic> (unpublished data), suggesting that residual Mars protein in <italic>mars<sup>1/P</sup></italic> embryos may play a dTACC-independent role, such as MT bundling, or that the level of ectopic <italic>dTACC<sup>S863L</sup></italic> was insufficient to compensate for elevated p-dTACC in a <italic>mars<sup>1</sup></italic> background.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that <italic>mars</italic>, which encodes a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sequence homologue of HURP, is critical for mitotic spindle structure and chromosome segregation during early embryogenesis. The primary defect in <italic>mars</italic> mutants appears to be loss of spindle MT stability, whereas overexpression of <italic>mars</italic> leads to the production of enlarged spindles with ectopic MTs. These data are consistent with a role for <italic>mars</italic> in MT bundling/stabilization similar to that described for its human homologue HURP. However, our identification of Mars as an interacting subunit of PP1 suggests a novel mechanism by which this family of proteins can maintain normal spindle structure in vivo. Binding of PP1 to Mars implicates PP1 in dephosphorylation of Mars or a Mars-associated protein. Although dTACC may be a substrate of PP1, it is also possible that Mars-bound PP1 may indirectly stimulate dephosphorylation of dTACC on the spindle by activating another protein phosphatase or inactivating a dTACC kinase such as Aurora-A, a known target of PP1 during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Katayama et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>An essential role of <italic>mars</italic> is to promote dTACC dephosphorylation.</bold> (A) Mars coprecipitates dTACC and Msps from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryonic nuclear extracts.

Why is it important to maintain dephosphorylated TACC on the spindle? One possibility is that <italic>mars</italic> functions to ensure that MT stabilization mediated by p-dTACC only occurs at the centrosome, allowing a more dynamic spindle. This is hard to test however, because the mechanism by which p-dTACC stabilizes MTs is unclear. The effect of dTACC on MT assembly appears to be mediated by effector proteins, such as Msps, as TACC has not been described to possess MT stabilizing activity on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kinoshita et al., 2005</xref>). Phosphorylation of dTACC might help activate effectors because dTACC mutated at Ser863 is able to recruit Msps to the centrosome but not promote MT assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barros et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is not known which aspect of Msps activity is affected by dTACC phosphorylation or to what extent the effect of dTACC phosphorylation is context dependent. It is conceivable that dTACC stabilizes spindle MTs by establishing lateral interactions with MTs or interactions with plus ends and that these functions of dTACC are impaired when phosphorylated at Ser863.</p><p>Is <italic>mars</italic> a functional homologue of HURP? We have confirmed that various aspects of <italic>mars</italic> and HURP function are conserved, including spindle stabilization and binding of Mars to Msps and PP1. However, Mars and HURP display apparently distinct spindle localizations, suggesting that there may be differences in how these proteins are used during cell division. This may reflect a wider difference in the organization of MAPs that control MT stability and the formation of bipolar spindles in flies and humans.</p><p>Spindle defects caused by lack of TACC phosphorylation or by alterations in TACC or HURP protein levels may lead to genetic instability and are implicated in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Raff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brittle and Ohkura, 2005</xref>). Our data indicate that spatially controlled dephosphorylation also plays a positive role in TACC function, suggesting that deregulation of either phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of TACC may also be involved in the molecular pathology of cancer by compromising the fidelity of chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly strains</title><p><italic>EP(2)2477</italic>, referred to here as <italic>mars<sup>P</sup></italic>, is a homozygous viable <italic>P</italic> element insertion in the 5&#x02032; untranslated region of <italic>mars</italic>. <italic>GFP-dTACC<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic><sup>GFP-dTACCS863L</sup></italic> (gift from J.

The mean pixel intensity of astral MTs from at least 25 embryos of each genotype was calculated. All measurements were corrected for variation in staining conditions by subtracting the background intensity. A similar approach was taken to quantify p-dTACC staining, except that measurements were also taken at four points on the spindle, both proximal and distal to the centrosome.
