NER deals primarily with UV-induced lesions and is also active against a broad range of endogenously generated oxidative lesions, although base excision repair is generally considered to play the key role in removing endogenous oxidative damage (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c1">1</xref>). The NER pathway consists of an initial damage recognition step, followed by dual incisions to either side of the lesion. The damaged site is then removed on a short oligonucleotide before repair synthesis takes place (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c3">3</xref>). Components of the NER pathway are known to be defective in the human inherited disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), which is characterised by UV hypersensitivity, pigmentation abnormalities and a 1000-fold increased risk of skin cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c4">4</xref>). XP patients also have an increased incidence of internal tumours and, in some cases, neurological abnormalities, suggesting the importance of NER in the repair of endogenously generated as well as UV-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c4">4</xref>). <italic>ERCC1</italic> was the first mammalian NER gene to be cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c5">5</xref>), but it failed to complement any of the seven complementation groups for classical XP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c6">6</xref>), suggesting that <italic>ERCC1</italic> mutations may be lethal in man. Of course it is also possible that a human inherited disorder caused by <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency remains to be identified.</p><p>ERCC1 is essential for NER, in which it acts in a complex with XPF to make the incision 5&#x02032; to the lesion site. Unlike the other NER proteins, ERCC1 and XPF are also involved in homologous recombination, double-strand break repair and the repair of interstrand crosslinks. Their role in recombination was deduced originally from studies on the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> homologues, RAD10 (ERCC1) and RAD1 (XPF), which are involved in both NER and mitotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c7">7</xref>). In addition, <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient or <italic>XPF</italic>-deficient mammalian cells are characteristically hypersensitive to the interstrand crosslinking agent mitomycin C. The key role, which explains the involvement of the ERCC1&#x0002f;XPF complex in these different recombination&#x02013;repair pathways, is the ability to cleave single- stranded 3&#x02032;-tails projecting from DNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c10">10</xref>).</p><p>The consequences of <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency in man could thus extend beyond the characteristic features of the NER deficiency disease XP. To study the consequences of <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency in a whole animal system we used gene targeting to inactivate the mouse <italic>ERCC1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c11">11</xref>). <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient mice were viable, but severely runted and died before weaning at the age of 3 weeks. Detailed analysis suggested that the most likely cause of death was hepatic failure. At birth <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient hepatocyte nuclei were already enlarged and polyploid; by 3 weeks of age increasingly polyploid and aneuploid nuclei were evident. Blood plasma analysis indicated that liver function was compromised. Since polyploidy is normally only observed in adult liver, the symptoms in the <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient mice were more reminiscent of premature ageing than a NER deficiency disease. Furthermore, elevated levels of p53 protein were detected in the liver, brain and kidneys of the <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls, indicating persistence of DNA damage in these tissues. Despite the detection of p53, we failed to see any increased incidence of apoptosis in these tissues. Subsequently, independently generated <italic>ERCC1</italic> knockout mice have been reported with the same liver pathology and runted phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c12">12</xref>).</p><p><italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient CHO cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient mice have a 100-fold elevated spontaneous mutation rate at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase locus in addition to a higher level of genome instability, indicated by an increased frequency of micronuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c13">13</xref>) and recombination-dependent genome rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c14">14</xref>). We would like to study the consequences of <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency, particularly cancer susceptibility, in a range of mouse tissues to assess the importance of ERCC1 in recombinational repair pathways <italic>in vivo</italic>. The premature death of our null mice has effectively precluded such studies. We speculated that by restoring <italic>ERCC1</italic> gene function in the liver, the lifespan of the nulls would be extended sufficiently to enable further studies of the consequences of <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency in other adult tissues and systems. Here we describe the restoration of <italic>ERCC1</italic> function to the liver of our knockout mice by conventional transgenesis with an <italic>ERCC1</italic> minigene construct under the control of a liver-specific promoter, thereby demonstrating correction of the severe liver phenotype and revealing the consequences of <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency in some other tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Generation of transgenic mice</title><p>To direct liver-specific <italic>ERCC1</italic> expression, a fragment containing exons 1&#x02013;10 of the mouse <italic>ERCC1</italic> cDNA was cloned (blunt-ended) into a <italic>Stu</italic>I site in exon 2 of the vector pTTR1 ExV3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c15">15</xref>) (kindly provided by Dr T. Van Dyke, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). The resulting construct (pTTR&#x0002f;ERCC1; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>A) was purified as a 5.4 kb <italic>Hin</italic>dIII fragment and used for pronuclear microinjection as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c16">16</xref>). Transgene-positive offspring were identified by PCR. The transgene was crossed onto our <italic>ERCC1</italic> null background by matings with <italic>ERCC1</italic> heterozygotes. Genotyping was performed using a triplex PCR that identified both the <italic>ERCC1</italic> wild-type and null alleles in addition to the transgene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>B). Primers for exon 4 (CCAGTGTTGAAGTTTGTGCG, mouse <italic>ERCC1</italic> cDNA sequence 429&#x02013;448, GenBank accession no. X07414) and exon 5 (CGAAGGGCGAATTCTTCCC, mouse <italic>ERCC1</italic> cDNA sequence 598&#x02013;579) gave a 0.6&#x000a0;kb product specific for the wild-type allele and a 0.17 kb product specific for the transgene. The targeted allele was detected as a 0.8 kb product from the exon 5 primer and a primer from the <italic>neo</italic> cassette (GGTTCGAAATGACCGACCAAGCG, 958&#x02013;980, GenBank accession no. V00618). Transgene copy number was determined by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA prepared from tail biopsies. To assess the transgene copy number, 3 &#x000b5;g wild-type mouse embryonic stem cell DNA was spiked with various amounts of the transgene fragment, equivalent to 1 (5.4 pg), 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 copies per mouse genome. Southern blots were first probed using a mouse <italic>ERCC1</italic> cDNA fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c11">11</xref>) to determine the transgene copy number and then reprobed using a mouse <italic>PrP</italic> coding region probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c17">17</xref>) to allow this estimate to be corrected for any errors in DNA loading. Quantification was performed using a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Chesham, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA and protein analysis</title><p>Total RNA was obtained from mouse tissues using the guanidine isothiocyanate-based reagent RNAzol (Biogenesis, Poole, UK) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. RNA samples were subjected to northern analysis as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c11">11</xref>). Detection of ERCC1 protein was achieved using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a His-tagged recombinant protein containing a central fragment (amino acids 36&#x02013;175) of mouse ERCC1 (K.-T.Hsia and D.W.Melton, unpublished results). Western blot analysis was carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c13">13</xref>), except that 12.5&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels were used and detection of the primary ERCC1 antibody was achieved with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Histology and FACS analysis</title><p>Tissues were fixed for 24&#x02013;48 h in buffered formalin (4&#x00025;) and embedded in paraffin.

HPLC was performed with a Dionex Summit system (Camberley, UK) equipped with a GP-50 pump, Gina 50 chilling autosampler, a UV&#x0002f;Vis UVD170S detector, operated at 254 nm, and an ESA Coulochem II electrochemical detector (Anachem, Luton, UK) at 400 mV, 2 nA with a filter time of 5 s and AUFS of 1 V. The chromatography was done on a 3 &#x000b5;m Hypersil BDS C18 column (Anachem). The mobile phase consisted of filtered and degassed 0.05 M sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, containing 8&#x00025; methanol delivered under pressure from a Dionex E01 eluent organiser at a flow rate of 0.5 ml&#x0002f;min. An aliquot of 100 &#x000b5;l of hydrolysed DNA sample was injected for analysis. Data analysis was carried out with Chromeleon software (Dionex).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Transgenic mice express <italic>ERCC1</italic> in a liver-specific manner</title><p>To rescue the lethal liver phenotype in our <italic>ERCC1</italic> null animals we generated mice carrying a transgene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>A) in which <italic>ERCC1</italic> expression was under the control of transthyretin (TTR) regulatory sequences that have previously been shown to bring about gene expression specifically in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c15">15</xref>). TTR is a thyroid hormone transport protein that is normally secreted by hepatocytes into serum and by the choroid plexus epithelium of the brain into the cerebrospinal fluid. Following pronuclear DNA injection a single transgene-positive female (TG&#x00023;17) was identified from the 23 mice that survived to weaning. All subsequent <italic>TTR</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ERCC1</italic> transgenic lines were established by breeding from this animal. The founder was crossed with a wild-type (MF1) male to expand the number of transgene-positive animals for preliminary expression analysis and subsequent breeding. Transgene-positive animals were then crossed with heterozygotes from our <italic>ERCC1</italic> knockout colony. Transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> heterozygotes identified from these matings were subsequently crossed together to generate transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>B).</p><p>The number of transgene arrays present in the founder was examined using Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA from TG&#x00023;17 was restricted with a range of enzymes known not to cut within the transgene. The result indicated a single transgene array in the founder (data not shown). It has been reported that <italic>TTR</italic> promoter-controlled transgene expression is detected in tissues other than the liver if the transgene is present in more than six copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c15">15</xref>). Southern blot analysis was used to determine the number of transgene copies in the genome of the founder animal and in offspring, each hemizygous for the transgene array, from crosses onto the knockout background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>C). The analysis showed the presence of the endogenous 8.3 and (very weak) 4.3 kb wild-type <italic>ERCC1</italic> bands in each track. The transgenic sample, TG&#x00023;9, was an <italic>ERCC1</italic> heterozygote and, consequently, an additional band from the null allele was evident at 6.7 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c19">19</xref>). In addition, a previously identified restriction fragment length polymorphism for the wild-type 8.3 kb band was evident in TG&#x00023;55. The 4.8 kb transgene-specific band was evident in each of the transgenic sample lanes and, at appropriately varying intensities, in the copy number titration lanes. Since the endogenous <italic>ERCC1</italic> bands were unsuitable as internal standards for DNA loading because of the polymorphisms, the blot was stripped and reprobed with a <italic>PrP</italic> gene probe. Phosphorimagery was used to quantify the level of the transgene signal relative to the 8.5 kb <italic>PrP</italic> band. The transgene copy number estimates were: TG&#x00023;17, two copies; TG&#x00023;9, three copies; TG&#x00023;26, 54 and 55, four copies. The consistently higher copy number estimates for the F<sub>1</sub> offspring than for the founder (TG&#x00023;17) suggests that the founder may have been a transgenic mosaic.</p><p>The normal pattern of <italic>ERCC1</italic> mRNA expression in a range of wild-type mouse tissues was determined by northern analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>D, upper). The 1.1 kb <italic>ERCC1</italic> mRNA was expressed at the highest level in testes and at the lowest level in liver. Western blotting, using an antibody raised against a central fragment of the mouse ERCC1 protein, revealed a different pattern of protein expression in the same wild-type tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>E, upper). The 33 kDa ERCC1 protein was again most abundant in testes, but the protein was now least abundant in heart. The liver also showed two additional, slower migrating ERCC1 protein species, presumably resulting from a liver-specific post-translational modification. We have found that our standard loading controls for blots, which involve reprobing for housekeeping genes such as <italic>GAPDH</italic> and actin, are inappropriate when different tissues are being compared. For this reason, ethidium bromide staining of northern gels and Coomassie blue staining of duplicate western gels was used to confirm that equal loadings were achieved (data not shown).</p><p>The liver-specific expression of the transgene on a wild-type background was revealed by northern analysis using an <italic>ERCC1</italic> probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>D, middle). Expression of the 1.5 kb <italic>TTR</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ERCC1</italic> transcript was strong in the liver, much higher than expression in the liver of the wild-type 1.1 kb <italic>ERCC1</italic> mRNA. However, the transgene transcript could not be detected in other tissues (but see below). The proximity of the wild-type 1.1 kb <italic>ERCC1</italic> mRNA made it impossible to exclude the possibility of low level transgene expression in other tissues. The same complication also extended to expression of the transgene on an <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient background because we have previously reported low levels of <italic>ERCC1</italic> transcripts of greater than normal size in tissues from <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c11">11</xref>). Consequently, we used a TTR probe to monitor transgene expression on an <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>D, lower). The probe detected the endogenous 0.7 kb <italic>TTR</italic> mRNA at a high level in liver and a much lower level in brain. Expression of the 1.5 kb <italic>TTR</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ERCC1</italic> transcript was specific to the liver.</p><p>Despite the presence of <italic>ERCC1</italic> transcripts, our antibody to mouse ERCC1 did not detect any ERCC1 protein in tissues from <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient mice (data not shown). Protein expression from the transgene on the <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient background was strong in the liver, higher than, but showing the same multiple species, as the endogenous protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>E, lower). In some animals, including the one shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f1">1</xref>E, a low level of transgene expression was also detected in the brain and testes (&#x0003c;5&#x00025; of the liver expression level). Thus, although all animals showed the expected high level of transgene expression in the liver, expression was not absolutely liver specific.</p><p>As the ultimate aim of this work was to increase the lifespan of our <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls, we considered it prudent to confirm that transgene expression was maintained. Northern blot analysis of liver RNA from animals (aged from 4 to 24 weeks) of four different generations confirmed that it was. Although there was some variation in the absolute level of transgene expression between liver samples (ranging from 29 to 105&#x00025; of the endogenous <italic>TTR</italic> mRNA), there was no correlation with the age of the animal or the generation from which the sample was taken.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the <italic>ERCC1</italic> transgene in the liver of ERCC1-deficient mice alleviates runting</title><p>The severe runting associated with <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c12">12</xref>). The body weights of <italic>TTR</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ERCC1</italic> transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient mice and their littermates were measured at weaning (age 21&#x02013;28 days). The average weight of a transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient mouse was 7.75 &#x000b1; 0.56 g, compared to 13.25 &#x000b1; 0.3 g for wild-type littermates. The body weight, as a percentage of the wild-type, was 58&#x00025; for the transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls, compared to the previously reported 20&#x00025; for our knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c11">11</xref>). This size difference meant that transgene-positive nulls could be readily distinguished from transgene-negative null littermates by eye (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f2">2</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the <italic>ERCC1</italic> transgene in the liver extends the lifespan of ERCC1-deficient mice</title><p>We have previously reported that our <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient mice die prematurely before weaning at 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c11">11</xref>). This is confirmed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f2">2</xref>B, where all (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5) of the transgene-negative <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls died within 24 days of birth. The transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9) showed 100&#x00025; survival up to 61 days, with all mice dying between 61 and 88 days. No wild-type littermates (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9) died within this period. Thus, the lifespan of the transgene-positive nulls has been extended to three times that of their transgene-negative <italic>ERCC1</italic> null siblings.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the <italic>ERCC1</italic> transgene in the liver corrects elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage associated with ERCC1 deficiency</title><p>Although NER deals primarily with UV-induced lesions, it also removes a broad range of endogenously generated oxidative lesions. The level of oxidative DNA damage in liver DNA was assessed by measuring the commonest oxidised base, 8-oxoG, by HPLC analysis with electrochemical detection. Levels were calculated as mol 8-oxoG&#x0002f;10<sup>5</sup> mol deoxyguanosine (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke607tb1">1</xref>). The mean value obtained for 10&#x02013;21-day-old <italic>ERCC1</italic> null liver was 9-fold higher than control littermates.

All wild-type and transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> null sections showed the typical appearance of young mouse livers, with uniformly small hepatocyte nuclei. In parallel, the DNA content of liver cell nuclei was determined by FACS analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f3">3</xref>B). The wild-type FACS profiles showed a major (G<sub>1</sub>) peak, representing the normal diploid cell population prior to DNA replication, and a much smaller (G<sub>2</sub>) peak, corresponding to cells that had undergone replication. This profile was essentially duplicated in all transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls. (The sub-G<sub>1</sub> material in the example shown reflects damage to some of the fragile hepatocyte nuclei during preparation for FACS analysis.) These profiles contrasted sharply with the profiles obtained from all the <italic>ERCC1</italic> null livers. In addition to the major peak, representing normal diploid hepatocyte nuclei in G<sub>1</sub>, there was a much larger peak corresponding to nuclei with double (4N) the normal DNA content. From centromeric staining we have previously found that most of these 4N cells are tetraploid cells in G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c20">20</xref>). Both the diploid and tetraploid G<sub>1</sub> peaks have distinct shoulders, possibly indicating the existence of cells with reduced, aneuploid DNA content. A discrete peak corresponding to nuclei with still higher DNA content (&#x0223c;8N) was also apparent. In the representative profiles shown 9.3&#x00025; of nuclei from the <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls fell into this category, compared to only 0.3 and 1&#x00025; from wild-type and transgene-positive nulls. Thus, the premature polyploidy seen in <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls has been effectively corrected by the transgene.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma analysis shows correction of hepatic function in transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls</title><p>Having shown that the transgene corrected the liver phenotype at the histological level it remained necessary to demonstrate that liver function was indeed restored.

A 2.5-fold increase in plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, normally indicative of reduced liver excretory function, was observed in the 3-week-old <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls compared to control littermates.

An increase in plasma creatinine is indicative of reduced renal excretory function.</p></sec><sec><title>Transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> null mice exhibit kidney abnormalities</title><p>The extended lifespan of our transgene-positive nulls has enabled us to study the consequences of <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency in adult tissues, other than the liver, for the first time. As expected, the level of oxidative DNA damage was elevated in the kidneys of 7&#x02013;8-week-old transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls compared to control littermates (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke607tb1">1</xref>). The 4-fold increase in 8-oxoG levels was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02 by Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). Comparison of tissue sections from transgene-positive nulls (aged 6 weeks and over) with wild-type littermates revealed no clear differences between brain, spleen, skin or liver. Plasma creatinine levels from 7-week-old transgene-positive nulls indicated a developing dysfunction in renal excretion. This was confirmed on post mortem examination of five 10-week-old transgene-positive nulls, which all revealed an accumulation of ascites fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Compared to wild-type controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f4">4</xref>A and C), kidney sections from these animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f4">4</xref>B, D and E) showed partially sclerosing glomeruli and tubular distention by protein casts, although inflammatory changes were essentially absent. There was considerable nuclear pleomorphism throughout, concentrated particularly in the proximal tubules, where many of the nuclei were also enlarged. The DNA content of kidney cell nuclei was determined by FACS analysis. FACS profiles for 10-week-old wild-type kidneys (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f4">4</xref>F) showed the typical major (G<sub>1</sub>) peak, with only 4&#x00025; of the population in G<sub>2</sub>. Cells with greater than this G<sub>2</sub> (4N) DNA content comprised &#x0003c;1&#x00025; of the population. The profile from transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> null kidneys was very different, being shifted towards nuclei with higher ploidy levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke607f4">4</xref>G). Nineteen per cent of this population had a 4N DNA content. In addition, 3&#x00025; of nuclei had a higher ploidy status (6N or 8N). Thus, having corrected the liver phenotype with an <italic>ERCC1</italic> transgene that is expressed in a liver-specific fashion, it seems likely that these animals are now succumbing to the consequences of <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency in the kidney.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The lethal liver phenotype of our <italic>ERCC1</italic> knockout mice has prevented us from studying the consequences of <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency, particularly cancer susceptibility, in a range of adult mouse tissues to assess the importance of ERCC1 in recombinational repair pathways <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show here that expression of an <italic>ERCC1</italic> transgene in the liver corrects the liver phenotype and significantly extends the lifespan of these DNA repair-deficient mice. Liver-specific <italic>ERCC1</italic> expression was achieved using a transgene under the control of the TTR gene promoter. The promoter fragment used was known to elicit high levels of hepatocyte-specific transgene expression, with expression detectable in the choroid plexus of the brain only when six or more copies of the transgene were present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c15">15</xref>). Characterisation of the founder transgenic animal and F<sub>1</sub> offspring indicated that the founder was most likely mosaic for the transgene, with an average of one or two copies of the transgene present per cell in a single array, whilst the F<sub>1</sub> animals had between three and four copies of the transgene.</p><p>Whilst it was unlikely that the transgene array here would be subject to repeat-induced silencing, as is often seen in animals with high copy number transgene arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c21">21</xref>), it remained possible that other factors, such as the chromosomal integration site, might repress transgene expression over time or in subsequent generations. For instance, age-dependent silencing of a &#x003b2;-globin driven <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c22">22</xref>). TTR-regulated <italic>ERCC1</italic> transgene expression was maintained at high levels (29&#x02013;105&#x00025; of endogenous <italic>TTR</italic> levels) in the livers of all mice through the four generations analysed and was stable throughout the life of the animals. This was of particular importance to ensure that any phenotypic correction achieved by transgene expression was maintained.</p><p>The level of transgene mRNA greatly exceeded the normal level of <italic>ERCC1</italic> transcripts in the liver. ERCC1 protein was also present at higher levels in the livers of transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls than in wild-type livers. Both transgene-encoded and endogenous ERCC1 protein showed liver-specific post-translational modifications. Although the significance of these novel protein species is uncertain, they could be involved in some liver-specific ERCC1 function which might provide an explanation for the particular sensitivity of the liver to <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency.</p><p>Over-expression of <italic>ERCC1</italic> in CHO cells resulted in hypersensitivity to a DNA crosslinking agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c23">23</xref>). An attempt to over-express <italic>ERCC1</italic> in CHO cells showed only a 4-fold increase at the protein level despite a 1000-fold increase in gene copy number and a dramatic increase in the level of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c24">24</xref>). These results raise the complication for transgenic studies that over-expression of <italic>ERCC1</italic> may be detrimental to the survival of a cell. The livers in transgene-containing <italic>ERCC1</italic> wild-type and null mice were normal by all our assay criteria. Evidently, <italic>ERCC1</italic> expression in our transgenic liver was below the level at which adverse consequences are encountered.</p><p>While expression of the transgene was high in liver it was not absolutely liver specific. Low levels of transgene transcripts and, particularly, transgene-encoded ERCC1 protein (&#x0003c;5&#x00025; of the level in liver) were observed in other tissues (particularly brain and testes) in some of the animals tested. This was not unexpected given previous reports of low levels of ectopic transgene expression from the same <italic>TTR</italic> promoter fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c25">25</xref>).</p><p>Our <italic>TTR</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ERCC1</italic> transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls survived 61&#x02013;88 days, compared to the transgene-negative null littermates that died prior to weaning at 21 days. We conclude that liver-specific transgene expression results in an increased lifespan for our <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls. The <italic>ERCC1</italic> knockout mice reported by Weeda <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c12">12</xref>) had a lifespan of 38&#x02013;78 days, depending on the genetic background, whilst mice carrying a subtle alteration lived for 2&#x02013;6 months, possibly due to some residual ERCC1 activity. In addition to the desired effect of increasing the lifespan of our nulls, there was also alleviation of the runted phenotype associated with <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency. The weight of the transgene-positive nulls was 60&#x00025; of their wild-type littermates, compared to only 20&#x00025; for the transgene-negative nulls. Whilst we believe that runting arises from the overall <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient status, this work may suggest that runting is predominantly a consequence of the effect of this DNA repair defect in the liver. If liver function is impaired in <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls the synthesis of growth hormones, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), which takes place primarily in the liver, will also be affected and may result in growth retardation as a consequence. Wistar rats with chemically induced liver damage showed a general reduction in body weight, which was alleviated by administration of IGF-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c26">26</xref>).</p><p>Levels of the commonest oxidised base, 8-oxoG, were 9-fold elevated in <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient liver and 4-fold elevated in transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> null kidney. This is the first <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstration of increased levels of endogenous DNA damage in <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency. Moreover, the elevated DNA damage levels in the liver were corrected by the <italic>ERCC1</italic> transgene. Traditionally base excision repair was considered to have the key role in removing 8-oxoG, which is strongly mutagenic and also acts as a block to transcription by RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c27">27</xref>). However, the discovery of transcription-coupled repair of 8-oxoG and the observation that this process continues to operate in <italic>OGG1</italic> null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c28">28</xref>) has, belatedly, led to the recognition that NER may also have an important role to play in the repair of 8-oxoG (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c28">28</xref>) and of another form of oxidative damage (purine cyclodeoxynucleosides; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c29">29</xref>). Nine-fold higher levels of 8-oxoG in <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient liver compared to control littermates demonstrate that ERCC1 is important for the repair of 8-oxoG, particularly considering that the levels of 8-oxoG in the livers of <italic>OGG1</italic> null mice were only 1.7-fold higher than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c30">30</xref>). Most likely the increase in 8-oxoG levels results from the lack of the NER function of ERCC1. However, in a pathway distinct from NER, XPG is involved in the repair of oxidised pyrimidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c31">31</xref>). Perhaps ERCC1 might be required for transcription-coupled repair of 8-oxoG in a similar NER-independent manner. We cannot be sure that the increased levels of oxidative damage observed are responsible for the <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient liver phenotype; other lesions (such as interstrand crosslinks) which are also recognised by ERCC1 could also be responsible. The role of NER and of ERCC1 in particular in the repair of 8-oxoG and the significance of oxidative DNA damage to the phenotype in <italic>ERCC1</italic>-deficient liver could be determined by measuring 8-oxoG levels in <italic>XPA</italic> and <italic>XPC</italic> knockout mice, which do not show the liver phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c34">34</xref>).</p><p>Liver nuclear abnormalities have been seen in all <italic>ERCC1</italic> knockout and mutant mice reported to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c12">12</xref>). We believe that the premature polyploidy in hepatocytes is a protective response to the accumulation of DNA damage that is normally repaired by ERCC1, although it could also result from the lack of another, non-repair-related function of ERCC1 that is peculiar to the liver. Expression of the liver-specific <italic>ERCC1</italic> transgene corrected the liver phenotype in our nulls. Despite this observation, it remained necessary to confirm that transgene expression also resulted in the restoration of hepatic function. The reduced liver excretory function in 3-week-old <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls, detected as a 2.5-fold increase in plasma ALP activity, was corrected in 3- and 7-week-old transgene-positive nulls. Plasma levels of bilirubin, a second measure of liver excretory function, were below the levels of detection in all samples analysed. In humans elevated bilirubin levels are only expected when the liver has lost at least half of its excretory capacity.</p><p>The plasma analysis also provided evidence for reduced mitochondrial function in 3-week-old <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls in the form of a highly significant 2-fold increase in lactate levels compared to control littermates. Lactate levels in 3-week-old transgene-positive nulls were not significantly different from controls. The increase in lactate levels in the 7-week-old transgene-positive nulls compared to control littermates could indicate that the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency is progressive and not just confined to the liver. The link between deficiency of a nuclear DNA repair enzyme and mitochondrial dysfunction remains to be established.</p><p>In addition to the liver, our original <italic>ERCC1</italic> knockout mice showed stabilisation of p53 in both brain and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c11">11</xref>). However, there was no detectable pathology in these organs immediately prior to death at 21 days. Correction of the liver phenotype has allowed us to study the developing consequences of <italic>ERCC1</italic> deficiency in these tissues in older animals. Although there was no indication of any pathology in the brains of 7-week-old transgene-positive nulls, the small (20&#x00025;) but significant increase in creatinine levels compared to controls provided the first indication of reduced renal excretory function. By 10 weeks transgene-positive nulls had excessive accumulation of ascites fluid, with damaged glomeruli and dilated or blocked proximal tubules. Similar kidney changes have been reported in an independent <italic>ERCC1</italic> knockout line with greater longevity than our own line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c12">12</xref>). We found that nuclei from proximal tubule cells were pleomorphic and many were also enlarged. Significantly, these are the same cells where p53 stabilisation was previously detected in our 3-week old <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls, although no pathology was evident at that early stage. FACS analysis revealed the existence of a large polyploid cell population in kidneys from 10-week-old transgene-positive nulls, similar to the polyploidy seen in the liver of 3-week-old <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls. Although progressively increasing ploidy is a normal feature of liver development, it is not usually seen in the kidney. However, the kidney is particularly susceptible to genotoxic agents, such as ionising radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c35">35</xref>), cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c36">36</xref>) and cadmium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c37">37</xref>), which all induce the appearance of enlarged proximal tubule cell nuclei. Elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage were found in the kidneys of transgene-positive <italic>ERCC1</italic> nulls. Having restored DNA repair capacity to the liver it seems likely that these animals now succumb to kidney failure. This is perhaps not unexpected given that the physiological role fulfilled by the kidneys would expose tubule cells to toxic and potentially DNA damaging compounds. Much of the resulting damage could not be repaired in the absence of ERCC1.</p><p>In summary, using conventional transgenesis we have succeeded in extending the lifespan of our DNA repair-deficient <italic>ERCC1</italic> null mice by correcting the runting and the novel premature polyploidy in liver. The increase in the lifespan of these repair-deficient animals has enabled us to identify an essential role for ERCC1 in kidney. We are currently using these animals to study the role of ERCC1 (and the recombinational repair pathways that it is involved in) in spermatogenesis and in the response to UV-induced DNA damage in the skin. The lifespan of the animals remains too short to study the role of ERCC1 in protecting against cancer. Mice with conditional <italic>ERCC1</italic> gene inactivation in specific tissues, induced by site-specific recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke607c38">38</xref>), will be needed to undertake these studies.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke607f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Molecular analysis of <italic>TTR</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ERCC1</italic> transgenic mice.
