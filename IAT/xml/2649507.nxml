On the contrary, no deficit was found in the learning ability to avoid an aversive event in active avoidance task. The reduced ability of <italic>Gpr3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to cope with stress was unrelated to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice showing normal corticosterone production under basal or stressful conditions.

In mouse oocytes, GPR3 contributes to maintenance of cAMP concentrations at a level required to ensure meiotic arrest in prophase I until the LH surge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Ledent1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Mehlmann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Vaccari1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether cAMP accumulation is the result of a true constitutive activity of the receptor or the consequence of the chronic stimulation by a ubiquitous unknown ligand, is still debated. Sphingosine 1-phoshate was proposed as an agonist of the rat GPR3 homologue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Hinckley1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Uhlenbrock1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> but this has not been confirmed yet.</p><p>GPR3 transcripts are also widely expressed in the mouse brain, in areas related to different physiological functions. More specifically, GPR3 receptor is expressed in the main brain structures involved in stress-related behaviors such as habenula but also hippocampus, amygdala, limbic system and cortex. Interestingly, the highest levels of expression were found in the habenula. The habenular complex is an important relay station between the limbic forebrain and the midbrain. It has been clearly shown to participate in the regulation of ascending monoamine and acetylcholine transmission towards hippocampus and frontal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Lecourtier1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Sutherland1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Serotonin and noradrenaline systems are known to play a role in the regulation of several central activities including mood and anxiety.

The maze was elevated 30 cm above the ground and placed in indirect light (100 lux). Each mouse was placed in the central zone facing one of the open arms and was observed during 5 min for three consecutive days. An arm visit was recorded when the mouse moved all four paws into the arm. The total number of visits into the closed arms, open arms and the cumulative time spent in the open arms and closed arms were registered through a video camera system (Viewpoint, Lyon, France). The percentage of time spent and the percentage of entries in the open arms were then calculated for each animal.

Together these results suggested that <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice displayed increased behavioral inhibition in a stressful novel environment, indicating an altered response to stressful events and/or an anxiety-like phenotype. The observed changes were not due to impaired motor coordination or altered skill tasks learning in <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice since both genotypes exhibited similar performance in the rota-rod test (<italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> 8.20 trials, CI 6.037&#x02013;10.363; <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> 9.00 trials, CI 6.108&#x02013;11.892).

The anxiogenic-like phenotype was confirmed by the results obtained in the elevated plus-maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004704-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). In this test, mice face a conflict between an aversion to the open arms of the maze and the motivation to explore them. <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice displayed a decrease in the percentage of entries and time spent in the open arms of the maze on the three observation days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004704-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Indeed two-way Anova calculated for the time spent in the open arm showed a significant effect of the day (F<sub>(2, 128)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;73.441, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and the genotype (F<sub>(1, 64)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;82.374, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) without interaction between these two factors. In the same way, two-way Anova for the entries in the open arm detected a significant effect of the day (F<sub>(2, 128)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8.194, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and the genotype (F<sub>(1, 64)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;109.185 <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) but no significant interaction emerged. The anxiety-like responses observed in the elevated plus-maze were similarly reversed by diazepam administration (1 mg/kg) in both genotypes. Indeed two-way Anova calculated for the time spent in the open arm showed a significant effect for the genotype (F<sub>(1, 38)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8.074, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and treatment (F<sub>(1, 38)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8.208, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) without interaction between these two factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004704-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, at the dose used (1 mg/kg, ip), diazepam did not induce significant changes in locomotor activity since the number of entries in the open arm was not significantly different in animals treated with the benzodiazepine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004704-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). To investigate whether their anxiety-like behavior was associated with aggressiveness, we evaluated <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in the resident-intruder test. <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> resident male mice exhibited a higher aggressiveness towards intruders than wild-type mice as estimated by their higher aggressiveness score in two sessions (session 1, F<sub>(1, 20)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4.016, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01; session 2 (F<sub>(1, 19)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4.016, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), and their shorter latency period for the first attack (F<sub>(1, 20)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4.501, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004704-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We next examined the <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> profiles in two different behavioral paradigms widely used to assess behavioral traits that may be related to despair behavior, the forced swim and the tail suspension tests. Both tests are based on the assumption that mice will normally try to escape from an inescapable aversive stimulus. An enhanced immobility is thought to represent a state of behavioral despair that is characteristic of depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Cryan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Porsolt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice exhibited an increase in the duration of immobility compared with wild-type mice in both behavioral models. As expected, administration of the inhibitor of serotonin reuptake fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the test) reduced the period of immobility of wild-type mice in both tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Porsolt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004704-g004">Figure 4B, C</xref>). <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice appeared to be sensitive to this dose of fluoxetine since its administration abolished statistical difference between genotypes in both tests. Two-way Anova for the forced swim test showed a significant effect for treatment (F<sub>(1, 39)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;175.05, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and interaction between treatment and genotype (F<sub>(1, 39)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10.497, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) but no genotype effect. For the tail suspension, two-way Anova revealed a significant effect for treatment (F<sub>(1, 39)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;16.254, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and genotype (F<sub>(1, 39)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11.255, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) but no significant interaction emerged. Since dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis can lead to the onset of anxiety-like behavior and depression, we compared in <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and wild-type mice the levels of serum corticosterone, the major glucocorticoid end product in rodents, both under basal conditions and in response to the stress induced by the tail suspension test. The basal corticosterone levels were comparable in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004704-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, corticosteronelevels were similarly increased after stress despite the significant increase in the duration of immobility observed for <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004704-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Two-way Anova calculated for genotype and stress exposure revealed a stress effect (F<sub>(1, 38)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14.489, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) with neither genotype effect nor interaction between the two factors. We next investigated if the altered emotional-like state exhibited by the knockouts, could alter their learning ability in an active avoidance paradigm. In this task the mouse has to learn to avoid an aversive event in response to a stimulus cue, by actively moving to a different compartment. The electric foot-shock used as aversive stimulus was found to produce similar basal reactivity in both genotypes as evaluated, in a preliminary experiment, by the changes of compartment, locomotor activity, jumps and vocalizations (data not shown). <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> exhibited a similar progressive increase in the avoidance learning performance through the five days of training as assessed by the significant increase in the number of conditioned changes in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004704-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Two-way Anova revealed a significant effect for the day (F<sub>(4, 112)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;82, 602, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) but neither genotype effect nor interaction between the two variables. Therefore, the lack of GPR3 does not seem to prevent the knockouts from adapting themselves to adverse conditions in this paradigm.</p><fig id="pone-0004704-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004704.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Spontaneous exploratory behavior in <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>Spontaneous horizontal and vertical locomotor activity under non-stressful conditions in both genotypes (<italic>n Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10; <italic>n Gpr3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) (A).

No deficits in avoidance learning were evidenced in <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, which exhibited similar performance than wild-type mice in the active avoidance paradigm. This suggests that the lack of GPR3 does not affect the learning of fear which primarily develops through a conditioned process. However, <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice exhibited a higher level of anxiety-related responses after exposure to unfamiliar stressful environment in the open-field and the elevated plus-maze paradigms, including a behavioral inhibition observed as a reduced activity in the open-field test. The anxiety-like phenotype observed in the elevated plus-maze was sensitive to the effect of benzodiazepines since the administration of diazepam reversed the anxiogenic response. In addition, an increase in the number of attacks and a decrease in the latency period for the first attack were observed in the resident-intruder test, revealing a higher level of aggressiveness in mutant mice. Thus, the behavioral phenotype argues for a possible link between emotional reactivity and aggressive behavior in mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004704-Davidson1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It also suggests that <italic>Gpr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice could be more susceptible to develop a &#x0201c;depression-related&#x0201d; behavior when exposed to a stressful situation from which they cannot escape.
