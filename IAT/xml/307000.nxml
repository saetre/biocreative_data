Although IFN activities have been described in many vertebrates, little is known about regulation of IFN- or IFN-stimulated genes in species other than human and mouse. Here, we report the cloning of a chicken cDNA, cIRF-3, encoding a protein with a DNA-binding domain similar to that found in the mammalian IRF family of proteins. Similarity between cIRF-3 and the mammalian IRFs is comparable with that between known members of the family. It is most similar to the IRF proteins ICSBP and ISGF3 gamma but is equally divergent from both. Gel mobility shift assays indicate that cIRF-3 is capable of binding a known IFN-stimulated response element that is conserved between the mammalian and chicken Mx genes. Expression of the cIRF-3 gene can be induced to high levels by poly(I).poly(C). Induction is rapid and transient with no requirement for protein synthesis. Co-treatment of cells with cycloheximide results in superinduction of cIRF-3 mRNA. The structural and regulatory characteristics of cIRF-3 indicate that it is the first example of a non-mammalian IRF protein.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0072-a" xlink:role="2142"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0072-b" xlink:role="2142"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0073-a" xlink:role="2143"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0073-b" xlink:role="2143"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2137"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2138"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2139"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0070.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2140"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2141"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2142"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0073.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2143"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0074.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2144"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0075.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2145"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0076.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2146"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
