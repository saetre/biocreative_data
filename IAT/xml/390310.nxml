It is involved in mediating the transcriptional activity of the Oct proteins. However, animals deficient for BOB.1/OBF.1 showed virtually normal expression of genes that contain octamer motifs in their regulatory regions. To identify new genes that are regulated by BOB.1/OBF.1, we took advantage of a previously described cell system. RNAs differentially expressed in a BOB.1/OBF.1-deficient pre-B cell line and a derivative of this cell line expressing a hormone dependent BOB.1/OBF.1-estrogene receptor (BobER) fusion protein were isolated. Using the cDNA representational difference analysis method we could identify myosin light chain 1 atrial (MLC1A) isoform as a gene regulated by BOB.1/OBF.1. MLC1A was so far unknown to be expressed in tissues other than muscle. Here we demonstrate that MLC1A is indeed expressed in mouse pre-B cells. Analysis of the expressed mRNA revealed an alternative 5&#x02032; promoter element and an alternative splice product, which had not yet been described for the murine gene. Cotransfection experiments with reporter constructs driven by the MLC1A promoter suggest that the regulation by BOB.1/OBF.1 is indirect. Consistent with this conclusion is the observation that transcriptional induction of the endogenous MLC1A gene by BOB.1/OBF.1 requires <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The octamer motif is a critical regulatory element for B-cell-specific transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c2">2</xref>). It is conserved in virtually all immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene promoters as well as in several immunoglobulin enhancer elements. It is essential for the B-cell-specific promoter function and contributes to B-cell-specific enhancer activity. However, a variety of ubiquitously expressed genes, such as the histone H2B gene and most U sn RNA genes, require the octamer motif for efficient expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c4">4</xref>).</p><p>B cells express two octamer binding transcription factors, Oct1 and Oct2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c5">5</xref>). Transcriptional activity conferred by the octamer motif requires additional coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c8">8</xref>). The BOB.1/OBF.1 (also named Bob.1, OBF-1 or OCA-B) coactivator interacts with either Oct1 or Oct2 and thereby activates transcription from promoter-proximal positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c12">12</xref>). Activity from distal enhancer positions specifically requires the presence of Oct2 and a further still unknown B-cell-restricted coactivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c13">13</xref>). BOB.1/OBF.1 itself does not bind to the octamer motif with high affinity, but rather is recruited into the active transcription complexes via protein&#x02013;protein interactions with the Oct proteins. It does, however, increase the selectivity of the ternary complexes for a subset of octamer motifs by making contacts with the major groove of DNA within the octamer motif and with the POU-specific domain and the POU homeodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c17">17</xref>). Furthermore, by contacting both POU subdomains simultaneously, BOB.1/OBF.1 can act as a molecular clamp that holds together these subdomains on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c18">18</xref>). A BOB.1/OBF.1 protein isoform bearing an N-terminal extension is myristylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and localized in the membrane fraction. The exact function of this BOB.1/OBF.1 isoform is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c19">19</xref>).</p><p>BOB.1/OBF.1 is expressed at all stages of B-cell development. Expression levels are highest in germinal center B cells and can be induced in resting B cells by appropriate stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c21">21</xref>). In B cells, expression of BOB.1/OBF.1 is not only regulated at the level of transcription but also at the level of protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c23">23</xref>). Furthermore, expression and function of BOB.1/OBF.1 can be induced by co-stimulation of T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Inactivation of the gene coding for the BOB.1/OBF.1 coactivator affects several stages of B-cell development. In bone marrow a reduction of transitional B cells is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c25">25</xref>). Additionally, numbers of B cells in the periphery, as well as of recirculating B cells in the bone marrow, are reduced. The most striking characteristic of BOB.1/OBF.1-deficient mice is the complete failure to form germinal centers in spleens and lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c28">28</xref>). Notably, expression of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes is not impaired in B cells from BOB.1/OBF.1-deficient mice. As a consequence, normal levels of IgM are produced, whereas the amounts of switched immunoglobulin isotypes are strongly reduced. In addition, development of marginal zone B cells is disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c29">29</xref>) and the number of apoptotic B cells is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c25">25</xref>). A bcl2 transgene can rescue all aspects of early B-cell development in BOB.1/OBF.1-deficient mice. However, terminal differentiation and function is still defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c30">30</xref>). Surprisingly, in mice simultaneously deficient for BOB.1/OBF.1 and Oct2, B cells develop up to the IgM-positive B-cell stage and immunoglobulin gene transcription was not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c31">31</xref>).</p><p>So far, only a few genes have been identified which are regulated by BOB.1/OBF.1. In B cells the expression of the BLR1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c32">32</xref>) was shown to be regulated cooperatively by the transcription factors NF-&#x003ba;B and Oct2, as well as the cofactor BOB.1/OBF.1. The CCR-5 gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c33">33</xref>) was shown to be controlled by BOB.1/OBF.1 and Oct2 in T cells. Expression of both of these genes was only partially affected by the lack of BOB.1/OBF.1. We recently searched for BOB.1/OBF.1 target genes by Chip-based expression profiling and identified a set of genes both induced and repressed by BOB.1/OBF.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c34">34</xref>). The products of these genes are involved in various aspects of B-cell physiology, such as cellular metabolism, cell adhesion and differentiation. In the present study, we used a parallel approach to search for BOB.1/OBF.1 target genes, employing the cDNA representational difference analysis (RDA) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c35">35</xref>). We identified a gene coding for the myosin light chain 1 atrial (MLC1A) isoform, which was previously described as being specifically expressed in the early development of mouse muscle cells in the embryo (MLC1emb), and in the adult mouse in heart atria (MLC1A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c39">39</xref>). Here, we show that MLC1A is expressed in murine pre-B cell lines as well as in primary pre-B cells in a BOB.1/OBF.1-dependent manner. In B cells, MLC1A transcripts are expressed using an alternative 5&#x02032;UTR as compared with the one utilized in mouse muscle cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>The BOB.1/OBF.1-deficient Abelson virus-transformed pre-B cells &#x0005b;MB10-mock and MB10-BobER stable cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c40">40</xref>)&#x0005d; were kept in Iscoves modified Dulbecco&#x02019;s medium (IMDM; Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, <sc>l</sc>-glutamate and 50 &#x000b5;M &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and grown at 37&#x000b0;C and 10&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.

In addition, they were transduced with a retrovirus, which resulted in the expression of an inducible BobER fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c40">40</xref>). In this cell line (MB10-BobER), octamer-dependent synthetic promoter and immunoglobulin promoter/enhancer driven reporter constructs were inactive, unless the activity of the BobER protein was induced by the hormone OHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c40">40</xref>). The use of this system allows us to examine B cells at the same stage of differentiation. Using this approach, differential gene expression should be caused by the transcriptional activity of the BOB.1/OBF.1 protein.</p><p>The MB10-BobER cells and, as control, the MB10-mock cell line, which was infected with the empty expression vector, were induced with OHT to avoid potential side effects of OHT. RNA was prepared from the induced cell lines and a cDNA RDA screen was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c35">35</xref>). The MB10-BobER cDNA was used as tester, the MB10-mock cDNA as driver. After three rounds of hybridization/amplification the resulting cDNAs (DPIII) were cloned into the pBluescript vector and subsequently 160 clones were sequenced.</p><p>Among these clones, we frequently found estrogen receptor sequences (&#x0223c;50&#x00025;), confirming that the cDNA RDA protocol enriched differentially expressed clones. Most of the remaining clones were single cDNA isolates and appeared not to be regulated by BOB.1/OBF.1 (data not shown). The cDNA identified most frequently (12 times) beside the estrogen receptor sequences was derived from the MLC1A gene.</p><p>The MLC1A gene was originally identified as an essential myosin light chain, specifically expressed in the murine heart atria (MLC1A, &#x02018;atrial&#x02019; isoform). Additionally, it was described as the first myosin light chain during early embryonic development in embryonic skeletal muscle, therefore, also designated as MLC1emb (&#x02018;embryonic&#x02019; isoform) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c38">38</xref>). The MLC1A gene was differentially expressed as confirmed by northern blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f1">1</xref>A). In addition to an unspecific band already present in the mock-infected cell line (see below), a second, more slowly migrating band, was observed in cells expressing the active BobER fusion protein.</p><p>In addition, several other cDNA clones were isolated repeatedly but less abundant, like alpha enolase, translation initiation factor 4E, complement protein C7 and several dehydrogenase motives. Notably, the transcripts for aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 like, the aldoketoreductase AKR1C13 and several other genes had been identified as BOB.1/OBF.1 regulated genes using a recently applied gene expression profiling approach and have been already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c34">34</xref>). Here we will focus on the analysis of the MLC1A gene.</p><p>We analyzed the influence of the hormone OHT on MLC1A expression in BobER-expressing cells. RNA was prepared from either uninfected MB10 cells, mock-infected MB10 cells or MB10 cells expressing the BobER allele (MB10-BobER), treated with OHT or left uninduced, and analyzed with the MLC1A-specific probe in northern blot experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f1">1</xref>B). As a control, RNA from PD31, an Abelson virus-transformed wild-type pre-B cell line, was included in this study. In all analyzed samples, the faster migrating non-specific band was visible, albeit at somewhat variable levels. Additionally, the MLC1A-specific (slower) band could be detected in the case of BOB.1/OBF.1-expressing PD31 cells and in OHT-treated MB10-BobER cells. In the case of PD31 cells, this expression was OHT independent as expected, whereas in BobER-expressing cells MB10-BobER, the expression of this additional band was regulated by treatment with OHT. Identical results were obtained analysing a second BobER-expressing cell clone (data not shown). To exclude a non-physiological expression of MLC1A in the Abelson virus-transformed pre-B cell lines we next analyzed primary mouse pre-B cells cultured in the presence of the cytokine IL-7 on a stromal cell layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f1">1</xref>C). Northern blot analysis revealed a strong MLC1A expression in wild-type pre-B cells. Notably, MLC1A was also detected in Oct2-deficient pre-B cells, whereas in BOB.1/OBF.1-deficient B cells no MLC1A was detectable confirming the BOB.1/OBF.1 dependence of its expression.</p><p>Since we always observed two bands in the BOB.1/OBF.1-expressing pre-B cells we asked if both of these bands are MLC1A specific. MLC1A expression in adult mice was reported to be restricted to the atrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c39">39</xref>) and should not be expressed in other tissues, for example, in fibroblasts. When we analyzed MLC1A expression in NIH/3T3 cells, in 10T fibroblast cells and in ST2 stroma cells by northern blots, only the slower migrating band could be detected (data not shown). These data indicate that the lower band is rather an unspecific hybridization than an MLC1A-specific signal. To corroborate this conclusion we used MLC1A gene-specific primers to analyze MLC1A transcripts by RT&#x02013;PCR. At high numbers of PCR cycles we observed low MLC1A expression in MB10-mock cells and a massive increase of MLC1A in MB10-BobER cells. However, no PCR product could be detected in the fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f1">1</xref>D). The specificity of the RT&#x02013;PCR was verified by sequencing the PCR products and by performing RT&#x02013;PCR with mouse atria RNA that gave a product of the same size (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the upper band observed in northern blot experiments corresponds specifically to MLC1A, whereas the lower band results from an unspecific hybridization.</p><p>As mentioned above, MLC1A, so far, was described as being expressed specifically in atria but not in other adult tissues. We were interested to determine whether MLC1A was expressed throughout the B-cell lineage and/or even in other hematopoietic cells. Therefore, we performed northern blot analysis with several additional B cell lines representing different stages of B-cell development. However, whereas the MLC1A band was present in pre-B cells, no expression was seen in cell lines representing immature B cells (WEHI 231), plasma cell stage (S194), or in T cells irrespective of whether they express BOB.1/OBF.1 (EL4) or not (BW 5147) (data not shown). In addition, we analyzed several other mature B and plasma cell lines but could not detect MLC1A expression. Furthermore, analysing lymphocytes derived from total spleen of wild-type or BOB.1/OBF.1-deficient mice by RT&#x02013;PCR no MLC1A expression could be detected even in wild-type splenocytes. In parallel, mouse atria were analyzed where MLC1A expression was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f1">1</xref>E). Since the expression level of BOB.1/OBF.1 is the highest in germinal centers, we asked whether MLC1A is also upregulated in mature IgM<sup>low</sup>IgD<sup>high</sup> CD38<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> primary human germinal center B cells. Using primers specific for the mouse, as well as for the human, MLC1A gene, RT&#x02013;PCRs were performed with cDNAs from mouse atria as a positive control or from human CD38<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> germinal center and CD38<sup>&#x02013;</sup> non-germinal center mature B cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f1">1</xref>F). No MLC1A expression could be detected either in mature germinal center cells or in non-germinal center B cells and other mature B cells. Therefore, MLC1A expression seems to be restricted to the pre-B-cell stage. This observation is not surprising, since BOB.1/OBF.1 was shown to be required at several stages of B-cell development including the pre-B-cell stage. Additionally, the target gene screen was performed using pre-B cells. Thus, identified BOB.1/OBF.1-dependent genes might be expressed and regulated only at this stage of B-cell development. This observation is reminiscent of the Oct2 target gene CRISP-3, which is expressed in pre-B cells and has not been found at later developmental B-cell stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c43">43</xref>).</p><p>MLC1A was described as being expressed in mouse atria and in the mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12. We wanted to compare the expression levels of MLC1A in pre-B cells with that in muscle cells. Northern blot experiments indeed confirmed a very strong MLC1A expression in mouse muscle cells, especially in the atria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f2">2</xref>A). This muscle-specific expression (in atrium and C2C12 cells) was significantly stronger than the MLC1A expression level found in PD31 cells. Interestingly, when we compared the sizes of MLC1A-specific bands it became clear that the pre-B-cell-specific band was slightly larger than that in the muscle cells. We reasoned that MLC1A might be alternatively spliced in mouse pre-B cells. In human skeletal muscle cells, different 5&#x02032;UTR and 3&#x02032;UTRs of the MLC1A gene are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c45">45</xref>), whereas in the mouse, so far, only one 5&#x02032;UTR has been described. We performed 5&#x02032;-RACE with RNA from the MB10-BobER cell line induced with OHT. A dominant 5&#x02032;UTR from pre-B cells was identified, which we named distal 5&#x02032;UTR since it results from an alternative upstream promoter and consequently from a splice process within the MLC1A 5&#x02032;UTR. The previously described 5&#x02032;UTR from mouse muscle cells was named proximal 5&#x02032;UTR (sequences of both 5&#x02032;UTRs are compared in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f2">2</xref>B). Therefore, the situation in mouse pre-B cells resembles that in human muscle cells, where distinct MLC1A and MLC1emb mRNAs are expressed differing in their 5&#x02032;UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c45">45</xref>). The function of the alternative transcript in humans is still unclear.</p><p>In order to analyze if both 5&#x02032;UTRs are expressed in mouse B cells, we prepared primer pairs in order to distinguish the different 5&#x02032;UTRs by RT&#x02013;PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f3">3</xref>A). Using the primer 5.1 (located in MLC1A exon 3) or 5.2 (located nearby the translation initiation signal), an MLC1A-specific PCR product should be observed in all cases, independent of the specific 5&#x02032;UTRs used. The 5.3 primer was a negative control since it is located in the region between distal and proximal promoters that is spliced out. Consequently, no PCR product should be observed. Using the primer 5.5 or 5.4 we can distinguish which 5&#x02032;UTR was used. As expected, the primers 5.1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f1">1</xref>D) and 5.2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f3">3</xref>B) revealed a signal in MB10 cells, whereas the primer 5.3 did not show a signal. The signal was much stronger in cells expressing a functional BOB.1/OBF.1 protein. Although we could detect some transcript originating from the proximal promoter, the majority of MLC1A transcripts in pre-B cells derived from the distal promoter. The use of another 5&#x02032;UTR in B cells other than in muscle cells suggests that different promoter regions are responsible for the regulation of MLC1A expression in B cells versus muscle cells.</p><p>We then addressed the question whether regulation of MLC1A expression by BOB.1/OBF.1 is direct or involves an intermediate. We generated luciferase reporter constructs, differing in the length of the MLC1A promoter &#x02013;630, &#x02013;680 or &#x02013;3000 bp. The activity of all these reporters was increased by BOB.1/OBF.1 cotransfection in NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f4">4</xref>A). The highest induced activity was found in the case of the shortest 630 bp promoter, which is consistent with the earlier observation in muscle cells that 630 bp of the mouse MLC1A promoter are sufficient to achieve a regulated expression of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c41">41</xref>). However, the basal activity of the &#x02013;630 bp promoter was also higher compared with the longer promoter constructs. Determining the absolute induction of analyzed promoters by BOB.1/OBF.1, all constructs were induced equally &#x0223c;2&#x02013;3-fold. Surprisingly, when the activity of these constructs was analyzed in MB10-BobER cells, no OHT induction of luciferase activity could be observed analyzing cells 24 h after transfection, while some induction of luciferase activity was observed upon longer incubation (data not shown). This result suggested that the activation of MLC1A gene transcription by BOB.1/OBF.1 might be indirect. Since BobER cells originally used for the presented RDA were induced with OHT for 20 h, we cannot exclude an indirect regulation of identified genes by BOB.1/OBF.1. Recently, two E-box motives were shown to be critically involved in the regulation of the MLC1A promoter, binding MyoD/E12 and myogenin/E12 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c46">46</xref>). Importantly, the known MLC1A promoter sequences do not contain recognizable octamer motifs which could mediate the regulation via BOB.1/OBF.1.</p><p>To address this issue, MB10-BobER cells were pre-incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX and induced for 12 h with OHT. Northern blot analyses revealed that CHX prevents the OHT-mediated induction of MLC1A by BOB.1/OBF.1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh327f4">4</xref>B), indicating that MLC1A indeed is indirectly regulated by BOB.1/OBF.1.</p><p>The actin&#x02013;myosin complex is the main contractile component of the muscle sarcomers. Furthermore, actin and myosin undergo reorganization in cultured mammalian non-muscle cells in response to cellular signals during various motile processes in cells, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, capping of surface receptors, vesicle transport and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c50">50</xref>).</p><p>Many functions of myosins in non-muscle cells have been described, such as cytoskeletal dynamics, which in turn are essential for cell migration and motility. Immune cells are characterized by cellular movement between compartments. Immature (transitional) B cells emerge from the bone marrow to the periphery and migrate into specific microenvironments of peripheral secondary lymphoid tissues, such as spleen and lymph nodes. Although the physical sites of B-cell precursor development and differentiation in the bone marrow remain poorly defined, it is likely that the actin&#x02013;myosin complex is also essential for B-cell motility of earlier developmental stages, e.g. to build contacts with the stromal layer, important for progenitor B cells. This hypothesis is supported by recent findings demonstrating the important role of cytoskeleton reorganization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. These processes affect adhesion and mobilization from the medullary cavity into the blood circulation and migration into lymph nodes or sites of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c52">52</xref>). Additionally, it was shown that the cytoskeletal organization that contributes to the shape of hematopoietic cells influences the transduction of growth signals through a number of externally activating signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c53">53</xref>). B cells deficient for BOB.1/OBF.1 have several defects in early development in the bone marrow and cannot properly develop into transitional B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh327c25">25</xref>). Taking together, the BOB.1/OBF.1-dependent expression of an essential myosin light chain in pre-B cells could be a novel mechanism to achieve a regulation of potential functions of actin&#x02013;myosin motility in pre-B cells, essential for development and function.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh327f1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The expression of MLC1A is dependent on BOB.1/OBF.1.
