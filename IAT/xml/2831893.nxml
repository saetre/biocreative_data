Two major mechanisms allow for creation of new genes based on existing templates: duplication of chromosomal regions containing gene loci and retrotransposition of mRNA transcripts into the genome - a process which in mammals is facilitated by active LINE-1 retrotransposons (L1s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Novel functions for processed genes, termed retrogenes, may come from the acquirement of new spatio-temporal expression patterns, dictated by the genomic context of cDNA insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, functional evolution of their regulatory sequences and coding sequences, driven by natural selection, could result in new functions within signaling networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Evidence for the latter mode of gene evolution is scarce. First of all, expression of retrogenes has only recently begun to be explored. Although expression of processed genes seems to be more common than previously anticipated, surveys are frequently limited to a single species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, the physiological consequences of altered gene expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and/or the biochemical consequences of amino acid substitutions are rarely investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we provide evidence for the functional evolution of retrogenes derived from the Ras-like GTPase, Rap1. The activity of Rap1 is dynamically controlled by many different receptor proteins, including tyrosine receptor kinases and G-protein coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These receptors regulate the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), resulting in GTP-binding of Rap1, or GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that strongly increase the hydrolyzing capacity of Rap1 and thereby inactivate Rap1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Rap1 is involved in many different morphogenetic processes e.g. by affecting the activity of cell-matrix or cell-cell adhesion receptors. In addition, Rap1 plays important physiological roles in established structures like for example the vertebrate blood vessel system. Here, an acute rise in cAMP results in immediate enhancement of the level of GTP-bound Rap1 that is crucial for an increase in vascular permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Rap1A and Rap1B are paralogs and differ only by 9 amino acids, that are mostly located at the very C-terminal part [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Rap1 proteins are highly conserved in evolution and in fact identical Rap1A as well as Rap1B proteins are found in human, chimp, macaque, cow and mouse. While both proteins are ubiquitously expressed in tissues, a differential distribution of isoforms has been observed, e.g. Rap1B protein is predominant in platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Possibly, the high level of sequence conservation and differential gene expression reflects specific functions for each of these GTPases. This would be consistent with the outcome of studies in mice with targeted disruption of Rap1 genes. Loss of Rap1B impairs platelet aggregation due to a diminished activation of &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrins. In addition, defects in endothelial cells may cause bleedings, resulting in a high percentage of embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Rap1A knockout mice are fully viable and fertile, but haematopoietic cells from the spleen and thymus adhere less efficiently to fibronectin or collagen as compared to wild type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In agreement with earlier <italic>in vitro </italic>observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], a recent work reported a reduced superoxide production in Rap1A -/- neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Double Rap1A/Rap1B knockout mice die during early embryogenesis suggesting functional overlap between the two Rap1 isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Our current study suggests that additional complexity resides within the Rap1 signaling network. We characterize here two murine-specific Rap1A retrogenes and one human-specific Rap1B retrogene that acquired limited substitutions in amino acids, including the residues G12 and A59 that were found to be mutated in oncogenic Ras isoforms. By using computational and experimental approaches we collected evidence that the species-specific events of retrotransposition and mutation created new Rap1 isoforms whose signaling capacity differs from that of their parental isoforms. We discuss potential roles for Rap1 retrogenes in cell physiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of Rap1A and Rap1B retrogenes with limited mutations</title><p>We have recently generated a Rap1A-deficient mouse strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Unexpectedly, PCR on cDNA derived from tissues of Rap1A -/- mice with a 5' primer recognizing the targeted second exon sequence and a 3' primer located in the last exon yielded products, thus suggesting the existence of another mRNA homologous to Rap1A. Indeed, we cloned two cDNAs that showed high homology to mouse Rap1A (mRap1A), yet encoded proteins with either a single or triple amino acid substitution as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. We named these genes mRap1A-retro1 (containing the mutation A59V) and mRap1A-retro2 (I9L, T35M, L96V). Based on mutational and structural analysis of Ras-like GTPases, it seemed likely that mRap1A-retro1 and mRap1A-retro2 would encode for activated (GTP-bound) versions of Rap1A.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of the mouse and human Rap1 retrogenes</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

To establish that the cloned mRap1A-retro1 and mRap1A-retro2 were not derived from amplification of genomic DNA, two control experiments were done. First, reverse transcriptase was left out of the RT-PCR reaction, which abolished amplification of the cDNAs. Secondly, the cDNAs were amplified using the Gene Racer kit, which relies on removal of the CAP from mRNA and subsequent ligation of a PCR primer to the now available phosphate group at the 5' end of the mRNA (see Methods). The RNA expression of both retrogenes was analysed in WT and Rap1A -/- organs by RT-PCR. Using PCR primers (Methods), which allow for simultaneous amplification of mRap1A-retro1, -retro2 and mRap1A mRNAs, a single PCR product of 1186 bp comprising the complete coding sequence and a large part of 3'UTR, was amplified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We identified a NlaIV restriction site unique for the mRap1A cDNA and used it to distinguish between transcripts of mRap1A-retro1, -retro2 and that of mRap1A. Digestion of the 1186 bp PCR fragment of mRap1A yielded two fragments of 213 and 973 bp. By means of this approach we could detect expression of mRap1A-retro1 and mRap1A-retro2 in multiple tissues like thymus, lungs, testis and brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Importantly, when RT-PCR was done on Rap1A -/- tissue with one primer placed in the deleted second exon (see Methods) cDNAs of both retrogenes were amplified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and data not shown). The same was observed, when primers specific for Rap1A retrogenes were used [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Supplemental Figure S1] (see Methods).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>RT PCR reaction of mRap1A and mRap1A-retro1, mRap1A-retro2 mRNA</bold>.

More specifically, database searches revealed expression of this retrogene in Ramos Burkitt's lymphoma, neuroblastoma cell lines and placental tissue, while a study by Gyan et al. detected expression in a bone marrow sample from a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As indicated above for Rap1A retrogenes, also the hRap1B-retro may encode for a Rap1 protein with elevated GTP content because of a mutation at position twelve (G12R), but no functional characterization of the encoded protein was so far undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic localization and origin of Rap1A and Rap1B retrogenes</title><p>BLAST searches with the mRap1A-retro1 cDNA sequence against the mouse genome sequence (NCBI 35) revealed that the gene is located on the antisense strand of the 14<sup>th </sup>intron of general transcription factor II H, polypeptide 1 (Gtf2 h1) gene on chromosome 7 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The mRap1A-retro1 cDNA sequence mapped to a single exon - a typical feature of retrogenes. A sequence identical to that of mRap1A-retro2 was found on an RZPD cosmid (German Science Centre for Genome Research: MPMGc121C10270Q2) that overlapped with a Celera contig, also derived from chromosome 7 and containing exons of Gtf2 h1 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Supplemental Figure S2-alignment]. (In contrast to the RZPD cosmid, the latter sequence contained a single point mutation resulting in a frame shift mutation in mRap1A-retro2, which may represent a sequencing error). Importantly, the Gtf2 h1 sequences flanking mRap1A-retro2 were not identical to those flanking mRap1A-retro1 and appeared to represent a second copy of the Gtf2 h1 gene. Both Gtf2 h1 genes appear to be transcriptionally active as is evident from two different cDNAs having intact ORFs and corresponding to Gtf2 h1a, Gtf2 h1b (Accession: 31982312 and Accession: 2582796). Importantly, mRap1A-retro1 and -retro2 retrogenes were not present in other mammalian genomes (i.e. Rap1A retrogenes were absent from the rat genome, but the Gtf2 h1 sequences flanking Rap1A retrogenes were highly homologous between mouse and rat, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Likewise, the duplicated Gtf2 h1 loci were only found in the mouse genome.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of mRap1A-retro1, mRap1A-retro2 and hRap1B-retro insertion loci</bold>. <bold>A</bold>. Existence of 2 genomic loci containing mRap1A-retro1 (Accession: EU359270) and mRap1A-retro2 (Accession: EU359271) is supported by (1) the NCBI chr.7 contig (NCBI, Accession: 20828562), (2) homologous sequences of the cellera assembly chr.7 contig (cel, Accession: 82906099) and the RZPD cosmid (csm, German Science Centre for Genome Research cosmid: MPMGc121C10270Q2) and the corresponding cDNAs of Gtf2H1a (Accession: 31982312) and Gtf2H1b (Accession: 2582796). As we resolved, by sequencing, the whole 5' UTR region of mRap1A-retro1, it is depicted as a longer message as compared to mRap1A-retro2.

Thus, Rap1A retrogenes likely split off the mouse lineage. Together, this strongly implies that an event of insertion of a Rap1A retrogene into the 14th intron of Gtf2 h1 was followed by a duplication event and that the both events date back to times after rodent speciation. After the duplication, both Rap1A retrogenes diverged by non-synonymous mutations (i.e. mutations leading to amino acid changes) in their ORF regions (see the next subchapter).</p><p>We resolved the location of the hRap1B-retro retrogene to the region within the antisense strand of the 2<sup>nd </sup>intron of SV2C (synaptic vesicle protein 2 isoform C) on chromosome 5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This Rap1B retrogene was only identified in the human genome sequence (i.e. was absent from the chimp genome), as revealed by genomic blast searches (see Methods).</p><p>Interestingly, hRap1B-retro's mRNA sequence maps to 2 exons that are separated by an intron, which was created by L1-mediated insertion of the SVA element into a preferred target site sequence (TTTT/AA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] present in human Rap1B mRNA (at 1304 nt, Accession: 58219793). We could reconstruct the insertion site for the human Rap1B retrogene based on the comparison with the chimp genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The 2<sup>nd </sup>intron of SV2C gene in the chimp genome bears the insertion site 5'-TTTT/A-3', typical of the site recognized by L1's endonuclease. Presence of target site duplications (TSDs) flanking Rap1A and Rap1B retrogenes provides further evidence for involvement of the LINE-1 retrotransposition machinery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis established that hRap1-retro and the Rap1B in human and chimp form a monophyletic group (bootstrap support of 95%, see [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Supplemental Figure S3]). This implies that hRap1B-retro arose after divergence of macaca from the ancestor of chimp and human.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional evolution scenario</title><p>Could Yang's codon evolution model provide evidence for the functionality of the retrogenes? If the retrogenes are functional, we expect that there are selective constraints on amino acid changing substitutions. As a consequence, the ratio &#x003c9; of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates should be significantly smaller than one for the retrogenes. To check that, we analyzed multiple alignments of the Rap1A and Rap1B genes with orthologs in human, chimp, macaca, dog, cow, rat, and mouse. All computational analysis described below were performed by means of the codeml program of the PAML software package (v. 3.15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Codeml assumes a time-continuous Markov process of codon evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and &#x003c9;-ratios were computed as Maximum-Likelihood-Estimates that maximize the probability to observe the multiple alignment under the assumptions specified below as outcome of the Markov process. We also computed standard deviations of the &#x003c9;-ratios by means of codeml. The assumed stationary distribution of codons was set to the one that reflects the empirical nucleotide frequencies at the three codon positions in the multiple alignment. Further, since the gene tree did not fully resolve relations between the Rap1 genes [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Supplemental Figure S3], we assumed that orthologs in the alignment have evolved along the branches of the established species phylogeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (see Methods). Because the mouse retrogenes are most similar to the mouse ortholog, as supported by the well-resolved parts of the gene tree [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Supplemental Figure S3], we assume the retrogenes split off the mouse lineage. For example, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> shows the phylogenetic tree with orthologs of Rap1A and the two retrogenes in mouse. The right hand part of the tree depicts the evolution of the two retrogenes in mouse that emerged by a retrotransposition and a duplication event. We assume the so called clades model (of PAML), i.e. the codon evolution model where the mammalian orthologs have evolved in accordance to one &#x003c9;-ratio &#x003c9;<sub>1</sub>, whereas the evolution of the retrogenes was governed by a different &#x003c9;-ratio &#x003c9;<sub>2</sub>. The multiple alignment of Rap1B genes and the respective human retrogene was modelled analogously under the clades-model. Amino acid sequences of mammalian Rap1A and Rap1B proteins are highly conserved, which is reflected in the small &#x003c9;<sub>1</sub>-values indicating strong negative selection on Rap1A and Rap1B genes. We find that, &#x003c9;<sub>2</sub>-values are much larger than the &#x003c9;<sub>1</sub>-values.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Codon evolution model of Rap1 retrogenes</bold>. <bold>A</bold>. The phylogenetic tree depicts the evolution of mammalian Rap1A orthologs and the two mouse Rap1A retrogenes. To check whether the two retrogenes are functional, we compute &#x003c9;-ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions with the clades model of PAML. We assume one &#x003c9;<sub>1</sub>-ratio for the left part of the tree whereas the evolution of recently emerged retrogenes is modelled by an individual &#x003c9;<sub>2</sub>-value. Table shows the estimated &#x003c9;-values and their standard deviations as computed by PAML. The amino acid sequences of mammalian Rap1A orthologs are fully conserved and the ML estimate &#x003c9;<sub>1 </sub>= 0.0001 is too close to zero for PAML to compute a standard deviation. <bold>B</bold>. The evolution of the two mouse Rap1A retrogenes involved a retrotransposition event and a subsequent duplication event. Vertical edge lengths in the tree dendrogram were computed by the PAML software and scale with the expected number of neutral synonymous substitutions under the 2-clades codon evolution model.

Codons at internal nodes were reconstructed by applying the Maximum Parsimony principle to single nucleotide substitutions. It can be hypothesized, that non-synonymous (T35 M) and synonymous (T35T) mutations at codon 35 observed in mRap1A-retro1 and mRap1A-retro2, respectively, result from deaminations of methylated CpG dinucleotide.

The simpler M0-model, which assumes only one &#x003c9;-ratio for the whole tree, is a special case of the clades model. Because the M0 model is nested in the clades model, the likelihood under the clades model is by definition larger or equal than the likelihood under the M0-model for every alignment. The test statistic &#x00394; of the LRT is two times the difference in log likelihoods, &#x00394; = 2 ln L(clades-model) - ln L(M0). The null assumption H<sub>0 </sub>of the LRT corresponds to the assumption that sequences in the multiple alignment had evolved according to the simpler M0-model. Then, under the null assumption H<sub>0</sub>, the expected distribution of &#x00394; is a &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>distribution with one degree of freedom. The LRT reveals for both alignments that the clades model with two &#x003c9;-ratios performs significantly better than the M0-model of codeml, computed p-values were p<sub>rap1A </sub>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-6 </sup>and p<sub>rap1B </sub>= 0.0013.</p><p>The fact that &#x003c9;-ratios are larger for retrogenes suggests that the selective pressure on the replacement of amino acids was relaxed during the evolution of the retrogenes. However, &#x003c9;<sub>2 </sub>estimates are at least two standard deviations smaller than one for both, for the alignment of Rap1A genes as well as for the alignment of Rap1B genes. Thus, synonymous substitutions, which are assumed to be neutral in Yang's codon substitution model, occurred significantly more often than non-synonymous substitutions and we argue that the evolution of retrogenes was subject to moderate selective constraints.</p><p>Interestingly, Lynch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] compared measures of &#x003c9; in paralogous genes of several eukaryotic genomes. The authors demonstrated that &#x003c9; systematically decreases in time and concluded that "early in their evolutionary history, duplicated genes tend to be under moderate selective constraints" where the range for &#x003c9; lies between values of 0.37 and 0.46. We thus argue, that the values of &#x003c9;<sub>2</sub>(Rap1A) = 0.26 and &#x003c9;<sub>2</sub>(Rap1B) = 0.33 indicate that the evolution of mRap1A-retro1, -retro2 genes and hRap1B-retro is constrained by a regime of at least "moderate selection".</p><p>The tree dendrogram of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> shows the evolution of the two mouse Rap1A retrogenes after a retrotransposition event and a subsequent duplication event. If we assume the expected number of neutral synonymous substitutions under the 2-clades codon evolution model (described above) to be proportional to the elapse of time, then it can be speculated that the duplication event occurred only shortly after the retrotransposition event. Moreover, we found evidence for a scenario according to which the mutations at codon 35 resulting in synonymous and non-synonymous (T35 M) substitutions in mRap1A-retro1 and mRap1A-retro2, respectively, were generated by deamination of methylated CpG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>).</p><p>We further employed structural analysis and functional assays to uncover evidence for the molecular basis of evolutionary pressure to conserve these genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Structure-related functional analysis</title><p>In order to functionally characterize the Rap1 retrogene encoded proteins, we first tested for their ability to bind guanine nucleotides. mRap1A-retro1 and hRap1B-retro contain mutations in 59<sup>th </sup>(in G3 motif) and 12<sup>th </sup>(in G1 motif) amino acid, respectively, that are involved in the control of interactions with the GTP ligand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

Indeed, more than ninety percent of human Rap1B-retro and about forty percent of mRap1A-retro1 was GTP-bound. mRap1A-retro2 was also almost exclusively GTP-bound. The latter is most likely explained by the mutation in the T35 located in the switch I region corresponding to the general recognition motif in the effector domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Importantly, T35 is conserved in Ras-like proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Inspection of the crystal structure of the complex between the Rap1A and the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf1 shows that T35 helps in coordinating the gamma-phosphate of GTP and the attacking water molecule required for hydrolysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Determination of the GTP/GDP ratio bound to mRap1A-retro1, -retro2 and hRap1B-retro</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Co-transfection of Rap1GAP with any of the retrogenes caused a strong decrease in the GTP/GDP ratio. However, this decrease was clearly less pronounced for mRap1A-retro2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) underlining the importance of T35 for GTP hydrolysis but also its involvement in control of interactions with target proteins. It was shown that mutations in T35 residue perturb a dynamic behavior of the switch I region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and this can affect interactions with effector proteins but also regulatory factors like GAP which bind to this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>The result above indicates that the conformations of the proteins encoded by retrogenes resemble that of active GTP-bound Rap1. GTP-bound Rap1 and Rap1-V12 are known to strongly interact with the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of RalGDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, we compared the binding of the retrogene-encoded isoforms to GST-RBD with that of Rap1A-V12 using a pull down assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The binding of hRap1B-retro and mRap1A-retro1 to RalGDS RBD was comparable to that of Rap1A-V12. In contrast, mouse mRap1A-retro2 did not significantly bind to this RBD. As discussed above, this is most likely caused by the T35 M mutation in the effector domain region that mediates the interaction with the RBD (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of activation of mRap1A-retro1, -retro2 and hRap1B-retro</bold>.

We electroporated expression vectors for the various Rap1 isoforms into HB6 cells and the next day allowed them to adhere to fibronectin-coated dishes (Methods). Both human Rap1A-V12 and human Rap1B-retro clearly increased adhesion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). As reported previously, expression of the RBD of RalGDS decreased adhesion by preventing endogenous Rap1 effectors to interact with Rap1. Strikingly, expression of mouse retrogenes did not affect adhesion positively or negatively. From this result we conclude that whereas human Rap1B-retro has dominant-active properties in terms of regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion, the mouse retrogenes are inactive in this respect.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of the effect of mRap1A-retro1, -retro2 and hRap1B-retro on cell adhesion</bold>.

In most cases they will develop into transcriptionally silent pseudogenes, which harbor mutations in their coding regions, preventing the production of functional proteins. However, if retrotransposition yields processed genes that have a distinct tempero-spatial expression pattern and/or have acquired neomorphic functions as a consequence of mutation, their presence may be advantageous to the organism and expression may be maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Indeed, a number of reports have recently appeared, suggesting that expression of processed genes (termed retrogenes) might be more common than previously anticipated. For example, the DPPA3 gene, which has been used as a marker for pluripotency, was found to have a number of related retrogenes, of which at least one was found to be expressed in adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Expressed retrogenes are not simple evolutionary relics, but can obtain essential functions as was shown for the Utp14B protein. Mutation of this autosomal gene results in juvenile spermatogonial depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>In the course of analysis of our Rap1A knockout mice, we isolated cDNAs from various tissues, corresponding to two distinct Rap1A retrogenes. The existence of Rap1-like retrogenes appears not to be unique to mice. Recently, we and others reported the existence of hRap1B-retro retrogene in human, whose expression might be linked to development of myelodysplastic syndromes and other types of leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Genomic comparisons indicated that the Rap1A and Rap1B retrogenes are species-specific and that the Rap1A retrogenes are paralogs. Interestingly, the recently emerged Rap1 retrogenes acquired limited amino acid-changing substitutions and our statistical analysis favors a scenario whereby they evolved under selective constraints on coding sequence. In this respect, hRap1B-retro (G12R, K42E) and mRap1A-retro1 (A59V) were of special interest since they had substitutions at positions 12 and 59 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which resembled those found in constitutively active oncogenic Ras proteins. Both retrogene-encoded isoforms had an increased GTP/GDP binding ratio and interacted strongly with the Ras-binding domain of RalGDS in pull-down assays. Strikingly, only hRap1B-retro increased integrin-mediated cell adhesion, whereas mRap1A-retro1 was practically inactive in this assay. Cell spreading on the other hand was increased upon over-expression of both hRap1B-retro and mRap1-retro1. These results are reminiscent of those obtained with various Rap1 mutants, generated via site directed mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In that study, Rap1A G12V appeared to be more powerful in suppressing growth of tumorigenic HT1080 cells than wild type Rap1, but its capacity to induce a flat revertant phenotype of in Ras-transformed DT cells was not strongly increased. In contrast, a Rap1A A59T mutant showed opposite characteristics with a mild effect on HT1080 proliferation but a clearly enhanced effect in the flat revertant assay. Together, these results indicate that the proteins encoded by the Rap1 retrogenes have different biological activities, and uncouple cell adhesion and cell spreading, possibly by activating distinct (sets of) Rap1 effectors. Indeed, Rap1 effectors have been described, which preferentially increase cell spreading like VAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] or both cell spreading and cell-matrix interaction like RIAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. It will be interesting to see if the Rap1 retrogene products indeed selectively interact with such effectors. The fact that Rap1 retrogene encoded proteins are in a GTP-bound state suggest that retrogene expression would allow for activation of Rap1-dependent processes in a stimulus-independent way. This phenomenon is well known in the case of Ras, where somatic mutations result in oncogenic proteins, which stimulate the ERK and PI-3K pathways in the absence of growth factors. Likewise, expression of Rap1 retrogenes may activate the above-mentioned effectors VAV or RIAM or any of the other Rap1-effectors that include diverse proteins like phospholipase C&#x003b5; or the scaffold protein AF6 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]). The precise mode by which retrogene encoded Rap1 isoforms interact with known Rap1 effectors or perhaps additional proteins will determine the physiological consequences. These may include effects on cell adhesion, important for neural pathfinding and immune surveillance or cell-cell adhesion, contributing e.g. to vascular permeability.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Collectively, the data above strongly indicate that mouse mRap1A-retro1 and human hRap1B-retro retrogenes represent recent examples of functional evolution. However, it has to be taken into consideration that not all of the described retrogenes will be selectively maintained and neo-functionalized. Indeed, we have not been able to detect a biological effect of mRap1A-retro2 over-expression. This may lend support for the scenario where mRap1A-retro2 is unlikely to escape non-functionalization.</p><p>Although it is hard to rule out that the other two retrogenes are on their way to non-functionalization, the fact that mRap1A-retro1 solely stimulates cell spreading but not adhesion, points to a unique property of this isoform. In addition, the fact that it like hRap1B-retro encodes for constitutively active protein, indicates that it can function largely independently of GEFs. Although one could argue that our current study does not reveal truly novel functions to warrant the term neo-functionalization, future studies that should try to identify downstream effectors for e.g. mRap1A-retro2 should shed further light on this issue.</p><p>It is of note that the Ras-like protein family contains at least two other members of retrogenic origin, a H-Ras retrogene named Eras, and a representative of Rap subfamily, Rap2B. Interestingly, mouse and human ERas, acquired mutations at positions 12, 59, 62 that render constitutively active proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. ERas is absent from genomes of fish and amphibians and appears to be exclusively present in mammalian genomes. Its primary function was linked to its highly specific domain of expression in mouse ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], yet expression of ERas was not detected in human ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. On the other hand, the Rap2B retrogene, originally discovered in human platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], is vastly conserved in vertebrate genomes. By contrast, Rap1 retrogenes are products of recent evolutionary events that created species-specific isoforms with differential signaling capacity. Although their physiological significance remains to be established, the fact that all of them are GTP-loaded, yet have distinct signaling capacities, shows how limited amino acid substitutions may turn recently emerged retrogenes into functionally novel genetic entities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sequences of Rap1 orthologs</title><p>The sequences of Rap1A and Rap1B orthologs were extracted using human and mouse Rap1A/B sequences (NM_145541, NM_015646) as queries in tblastx searches against the chimp, macaca, rat, dog and cow genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic comparisons</title><p>In order to identify orthologous loci of mouse Rap1A and human Rap1B retrogenes in the rat and in the chimp genomes, respectively, we utilized nucleotide and protein blast searches.

Haemaglutamin (HA)-tagged Rap1, Rap1V12 (HA-RapV12), Rap1GAP (HA-RapGAP I) have previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cell spreading assay</title><p>To measure cell spreading, A431 p120 RNAi cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] were plated on glass cover slips. The next day cells were transfected with either empty vector or pMT2HA vectors expressing the various Rap1 cDNAs and histon2B::GFP using Fugene. After 24 hours, cells were fixed and stained either for the HA-tag to confirm that GFP positive cells also expressed Rap1 protein or with TRITC phalloidin. Cell surface area was measured using the ImageJ program version 1.36b (NIH).</p></sec><sec><title>Adhesion Assay</title><p>For adhesion assays, transiently transfected Jurkat cells, serum starved overnight, were harvested, washed, and suspended in TSM buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) at a concentration of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml. 24-Well Nunc Maxisorp plates (Corning, NY, USA) were coated with fibronectin (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, washed, and blocked for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), TSM. After washing, 200 &#x003bc;l of TSM was added per well with or without the indicated stimuli. Subsequently, 200 &#x003bc;l cell suspension was added per well. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C and non-adherent cells were removed with warmed 0.5% BSA, TSM. Adherent cells were lysed and subjected to a luciferase assay as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Expression of transfected constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting of total cell lysates. Adherent cells were calculated, and the cell numbers were corrected for transfection efficiency and non-specific effects of constructs by measuring luciferase activity of total input cells ((counts in cells bound/counts in total input cells) &#x000d7; 100%).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TZ co-initiated and coordinated the project, co-identified the retrogenes, co-performed the statistical and genomic analysis and co-wrote the manuscript, MD co-identified and cloned the retrogenes, ZZ performed adhesion assays, TPaluch cloned expression vectors for the retrogenes and did the pull down experiments, HL co-performed the statistical analysis and co-wrote corresponding part of the manuscript, TPenzkofer co-performed the genomic analysis, JS participated in the initiation and coordination of the project, FZ co-initiated and coordinated the project, did the hot labeling assays and cell spreading assays and co-wrote the manuscript.
