In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, mitotic exit is driven by a protein phosphatase, Cdc14, which is in part responsible for counteracting Cdk activity. Throughout interphase, Cdc14 is sequestered in the nucleolus, but successful anaphase activates the mitotic exit network (MEN), which triggers dispersal of Cdc14 throughout the cell by a mechanism that has remained unknown. In this study, we show that a MEN component, protein kinase Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1, promotes transfer of Cdc14 to the cytoplasm and consequent exit from mitosis by direct phosphorylation of Cdc14 on serine and threonine residues adjacent to a nuclear localization signal (NLS), thereby abrogating its NLS activity. Our results define a mechanism by which the MEN promotes exit from mitosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exit from mitosis in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is characterized by a precipitous decline of B-type cyclins, dissolution of the spindle, and completion of cytokinesis. Cdc14 phosphatase plays a key role in initiating this transition by reversing Clb/Cdk phosphorylations while simultaneously promoting the destruction of B-type cyclins via the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC)&#x02013;Cdh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jaspersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Visintin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zachariae et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwab et al., 2001</xref>). To ensure that the newly duplicated genome is faithfully segregated before mitotic exit and cytokinesis, Cdc14 is sequestered in the RENT (regulator of nucleolar silencing and telophase) complex where it is tightly bound to and inhibited by Net1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Straight et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Visintin et al., 1999</xref>). The mechanisms that control dissociation of Cdc14 form Net1 fall under multiple layers of checkpoint and cell cycle control, thereby ensuring an orderly exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouck and Bloom, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Two temporally distinct mechanisms govern Cdc14 release. The 14 early anaphase release network provides a transient burst of Cdc14 phosphatase activity in early anaphase that is primarily restricted to the nucleus and promotes spindle stability, spindle elongation, and ribosomal DNA segregation. In late anaphase, the mitotic exit network (MEN) pathway affects a complete and sustained release of Cdc14 that results in its dispersal throughout the cell and drives exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jaspersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stegmeier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marston et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Amours and Amon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, Cdc14 substrates that act during late anaphase/telophase (e.g., Cdh1 and Swi5) are held in the cytoplasm until MEN is activated, whereas those that act during mid anaphase (e.g., Sli15, Ask1, and Fin1) are associated with the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moll et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jaquenoud et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pereira and Schiebel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geymonat et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Higuchi and Uhlmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Woodbury and Morgan, 2007</xref>).</p><p>MEN-dependent activation of Cdc14 is controlled by the G protein Tem1 and by protein kinases Cdc15 and Dbf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pereira and Schiebel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Visintin and Amon, 2001</xref>). Genetic and biochemical analyses of the MEN components suggest that Dbf2 and its regulatory partner Mob1 comprise the most downstream signaling component of MEN. A recent study indicates that Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 enters the nucleus during telophase and colocalizes with Cdc14 at kinetochores, suggesting that Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 could directly modify either Cdc14, Net1, or an as yet unidentified member of the nucleolar complex to initiate mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stoepel et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, a small quantity of Cdc14 appears at the cytoplasmic surface of the spindle pole body in mid anaphase. Collectively, it appears that some fraction of Cdc14 interacts with Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 before complete release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in telophase, allowing for direct control of Cdc14 activation by Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1.</p><p>Evidence that nuclear import and export play a part in restraining Cdc14 activity to telophase has been mounting. Screens designed to identify mutants that bypass the essential requirement for the MEN pathway identified alleles of <italic>KAP104</italic> and <italic>SRP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asakawa and Toh-e, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shou and Deshaies, 2002</xref>). More recently, identification of a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) within Cdc14 that contributes to its localization and function hints at a role for nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling in control of mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bembenek et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, regulation of the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> homologue of Cdc14, Clp1, may also involve cell cycle&#x02013;dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling. Although the control of mitotic exit and the biological function of the MEN pathway are surprisingly divergent in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the two species may use similar mechanisms to regulate Cdc14/Clp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trautmann and McCollum, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>The C terminus of Cdc14 contains an NLS</title><p>As described in the Introduction, several lines of evidence suggest that regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Cdc14 may play an important role in exit from mitosis. To explore this possibility, we sought to define an NLS sequence. Interestingly, the extreme C-terminal region of Cdc14 contains four pairs of basic amino acids with no intervening Asp or Glu residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To test whether this basic patch (BP) mediates nuclear localization of Cdc14, we generated a C-terminal truncation fused to GFP and expressed from the galactose-inducible <italic>GAL1,10</italic> promoter. Under the inducing conditions used for this experiment (75 min in 3% galactose at 30&#x000b0;C), Cdc14-GFP was overexpressed relative to endogenous Cdc14 by only twofold or less (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812022/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812022/DC1</ext-link>). Deletion of the C-terminal 45 amino acids of Cdc14 resulted in a pattern of localization that differed from full-length Cdc14-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The truncated protein still accumulated in the nucleolus, but a substantial fraction was distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. A larger deletion that encompasses NES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bembenek et al., 2005</xref>) partially restored the pattern seen with the full-length reporter (not depicted). These observations suggest that there is an NLS within the C-terminal 45 amino acids of Cdc14 and a second NLS within the N-terminal 345 residues. The N-terminal two thirds of the protein does not contain a recognizable NLS motif but binds to substrates, including Net1, which might piggyback Cdc14 to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>BPs near the C terminus of Cdc14 comprise an NLS.</bold> (A) Diagram of Cdc14 showing the relative positions of the type II phosphatase domain and putative NES and NLS.

Expression of this construct resulted in concentration of fluorescence in the nucleus in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In contrast, unfused GFP was evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Owing to its strong nuclear localization, we refer to this construct hereafter as NLS-GFP. The last 50 amino acids of Cdc14 contain four vicinal pairs of Args and/or Lys (BP 1&#x02013;4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) with no intervening acidic residues. Because these residues appeared to be the best candidates for an NLS, we changed Args 527, 528, 533, and 534 to Ala (BP1,2A) and compared the subcellular distribution of the wild-type and BP1,2A NLS-GFP reporters by live cell fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Mutation of BP1 and BP2 effectively eliminated concentration of the fusion protein in the nucleus of interphase cells. Thus, these pairs of Args comprise an essential determinant of the C-terminal NLS.</p></sec><sec><title>Cdc14&#x02019;s C-terminal NLS is regulated by MEN</title><p>An interesting feature of NLS-GFP is that its localization appeared to change during the cell cycle (unpublished data). An appealing hypothesis is that when MEN switches on in cells undergoing anaphase, it inactivates NLS, causing NLS-GFP to disperse throughout the cell. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the localization of the NLS-GFP reporter in wild-type and temperature-sensitive <italic>dbf2-2</italic> strains that also expressed a red fluorescent marker of the mitotic spindle, mCherry-Tub1 (&#x003b1;-tubulin). Transformants were grown at 25&#x000b0;C, induced to express the NLS-GFP reporter (90 min in 3% galactose), and shifted to 37&#x000b0;C for 45 min to inactivate <italic>dbf2-2</italic>. Cells were resuspended in TE (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA) before microscopy to arrest growth and preserve protein localization. The number of cells that exhibited cytoplasmic versus nuclear fluorescence were counted, and spindle length was measured for each cell. NLS-GFP was delocalized to the cytoplasm in 73% (<italic>n</italic> = 75) of wild-type cells with late anaphase spindles &#x0003e;5 &#x000b5;m in length as opposed to only 16% (<italic>n</italic> = 50) of <italic>dbf2-2</italic> cells with late anaphase spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), indicating that Dbf2 activity is required for the late anaphase inactivation of the C-terminal NLS. In contrast, analysis of GFP-Crz1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boustany and Cyert, 2002</xref>) revealed that nuclear export was not globally impeded in <italic>dbf2-2</italic> cells arrested in anaphase (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812022/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812022/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Cytoplasmic localization of NLS-GFP during late mitosis is dependent on MEN.</bold> (A) Localization of NLS-GFP (green) in temperature-sensitive <italic>dbf2-2</italic> and wild-type (WT) W303 grown at 37&#x000b0;C (nonpermissive). mCherry-Tub1 was imaged to identify interphase (short spindle) and late anaphase (long spindle) cells. 73% of wild-type (<italic>n</italic> = 75) cells with spindles &#x0003e;5 &#x000b5;m exhibited pancellular localization of the NLS-GFP reporter (carrot) compared with 16% of <italic>dbf2-2</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 50) cells, indicating that Dbf2 activity is required for inactivation of Cdc14&#x02019;s C-terminal NLS during late anaphase.

This revealed two dominant phosphopeptide species that were identified by tandem LC-MS/MS as TTpSAAGGIR (amino acids 535&#x02013;543) and KIpSGSIKKEA (amino acids 544&#x02013;551; Fig. S1). The extra Glu and Ala residues at the end of the second peptide were added during assembly of the recombinant construct.

Collectively, these observations suggested that Dbf2 phosphorylates residues adjacent to NLS in late mitosis, which inactivates it and results in redistribution of NLS-GFP to the cytoplasm. To test this hypothesis, we individually mutated phosphorylation sites within our NLS-GFP reporter and assayed the effects of these mutations on nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

(ii) In a MEN mutant (e.g., <italic>cdc15&#x00394;</italic>), release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus is inhibited. Those few molecules that are released and translocated to the cytoplasm fail to accumulate there because the C-terminal NLS remains active. Consequently, both the nuclear and cytoplasmic pools of Cdc14 are very low. (iii) The same as in ii is shown except that the C-terminal NLS is mutated.

Accumulation of GTP-bound Tem1 triggered by division of the nucleus along the mother&#x02013;bud axis leads to sequential activation of the protein kinases Cdc15 and Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Visintin and Amon, 2001</xref>). The activated Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 translocates to the nucleus where it comes into contact with protein phosphatase Cdc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stoepel et al., 2005</xref>). Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 phosphorylates an unknown protein to dislodge Cdc14 from Net1, resulting in diffusion of Cdc14 throughout the nucleus. Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 also phosphorylates Cdc14 on several sites that flank C-terminal NLS sequences, thereby inhibiting the NLS. Because of this, phosphorylated Cdc14 molecules that escape to the cytoplasm cannot efficiently return to the nucleus and thus linger in the cytoplasm where they can dephosphorylate substrates such as Cdh1 and Swi5. Although phosphorylated Cdh1 and Swi5 are retained in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jans et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knapp et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jaquenoud et al., 2002</xref>), the molecules dephosphorylated by cytoplasmic Cdc14 can now gain access to the nucleus, where they activate APC and expression of Sic1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Visintin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jaspersen et al., 1999</xref>). Cdh1-APC and Sic1 extinguish cyclin B&#x02013;Cdk activity, thereby enabling a return to G1 phase.</p><p>Several key pieces of evidence reported in this study support this model. First, Cdc14 contains a C-terminal NLS that is sufficient to direct localization of a GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Second, the activity of this NLS is transiently inhibited in late mitosis in a <italic>DBF2</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Third, the NLS sequences of Cdc14 are flanked by multiple consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). We can confirm by direct MS analysis that at least some of these sites are phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. S3) and are phosphorylated by purified Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;C</xref>; and Fig. S1). Fourth, mutation (to Ala) of consensus and validated Dbf2 phosphorylation sites flanking the NLS leads to a loss of <italic>DBF2</italic>-dependent regulation, such that NLS activity is no longer inhibited during late mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Fifth, this key regulatory control is not confined to the overexpressed NLS reporter, as it can also be observed with full-length Cdc14 expressed at subendogenous levels. Although wild-type Cdc14 is dispersed throughout the cell during late anaphase in a MEN-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Visintin et al., 1999</xref>), a mutant with a nonphosphorylatable C-terminal NLS is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>). The role of regulated nuclear transport in control of mitotic exit described in this study adds to a long list of processes that are known to be controlled by phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of NLS activity, dating back to the observation that phosphorylation of consensus Cdk phosphorylation sites adjacent to NLS of Swi5 blocks its uptake into the nucleus during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moll et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>The behavior of Cdc14 NLS mutants suggests that MEN promotes exit from mitosis by at least two distinct mechanisms. This interpretation is based on the observation that cells can be sustained by an allele of Cdc14 in which the Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 phosphorylation sites have been changed to Ala (Fig. S4). Further support is provided by the observation that a phosphomimetic mutant (<italic>CDC14-PS1,2E</italic>) can bypass <italic>cdc15&#x00394;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>) when expressed from a <italic>CEN</italic> plasmid. If Cdc14 is the only target (or the only essential target) of Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1, a nonphosphorylatable allele of Cdc14 should mimic a <italic>dbf2</italic> loss of function mutant. This is clearly not the case, which suggests the existence of a second activity for Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 that can promote exit from mitosis even if Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 cannot phosphorylate the C-terminal NLS of Cdc14 and is required for exit from mitosis even if the C-terminal NLS is inactivated by mutation. However, it is clear that phosphorylation of Cdc14&#x02019;s NLS contributes to mitotic exit because a mutant lacking these phosphorylation sites is unable to recover efficiently from a <italic>cdc15ts</italic> block and resume exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A&#x02013;C</xref>).</p><p>The work presented in this study represents a significant step forward in our understanding of exit from mitosis, in which we identify Cdc14 as the first known substrate of Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1. Our findings thereby yield the first mechanistic insights into how this protein kinase acts directly to trigger mitotic exit, which is a topic that has remained an enigma since it was first discovered nearly a decade ago that Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 underlies the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus during late anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Visintin et al., 1999</xref>). However, a complete description of the molecular basis for the exit from mitosis awaits identification of the additional mechanisms mobilized by Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1. What is the best candidate for this mechanism? Our data indicate that even though Cdc14 that lacks Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 phosphorylation sites is not efficiently localized to the cytoplasm during late mitosis, it is nevertheless released from the nucleolar tether protein Net1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). This implies that the other way in which Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 acts is to disrupt the Cdc14&#x02013;Net1 complex. A Cdc14 mutant lacking the C-terminal phosphorylation sites is essentially not a substrate for Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>), but the corresponding phosphomimetic mutant still localizes primarily to the nucleolus in interphase cells (not depicted), suggesting that these phosphorylations do not disrupt the Cdc14&#x02013;Net1 complex. If Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 activates parallel mechanisms to secure mitotic exit, then its second target need not be essential. Multiple proteins implicated in regulator of nucleolar silencing and telophase formation or function are plausible targets, including RNA Pol I, Sir2, Spo12, and Net1. Indeed, Net1 was identified in an in vitro proteomic screen for Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mah et al., 2005</xref>). Evaluation of this possibility will require analysis of Net1 phosphorylation during exit from mitosis and phenotypic characterization of PS mutants.</p><p>A question posed by our results that remains unresolved is why is cytoplasmic retention of Cdc14 not essential for exit from mitosis? We consider two potential explanations. First, the <italic>CDC14-PS1,2A</italic> mutant may not be a complete PS null. We have attempted to address this by eliminating all three PS clusters, but mutations in PS3 have the paradoxical effect of suppressing <italic>cdc15ts</italic> (unpublished data), pointing to either a nonspecific effect of the mutations or further complexity in the regulation of Cdc14. Our second explanation relies on the notion that Cdc14 is constantly being exported to the cytoplasm during mitotic exit. Even though Cdc14-PS1,2A molecules are quickly resequestered in the nucleus as a result of action of the uninhibitable mutant C-terminal NLS, they may nonetheless be capable of exerting activity on their substrates during their brief sojourn in the cytoplasm. According to this viewpoint, the chief function of the regulatory circuit we have uncovered in this study is to delay the return of Cdc14 to the nucleus, thereby allowing it to achieve a higher concentration in the cytoplasm. Although this increase would not be as robust in <italic>cdc14-PS1,2A</italic> cells, it could be sufficient to exceed a threshold level of cytoplasmic Cdc14 activity to enable exit from mitosis unless the other activities of the Cdc15&#x02013;Dbf2&#x02013;Mob1 module have been circumscribed.</p><p>While this manuscript was in revision, a paper appeared from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Chen et al. (2008)</xref> on the phosphorylation of Clp1 by Sid2. Clp1 is the <italic>S. pombe</italic> homologue of Cdc14, and Sid2 is a homologue of Dbf2. Although <italic>S. pombe</italic> contains a pathway very similar to MEN, in fission yeast, this pathway controls the initiation of septation and not exit from mitosis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Chen et al. (2008)</xref> show that Sid2 phosphorylates Clp1 on a cluster of sites in vitro and in vivo. The 14-3-3 protein Rad24 binds to phospho-Clp1, which retains Clp1 in the cytoplasm throughout cytokinesis. A nonphosphorylatable mutant, Clp1, returns to the nucleus prematurely during cytokinesis, and this renders the cells sensitive to perturbations of the cytokinetic machinery. There are some interesting differences in the phosphorylation sites of Cdc14 and Clp1. Although the target region of Clp1 spans &#x0223c;125 residues and has a significant content of basic (10 Lys and Arg) and acidic (11 Glu and Asp) residues, the target region of Cdc14 is compact, with all sites clustered within a stretch of 25 amino acids (lacking Asp or Glu) and tightly interdigitated with four pairs of Lys or Arg that have NLS activity. NLS for Clp1 has not been mapped. It could be that both yeasts use different strategies to retain Cdc14/Clp1 in the cytoplasm during exit from mitosis/cytokinesis or that a combination of phosphorylation and binding of 14-3-3 protein inactivates a C-terminal NLS in both proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>All strains were made in the W303 background (<italic>can1-100</italic>,<italic> leu2-3</italic>,<italic> his3-11</italic>,<italic> trp1-1</italic>,<italic> ura3-1</italic>, and<italic> ade2-1</italic>).
