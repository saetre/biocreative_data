In parallel, we determined the response to steady state overexpression of MYCN and MYCN&#x00394;MBII in the same cell type. An overlapping set of 398 genes from the two protocols was designated a &#x02018;Core MYC Signature&#x02019; and used for further analysis. Comparison of the Core MYC Signature to a published study of the genes induced by serum stimulation revealed that only 7.4&#x00025; of the Core MYC Signature genes are in the Core Serum Response and display similar expression changes to both MYC and serum. Furthermore, more than 50&#x00025; of the Core MYC Signature genes were not influenced by serum stimulation. In contrast, comparison to a panel of breast cancers revealed a strong concordance in gene expression between the Core MYC Signature and the basal-like breast tumor subtype, which is a subtype with poor prognosis. This concordance was supported by the higher average level of MYC expression in the same tumor samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The Core MYC Signature has clinical relevance as this profile can be used to deduce an underlying genetic program that is likely to contribute to a clinical phenotype.

MYC is a transcription factor that can both positively and negatively regulate target gene expression (review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Dang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>). Enormous strides have been made in understanding the biochemical properties of the MYC protein. Several nuclear cofactors such as TRRAP, RUVBL1/Tip49, p300 and SKP2 have been shown to be required for MYC induced transformation or transactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-McMahon1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-vonderLehr1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. A large list of MYC target genes forms the core of a publicly available MYC database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Zeller1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, exhaustive studies have recognized MYC's ability to increase cellular proliferation, transformation, apoptosis, and genetic instability, as well as to inhibit cellular differentiation (reviewed in references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Dang2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Pelengaris1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>). Despite these advances, the extraordinarily complex cellular responses to MYC expression has made it difficult to decipher the target genes that mediate these biological activities.</p><p>When translocated, amplified or misregulated, MYC can function as a potent oncogene, and it is estimated that 20&#x00025; of all human cancers harbor an oncogenic allele of MYC (review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Nesbit1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>). MYC deregulation has been directly implicated in many specific types of cancer, including breast cancer. An early example of aberrant MYC expression in breast tumor tissue described gene amplification in 32&#x00025; of 121 breast tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Escot1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. A comprehensive review finds a consistent link between breast cancer and MYC amplification or overexpression. These and other data linking MYC deregulation with malignant transformation unequivocally reveal MYC's oncogenic potency, however the underlying transcriptional mechanisms driving transformation remain unresolved.</p><p>MYC overexpressing cells exhibit reduced dependence on serum for rapid proliferation and survival in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Armelin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Keath1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. It is commonly believed that MYC enables cells to develop such independence by directly or indirectly inducing or repressing those genes that are normally regulated by serum stimulation. However, there has never been a systematic analysis of this question. In vivo, most cells experience serum stimulation normally only in the context of local injury. The gene expression program in fibroblasts in response to serum exhibits many features of the wound healing response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Iyer1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Motivated by the observation that wound healing and tumor growth share many common physiological characteristics (review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Bissell1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>), Chang and colleagues showed that the expression of the serum response in cancer cells is a predicator of cancer patient survival and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Chang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, they propose a model in which the wound signature in breast cancer is induced by the coordinate amplification of MYC and CSN5, a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Adler1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>New technologies are beginning to permit a better appreciation of the complexity of the cellular response to MYC. Numerous high-throughput studies querying MYC regulated genes have recently been published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Coller1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Zeller2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. While many studies have focused on the discovery of MYC target genes, few have examined the complete cellular transcriptional changes induced by MYC. Interestingly, different studies identify very different MYC responsive genes. Many experimental variables like cell type, MYC protein levels, length of time of aberrant MYC expression, etc. are likely to account for the study-to-study discrepancies. In this study, we have attempted to define a core MYC-responsive gene expression signature that is less subject to many of the common experimental variables. We identified a gene expression signature common to two cell culture models of MYC overexpression and compare this profile to the gene expression data from the serum response and from primary human breast tumors. This approach allowed us to isolate the transcriptional response to MYC in a controlled system and to then show that the core MYC signature is present in a gene expression data set of breast cancer samples, which identifies the basal subtype of breast cancer and may indicate one of the genetic determinants of this group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell Culture, Transfection and Retroviral Infection</title><p>MYCN-ER<sup>TM</sup> was created as a fusion between mouse MYCN C-terminus and a portion of the estrogen receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Littlewood1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

The MYC Target Gene database includes MYC responsive genes identified in independent studies by SAGE, DNA microarray, subtractive hybridization, ChIP, northern/western blot or RT-PCR. To compare the MYCN-ER responsive genes and the steady state MYCN responsive genes with a current compilation of MYC targets in the MYC Target Gene database, we mapped MYCN responsive genes identified here, and those found in the MYC cancer database to UNIGENE cluster IDs. The total number of target genes from the MYC database is the number of genes in the database that map to a unique UNIGENE ID (UNIGENE Build 219) and that were represented on the Agilent microarrays (1,378 genes). Similarly, the number of MYCN-ER responsive (1,449 genes) or MYCN responsive genes (1,407 genes) is the number of responsive probes that map to unique UNIGENE clusters (UNIGENE build 219). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006693-g002">Figure 2</xref>, we compare these data in a Venn diagram.

We noticed that a substantial number of these non-overlapping genes were apparently responsive in both studies. Further analysis shows that while many of theses genes do respond in both studies, the response is weak or noisy in one study thereby not passing the previously decided criteria for MYCN responsiveness. Lowering the thresholds for MYCN responsiveness leads to a larger group of overlapping genes. One explanation for these differences could be the kinetics of target gene response. MYCN-ER is activated transiently for a few hours whereas the steady state cells took three weeks of continuous culture to expand the polyclonal population. Short term versus long-term response to high MYCN levels could alter the magnitude and spectrum of the gene expression profiles.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>MYCN responsive genes</title><p>Gene Ontology (GO) terms allow gene lists to be interrogated for the overrepresentation of specific biological processes.

First, the number of repressed genes forms a significant portion of the complete transcriptional response. In the MYCN-ER experiments, approximately 48&#x00025; of the response corresponds to repressed genes. In the MYCN steady state experiments, approximately 41&#x00025; of the MYC response is composed of repressed genes. Second, a substantial fraction of the repression response initiated by MYCN-ER activation occurred as rapidly as the earliest induction response. Rapid repression will only be observed for genes with rapid mRNA turnover, so repressed genes may be underrepresented in the early points of a time course. For example, PDGFR-alpha peptide (platelet derived growth factor receptor, alpha peptide 1), DUSP1 (dual specific phosphatase 1) and ARHE (Ras homolog gene family member E) show a repression response after only two hours of MYCN-ER activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006693-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Specifically, we thought that MYCN would induce genes that are called delayed early response genes. Delayed early response genes are defined as those that are dependent on the initial induction of a transcriptional regulator or signaling pathway. This initial transcriptional response subsequently induces a secondary set of genes that are not induced by the primary signal. These expectations were met for a fraction of the CSR genes that could be mapped to our array platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006693-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). A set of genes (80 out of 354; 23&#x00025;) is induced both by MYCN and by serum, and the kinetics of induction in the CSR are consistent with these genes being downstream of MYC. In the serum induced gene profiles, the c-MYC gene itself is induced at 2&#x02013;4 hr, similar to the response described in numerous studies. However, in the MYCN-ER and steady state overexpression profiles, the c-MYC gene itself scores as repressed due to autoregulation. It is important to add that although there is an overlap between the CSR and MYCN induction, many of the CSR genes would not have passed the threshold as MYC targets in either the kinetic or steady state experiments. Not surprisingly, many CSR genes are not MYCN responsive, implying that these genes are regulated by MYC independent pathways or require some combinatorial signal.</p><fig id="pone-0006693-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006693.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Serum stimulation vs. MYC overexpression.</title><p>A.

To explore relative differences in MYC RNA levels across the tumors, we displayed the median centered data for MYC in a histogram below the tumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006693-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Among the tumor samples, the basal tumors have the highest average MYC levels. Furthermore, the general expression pattern (induced or repressed) of Core MYC signature genes in the basal tumors most closely parallels the response of these genes to ectopic MYCN expression in primary fibroblasts. Interestingly, some of the normal breast tissue samples that cluster on the right (blue) branch of the array dendrogram have relatively high MYC expression but display an expression profile that is clearly distinct from the samples in the left cluster of mostly basal-like tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Detecting the presence of the Core MYC signature</title><p>To quantify the relationship between the Core MYC signature response and the expression profile of an individual tissue, we first calculated a Core MYC signature centroid to which the resemblance of each expression profile is calculated as a Pearson's correlation. A similar strategy was previously employed to calculate the presence of the &#x0201c;wound signature&#x0201d; in tumor expression profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Chang2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, we use this correlation value as a means to describe the presence of the Core MYC signature in a given sample. However, it is difficult to decide a threshold correlation value above which one would classify a sample as definitively displaying the Core MYC signature. For comparison, the absolute value of a correlation score describing the presence of the wound signature in a tumor sample of greater than 0.15 had substantial predictive clinical consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Chang2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The Pearson correlations between the MYC centroid and breast tumor expression profiles are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006693-g005">Figure 5C</xref>. The left and right clusters display average correlation scores of 0.16, and &#x02212;0.13, respectively. In the left cluster, most tumors had a positive correlation score and some tumors had correlation scores greater than 0.5.</p><p>To more objectively search for associations between the Core MYC signature and tumor subtype, we created an &#x0201c;average expression profile&#x0201d; for each patient across the Core MYC signature genes by simply deriving an average expression value across all Core MYC signature genes for each sample. Next, the patients were put into rank expression order based upon this average Core MYC signature expression value. The patients were then put into either the &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; Core MYC signature expression groups based upon a 50/50 split of the samples. Using chi-squared analyses where the distinction of high vs. low is compared to the classification of intrinsic subtype in the Hu et al. set of 146 samples analyzed, a statistically significant relationship between the Core MYC signature average expression and subtype was observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006693-t005">Table 5</xref>); the higher average expression was most commonly seen in the basal-like tumors that frequently show 8q24 amplification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Chin1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, and the lower average expression was observed more often in the good outcome Luminal A subtype. Similar results were obtained when an identical analysis was performed on the NKI295 sample set of van't Veer et al., and van de Vijver et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-vantVeer1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-vandeVijver1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006693-t006">Table 6</xref>). Lastly, using this Core MYC signature average profile and the distinction of &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; expression, we conducted Kaplan Meier survival analyses in both the Hu et al. and van de Vijver et al. data sets, which suggested that this profile by itself may be of prognostic significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006693-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The classification of tumor samples into &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; expression yielded starkly different survival curves in the Hu et al. data set, while the differences in survival curves in the NKI295 sample set were significant, yet decidedly more subtle. The reason for this difference in the two data sets is likely due to the difference in microarray platforms used in these studies. The Hu et al. study utilized the identical microarray platform as this MYC study permitting greater overlap of genes for subsequent survival analysis. The NKI295 samples sets were analyzed on a different microarray platform that provided a reduced set of overlapping genes for the survival analysis.</p><fig id="pone-0006693-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006693.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Kaplan Meier survival analyses in the Hu et al. and NKI datasets.</title><p>Patients from the Hu et al.

This sample set represents a group of breast tumors that were analyzed using RNA recovered from fresh frozen material and for which paraffin-embedded materials were also available for protein expression studies. We performed IHC on 26 tumors in total, which included 11 Basal-like, 3 HER2&#x0002b;/ER&#x02212; and 12 Luminal/ER&#x0002b; tumors using antibodies against MYC. Representative IHC images of a basal-like tumor and normal breast tissue are shown in Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006693.s003">Figure S3</xref>. Ten out of eleven of the basal-like tumors were positive for MYC, as were two out of three HER2&#x0002b;/ER&#x02212;. In contrast ten out of twelve Luminal/ER&#x0002b; tumors were negative for MYC. As was seen in the gene expression studies, significant expression of MYC was also seen in normal breast epithelial tissue (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006693-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These protein expression results corroborate the gene expression results for MYC itself and support the conclusion that the MYC gene expression signature is a common, and perhaps critical, characteristic of basal-like breast tumors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The fact that nearly all mammalian cell proliferation is contingent on the expression of at least one MYC family protein hints at the central role that MYC plays in normal growth. Given its critical role in proliferation, it is not surprising that aberrant or deregulated MYC expression participates in the malignant transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. Numerous high-throughput studies querying MYC regulated genes have been published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Coller1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Watson1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Zhang1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps surprisingly, little overlap in target genes is found among all the studies. A trivial but important reason for part of the non-overlap is that the genes on the microarrays were different from study to study. As newer microarray platforms and approaches have permitted complete or near complete genome wide inquiry, this problem may be resolved. Numerous other possible explanations stem from methodological differences including choice of cell type, the levels of MYC overexpression, time of overexpression, and the choice of MYC family member as the exogenous transgene. We show here that the response to MYC can vary significantly even in a single cell type (primary human fibroblasts) depending on the timing and dosage of MYC delivery (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006693.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The use of an estrogen receptor offers the advantage of a rapid kinetic response, yet the artificial nature of the fusion protein may alter the target gene response compared to wt MYC. On the other hand, constitutive MYC expression may induce a broad change in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional program that includes many indirect effects. We sought to overcome the limitations of each technique by focusing on genes that responded to MYC induction in two independent protocols within the same cell type. Both protocols show that MBII is critical for the full induction and repression of the majority of MYC responsive genes.</p><p>After defining a Core MYC signature, we compared the transcriptional response in fibroblasts between MYCN overexpression and serum stimulation. This is of particular relevance because MYC is an immediate early serum response gene, i.e. induced by serum stimulation even in the absence of protein synthesis. We anticipated that a significant fraction of the Core MYC signature would be part of the serum response, perhaps focused on a &#x02018;delayed early&#x02019; gene set that is dependent on prior MYC expression. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that overexpression of MYC can bypass the need for serum growth factors. We were surprised to find that only a fraction of the Core MYC signature (10&#x00025;) falls within the core serum response gene set, which was also derived from primary human fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Chang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the response to MYC and serum is sometimes in opposite directions for individual genes. Nevertheless, 23&#x00025; of the induced CSR genes are also MYC induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006693-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). There are at least three possible explanations for this observation (which are not mutually exclusive). First, serum is a heterogeneous stimulus that is likely to activate many different pathways. The final expression levels of genes may be the consequence of the additive or competing regulatory influences of different pathways. Hence, while serum stimulation induces MYC expression, which may alone lead to the activation of a gene, other serum activated pathways may lead to a repressive regulatory influences on that same gene. Second, deregulated MYC expression afforded by the viral LTR and/or ER domain may exceed the level of MYC protein induced by serum. MYC/Max binding to promoter sites is dependent on expression level, with more sites occupied at higher MYC levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is not yet clear if elevated levels of MYC lead to novel responsive genes or simply an exaggerated response. Third, experimental differences in this study and the CSR study may account for differences observed in the Myc signature and the serum response. Some serum regulated genes (which are also Myc regulated) may have achieved their maximum response before Myc was overexpressed in our system since cells were not serum starved before MYCN-ER activation. However, the bulk of the Myc signature genes (genes whose transcripts do change with MYCN overexpression in the presence of serum) do not have the cognate response to serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006693-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). It is clear that the cellular response to MYC alone is qualitatively distinct from a serum response, with a wide range of genes activated and repressed that are normally unaffected by serum growth factors. A previous study reached a similar conclusion that MYC induction and serum stimulation were distinct using a B cell model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Schlosser2">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While many studies have focused on the discovery of MYC target genes, few have examined the genome-wide transcriptional changes induced by MYC. A recent study of gene expression in a murine model of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) created by targeting MYC overexpression to the prostate has defined a prostate cancer specific MYC induced gene expression signature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-EllwoodYen1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. In another study, analysis of gene expression profiles of neuroblastomas identified coordination between high MYCN levels and high levels of another oncogene, H-Twist, that functions to antagonize MYCN's proapoptotic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-ValsesiaWittmann1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, Adler et al. show that the underlying drivers of the wound signature in human breast cancer were the amplification of MYC and CSN5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Adler1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The wound signature is most robustly recapitulated by the overexpression of both MYC and CSN5. In most of these studies, comparison between normal tissues with low MYC levels to tumor tissues with high MYC levels was used to define the MYC dependent gene expression profile. Because the comparisons are to tumors with high MYC expression that are likely to have suffered multiple other genetic lesions, these strategies reveal the transcriptional profile after all genetic lesions have occurred, not just those associated with MYC activation alone. Since the Core MYC signature defined in the present study includes both kinetic data and an enrichment for MYC/Max binding sites, it is more likely to contain direct MYC targets. A fundamental MYC gene expression profile may be broadly relevant to different types of MYC-driven tumors and should facilitate elucidation of the complex cellular responses that mediate the biological activities of the MYC protein.</p><p>A key finding of this study is the distinct correlation between the Core MYC signature and tumors of the basal-like subtype of breast cancer. Our IHC data corroborate the association between high MYC expression and the basal-like tumor subtype, and this strongly suggests a common underlying biological program in effect in both the basal-like tumors and the MYC induced fibroblast cells. From these data it is not formally possible to conclude that expression of the Core MYC signature orchestrates the typically aggressive behavior of the basal-like breast tumors; however, it is likely that this expression profile is not inconsequential. In support of this direct link is the finding that MYC mRNA expression and the Core MYC signature are linked to basal-like tumors in two different patient data sets, and in both bases, the Core MYC signature is also of prognostic value. Further support for a link between MYC and basal-like breast cancers comes from studies of the transformation of human mammary epithelial cells (which are basal-like cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Perou1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Perou2">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>) with hTERT, SV40 T-antigen and H-Ras. Transformation was frequently accompanied with the amplification of MYC, suggesting that even in the presence of multiple other oncogenes, amplification of MYC is still required to transform this basal-like cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Elenbaas1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, high levels of MYC can partially transform immortalized human mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Cowling3">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. A recent meta-analysis study further supports elevated MYC and E2F activity in the basal-subtype tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Alles1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Lastly, it has also been shown that MYC is amplified in many BRCA1-associated tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Grushko1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>, which are known to be mostly basal-like tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006693-Sorlie1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, basal-like mammary epithelial cells are exquisitely sensitive to MYC overexpression, and it is likely that MYC is a significant etiological factor in the development of this subtype of breast tumor.</p><p>In conclusion, using two different cell culture models of aberrant MYCN expression, we have defined a fundamental gene expression profile that is less subject to many of the common experimental variables. The Core MYC Signature is distinct from the Core Serum Response, yet the two profiles share statistically significant gene expression responses. The Core MYC Signature has clinical relevance as this profile is identified in the basal-like subtype of breast cancer expression profiles, which typically harbor the highest levels of MYC expression among the different breast cancer subtypes. Importantly, the Core MYC signature can be used to deduce an underlying genetic program that is likely to powerfully contribute to a clinical phenotype. Therefore, the presence of the Core MYC Signature may predict clinical responsiveness to drugs that are designed to disrupt MYC-mediated phenotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006693.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Analysis of expression from transgenes Whole cell lysates of primary human fibroblast cells infected with pLPCX (lane 1) pLPC-MYCN-ER (lane 2), and pLPC-MYCN(del-MBII)-ER (lane 3) were resolved by PAGE and transferred to PVDF for western blot analysis.
