Numerous disorders in the immune system and abnormalities in cytokine productions have been described in patients with SLE. The exact pathological mechanisms are still obscure, however, and the roles of the cytokines are not well understood. High levels of TNF, type I interferon, and type II interferon in the sera of patients with SLE have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. On the other hand, an impaired production of IL-12 by T lymphocytes from SLE patients <italic>in vitro </italic>has also been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Cytokines are pleiotropic in their biological activity, and it is known that our immunity is regulated by highly sophisticated cytokine networks. Comprehending the pathological roles of these abnormally induced cytokines and immunoregulatory networks of cytokines in SLE patients is therefore important so that appropriate treatment can be offered.</p><p>The microarray is a powerful tool to exhaustively investigate the gene expressions of autoimmune diseases that have complex pathogenesis and heterogeneous manifestations, such as SLE. So too are the various databases and bioinformatics tools such as gene ontology analysis, which can functionally categorize genes, or network-based analysis to investigate molecule interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These tools have proven useful to further analyze the enormous data from microarray analysis, providing several new findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Most microarray analyses in SLE have been performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) while recent studies provide strong evidence that IFN-related genes are overexpressed in SLE patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the present study, to investigate the abnormal immune system in SLE, we focused on genes in the functional category of immune response differentially expressed in SLE patients compared with healthy individuals. Our results using SLE whole blood showed definite overexpression of IFN-regulated genes in this category. As molecules in the immune response category are always communicating with each other, we performed a network-based analysis to identify aberrant regulations or interactions among differentially expressed molecules observed in this study. We also investigated the effect of interactions between IFN&#x003b1; and one of TNF, IFN&#x003b3;, or &#x003b2;-estradiol (E2) on the expression of these molecules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and healthy individuals</title><p>Eleven patients (all women, median age 35 years, range 27 to 72 years) with SLE fulfilled by the diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and six healthy women were enrolled in the present study after obtaining their written informed consent.

Amino allyl RNA (aRNA) was synthesized from 1 &#x003bc;g total RNA using the Amino Allyl MessageAmp&#x02122; aRNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Five micrograms of aRNA from each sample (11 SLE patients and six healthy control individuals) and the equivalent quantity of reference aRNA from a mixture of RNA extracted from peripheral blood of 12 healthy women were subjected to Cy3 and Cy5 labeling, respectively.

The intensities of no-probe spots were used as the background. The median and standard deviation of background levels were calculated. Genes whose intensities were less than the median plus two standard deviations of the background level were identified as null. The Cy3/Cy5 ratios of all spots on the DNA microarray were normalized by the global ratio median. Genes with at least 80% good data across each group of samples were selected for further analysis.

Twenty-three out of the 38 downregulated genes were included in the first network, including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) complex and NF&#x003ba;B complex depicted at the center of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>. p38 MAPK is phosphorylated in response to inflammatory cytokines including IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and TNF. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK contributes to the activation of NF&#x003ba;B, which regulates the gene expression of various cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although TNF was not identified in this network, we found that most of the molecules were TNF-regulated &#x02013; including cell surface antigens (CD40, CD14, CD1C), chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 7, and acute phase proteins such as serum amyloid A<sub>1 </sub>and apelin. These data, together with a previous report of increased TNF levels in the serum of SLE patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], suggested that an abnormality in TNF signaling might exist. Meanwhile, a cluster of MHC class II genes consisting of HLA-DRA, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and CD74 (also known as HLA-DRG) were also identified in this network. The second network, composed of nine downregulated genes, implied that there were interactions among TNF, IFN&#x003b3;, IL-2, IL-4, and E2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Network-based analysis of downregulated genes in the functional category of immune response</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Network 1 and <bold>(b) </bold>Network 2 constructed by downregulated genes. <bold>(c) </bold>Network graphical representation.

The first network, constructed by 25 upregulated molecules, was the network with p38 MAPK, NF&#x003ba;B, and TNF receptor depicted at the center of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>. A cluster of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (that is, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5) and another cluster of Fc&#x003b3; receptors (Fc&#x003b3;Rs) were identified in this network. The two clusters were indirectly connected through p38 MAPK and NF&#x003ba;B, suggesting there may be functional interactions among these molecules through this pathway. This network was overlapped with the fourth network, whose central molecules were IFN&#x003b3; and E2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>).

We found that two IFI molecules were included in the second network, and that seven out of the 14 upregulated molecules that constructed the third network were IFI molecules.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Network-based analysis of upregulated genes in the functional category of immune response</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Network 1, <bold>(b) </bold>Network 2, <bold>(c) </bold>Network 3, and <bold>(d) </bold>Network 4 constructed by upregulated genes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ar2584-2"/></fig><p>Gathering the above results, TNF, IFN&#x003b3;, and E2 were depicted by both downregulated and upregulated molecules in the networks. As most of the genes in the immune response were TNF regulated, we performed stimulating experiments on the PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy individuals to assess the TNF regulation on the immune response-related molecules in SLE. On the other hand, although the expression of IFN&#x003b1; was not upregulated and was not depicted in networks related to TNF, IFN&#x003b3;, or E2, IFI molecules were found ranging over the four networks. Furthermore, it has been reported that there exist elevated levels of type I interferon in the SLE serum. Type I interferon therefore appears to have complicated interactions with various cytokines and E2. This encouraged us to further examine the effects of interactions between IFN&#x003b1; and one of TNF, IFN&#x003b3;, or E2 on IFI gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by TNF stimulation for SLE patients and healthy individuals</title><p>Seven downregulated genes (CD40, CD1C, CD14, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 7, IL12B, IL-4 receptor, and prostaglandin E synthase) and 12 upregulated genes (IFIT1, IFIT3, IFIT5, ISG15, IRF7, OASL, OAS1, guanylate binding protein (GBP) 1, GBP2, IL8RA, C-type lectin domain family 4 member E, and TNF&#x003b1;-induced protein 6), all of which were TNF regulated, were selected and their mRNA expressions upon TNF stimulation were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. All of the genes selected showed essentially the same responses to TNF stimulation on PBMCs independent of the individual (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). CD40, IL12B, prostaglandin E synthase, C-type lectin domain family 4 member E, and TNF&#x003b1;-induced protein 6 were upregulated, while CD1C, IFIT1, IFIT3, OAS1, and IL8RA were downregulated upon TNF stimulation in both SLE patients and healthy individuals.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of TNF stimulation on gene expression in healthy individuals and systemic lupus erythematosus patients</bold>.

Meanwhile, IFI genes such as IFIT1, IFIT3, OAS1, ISG15 and IRF7, and IL8RA were upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, but IFIT1, IFIT3, OAS1 and IL8RA were downregulated, while ISG15 and IRF7 showed almost no response to TNF <italic>in vitro</italic>. These data suggest that other soluble factors might be involved in the regulation on the gene expression. Indeed, high levels of interferon in SLE serum have been suggested to cause overexpression of IFI genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, we not only found that TNF had repressive effects on IFI genes IFIT1, IFIT3, IFIT5, ISG15, and IRF7 expression, but that the effect was significantly stronger on SLE patients' PBMCs than those of healthy individuals. This result may be caused by the differences in the baseline expressions where IFI genes were overexpressed <italic>in vivo </italic>in SLE patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Repressive effect of TNF on interferon-inducible gene expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>The expression of 15 IFI genes (IFIT1, IFIT3, IFIT5, IFI6, IFI16, IFI27, IFI30, IFI35, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1, ISG15, IRF7, OAS1, OASL, GBP1, and GBP2) in PBMCs upon stimulation were measured. All of these genes were upregulated upon IFN&#x003b1; stimulation, while only some were upregulated by IFN&#x003b3; (data not shown). On the other hand, TNF also showed a repressive effect on the expressions of most IFI genes in PBMCs <italic>in vitro </italic>in this experiment.</p><p>The relative expressions of three of the representative genes (that is, IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFI27) from three women are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. A remarkable suppression was observed through the TNF and IFN&#x003b1; co-stimulating experiment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). On the other hand, there was synergism between IFN&#x003b3; and IFN&#x003b1; on IFI gene expressions, although with some exceptions like IFIT1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). IFIT1 was downregulated upon IFN&#x003b3; and IFN&#x003b1; co-stimulation, unlike stimulation with IFN&#x003b1; alone. E2 showed no significant or consistent interaction with IFN&#x003b1; for most of the IFI genes. Inconsistent responses to E2 stimulation, however, were observed among the three healthy donors on IFI27. E2 tended to downregulate IFI27 expression in one donor but upregulated expression in the other two donors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of cytokines or &#x003b2;-estradiol on the expressions of interferon-inducible genes</bold>.

Most previously reported SLE studies utilizing microarray analysis have used PBMCs, but in the present study we used whole blood from SLE patients to exhaustively analyze the gene expression profiles of immune response-related molecules <italic>in vivo</italic>. Despite an additional proportion of granulocytes (mainly neutrophils), our results showed that there was an overexpression of several interferon-regulated genes. This result was in agreement with a previous report showing that peripheral blood from SLE patients had remarkably homogeneous gene expression patterns with an overexpression of IFI genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and confirms the involvement of interferon in SLE.</p><p>Since the immune system is regulated by an elaborate network, interactions among the downregulated genes and the upregulated genes of the immune response category were further investigated by utilizing network-based analysis. A cluster of the TLR family (that is, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5) and another cluster of Fc&#x003b3;Rs were upregulated and depicted in the same network, which had p38 MAPK and NF&#x003ba;B at the center. Our finding that Fc&#x003b3;R genes were overexpressed in the peripheral blood of SLE patients is novel, although the overexpression of TLR genes has been recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, this is the first report showing that these clusters possibly interact with each other through p38 MAPK and NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathways in a network, and consequently contribute to SLE. Indeed, it has been shown that Fc&#x003b3;RIIb is a gene susceptible to SLE both in humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Means and Luster have reported that a functional interaction between TLR9 and CD32 (also known as Fc&#x003b3;RIIa) may be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE, and they also have suggested the possibility that TLR7 may activate cells through similar pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although in our study overexpression of DNA-recognizing TLR9, which has been suggested to be triggered by immune complexes containing DNA in SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], was not statistically significant according to the rank test, seven out of the 11 SLE patients showed upregulated expressions of TLR9. In addition, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 &#x02013; which serve to recognize bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide or lipopeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] &#x02013; were also upregulated. Our network-based analysis therefore suggested the hypothesis that the interaction between TLRs and Fc&#x003b3;Rs is involved in the pathogenesis of SLE.</p><p>We additionally found that networks whose central molecule was TNF, IFN&#x003b3;, or E2 were represented by both the downregulated genes and the upregulated genes in the functional category of immune response. This observation suggested that TNF, IFN&#x003b3;, or E2 may be involved in the abnormal expressions of both downregulated and upregulated genes in the immune response. Indeed, the elevated level of some cytokines such as TNF and interferon in the sera of SLE patients has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although our data did not show a significant increase in the gene expressions of TNF, IFN&#x003b3;, or IFN&#x003b1; in themselves according to rank test, more than one-half of the SLE patients' individual data showed an increase in the TNF gene expression in our study (data not shown). For IFN&#x003b1;, the expression was not increased in the peripheral blood but it may be produced at the other site. Siegal and colleagues have demonstrated that purified interferon-producing cells were CD4<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>- </sup>type 2 dendritic cell precursors, which produce 200 to 1,000 times more IFN&#x003b1; than other blood cells after a microbial challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. E2 is enzymatically synthesized in the ovary, and therefore does not transcript and cannot be detected in peripheral blood in the present study. There is, however, a 10 to 15 times higher frequency of SLE in women during childbearing years, probably due to an estrogen hormonal effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We therefore believe these results are a good reason to further investigate E2 involvement in SLE pathogenesis.</p><p>Concerning the interaction between cytokines, to our knowledge this is the first report showing that TNF has a repressive effect on IFI genes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although the exact mechanisms of the IFI gene product involvement in SLE pathogenesis are still poorly understood, we suspect that the elevated expression of TNF in SLE reduces the overexpression of IFI genes. Since serum levels of both TNF and IFN&#x003b1; were reportedly elevated in SLE, as mentioned above, it is possible that the increased serum TNF level in SLE is an outcome to compensate the immune system balance altered by IFN&#x003b1; in SLE. Consider that patients with rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease under TNF-blocking therapies can develop autoantibodies to nuclear antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]; therapeutic TNF blockades could thus lead to an exacerbation of certain autoimmune diseases such as SLE and to provoke lupus-like manifestations. Palucka and colleagues reported recently that blocking TNF signaling increases the production of IFN&#x003b1; by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and induces an IFN signature in the blood of arthritis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This may be another mechanism for TNF inhibitor to induce the IFN signature. We confirmed that there was no significant effect, however, of TNF on IFN&#x003b1; gene expression in the PBMCs in our experiment. Furthermore, the 500 units/ml IFN&#x003b1; we used for stimulation is obviously a higher amount than endogenously produced IFN&#x003b1;. TNF therefore appeared to directly suppress IFI gene expression in PBMCs. We suggest that the direct suppressive effect of TNF on the IFN signature induced by IFN&#x003b1;, at least, exists in the network regulation of cytokines <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The results of the co-stimulating experiments did not show any strong evidence of a functional interaction between E2 and IFN&#x003b1; on the expression of IFI genes. Inconsistent gene expression patterns were observed in the co-stimulating experiments, possibly due to the hormonal effects of the women donors. The modulation of estrogens on humoral immune response seems to be greatly dependent on its physiological concentration, and E2 is a versatile hormone that plays a wide variety of roles in our body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that E2 also plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of SLE.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TNF may have a counter effect on the abnormal regulation of IFN&#x003b1; on the immune response-related gene expressions, while IFN&#x003b3; may have a synergistic effect with IFN&#x003b1; in SLE.
