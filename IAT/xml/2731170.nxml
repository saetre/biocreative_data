By sequencing <italic>Tnni3k</italic> cDNA from the strains, we noted another, more consequential, strain-specific sequence difference. All strains sharing the B6 haplotype showed a single major transcript identical to the published cDNA. By contrast, all strains sharing the DBA haplotype exhibited a mixture of two transcripts consisting of the published transcript and a second transcript containing a 4-nucleotide insertion between exons 19 and 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000647-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This insertion was not present in the genomic DNA, but instead represented the addition of the first 4 nucleotides from intron 19 into the <italic>Tnni3k</italic> transcript. The insertion created a frameshift resulting in a premature termination codon immediately downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000647-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

Although in principle any of these could have caused the aberrant splicing, we focused on the SNP nearest to the splice donor junction. B6 and related strains (AKR, 129, MRL) possess an &#x02018;a&#x02019; nucleotide at rs49812611, whereas DBA and related strains (A/J, C3H/HeJ (C3H), BALB/c) possess a &#x02018;g&#x02019;. This SNP lies at the &#x0002b;9 position for the normal splice site, but importantly, this SNP lies at the &#x0002b;5 position with reference to the aberrant splice site.

TNNI3K protein is highly conserved between human and mouse (91&#x00025; identity), and transgenic expression of the human transcript enabled discrimination between the endogenous murine transcript and that derived from the transgene. Three independent founder lines were created, and qRT-PCR indicated that the human transgene was expressed at levels ranging from 5 to 20-fold above the endogenous B6 mouse transcript, depending on the founder. F1 generation mice from all three lines survived over a year, and cardiac function in 12 and 21-week transgenic animals were indistinguishable from wild-type animals.

We have shown that the murine <italic>Tnni3k</italic> locus harbors an ancestral SNP in intron 19 that activates a cryptic splice site, generating an aberrant transcript that undergoes NMD, leading to drastically reduced message levels and an apparent absence of TNNI3K protein. In DBA and other inbred mouse strains sharing the same haplotype at <italic>Tnni3k</italic>, drastically reduced levels of TNNI3K protein have no obvious effect on normal development or physiology, suggesting that any trace amounts of protein that remain are sufficient for its normal function, or that the lack of protein is compensated by functional redundancy of another gene. <italic>In vivo</italic> transgenic and congenic mouse lines confirm that TNNI3K levels are a significant determinant of the rate of disease progression and outcome, since expression of this protein accelerates disease progression in two independent and unrelated models of cardiomyopathy. However, we did not observe a simple, linear relationship between the level of TNNI3K transgenic overexpression and the strength of the modifying effect. In these models, the levels of overexpression in the transgenic lines may have crossed the threshold required for maximal phenotypic effects.</p><p>The modifying effects of TNNI3K expression were not dependent on the allele at the nonsynonymous coding SNP (rs30712233, T659I). DBA and most inbred mouse strains encode Threonine at this position. Most other species also encode Threonine at the homologous position. By contrast, B6 and AKR inbred strains encode the Isoleucine variant. The human <italic>TNNI3K</italic> transgene employed in the validation experiments coincidentally encodes the highly conserved Threonine variant. The modifying effects of the human transgene carrying the conserved variant (695T) directly parallel, and are even stronger, than those observed using the congenic line containing the B6/AKR variant (695I). Thus, robust phenotype modifying effects were observed independent of the murine <italic>Tnni3k</italic> coding variant. Nonetheless, these experiments did not address whether the 695I polymorphism also alters TNNI3K protein function.</p><p>TNNI3K was identified as a cardiac-specific protein kinase that interacted with cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) in the yeast-two hybrid interaction assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000647-Zhao1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, however, cTnI has not been established as a phosphorylation target. TNNI3K protein contains seven ankyrin repeats in the N-terminus followed by a dual-specificity protein kinase domain and a short C-terminal serine-rich domain. The overall domain structure of TNNI3K resembles that of Integrin-linked Kinase (ILK). ILK mediates communication from the cellular matrix to intracellular signaling molecules such as PKB and GSK3&#x003b2;, and plays important roles in cardiac growth, contractility and repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000647-Hannigan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000647-Lu1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Assuming that <italic>Tnni3k</italic> also underlies the <italic>Vms1</italic> locus, viral-induced myocarditis might represent another disease context where expression of TNNI3K is protective. These combined data suggest that expression of TNNI3K may be detrimental in certain pathological conditions such as pressure overload or aberrant sarcomeric calcium regulation, but protective in other disease contexts. In either scenario, TNNI3K appears to play a critical role in modulating disease progression and outcome in heart disease.</p><p>Since protein kinases are critical cell cycle regulators, kinase inhibitors have become a major avenue for the development of novel cancer therapeutics. TNNI3K may be an ideal candidate for the development of small molecule kinase inhibitors for categories of heart disease where TNNI3K expression is detrimental. In these cases, selective inhibition of TNNI3K would be particularly useful as it might slow disease progression, which may prove beneficial in treating individuals with rapidly progressing disease. In other scenarios of disease, augmentation of TNNI3K activity or protein levels may instead prove beneficial. Further investigation of TNNI3K function in these and other cardiomyopathic mouse models will lead to increased understanding of its role in both normal and pathological contexts, and may provide a novel target for therapy for heart disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal care and handling</title><p>All mice were handled according to approved protocol and animal welfare regulations of the Institutional Review Board at Duke University Medical Center.
