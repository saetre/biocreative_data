These enzymes have a complex domain structure consisting of at least a signal peptide, pro domain, metalloproteinase domain, disintegrin domain, thrombospondin type I motif and cysteine rich domain (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al., 2005</xref>). Phylogenetically, the enzyme family separates into eight clades which to some extent correlate with function where assigned (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Huxley-Jones et al., 2005</xref>). ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, -8, -9 and -15 are all capable of degrading aggrecan at a specific set of loci with ADAMTS-5 being the major aggrecanase in cartilage destruction, at least in mice (<xref rid="bib4 bib7 bib12 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Parker, 2003; Collins-Racie et al., 2004; Glasson et al., 2005; Stanton et al., 2005</xref>). At least three ADAMTS enzymes (ADAMTS-4, -7 and -12) can degrade cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, another component of cartilage ECM (<xref rid="bib10 bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dickinson et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2006a,b</xref>). Three ADAMTS enzymes, ADAMTS-2, -3 and -14, are procollagen N-propeptidases (PCNPs), which have roles in collagen biosynthesis. ADAMTS-2 acts preferentially on type I collagen and ADAMTS-3 on type II collagen, whereas the preference of ADAMTS-14 is currently unknown (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Colige et al., 2002</xref>). Mutation of the <italic>ADAMTS2</italic> gene causes Ehlers&#x02013;Danlos syndrome Type VIIC in man (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Colige et al., 1999</xref>). ADAMTS-13 cleaves von Willebrand factor with mutations in this enzyme leading to an inherited thrombotic thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Tsai, 2007</xref>). A form of Weill&#x02013;Marchesani syndrome is caused by mutation in the <italic>ADAMTS10</italic> gene (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dagoneau et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p><italic>ADAMTS-16</italic> is a recently described member of the <italic>ADAMTS</italic> gene family (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al., 2005</xref>). The cDNA was cloned using a combination of bioinformatics and degenerate RT-PCR, which also identified ADAMTS-13, -14, -15, -17, -18 and -19 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Cal et al., 2002</xref>). Amino acid sequence alignment showed a significant percentage of identity between ADAMTS-16 and ADAMTS-18 (overall identity, 57%), particularly in the catalytic domain where identity reaches 85% (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, the zinc-binding motif is identical between these two proteinases (HESGHNFGMIHD) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Somerville et al., 2003a</xref>). ADAMTS-16 and -18 form a phylogenetic clade, with the nearest evolutionary neighbours being ADAMTS-6, -7, -10 and -12.</p><p>Whilst the substrates for ADAMTS-16 are currently unknown, a recombinant truncated form of ADAMTS-16 shows weak aggrecanase activity (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2006</xref>) and full length recombinant ADAMTS-16 is capable of cleaving the proteinase inhibitor &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>An initial expression analysis in a selection of human tissues shows high expression of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> mRNA in fetal lung and kidney, and adult brain and ovary (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Cal et al., 2002</xref>). In this latter tissue, <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> is expressed predominantly in the parietal granulosa cells of pre-ovulatory follicles. Expression of the gene can be induced by follicle-stimulating hormone and forskolin in granulosa cells, suggesting that the cAMP pathway may be involved in its regulation in this system (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> has also recently been genetically linked to inherited hypertension (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Joe et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We undertook the expression profiling of all <italic>ADAMTS</italic> genes in cartilage and synovium. We compared expression in patients undergoing hip replacement for osteoarthritis (OA) to phenotypically normal tissues from patients undergoing hip replacement following fracture to the neck of femur. In cartilage, the expression of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> increased in the OA samples with a significance of <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001, comparable to the increase in expression of <italic>MMP13</italic>, a collagenase whose activity is pathognomic with cartilage destruction in OA. This was backed up with a preliminary study in the knee using cartilage from OA patients compared to normal cartilage from post-mortem, where a similar increase in expression of these two genes was measured (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kevorkian et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, in synovium, the expression of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> was significantly increased in OA with the absolute level of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> mRNA approximately 10-fold higher in synovium than in cartilage (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Davidson et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In order to provide some insight into the regulation and function of ADAMTS-16 in the joint, the current study examines the expression of ADAMTS-16 by chondrocytes, the regulation of the gene and the consequence of stable over-expression of the gene in chondrosarcoma and immortalized chondrocyte cell lines.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Characterisation of ADAMTS16 and creation of stably expressing cell lines</title><p>Using PCR primer pairs to amplify overlapping sections of the <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> gene, the entire transcript was amplified from cDNA reverse transcribed from mRNA purified from an immortalized human chondrocyte cell line, C28/I2 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Loeser et al., 2000</xref>) (data not shown). No evidence for expression of splice variants was found (though it is possible that some truncated forms of the transcript might not have been detected if they were not amplified at all by selected primers). Based on these data, a full length cDNA was cloned and the final cDNA verified by sequencing in both directions. It should be noted that, despite using high fidelity polymerases and low numbers of amplifications cycles, frequent mutations were introduced by the PCR. The correct version of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> could only be created by amplifying sections of the gene (up to approximately 1000&#x000a0;bp), verifying sequence, then assembling via restriction digestion and ligation into an error-free cDNA.</p><p>Initially, both immortalized chondrocytes (C28/I2) and chondrosarcoma (SW1353) cells were transfected with the full length <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> construct (with a C-terminal FLAG tag). However, the C28/I2 transfectants did not grow robustly after selection and experiments were pursued in the SW1353 line alone. Following cloning by limiting dilution, four different clonal populations expressing <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> (TS16) were compared to two clonal populations transfected with vector only control constructs (VO). Expression of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> at the mRNA level was confirmed using qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). The <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> expressing clones had an average of approximately 95-fold higher expression than the vector only controls. Western blot using both an anti-ADAMTS-16 antibody and an anti-FLAG antibody showed expression of a high molecular weight (~&#x000a0;130&#x000a0;kDa) protein predominantly in the extracellular matrix fraction of the ADAMTS16 transfectants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b). Two bands of similar size were also detected in the conditioned medium and cell lysate fractions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c).</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Influence of ADAMTS-16 on expression levels of other metzincin genes</title><p>Expression levels of all 19 members of the ADAMTS family, all four members of the TIMP gene family and MMP2, MMP9, MMP13 and MMP28 were determined in cells stably over-expressing ADAMTS16 compared to vector only controls using qRT-PCR. The representatives of the MMP family were chosen because of their expression pattern in tissues of the OA joint (<xref rid="bib9 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Davidson et al., 2006; Kevorkian et al., 2004</xref>). MMP13 expression levels were significantly reduced in ADAMTS16-expressing clones compared to vector only controls (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.005; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d) with a mean of approximately 9-fold lower expression. Interestingly, the level of MMP13 expression was inversely correlated with that of ADAMTS16 (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a and d). Expression levels of the other genes analysed did not change significantly between over-expressing cells and vector only controls (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Effects of ADAMTS16 expression on cell phenotype</title><p>Expression of ADAMTS-16 by stably expressing clones was confirmed by immunocytochemistry using anti-FLAG antibodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). Protein was detected only in permeabilized cells, with cytoplasmic and some perinuclear staining. No staining was observed in vector only controls or non-immune IgG controls. Cells stably over-expressing <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> were larger and more elongated than vector only controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b) which were not significantly different from non-transfected SW1353 cells. These differences were observed at all stages of confluence. The ability of cells to adhere to extracellular matrix proteins (collagen I, collagen II, fibronectin and vitronectin) was measured and no significant difference was observed between <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> over-expressing cells and vector only controls (data not shown). Cell proliferation was measured by uptake of tritiated thymidine, a direct measure of DNA replication. This showed that proliferation of over-expressing cells was significantly reduced in all four clones in medium containing 0.5% FCS compared to vector only controls (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 comparing <italic>ADAMTS16</italic>-expressing cells vs. vector only; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Proliferation was similarly reduced in cells growing in medium containing 10% FCS though with lower significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). Migration of cells measured using time-lapse microscopy also showed that <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> over-expressing cells had significantly reduced migration on plastic compared to vector only controls (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.005, comparing mean of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic>-expressing cells vs. vector only; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Regulation of ADAMTS16 by growth factors and cytokines</title><p>Of a number of growth factors and cytokines tested (IL-1, TNF-&#x003b1;, TGF-&#x003b2;1, IGF-1, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-6, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, IL-17, OSM, EGF, BMP-2, BMP-7), only TGF&#x003b2; was found to regulate levels of endogenous <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> expression in chondrocyte cell lines.

The predicted translation start site (ATG) is conserved amongst the primates, but not in mouse which appears to use a downstream ATG. This latter sequence is conserved in primates, but not in frame with the upstream primate ATG.</p><p>The longest PCR products obtained using 5&#x02032; RLM-RACE indicate that the transcription start site lies 138&#x000a0;bp upstream of the ATG in the human gene. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a shows the PCR products obtained by performing 5&#x02032; RLM-RACE on RNA from three different sources (C28/I2 cells stimulated with TGF&#x003b2;, ovary and HeLa cells). <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b shows the position of the primer SP2 used for RLM-RACE and the predicted transcription start point.

Primer extension using primer SP2 also detected a band of approximately the same size as the RACE products (data not shown).</p><p>Eight fragments of the 5&#x02032; region of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> ranging from +110/+138 to &#x02212;&#x000a0;1802/+138 (marked on <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector. Analysis of reporter activity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) indicated that the minimal promoter lies between &#x02212;&#x000a0;13 and +&#x000a0;25, encompassing the transcription start point identified above. Activity increased greatly in deletions from &#x02212;&#x000a0;1802 to &#x02212;&#x000a0;412 indicating the presence of a repressive element within this region. Successive deletions between &#x02212;&#x000a0;412 and &#x02212;&#x000a0;13 resulted in incremental decreases in activity, suggesting the presence of a number of transcription factor binding sites in these regions.</p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Identification of transcription factors activating the ADAMTS16 promoter</title><p>The proximal promoter is GC rich and a search for transcription factor consensus sequences (MatInspector, Genomatix) revealed a number of both Sp1 and Egr1 binding sites (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>a). These factors have also been implicated in TGF&#x003b2; signalling to extracellular matrix genes (<xref rid="bib3 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). Co-transfection of the <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> promoter constructs with expression vectors for each of these factors showed responsiveness to both transcription factors (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>b and c). Induction of the promoter by Egr1 is reduced by deletion from &#x02212;&#x000a0;412 to &#x02212;&#x000a0;157 and lost by further deletion to &#x02212;&#x000a0;42 (with Egr1 repressing smaller constructs). All promoter constructs were induced by Sp1 and indeed there are further Sp1 sites downstream of the transcription start point.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p>ADAMTS-16 is a multi-domain protein encoded by 23 exons. Initially in this study, we verified that the full length transcript was expressed in chondrocyte cell lines and then cloned this cDNA into an expression construct with a C-terminal FLAG tag. Chondrosarcoma cells stably over-expressing ADAMTS-16 were selected and cloned. Over-expression of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> was verified at the mRNA level by qRT-PCR and at the protein level by immunocytochemistry and western blot using the anti-FLAG antibody and/or an anti-ADAMTS-16 antibody (raised against a C-terminal peptide). Western blot showed an approximately 130&#x000a0;kDa band predominantly associated with the extracellular matrix fraction, with an additional higher molecular weight band faintly detected. The full length ADAMTS-16 polypeptide has a predicted molecular weight of 136&#x000a0;kDa, in good agreement with the experimental finding. A doublet around this molecular weight was also weakly detected in the cell lysate and conditioned medium of the <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> transfects. The lower molecular weight band corresponds to the major band in the ECM, suggesting that this is a processed form. Two &#x02018;in-house&#x02019; anti-peptide antibodies raised against sequences in the propeptide and catalytic domain respectively recognise a band of approximately 65&#x000a0;kDa in conditioned medium (data not shown), though the specificity of these antibodies remains to be determined.</p><p>Whilst stably transfected SW1353 cells could be maintained and expanded, this wasn't the case for the C28/I2 transformed chondrocytes. In the SW1353 cells, over-expression of ADAMTS-16 lead to a reduction in cell proliferation and this change in phenotype may, in part, explain why the C28/I2 cells were not successfully expanded. SW1353 cells over-expressing ADAMTS-16 also showed a change in cell shape and a decrease in cell migration on plastic, though no difference in cell adhesion to a number of extracellular matrix proteins. This does not appear to be the consequence solely of stable transfection since similar cell lines over-expressing MMP-28 display a different phenotype (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Rodgers et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, ADAMTS-1 modifies both cell proliferation and migration dependent on cell type, domain content and concentration of the enzyme used (<xref rid="bib17 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Krampert et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006c</xref>).</p><p>Members of the metzincin family are known to process a number of growth factors, cytokines and signalling molecules in addition to matrix substrates (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Somerville et al., 2003b</xref>). Since the over-expression of ADAMTS-16 has no effect on expression levels of most of the <italic>ADAMTS</italic>, <italic>TIMP</italic> and <italic>MMP</italic> genes tested, it is unlikely that ADAMTS-16 processes factors that regulate these genes. However, our initial interests in ADAMTS-16 centred around the fact that in end stage osteoarthritis, the expression of the <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> gene is increased in cartilage and synovium in a way similar to that of MMP-13, a collagenolytic enzyme known to be involved in the destruction of tissues in the joint [17, 18]. Interestingly, the SW1353 cells over-expressing ADAMTS-16 display reduced expression of <italic>MMP13</italic> mRNA, though the mechanism or functional significance of this observation is unknown. There is no clear link in the literature between decreased <italic>MMP13</italic> expression and decreased proliferation or migration (as observed for <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> over-expressing cells). Indeed one agent, pleiotrophin, has recently been reported to induce proliferation and migration of chondrocytes whilst repressing <italic>MMP13</italic> expression (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Pufe et al., 2007</xref>). In OA cartilage, other factors must override the repression of <italic>MMP13</italic> expression by increased ADAMTS-16 since both enzymes show increased expression compared to that in normal cartilage. Given the importance of MMP-13 as a collagenase in OA, the mechanistic link between ADAMTS-16 and <italic>MMP13</italic> expression is worthy of further investigation.</p><p>Since <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> expression was increased in OA tissues, we tested a number of growth factors and cytokines implicated in this disease for their ability to regulate expression of the <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> gene <italic>in vitro</italic>. In both C28/I2 and SW1353 cells, TGF&#x003b2; induced expression of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> in a dose-dependent fashion. TGF&#x003b2; has been reported to induce <italic>MMP13</italic> expression in chondrocytes (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Moldovan et al., 1997</xref>) and there is evidence to demonstrate a role for this growth factor in the development or progression of osteoarthritis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Blaney Davidson et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Sequence alignment shows a high level of conservation between primates and mouse in the 5&#x02032; upstream region of the <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> gene. 5&#x02032; RACE gives a transcription start point 138&#x000a0;bp upstream of the translation start point and this is in agreement with both primer extension data and the end of exon 1 given in Ensembl (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.ensembl.org</ext-link>). Interestingly, the sequence across the transcription start point (&#x02212;&#x000a0;2/+5, 5&#x02032;TCAGTAA3&#x02032;) is a putative AP-1 binding site. This is contrary to the computer prediction of the transcription start point at 560&#x000a0;bp upstream of the translation start point (&#x02212;&#x000a0;422 from the transcription start point) and the associated promoter reported in Gao et al. (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2007</xref>), however it is possible that the gene has greater than one transcription start point.</p><p>A deletion analysis from &#x02212;&#x000a0;1802 (relative to the transcription start point) showed that constructs expressed promoter activity only when they encompassed the transcription start point. Promoter activity increased with the increasing length to &#x02212;&#x000a0;412, a region which is GC rich and contains many putative binding sites for transcription factors such as Sp1 and Egr1. Interestingly, these factors have previously been implicated in TGF&#x003b2; signalling, with both factors involved in the induction of type I collagen by TGF&#x003b2; (<xref rid="bib3 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). Forced over-expression of these factors demonstrates that both factors are capable of inducing the <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> promoter. Egr1 induction appears to be mediated mainly by the &#x02212;&#x000a0;412/&#x02212;&#x000a0;157 region, with Sp1 induction also mediated through further downstream sequences.</p><p>In summary, over-expression of ADAMTS-16 leads to decreased cell proliferation and migration either directly, or indirectly via changes in gene expression e.g. <italic>MMP13</italic>. Expression of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> is induced by TGF&#x003b2; and we have experimentally identified the transcription start point of the gene, its promoter, and two relevant activating transcription factors. Overall, these data provide new information on the function and regulation of ADAMTS-16 in chondrocyte cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><label>4</label><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><label>4.1</label><title>PCR and cloning of full length transcript</title><p>RNA was extracted from C28/I2 immortalised human chondrocyte cells (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Loeser et al., 2000</xref>) using TRIzol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> reagent (Invitrogen) and adding 0.5&#x000d7; volume of chloroform.
