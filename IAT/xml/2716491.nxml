Widely anticipated to represent a very promising therapeutic target in several cancer indications, it is increasingly evident that optimal therapeutic benefits obtained using ILK targeting strategies will only be achieved in combination settings. The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of the ILK small molecule inhibitor, QLT0267 (267), alone or in combination with chemotherapies commonly used to treat breast cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A single end-point metabolic assay was used as an initial screen for 267 interactions with selected chemotherapeutic agents. These <italic>in vitro </italic>assays were completed with seven breast cancer cell lines including several which over-expressed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2). One agent, docetaxel (Dt), consistently produced synergistic interactions when combined with 267. Dt/267 interactions were further characterized by measuring therapeutic endpoints linked to phosphorylated protein kinase B (P-AKT) suppression, inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and changes in cytoarchitecture. <italic>In vivo </italic>efficacy studies were completed in mice bearing orthotopic xenografts where tumor growth was assessed by bioluminescence and calliper methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The combination of 267 and Dt resulted in increased cytotoxic activity, as determined using an assay of metabolic activity. Combinations of cisplatin, doxorubicin, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab produced antagonistic interactions. Further endpoint analysis in cell lines with low Her2 levels revealed that the 267/Dt combinations resulted in: a three-fold decrease in concentration (dose) of 267 required to achieve 50% inhibition of P-AKT; and a dramatic disruption of normal filamentous-actin cellular architecture. In contrast to Her2-positive cell lines, three-fold higher concentrations of 267 were required to achieve 50% inhibition of P-AKT when the drug was used in combination with Dt. <italic>In vivo </italic>studies focusing on low Her2-expressing breast cancer cells (LCC6) implanted orthotopically demonstrated that treatment with 267/Dt engendered improved therapeutic effects when compared with mice treated with either agent alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings indicate that the 267/Dt drug combination confers increased (synergistic) therapeutic efficacy towards human breast cancer cells that express low levels of Her2.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), an intracellular serine/threonine kinase, is a key signaling molecule expressed in most, if not all, tissues, with high levels of expression in normal pancreatic, cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. Through interactions with a diverse range of proteins including adapters such as particularly interesting Cys-His-rich protein (PINCH), calponin homology-containing ILK-binding protein (CH-ILKBP), affixin and paxillin, kinases such as integrin-linked kinase-associated serine/threonine phosphatase 2C (ILKAP), protein kinase B (AKT) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1), and transmembrane receptors such as &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3 integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], ILK is thought to play a key role in integrin and growth factor receptor related signaling cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. For example, ILK acts as a scaffold protein to allow for protein-complex formations connecting extracellular integrin signals to intracellular actin cytoskeleton rearrangements through direct interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of &#x003b2;1 integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cell extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion complexes influence a vast number of cellular processes including cellular morphology, migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Activation of downstream targets of ILK such as AKT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], myosin light chain (MLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], affixin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and the cytoplasmic domain of &#x003b2;1 integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], is associated with signaling cascades known to regulate transcription of genes involved in a diverse range of functions including: cell survival, cell cycle progression, cell adhesion and spreading, focal adhesion plaque formation, ECM modification, cell motility, and contractility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Increased ILK expression and activity is found in association with many cancer types including: breast, brain, prostate, pancreatic, colon, gastric, ovarian, and malignant melanomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Further, there is mounting experimental evidence indicating that ILK plays a pivotal role in many processes associated with tumorigenesis. Enforced over-expression of ILK in immortalized rat intestinal epithelial cells induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a transformed tumorigenic phenotype that is, in part, linked to ILK-dependent inhibition of E-cadherin expression and increased nuclear translocation of &#x003b2; catenin. Over-expression and constitutive activation of ILK leads to dysregulated growth and suppression of apoptosis and anoikis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. With specific respect to breast cancer, over-expression of ILK in mammary cells stimulates anchorage-independent cell growth, cell cycle progression, and increased cyclin D and A expression <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, mammary epithelial cells over-expressing ILK exhibit hyperplasia and tumor formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Further evidence has indicated ILK might play a key role in VEGF-mediated endothelial activation and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Targeted inhibition of ILK in cancer cells by various strategies can also lead to suppression of the AKT signaling pathway, inhibition of cell cycle progression, reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion <italic>in vitro</italic>, and reduced tumor growth <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A number of pharmaceutically viable small-molecule inhibitors of ILK have been developed and partially characterized. From the K15792 class of the pharmacophor family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], some of these inhibitors were shown to effectively inhibit cancer cell survival, growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and induce apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], as well as inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, the most promising ILK inhibitor, QLT0267 (267), while capable of eliciting pleiotropic effects in xenograft models of glioma, was unfortunately shown to only delay, but not prevent, tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, even at doses as high as 200 mg/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Based on these findings, we speculate that optimal therapeutic effects of 267 will only be realized using a combination therapeutic strategy.</p><p>Here we demonstrate on the basis of a cell viability assessment determined using multiple breast cancer cell lines that 267 in combination docetaxel (Dt) interacted in a synergistic manner (increased therapeutic benefit over single agents as assessed by the median effect methodology developed by Chou and Talalay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). Experimentations aimed to identify underlying molecular mechanisms and additional drug-drug interactions using multiple endpoint analyses, revealed in breast cancer cells expressing low levels of Her2, beneficial drug-drug interactions on the basis of endpoints measuring AKT phosphorylation and F-actin cytoarchitecture. Using an orthotopic model of breast cancer (low Her2), 267/Dt combinations were found to exert enhanced therapeutic activity, as demonstrated by significantly reduced tumor growth and extended survival in mice treated with the combination compared to the single agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxil, Dt, vinorelbine, and trastuzumab (Tz) were obtained from the British Columbia Cancer Agency Pharmacy (Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 267 was a generous gift from QLT Inc (Vancouver, BC, Canada). All other chemicals, unless specified, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Dt was reconstituted in 13% ethanol for a final concentration of 10 mg/ml and Tz (Hoffman-La Roche, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was reconstituted in PBS at a stock concentration of 21 mg/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell-lines and culture</title><p>MCF-7, KPL-4, BT-474, MDA MB/468 and SKBR3 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). MDA-MB-435 (LCC6) estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and MCF-7<sup>Her2 </sup>cells were generously donated. LCC6<sup>Her2 </sup>cells, previously described by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], were generated by the stable transfection (neomycin selection using G418) of plasmid DNA containing the <italic>Her2 </italic>gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. LCC6 cells were stably transfected using a lenti-virus system with the luciferase gene and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Cells were sorted by FLOW cytometry for GFP expression and selected cells were used in the following experiments. Sorted cells exhibited similar <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>growth rates as the parental LCC6 cell line. Additionally LCC6<sup>luc </sup>and parental LCC6 were equally sensitive to Dt.</p><p>The breast cancer origin of the LCC6 parental cell line, MDA-MB-435, is controversial. Based on studies of Ross and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and Rae and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] it has been suggested that the MDA-MB-435 cell line is of a melanoma origin. However, Sellappan and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] have been able to demonstrate that MDA-MB-435 cells can be induced to express breast differentiation-specific proteins and secrete milk lipids. Further, more recent studies of Neve and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] have demonstrated that the MDA-MB-435 cell line shares many molecular features with breast cancer cell lines of breast epithelium origin. In studies from our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] using a LCC6 cell line permanently transfected with the <italic>Her2 </italic>gene (LCC6<sup>Her2 </sup>cell line), we have been able to demonstrate that the Her2-positive variant exhibit enhanced survival under stress, overproduction of VEGF, activation of nuclear factor (NF) &#x003ba;B and <italic>in vivo </italic>sensitivity to Tz (aka Herceptin&#x02122;; Hoffman-La Roche, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada); results that are consistent with what is known about Her2-positive breast cancer models. Thus, we believe it is justifiable to use these cells as a model breast cancer cell line; particularly when the results obtained using this cell line are confirmed with other breast cancer cell lines.</p><p>LCC6, LCC6<sup>Her2</sup>, LCC6<sup>luc</sup>, KPL-4, BT-474, MDA MB/468, MCF-7 and MCF-7<sup>Her2 </sup>cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM)/high glucose supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mmol/L; DMEM and L-glutamine from Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) 5 mM penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA). SKBR3 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5a medium (fStem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) supplemented with L-glutamine, 5 mM penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FBS. All cells were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% carbon dioxide in a humidified atmosphere.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell viability assays</title><p>Metabolic activity (measure of cell viability) of breast cancer cell lines incubated in the presence of various therapeutic agents was determined using Alamar Blue<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>assays (Medicorp Inc. Montreal, QU, Canada) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Briefly, 6000 cells/well seeded in triplicate onto 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates (Techno Plastic Products AG, Trasadingen, Switzerland) were allowed to adhere to the substratum for 24 hours under normal growth conditions (37&#x000b0;C and 5% carbon dioxide in a humidified atmosphere). Serial dilutions of individual drugs, 267/drug combinations and vehicle controls diluted in appropriate cell culture medium were then added to the wells and cells were grown for an additional 72 hours. To assess cell viability, cells were then incubated with 10% resazurin solution for four hours at 37&#x000b0;C and fluorescence was measured at 560/590 nm using an Optima fluorescence plate reader (BMG Labtech, Durham, NC, USA). Relative fluorescence determined from drug-treated cells was normalized to fluorescence determined from control cells (cells grown in presence of appropriate vehicle control alone) and data is shown as percentage relative cell viability compared with vehicle-treated control cells (100% viability, highest fluorescence). Background fluorescence was subtracted from all samples and results of experiments conducted in triplicate are indicated (average &#x000b1; standard deviation).</p></sec><sec><title>Drug combination effects &#x02013; median effect principle</title><p>To determine whether various 267/drug combinations had resulted in synergistic, antagonist, or additive effects, the median effect principle (MEP) method of Chou and Talalay was used to determine combination index (CI) values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Briefly, the MEP method is used to describe and understand the relationship between a measured response within a population of cells (fraction affected (f<sub>a</sub>) versus the fraction unaffected (f<sub>u</sub>)) and the fraction of the dose (D) required to achieve an effect level of 50% and is represented by the formula:</p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bcr2252-i1.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>- where <italic>D</italic><sub>m </sub>is the dose required to achieve a 50% effect level and m is a coefficient indicating the sigmoidicity of the dose-effect curve. The right side of the equation [(D/D<sub>m</sub>)<sup>m</sup>] represents the dose, and the left side of the equation [<italic>f</italic><sub>a</sub>/<italic>f</italic><sub>u</sub>] represents the effect of the interaction. The CI can be calculated at any effect level and the effect used can be derived on the basis of different endpoints (e.g. cell viability, inhibition of VEGF secretion, etc.). If CI is equal to one then the combination interactions result in additive effects, if the CI is less than one the combination interactions are considered synergistic, and if the CI is greater than one the combination interactions are considered antagonistic.</p><p>To determine CI values, the commercially available program CalcuSyn (Biosoft Ferguson, MO, USA) was used to calculate CI values for a broad range of effect levels and, on the basis of this analysis, F<sub>a </sub>versus CI plots were generated. CI values were then used to estimate the dose reduction index (DRI) for combination of drugs. The DRI estimates the extent to which the dose of one or more agents in the combination can be reduced to achieve effect levels that are comparable with those achieved with single agents. Drug combinations that acted synergistically can be identified as those that exhibited significant dose reduction values (i.e. a given measured effect will be observed at dose(s) significantly lower than expected based on single agent activities).</p></sec><sec><title>VEGF expression</title><p>To determine whether a specified treatment influenced VEGF expression, ELISA assays using Quantikine Human VEGF Immunoassay kits (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were conducted according to manufacturer's suggestions. Briefly, 6000 cells were seeded onto 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere for 24 hours. Cells were then grown in the presence of single agents or combinations of drugs for 72 hours (as described above). The experiments were completed in triplicate and repeated at least two times. Supernatants were collected, combined, and then assayed for the presence of secreted VEGF (specific for recombinant human VEGF<sub>165 </sub>and recombinant human VEGF<sub>121</sub>) using the Optima fluorescence plate reader (BMG Labtech, Durham NC, USA). Results were normalized to total protein found in supernatant and compared with standard curves determined using VEGF standards provided in the kit. This assay accurately measures VEGF levels between 9 pg/ml and 2000 pg/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Total protein lysates were prepared from cells incubated in the presence of single drug, the drug combinations or vehicle controls. Briefly, cells were rinsed with PBS, harvested from plates with trypsin, and centrifuged at 1500 &#x000d7; g for five minutes. Cell pellets were then re-suspended in lysis buffer (150 mmol/L sodium chloride, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% SDS), Mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), sheared using 25-gauge needles, incubated on ice for 30 minutes, and finally centrifuged at 10,000 &#x000d7; g for 10 minutes to remove insoluble material. Protein concentrations were determined from supernatant using the Bradford Method and approximately 75 &#x003bc;g of total protein from each sample were denatured in loading buffer (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) by boiling for 10 minutes and loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins separated by electrophoresis were transferred to Nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and blocked for one hour at room temperature in Odyssey blocking buffer (Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NB, USA). Membranes were incubated at 4&#x000b0;C overnight in Odyssey blocking buffer containing polyclonal anti-ILK, anti-AKT, anti-P-AKT or anti-Her2 antibodies (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signalling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). Membranes were then washed three times for five minutes with PBS-Tween (1% v/v) and incubated with either anti-rabbit or mouse IRDYE (green) (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) or anti-rabbit Alexa 680 (red) (Invitrogen, Molecular probes, Burlington, ON, Canada) (1:10,000) for one hour at room temperature and signals were detected and quantified using the Odyssey Infrared Detection System and associated software (Odyssey v1.2; Licor, Lincoln, NB, USA). Background and input variation between samples were corrected using signal intensities for negative control pixel noise and actin band intensities, respectively. Data were expressed as mean values &#x000b1; standard deviation and parametric analysis was performed using an unpaired Student t-test.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence analysis</title><p>Cells grown on coverslips were rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4), fixed using 2.5% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature and permeabilized using 0.5%Triton X-100 (v/v) in PBS for five minutes at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for one hour in 2% BSA (w/v) in PBS to block non-specific binding, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated with phalloidin conjugated to Texas red (1:500) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using Hoechst nuclear stain (10 mg/ml) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) (1:1000) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed once with double distilled water and mounted to microscope slides using a 9:1 solution of glycerol and PBS (Air Products &#x00026; Chemicals, Inc., Allentown, PA, USA). Images were viewed and captured using a Leica CTR-mic UV fluorescent microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) and a DC100 digital camera with Open Lab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor xenografts</title><p>All animal studies were conducted in accordance with institutional (University of British Columbia) guidelines for humane animal treatment and according to the current guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care. Mice were maintained at 22&#x000b0;C in a 12-hour light and dark cycle with <italic>ad libitum </italic>access to water and food.

The DRI can be used to estimate the doses of 267 and Dt needed when used in combination to achieve a defined effect level which can then be compared with the single agent dose required to achieve this effect. Based on these analyses, it was estimated that the concentration (dose) of 267 in the 267/Dt combination required to achieve an ED50 could be reduced by up to 3.6-fold in the LCC6 cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). 267 dose reductions were less remarkable in the other cell lines evaluated; ranging from no change to a 30% reduction. A similar analysis was completed for Dt (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>) and it was estimated that the concentration (dose) of Dt in the 267/Dt combination required to achieve an ED50 could be reduced in all cell lines by 2 to 25-fold when compared with Dt alone.

In these studies P-AKT (Ser473) was measured eight hours after addition of 267, a time point selected because no significant changes in cell viability (as measured by dye exclusion) were noted (even at the highest 267 dose used) yet significant reductions in P-AKT (Ser473) were detectable as noted in the representative western blots shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. P-AKT (Ser473) levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner over the range of 267 concentrations evaluated in both LCC6 and LCC6<sup>Her2 </sup>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Dt treatment alone was shown to have little or no measurable effect on P-AKT (Ser473) levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). In cells treated with the 267/Dt there were significant reductions in P-AKT (Ser473) levels which were also dose dependent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). None of the treatment strategies were shown to influence expression of total ILK or total AKT where protein loading was verified using &#x003b2;-actin. P-AKT levels from three independent experiments (as illustrated in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>) were qualitatively assessed by densitometry to estimate the effective doses needed to achieve a defined effect level represented by a FA value. As described above, these data in turn, could be used to estimate the dose of 267 required to achieve a defined level of P-AKT (Ser473) suppression when the drug was used alone or in combination with Dt. These calculated values have been summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref> (LCC6) and 4e LCC6<sup>Her2</sup>). The results clearly demonstrate that the combination acts differently in the Her2-positive cell line when compared with the parental LCC6 cell line. More specifically for LCC6 cells the dose of 267 required to achieve a defined level of P-AKT (Ser473) suppression was substantially reduced when Dt was present indicating that Dt potentiates 267 mediated suppression of P-AKT (Ser473). For example, the dose of 267 required to achieve 50% suppression of P-AKT (Ser473) (FA = 0.5) when used alone was calculated to be 30 &#x003bc;M, while in combination with Dt the dose required to achieve the same FA was reduced three-fold. In contrast, the densitometry data indicated that for LCC6<sup>Her2 </sup>cells, the concentration of 267 required in combination with Dt to achieve a defined effect (FA) on P-AKT (Ser473) inhibition was significantly higher than that required when 267 was used as a single agent. For example, 30 &#x003bc;M 267 was required to achieve an FA of 0.5 (ED50) when 267 was used alone; however, in the presence of Dt the concentration of 267 required to achieve an FA of 0.5 was estimated to be 130 &#x003bc;M.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Dose response curves were generated for changes in P-AKT in LCC6 and LCC6<sup>Her2 </sup>cells after treatment with QLT0267, docetaxel, or a fixed ratio combination of QLT0267 and docetaxel.

Densitometry assessment of western blots (n = 3) were used to estimate treatment response relative to controls (taken to be 100% P-AKT levels) and the resulting data was then analyzed by Calcusyn to determine estimated DRI. The DRI was then used to estimate the dose of 267 when used alone (black bars) or in combination with Dt (grey bars) needed to achieve a defined fraction affected (FA).

The 267/Dt combination resulted in enhanced P-AKT (Ser473) suppression compared with 267 alone when used to treat the parental cell lines (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b, d</xref>). However, this combination effect was lost when tested in the Her2 over-expressing cell lines, where the level of P-AKT (Ser473) suppression was no better or even worse than when 267 was used alone (compare Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref>). This effect is most notable in the LCC6<sup>Her2 </sup>cells where 267 caused a 92% reduction in P-AKT (relative to control) when used alone, but only a 24% reduction when used in combination with Dt. It should be noted that all four cell lines studies expressed similar levels of ILK and AKT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>) and treatment with 267 and Dt alone or in combination did not effect total ILK or AKT levels as detected by western blot analysis.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Levels of P-AKT were measured in LCC6, LCC6<sup>Her2</sup>, MCF-7, and MCF-7<sup>Her2 </sup>cells after treatment with a singles dose of QLT0267, docetaxel, or a combination of QLT0267 and docetaxel. <bold>(a) </bold>LCC6, LCC6<sup>Her2</sup>, MCF-7, and MCF-7<sup>Her2 </sup>cells express baseline levels of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), protein kinase B (AKT), and phosphorylated AKT (P-AKT). <bold>(b) </bold>LCC6, <bold>(c) </bold>LCC6<sup>Her2</sup>, <bold>(d) </bold>MCF-7, and <bold>(e) </bold>MCF-7<sup>Her2 </sup>cells were treated for eight hours QLT0267 (267) (42 &#x003bc;M), docetaxel (Dt) (1 nM), or the combination of 267 and Dt.

The 72-hour time point was selected because VEGF levels in the media were highest at this time; however, it can be suggested at this time point VEGF levels would be a reflection of both direct effects of 267 on VEGF expression and indirect effects due to 267 and/or Dt cytotoxicity as fewer viable cells capable of producing VEGF would be present. For this reason we focused on doses of 267 and Dt below that which caused 50% toxicity over the 72-hour incubation time. The results, summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, are consistent with previous publications and indicate that when LCC6, LCC6<sup>Her2</sup>, and MCF-7 cells are treated with 267 there is a significant decrease in VEGF secretion. This decrease was not observed in the MCF-7<sup>Her2 </sup>cell line. Treatment of LCC6 and LCC6<sup>Her2 </sup>cells with 10 &#x003bc;M 267 resulted in an approximately 79% and 83% decrease in VEGF secretion, respectively. When Dt was combined with 267, the decrease in VEGF secretion was larger (92%) when the drugs were added in combination to the LCC6<sup>Her2 </sup>cells. Conversely, when the drugs were used in combination to treat the LCC6 cells the decrease in VEGF levels in the media was 72%, an effect that was actually less then what was observed when using 267 alone. It should be noted that treatment with Dt (0.25 nM) was associated with a 56% and a 40% decrease in VEGF levels relative to controls for the LCC6 and LCC6<sup>Her2 </sup>cells, respectively. Thus the enhanced effect observed when using 267/Dt combination against the LCC6<sup>Her2 </sup>cells could be explained by the effects of the individual agents. This, however, is not the case for the LCC6 cells. The effect of 267 on VEGF secreted by MCF-7 cells was similar to that observed with the LCC6 cell line; 267 produced a 90% reduction in VEGF secretion when used alone and only 53% reduction when used in combination with Dt.

The results demonstrated that the combination effects are more complicated in cell lines that over-express Her2 and that for some endpoints measured (P-AKT) the data do not necessarily support further development of the 267/Dt combination for tumors that over-express Her2. Studies to be reported elsewhere have been completed to better characterize the effects of 267 and ILK inhibition in Her2 over-expressing cell lines. Here, however, we determined whether the favourable drug-drug interactions observed <italic>in vitro </italic>for the low Her2 expressing cells line could be recapitulated <italic>in vivo</italic>. 267 and Dt alone and in combination were used to treat mice with established LCC6<sup>luc </sup>tumors (LCC6 transfected with luciferase as described in the Materials and methods). These tumors were readily detectable in all mice 24 hours and seven days post-implantation of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells. Mice (n = 5, per treatment strategy) were treated with: the vehicle controls used for both 267 (orally) and Dt (intravenously); 200 mg/kg 267 (QD once daily for 28 days; orally); 10 mg/kg Dt (Q7D once weekly for four weeks; intravenously); or 267 (200 mg/kg; orally)/Dt (5 mg/kg; intravenously). The 267 dose and schedule was selected based on previous studies that showed effective therapy in different human xenograft models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The aim of this study was to determine whether use of 267 (200 mg/kg QD once daily for twenty eight days) in combination with Dt might improve treatment outcomes. A suboptimal dose of Dt (5 mg/kg) was administered using a Q7D once a week for four weeks dose schedule in order for us to assess whether 267 contributed to improved outcomes in a combination setting.

Survival (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8k</xref>) was determined based on the time in days required for the mice to be terminated due to tumor ulceration and/or the presence of tumors exhibiting volumes in excess of 500 mg.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>267/Dt combination therapy <italic>in vivo </italic>correlates with reduced tumor burden and extended survival in orthotopic LCC6 breast cancer tumor model.

Quantification of total light flux (n = 5 mice per treatment, average &#x000b1; standard error, background subtracted; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8i</xref>) demonstrated tumor burden was significantly less in mice that had received the combination treatment as compared with mice treated with the vehicle control or 267 alone (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05).

It is interesting to note that close examination of the pattern of luciferase expression showed that tumors from 267-treated animals (alone or in combination) exhibited dark regions in the center of the tumor (for an example refer to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8f</xref>, inset). These dark regions may reflect regions of necrosis or alternatively could be a result of treatment induced changes in tumor perfusion that may alter luciferin delivery to the tumors.</p><p>Kaplan-Meir survival analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8k</xref>) based on survival endpoints defined by tumor ulceration and/or tumor size (500 mg or larger) showed that the median survival time was 28 days (or 21 day post-treatment initiation) for untreated mice, 33 days (or 26 days post-treatment initiation) for mice treated with 267, 31 days (or 24 days post-treatment initiation) for mice treated with Dt and more than 90 days (or &#x0003e; 83 days post-treatment initiation) for mice treated with the 267/Dt combination. In reference to the latter group, it should be note that three out of five mice treated with 267/Dt combinations were still alive at day 91, while mice from all other treatment groups had been terminated due to tumor ulceration and/or a tumor size of more than 500 mg.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although it is understood that ILK is an important therapeutic target in cancer, the data summarized here (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) and elsewhere suggest that an ILK inhibitor such as 267 given alone will not achieve much more than a delay in tumor progression. Lack of potent single-agent activity, when using <italic>in vivo </italic>tumor growth as an efficacy measure, lends support to the belief that ILK inhibitors must be developed in the context of other therapeutics. A similar trend was exemplified by treatment regiments incorporating Tz (Herceptin&#x02122;), a therapy that targets Her2-expressing tumors. Tz as a single agent exhibits little significant activity, but when used in a combination setting it has proved to be of significant therapeutic value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The studies described here, focused on identifying agents that would work synergistically with QLT0267. We used cell-based screening assays in order to assess whether drugs commonly used for breast cancer could be combined with 267 to achieve better then expected therapeutic results. For these studies a fixed-drug ratio experimental design was used where drug-drug interactions were determined using at least three different drug-drug ratios applied over a broad range of effective doses (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). We show for the first time that combination of 267/Dt appeared to interact in a manner that results in synergy. Drug-drug interactions were measured by use of the median effect method of Chou and Talalay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and were initially determined on the basis of a therapeutic endpoint measuring metabolic activity (Alamar Blue assay). Synergy was observed over a broad range of effective dose and was measured in five out of six breast cancer cell lines tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), regardless of Her2 status. Although limited to results obtained with the two cell lines used for the broad combination screen (LCC6 and LCC6<sup>Her2</sup>) it is interesting to note that the 267/Dt combination was synergistic while combinations of 267 with paclitaxel and vinorelbine appeared antagonistic. This would suggest that the mechanism(s) promoting synergy may not involve microtubules in general. It has been suggested that Dt is more effective in treatment of breast cancer than paclitaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and in addition to its influence on microtubule assembly that culminates in a general cytotoxic response, Dt activity has been linked to increased activation of the apoptotic program and to changes of apoptotic marker expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It may be these additional activities of Dt that combine with 267 to produce enhanced therapeutic effects.</p><p>It was important to demonstrate that the individual drugs within the 267/Dt combination exert benefits consistent with their individual mechanisms of action. For example, 267 activity can be linked to measured changes in P-AKT (ser473) levels and VEGF while Dt activity can be assessed by drug-mediated changes in cell architecture. ILK inhibition by 267 engenders dose dependent decreases in levels of P-AKT (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and when 267 is added as a single agent it can inhibit VEGF secretion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Perhaps unexpectedly, single-agent 267 treatment also caused changes in cytoarchitecture and nuclear morphometry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This effect of 267 has not be reported previously, however, studies have provided evidence that ILK plays a role in cytoskeletal arrangement of actin through the regulation of proteins such as Rac and Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, siRNA mediated ILK silencing resulted in diminished cell spreading and actin cytoskeleton reorganization; results that help to explain ILK's role in the regulation of cancer cell motility and invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Recent evidence indicates a role for ILK in regulation of mitotic spindle organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. When this information is considered in light of the activity of Dt, one can speculate about the mechanism that may be promoting synergy when Dt is used in combination with 267. Studies have shown that cells treated with Dt exhibit a reorganization of the microfilament network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], disturbed microtubule structures, less F-actin stress fiber formation, decreased activation of Rac1/Cdc42, reduced cell motility, and an inhibition of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. When considering the primary effect of Dt on the microtubule cytoskeleton of cancer cells, and based on the results summarized here it can be suggested that the combination of Dt and 267 may result in synergistic changes in tubulin, F-actin organization, and nuclear degeneration during apoptosis.</p><p>As indicated above, inhibition of ILK by 267 was expected to cause a decrease in P-AKT at serine 473. However, the effect of Dt on AKT has not been well studied. Studies have suggested that Dt can suppress the phosphorylation of AKT in lymphoma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and lung carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Others have suggested that the AKT pathway can be activated by Dt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, results obtained in several breast cancer cell lines indicate that Dt added at doses of up to 1 nM exerted no significant effect on P-AKT levels after an eight-hour exposure. Importantly, Dt potentiates the effect of 267 on P-AKT levels, at least in LCC6 and MCF-7 cell lines (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, this beneficial combination effect was not observed in the Her2 transfected variants of these cell lines, suggesting that phosphorylation of AKT does not play a role in the enhanced cytototoxicity seen when 267 is combined with Dt to treat the Her2 over-expressing cells.</p><p>It has also been established that one of the beneficial therapeutic effects of 267 is associated with its ability to inhibit VEGF secretion. More specifically, it has been reported that integrins cooperate with the VEGF receptors to promote angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and other studies indicate that ILK and PI3-kinase are involved in VEGF signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Although not well studied, it has been suggested that Dt can influence vascularization <italic>in vivo </italic>in a fashion that is related to VEGF signaling. More specifically, Murtagh and Schwartz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] have recently demonstrated that Dt can prevent VEGF-induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, effects that may be mediated by Dt mediated dissociation of Hsp90 from tubulin and subsequent Hsp90 degradation by ubiquination. Thus, it could be speculated that combinations of 267 and Dt would be of particular interest in the context of VEGF-induced tumor vascularization; where 267 would suppress VEGF production and Dt would mitigate signaling through any remaining VEGF. However, preliminary <italic>in vitro </italic>studies summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> suggest in the cell lines that express low levels of Her2 that the 267/Dt combination was less effective at inhibiting VEGF secretion then when 267 was used alone. Similar to the P-AKT (Ser473) results, when using VEGF secretion as an endpoint, the results obtained in the Her2 over-expressing cell lines differed from those obtained with cells that express low Her2 levels.</p><p>On the basis of VEGF secretion and P-AKT (Ser473) data we can conclude that the 267/Dt drug combination effects were dependent on Her2 expression. These differences encouraged us to assess the effect of 267 on Her2 signalling in the Her2-positive cell lines. Although not reported here, these studies demonstrated that 267 treatment induced a dose-dependent decrease in Her2 levels; an effect that could also be obtained when using siRNA to silence ILK. This unexpected effect of 267 on Her2-positive cell lines complicated the interpretation of results in these cells and for this reason the <italic>in vivo </italic>studies reported here focused on mice bearing orthotopically transplanted LCC6 cells, which do not express detectable levels of Her2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This <italic>in vivo </italic>study provided evidence supportive of the beneficial therapeutic effects of the 267/Dt combination LCC6 tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) and suggest that further studies are warranted to address development of this combinations and the factors that may influence treatment outcomes; factors that include drug dose, schedule and sequencing as well as an assessment of therapeutic response <italic>in vivo </italic>that also includes multiple endpoints (e.g. tumor cell proliferation and death as well as tumor vascularization).</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>267: QLT0267; AKT: protein kinase B; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CH-ILKBP: calponin homology-containing ILK-binding protein; CI: combination index; D: dose; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium; DRI: dose reduction index; Dt: docetaxel; ECM: extracellular matrix; ED: effective doses; EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; EMT: epithelial to mesenchymal transition; F-actin: filamentous actin; FA/fa: fraction affected; FBS: fetal bovine serum; fu: fraction unaffected; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GSK-3: glycogen synthase kinase 3; Her2: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ILK: integrin-linked kinase; LCC6: MDA MB435/LCC6; LCC6Her2: MDA MB435/LCC6<sup>Her2/<italic>neu</italic></sup>; luc: luciferin; MEP: median effect method; MLC: myosin light chain; P-AKT: phosphorylated AKT (serine 473); PBS: phosphate buffered saline; PDK-1: phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1; ROI: region of interest; Tz: trastuzumab; v/v: volume to volume; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; w/v: weight to volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JK designed and executed all experiments and data analysis and wrote the manuscript.
