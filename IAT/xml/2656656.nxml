Disrupting any of several distinct steps in lipid synthesis decreases adiposity, but it is unclear if this approach coordinately corrects the environment that propagates metabolic disease. We tested the hypothesis that inactivation of FAS in the hypothalamus prevents diet-induced obesity and systemic inflammation. Ten weeks of high-fat feeding to mice with inactivation of FAS (FASKO) limited to the hypothalamus and pancreatic &#x003b2; cells protected them from diet-induced obesity. Though high-fat fed FASKO mice had no &#x003b2;-cell phenotype, they were hypophagic and hypermetabolic, and they had increased insulin sensitivity at the liver but not the periphery as demonstrated by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, and biochemically by increased phosphorylated Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, and FOXO1 compared with wild-type mice. High-fat fed FASKO mice had decreased excretion of urinary isoprostanes, suggesting less oxidative stress and blunted tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) responses to endotoxin, suggesting less systemic inflammation. Pair-feeding studies demonstrated that these beneficial effects were dependent on central FAS disruption and not merely a consequence of decreased adiposity. Thus, inducing central FAS deficiency may be a valuable integrative strategy for treating several components of the metabolic syndrome, in part by correcting hepatic insulin resistance and suppressing inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>metabolic syndrome</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes mellitus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Published, JLR Papers in Press, November 22, 2008.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Constant availability of food and sedentary living in contemporary wealthy cultures has dramatically limited the ability to utilize fat stores, resulting in an obesity epidemic. Worldwide, at least 1 in 10 adults is obese, and more than 25% are affected in many Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), leading to striking increases in type 2 diabetes and heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Over a quarter of adults in the United States have the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), a combination of central obesity, glucose intolerance/insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), that confers a 2- to 3-fold increase risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>Given the reluctance of most modern adults to eat less and exercise more, many groups have altered lipid metabolism in mice in hopes of establishing proof of principle for new obesity therapies. Mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity after genetic manipulations that decrease lipid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase-2, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1) and adipogenesis [peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (Ppar)&#x003b3;], increase mitochondrial gene expression (Ppar&#x003b4;), increase respiratory uncoupling (uncoupling protein-1, liver X receptor), or perturb intracellular signaling (Ikk&#x003b2;, S6k1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). However, it is not clear that simply decreasing adiposity will universally improve the metabolic disease milieu. For instance, liver X receptor-deficient mice have increased metabolism, yet they are predisposed to the chronic inflammatory process of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 null mice are also hypermetabolic and thin but are predisposed to acute colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>We recently identified hypothalamic expression of another key protein in lipid metabolism, as a mediator of energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). FAS is ubiquitously expressed and catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Pharmacologic inhibition of this enzyme with compounds such as C75 had previously implicated FAS in bioenergetics, but the lack of specificity of C75, notably its activation of the sympathetic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), raised the possibility that mechanisms independent of FAS could be involved.</p><p>By mating FAS floxed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) with RIPCre transgenic animals (known to express the Cre recombinase in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells and the hypothalamus), we generated animals with FAS deficiency limited to pancreatic &#x003b2; cells and the hypothalamus (FASKO). The lack of FAS, at least on a standard chow diet, did not affect &#x003b2;&#x02212;cell function. However, hypothalamic FAS deficiency resulted in mice that were hypophagic, hypermetabolic, and lean on a standard chow diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). While these results provided unexpected insights into the role of hypothalamic FAS in feeding and behavior, they did not address effects of this manipulation on the risk for diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation that are characteristic of human type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In addition, the high-fat feeding paradigm also allowed us to critically examine whether the beneficial metabolic effects in the FASKO mice are simply a consequence of decreased adiposity or due to a specific perturbation in central FAS signaling. Here we report the results of experiments testing the hypothesis that deficiency of hypothalamic FAS prevents diet-induced obesity and systemic inflammation, clinically relevant endpoints.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals and feeding studies</title><p>Protocols were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Generation of mice with FAS deletion in the hypothalamus and pancreatic &#x003b2; cells (FASKO), and wild-type (Cre negative with the FAS floxed allele) in a mixed (BL/6 and 129) background has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Starting at 6 weeks of age, FASKO and wild-type littermates were started on a Western-style diet (TD 88137, Harlan Teklad) [high-fat diet (HFD)] containing 21% (w/w) total lipid and 0.15% (w/w) total cholesterol for 10 weeks. Fatty acid composition of this diet is presented in supplementary Table I. Body weight was recorded weekly, and food intake [expressed as a function of lean body mass (g<sup>0.75</sup>)] was measured biweekly. On week 8, stools were collected to determine lipid content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), and percentage of consumed lipid that was absorbed was calculated as (food intake &#x000d7; food lipid content) &#x02212; (stool output &#x000d7; stool lipid content)/(food intake &#x000d7; food lipid content) &#x000d7; 100. After 10 weeks of high-fat feeding, another cohort of wild-type mice received an amount of food identical to that consumed by the FASKO mice (pair-fed) for an additional 15 days. These pair-fed wild-type mice were then subjected to the same experiments (see below) as freely fed wild-type and FASKO mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Analytical procedures</title><p>Body composition, indirect calorimetry, locomotor activity, serum glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol, &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate, leptin, adiponectin, glucose, and insulin tolerance tests were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).

There are examples of disruption of the expected inverse relationship between adiposity and aberrant metabolism. Despite decreased adiposity, inactivation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 promotes the development of diabetes in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Conversely, despite increased adiposity, mice with inactivation of TLR-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), as well as mice with overexpression of adiponectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), have enhanced insulin sensitivity. Novel therapies most likely to provide benefit will not only decrease adiposity but also ameliorate pathophysiologic conditions such as insulin resistance, fatty liver, and systemic inflammation. Here we demonstrate that central nervous system inhibition of de novo lipogenesis mediated by FAS protects mice from HFD-induced diabetes and results in enhanced hepatic insulin signaling, less fatty liver, decreased circulating triglycerides and free fatty acids, an improved adipokine profile, and evidence of decreased oxidative stress as well as systemic inflammation.</p><p>Our initial characterization of these mice on standard chow demonstrated decreased adiposity due to a combination of hypophagia and increased locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). The current results extend this work by showing that the decreased food intake and increased activity phenotype is preserved in the setting of high-fat feeding and protects mice from obesity. These findings, while logical, were not necessarily predictable. The product of the FAS reaction, mostly palmitate, appears to serve a signaling function that includes activation of Ppar&#x003b1; signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Due to the fact that HFDs are enriched in palmitate (see supplementary Table I), it was possible that the provision of large amounts of this molecule could reverse the behavioral phenotype of these mice. This did not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), indicating that either dietary palmitate cannot substitute for the product of the FAS reaction in brain or FAS is compartmentalized in the central nervous system to sites critical for energy homeostasis. Our pair-feeding studies support a potentially direct role for hypothalamic FAS in the regulation of bioenergetics (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>).</p><p>The current data also show that the absence of FAS expression in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells does not affect &#x003b2;-cell function even under conditions of nutrient excess. In reductionist systems, de novo lipogenesis in islets may be important for normal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) but in intact mice, this process does not impact insulin secretion from islets isolated from mice following low-fat chow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) or high-fat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) feeding.</p><p>Limitations to this work include the fact that these animals are in a mixed (BL/6 and 129) background and utilize the RIP-driven ectopic expression of the Cre recombinase, which has been shown to affect &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). While genetic admixture and Cre could have confounding effects, controls were littermates of the FASKO mice and included Cre only in addition to floxed only mice. We also failed to observe any &#x003b2;&#x02212;cell phenotype.</p><p>Beneficial effects at the liver were striking in high-fat fed FASKO mice. Hepatic glucose production was decreased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>) without an effect on peripheral glucose disposal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>), suggesting that much of the enhanced glucose tolerance in high-fat fed FASKO mice was due to effects at the liver. Consistent with this observation, insulin signaling was increased in liver but not muscle of FASKO as compared with control mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In FASKO as compared with control mice, the lipid content of liver but not muscle was decreased with high-fat feeding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Expression of sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1c, an insulin responsive transcription factor important for lipogenesis, was substantially decreased in the FASKO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), which likely contributes to their protection from fatty liver because their tissues were notable for the absence of up-regulated expression of genes involved in fat oxidation, uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation, or futile energy cycling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Consistent with our sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1c findings in liver, hepatic sterol-regulatory element binding protein expression is known to be increased in mouse models of obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Additional mechanisms may also be involved in the protection from hepatic steatosis. CD36 expression was decreased in FASKO as compared with control livers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), consistent with previous reports showing CD36 up-regulation in HFD-induced steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). FASKO mice are more active than controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>), consistent with studies implicating increased physical activity in the protection against fatty liver in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>).</p><p>Observations from the present study with high-fat feeding and our previous data in chow-fed FASKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) collectively support the notion of FAS functioning as a nutritional sensor within the hypothalamus. Inhibition of hypothalamic carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>) and accumulation of malonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) independently reduce food intake. Products of the FAS reaction serve as endogenous ligands to activate PPAR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). FASKO mice demonstrate reduced expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, targets of PPAR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Thus, manipulations of hypothalamic fatty acid oxidation (via inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1) and synthesis (via accumulation of malonyl-CoA) that alter feeding behavior can be orchestrated through FAS.</p><p>Inactivation of hypothalamic FAS also affects glucose metabolism, providing another example of how FAS might serve as a nutritional sensor and contributing to a growing body of evidence identifying the brain-liver axis as a mediator of glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Disrupting central nervous system liver neural signaling lowers blood glucose and blood pressure in the setting of glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Central inhibition of lipid oxidation in the hypothalamus decreases hepatic glucose production in overfed rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Central administration of lactate decreases glucose production in rats with diet-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Now we show that inactivation of lipogenesis in the hypothalamus (see supplementary Table II) reduces glucose production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>) and enhances hepatic insulin signaling in the setting of nutrient excess (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), independent of AMPK activation (see supplementary Fig. I) and adiposity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). As glucose production by the liver is the main endogenous fuel source, hypothalamic FAS appears to regulate exogenous (via food intake) and endogenous (via glucose production) energy availability.</p><p>Systemic oxidative stress correlates with fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>) and may promote insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Increasing oxidative metabolism increases production of reactive oxygen species, which may induce inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Thus, while increasing fat oxidation might be considered beneficial by decreasing body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), it may increase reactive oxygen species, and, depending on the tissue in which such species are generated, this effect could impair physiology. Global stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 deficiency, which increases the rate of &#x003b2;-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), increases proinflammatory cytokines and predisposes to acute colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Accelerating metabolism specifically in the vasculature increases the chronic inflammatory condition of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). In contrast, FASKO mice have less oxidant stress (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) and less systemic inflammation as manifested by decreased serum levels of TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), inflammatory markers elevated in insulin resistance and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). At least some of this effect is mediated by macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), and insulin resistance is ameliorated by inhibiting macrophage recruitment in animal models of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Consistent with these findings, macrophages were less apparent in adipose tissue of FASKO mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, bottom).</p><p>Although decreased inflammation in FASKO mice could reflect decreased adiposity, this effect appears to be due to a specific consequence of central FAS deficiency rather than body-fat content as suggested by pair-feeding studies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Despite reducing adiposity of wild-type mice to the same level as the FASKO animals (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>), the leaner pair-fed wild-type mice continued to manifest similar peak serum TNF&#x003b1; concentrations as the obese ad libitum HFD fed wild-type controls in response to endotoxin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>). These studies lend support to the notion that the brain can affect inflammation. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in vivo during lethal endotoxinemia in rats attenuates TNF&#x003b1; levels and prevents shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Perturbation of de novo lipogenesis in FASKO mice, which alters systemic energy balance, also appears to directly affect systemic inflammation.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest a critical role for hypothalamic FAS in the orchestration of bioenergetics, hepatic insulin signaling, and systemic inflammation resulting in obesity-resistance and enhanced insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref>). Medicinal chemists frequently pursue potential drug targets with a goal of excluding compounds from the central nervous system in hopes of diminishing behavioral side effects. The current data suggest that a strategy of targeting FAS at specific sites in the brain could coordinately improve multiple features of obesity-related disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M800379-JLR200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800379-JLR200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>HFD, high-fat diet</p></list-item><list-item><p>IL-6, interleukin-6</p></list-item><list-item><p>FASKO, fatty acid synthase knockout</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ppar, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor</p></list-item><list-item><p>TNF&#x003b1;, tumor necrosis factor alpha</p></list-item></list></glossary><ack><p>We thank Dr. Barbara Mickelson at Harlan Teklad for her assistance with obtaining fatty acid composition of the high-fat diet.
