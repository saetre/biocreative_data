BDNF is now known to be involved in a number of biologic functions, including regulation of differentiation/survival of sensory neurons, regulation of nociceptive function and central pain modulation, and modulation of inflammatory pain hypersensitivity.</p><p>Nerves grow into tissues in response to signaling molecules called neurotrophins, which are involved in the survival, differentiation, migration and outgrowth of neurons. We now know that neurotrophins are expressed in non-neuronal tissues, including the IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Gigante and colleagues recently reported the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA, the high-affinity tyrosine kinase A receptor and the low-affinity p75 receptor in rounded cells in the disc annulus and nucleus pulposus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. NGF and its receptors tyrosine kinase A and p75 are expressed not only in the developing nervous system, but also in the mature adult nervous system &#x02013; where they are particularly important because of their association of primary nociceptive neurons. The recent review by Mendell and colleagues points out that in adults NGF acts as an important intermediate in pain, contributing to peripheral and central sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>One other neurotrophin has previously been studied in the IVD. Abe and colleagues have reported on the expression of NGF by human IVD cells in control disc tissue <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>in cells from control IVDs using immunocytochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. NGF was found to be high in the outer annulus and in herniated disc tissue. Abe and colleagues' work also demonstrated that the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1; had stimulatory effects on NGF. These authors suggested that such actions may play a role in nerve sprouting into the IVD, and may be associated with discogenic pain.</p><p>Ohtori and colleagues have reported on the presence of BDNF in dorsal root ganglion neurons innervating lumbar discs in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Supraspinal BDNF-tyrosine kinase receptor B signaling is now known to represent a mechanism underlying the development of persistent pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Another important role for BDNF involves more recent advances in our understanding of BDNF function. The interesting studies by Kermani and colleagues have documented the ability of BDNF to promote revascularization via endothelial cells and hematopoietic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These investigators suggest their work with skeletal muscle and heart indicates that the signaling pathway involving BDNF and its receptor may also be active in modulation of angiogenesis in specific organs in the adult. In light of the avascular status of the adult IVD, this role merits future research.</p><p>Because of the significance of BDNF in the IVD, our objectives in the present work were to use immunocytochemistry to determine the distribution of BDNF and its receptor in the human IVD, and to test for gene expression of BDNF and its receptor in cultured human annulus fibrosus cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Clinical study population</title><p>The experimental study of human IVD specimens was approved prospectively by the authors' Human Subjects Institutional Review Board (protocol number 08-04-09E).

Quantitative assessment of the proportion of cells positive for BDNF localization showed significantly greater localization in the outer annulus compared with the inner annulus or the nucleus pulposus (<italic>P </italic>&#x02264; 0.01). Quantitative analysis was not performed for the BDNF receptor, but qualitatively its localization appeared to follow a similar pattern.</p><p>BDNF and the BDNF receptor were also found to be present in sand rat lumbar IVDs, and the immunolocalization pattern was similar to that seen in human IVDs but with more labeled cells present in the outer annulus. Inner annulus cell and nucleus cells in the human IVD were found to occasionally show positive immunolocalization, but at a significantly lower proportion. Although there was minimal background present in the animal tissues, it must be remembered that this portion of our study utilized antihuman antibodies, no biochemical analysis of the cross-reactivity of the sand rat substrates was carried out, and a danger of some false-positive reactivity with proteins in the sand rat IVD remains a concern that at present cannot be discounted.</p><p>Neurotrophins are beginning to be viewed as important agents in the IVD. Aoki and colleagues have suggested that NGF-dependent neurons may be the nerve population responsible for discogenic pain based on findings from studies of disc degeneration in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A study of human discs from subjects with low back pain performed by Freemont and colleagues identified a positive relationship between ingrowth of nonmyelinated, nociceptive nerves into the IVD and the production of nerve growth factor by nearby ingrowing blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Studies have recently shown production of several neurotrophins by IVD cells, but the mechanisms that control their expression, and the effects these factors have on disc cells, are poorly understood. Gigante and colleagues recently reported the presence of NGF mRNA and the high-affinity tyrosine kinase A receptor and the low-affinity p75 receptor in the rounded cells in the disc annulus and nucleus pulposus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The p75 receptor is of special interest because it also has the ability to bind to BDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The work presented here adds to, and expands, our understanding of the distribution of BDNF and its receptor in the human IVD. In addition to NGF, BDNF has recognized neuroprotective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. There is also evidence that BDNF can be considered a neurotransmitter and may have a role in nociceptive transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Work by Thompson and colleagues suggests that BDNF may be released from primary sensory nociceptors with activity such as that involved with persistent pain states and inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is well recognized that differential regulation of neurotrophin expression occurs in inflammatory states, such as in the airway, where NGF, BDNF and neurotrophin 3 have been shown to be elevated during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Increased proinflammatory cytokines are now well recognized during IVD degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], providing support for the hypothesis that BDNF <italic>in vivo </italic>may be produced in response to inflammatory cytokines during IVD degeneration. Clearly the relationship of BDNF to inflammatory cytokines in the IVD merits future research attention.</p><p>The recent studies of by Kermani and colleagues regarding the ability of BDNF to promote revascularization via endothelial cells and hematopoietic progenitors are currently unexplored in the IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These investigators suggest that the signaling pathway involving BDNF and its receptor may function in modulation of angiogenesis in specific organs in the adult. Since the adult disc is avascular, the potential of BDNF to influence angiogenesis in the mature disc is intriguing.</p><p>Finally, the initial observations by Boyd and colleagues that showed the upregulation of BDNF by application of increased osmolarity remains intriguing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and suggests the potential importance of the unexplored relationship between mechanoregulation and BDNF in the human IVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data presented here document the presence of BDNF and its receptor in the human IVD at the translational level, and also show the expression of BDNF and its receptor by cultured human annulus cells. Quantitative assessment of the proportion of cells positive for BDNF localization showed that the outer annulus contained a significantly larger proportion of positive cells compared with the inner annulus or the nucleus (<italic>P </italic>&#x02264; 0.01). Our findings point to the need for further studies to define the role of BDNF in the human IVD and to investigate regulatory events, especially those related to mechanoregulation, which regulate the expression of BDNF and its receptor in the human IVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BDNF = brain-derived neurotrophic factor; IVD = intervertebral disc; IL = interleukin; NGF = nerve growth factor; TNF = tumor necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HEG conceived of the study and participated in study design with ENH, analyzed the data, and prepared and revised the manuscript.
