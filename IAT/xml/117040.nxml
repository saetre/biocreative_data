All known vertebrate TFIIIAs have a similar organization: nine zinc fingers, followed by a C-terminal domain of unknown structure. The zinc fingers of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> TFIIIA are interrupted between fingers eight and nine by an 81-amino acid spacer. Aside from the amino acids required for zinc finger folding, TFIIIAs from different species are remarkably divergent, whereas the natural binding site, the internal control region of the 5S rRNA gene, is well conserved. We now describe the identification and characterization of TFIIIA from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. This protein is organized differently from its known homologs, in that it contains eight closely spaced zinc fingers, a ninth zinc finger missing a C-terminal Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-coordinating histidine, a 53- amino acid spacer, and an unprecedented tenth zinc finger. We have confirmed the identity of this divergent protein as TFIIIA by showing that it binds specifically and with high affinity to the <italic>S.pombe</italic> 5S rRNA gene. Comparison of DNase I protection patterns produced by TFIIIA from multiple species suggests a novel mode of DNA recognition by the <italic>S.pombe</italic> protein.

Transcription complex assembly is initiated by the binding of this factor, transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA), to the gene and is completed by the binding of the multi-subunit factors TFIIIC, TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c5">5</xref>). The DNA-binding moiety of TFIIIA consists of multiple consecutive C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers, a motif originally defined on the basis of its repeated occurrence in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> TFIIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c7">7</xref>). Although it is the archetypal example of a zinc finger protein, <italic>X.laevis</italic> TFIIIA is atypical in that it contains an unusually large number of tandemly repeated zinc finger domains (nine), and binds to a particularly large segment of double-stranded DNA. TFIIIA from <italic>X.laevis</italic> binds not only to the 5S rRNA gene, but also to 5S rRNA, the gene product. Through this mechanism, it participates in feedback inhibition of 5S rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c9">9</xref>) and participates in a network of interactions that couple 5S rRNA synthesis to ribosomal protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c10">10</xref>). The structure, nucleic acid-binding capabilities and transcriptional activity of <italic>X.laevis</italic> TFIIIA have been studied extensively by our group and others. In addition, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> TFIIIA has been analyzed in some detail.</p><p>Analysis of TFIIIA sequences from several vertebrate species, including human, catfish, mouse, rat and five species of frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c17">17</xref>), has revealed remarkably poor conservation of primary sequence. In fact, we have estimated a divergence rate of 1.5&#x02013;3 amino acid changes per residue per billion years for TFIIIA during the evolution and diversification of vertebrates (data not shown). This rate of evolutionary change is high when compared with other zinc finger proteins, other transcription factors or proteins in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c19">19</xref>). The rapidity of the rate is particularly surprising given the relatively high degree of sequence conservation observed for the TFIIIA-binding site in 5S rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c20">20</xref>) (&#x0223c;58&#x00025; identity between <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>X.laevis</italic>), and the fact that dual recognition of 5S rRNA genes and 5S rRNA might have been expected to place additional constraints on TFIIIA&#x02019;s sequence. Despite variation in primary sequence, however, vertebrate homologs of TFIIIA possess a similar structural organization consisting of nine closely spaced zinc fingers followed by a C-terminal domain of indeterminate structure. A region within the C-terminal domain of <italic>X.laevis</italic> TFIIIA has been shown to be required for the support of transcription of 5S rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c21">21</xref>).</p><p>The organization of the <italic>X.laevis</italic> and human TFIIIA genes suggests that the repeated zinc finger motif resulted from duplication of exons encoding individual zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c22">22</xref>) (analysis of the human gene performed using BLAT at www.genome.ucsc.edu). In the TFIIIA genes of both species, each of the first six zinc fingers is encoded by an individual exon, while the seventh, eighth and first half of the ninth finger are encoded by a seventh exon. The second half of finger nine and the C-terminal domain are encoded by an eighth exon. Presumably, ancestral introns separating exons encoding individual C-terminal zinc fingers have been lost subsequent to motif duplication. In fact, it is possible that additional zinc fingers present in an ancestral protein have been lost in the vertebrate lineage. Brown <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c23">23</xref>) have even argued that remnants of three additional zinc fingers can be identified in <italic>X.laevis</italic> TFIIIA.</p><p>TFIIIA from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> has diverged so significantly from the vertebrate proteins that little sequence conservation can be discerned other than at the seven residues in each zinc finger that are important for maintaining the conserved zinc finger fold. The protein contains nine zinc fingers, as do the vertebrate proteins, but also includes a unique 81-amino acid spacer region between fingers eight and nine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c25">25</xref>). This region includes a leucine-rich oligopeptide that is required for transcription of 5S rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c26">26</xref>). A 40-amino acid C-terminal region that is dispensable for transcriptional activity follows finger nine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c27">27</xref>).</p><p>Despite its considerable divergence in sequence and structural organization, TFIIIA appears to function similarly in various vertebrate species and in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. Therefore, it is of interest to determine if the rapid evolutionary divergence of TFIIIA has resulted in additional categories of structural organization in other distantly related eukaryotic species. To this end, we have identified and characterized TFIIIA from <italic>S.pombe</italic>, fission yeast, and show that it possesses a number of interesting features that clearly distinguish it from its homologs in vertebrates and <italic>S.cerevisiae.</italic></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Isolation of an <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA cDNA and purification of recombinant protein</title><p>A cDNA encoding the putative <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA homolog was cloned for bacterial expression using PCR amplification from an <italic>S.pombe</italic> cDNA library constructed in plasmid pGAD-GH (provided by G.

The insoluble recombinant TFIIIA was solubilized from the pellet with 5 M urea, and purified with two sequential ammonium sulfate precipitations followed by BioRex70 (BioRad) ion-exchange column chromatography.

We confirmed that virtually all of the probe molecules were bound by protein prior to DNase I digestion by running an aliquot of the reaction mixture on a non-denaturing gel and observing little or no unbound probe in the mixture (data not shown).

Increasing amounts of unlabeled competitor 5S rDNA were added to reaction mixtures containing constant amounts of TFIIIA and labeled DNA. The amounts of bound and free DNA were quantified using a gel mobility shift assay and the equilibrium binding constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for the interaction was determined as described in Materials and Methods and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c40">40</xref>). We measured a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 0.19 nM (SE &#x000b1;0.03) for the interaction between <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA and 5S rDNA. This value is roughly comparable with those reported previously for the binding of <italic>X.laevis</italic> or <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> TFIIIA to 5S rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c41">41</xref>).

A whole cell extract was prepared from <italic>S.pombe</italic>, based upon a method developed for the analysis of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> RNA polymerase I machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c35">35</xref>) and used previously to study the transcription of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> 7S L gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c36">36</xref>). This extract is capable of transcribing a plasmid-borne 5S ribosomal RNA gene <italic>in vitro</italic>, with or without added recombinant TFIIIA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf385f4">4</xref>), at an efficiency of approximately 0.5 transcripts per template per 2 h. The transcript generated migrates close to the position of authentic <italic>X.laevis</italic> 5S rRNA, which is 120 nt long. The additional band generated in these reactions is likely to be a post-transcriptionally labeled tRNA molecule (R. Maraia, personal communication).</p><p>We further confirmed that the 120-nt transcript is in fact 5S rRNA using oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf385f5">5</xref>A). An oligonucleotide was designed to anneal to 5S rRNA within structurally conserved loop C (positions &#x0002b;33 to &#x0002b;44) and was expected to direct cleavage of the transcript by RNase H into fragments of &#x0223c;30 and &#x0223c;70 nt. The RNA was specifically cleaved to generate the expected two fragments only in the presence of the oligonucleotide and RNase H. The transcript was also shown to be generated only when a 5S rRNA gene sequence was present in the plasmid template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf385f5">5</xref>B). In addition, we demonstrated that generation of the transcript is sensitive to the transcriptional inhibitor &#x003b1;-amanitin at concentrations previously observed to inhibit synthesis of <italic>S.pombe</italic> tRNA in a differently prepared <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription system (50&#x00025; inhibition at &#x0223c;0.5 mg&#x0002f;ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c43">43</xref>) (data not shown).</p><p>Analysis of 5S rRNA synthesis in the extract as a function of time revealed the existence of a lag of &#x0223c;1 h before any appreciable product accumulation could be detected. Similar, though not as lengthy, lags in activity have been described for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription by RNA polymerase III in crude extracts from <italic>X.laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c44">44</xref>). Products accumulated almost linearly for at least 3 h after the initial lag, from approximately 0.03 transcripts per template at 1 h to 1.5 transcripts per template at 4 h (data not shown). Further experiments were done at a fixed incubation time of 2 h.</p><p>In order to assay the activity of recombinant TFIIIA in this system, it was necessary to remove endogenous TFIIIA activity from the whole cell extract. To this end, the extract was fractionated on phosphocellulose, using conditions similar to those used previously to fractionate factors involved in RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c47">47</xref>). The transcriptional activity of the 0.6 M P11 fraction was tested for 5S rDNA- and TFIIIA-dependence. We showed that the 120 nt RNA was produced only in the presence of recombinant TFIIIA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf385f6">6</xref>) and of a plasmid containing an <italic>S.pombe</italic> 5S rRNA gene (data not shown).</p><p>Conditions for transcription were optimized with respect to monovalent salt and magnesium concentration. Optimal activity was observed at 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 100 mM monovalent salt. Activity is quite sensitive to deviations from these optimal salt concentrations. At 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, activity was reduced by &#x0223c;30&#x00025; and by &#x0223c;85&#x00025; at 7.5 mM. Similarly, transcriptional activity exhibits a surprisingly narrow monovalent salt optimum, with a decrease in activity of &#x0223c;90&#x00025; at salt concentrations of either 50 or 150 mM (data not shown).</p><p>Reactions were performed at a range of TFIIIA concentrations with a fixed amount of 0.6 M P11 fraction to determine if transcriptional activity is sensitive to increasing amounts of added TFIIIA. The results were quantified and the number of transcripts per input template molecule was determined. At high concentrations of recombinant protein, transcriptional activity reached a plateau, corresponding to an efficiency of approximately 0.2 transcripts per template per 2 h. Thus, in these reactions, a component of the transcriptional apparatus other than TFIIIA is limiting. This component is unlikely to be the template, as adding additional template beyond the 4.1 nM concentration used in these experiments did not increase the transcriptional activity (data not shown). Rather, it is likely that one of the protein components of the transcription complex or RNA polymerase III, included in the extract, is entirely sequestered in complexes in the presence of high concentrations of TFIIIA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Despite considerable sequence divergence when compared with TFIIIAs from vertebrates or <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, it is clear from the results presented here that the protein we have characterized is indeed <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA. We have shown that the protein has specific 5S rDNA-binding activity, with an affinity and DNase I-protection pattern similar to those exhibited by previously characterized TFIIIAs from distantly related species. Additionally, we have shown that the recombinant form of the protein is capable of supporting 5S rDNA transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Several novel features of TFIIIA from <italic>S.pombe</italic> add additional complexity to considerations of TFIIIA&#x02019;s evolutionary ancestry. Most notably, <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA is unique among characterized homologs in that it contains 10, rather than nine, zinc finger motifs. Putative TFIIIA homologs have also been identified from genome sequencing efforts in the fungi <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> &#x0005b;Neurospora Sequencing Project, Whitehead Institute&#x0002f;MIT Center for Genome Research (www-genome.wi.mit.edu)&#x0005d; and <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (The Institute for Genomic Research website at http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.tigr.org). Interestingly, a potential tenth zinc finger can be identified in both cases, although there are multiple deviations from consensus in several fingers. Thus, <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA may be representative of a larger sub-family of 10-finger-containing TFIIIA homologs. An interesting possibility is that the common ancestor of vertebrates, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> possessed a 10-finger version of TFIIIA similar in overall organization to that now observed in <italic>S.pombe</italic>. In this scenario, ancestral finger nine would have diverged extensively in the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> lineage, resulting in an extended spacer between ancestral fingers eight and 10, now considered to be fingers eight and nine. Similarly, finger 10 would have diverged in the vertebrate lineage to become part of the C-terminal non-finger region; alternatively, it may have been deleted entirely. Thus, <italic>S.pombe</italic> finger nine would be orthologous to vertebrate finger nine and to the first 30 or so amino acids of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> spacer, although no vestige of sequence similarity remains to validate this hypothesis. Similarly, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> finger nine would be the ortholog of <italic>S.pombe</italic> finger 10 and the last part of the C-terminal tail of the vertebrate protein. Again, however, no remaining sequence similarity between the vertebrate C-terminal tail and any zinc finger can be discerned.</p><p>In principle, the evolutionary relationships between the zinc fingers in vertebrate, <italic>S.pombe</italic> and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> TFIIIAs might be revealed by inter-finger sequence comparisons. Unfortunately, the sequence divergence is so great that we have been unable to detect any convincing patterns of similarity when all possible pair-wise comparisons among the zinc fingers of the three proteins are made. Thus, the evolutionary scenario presented remains speculative, and establishing which of the 10 <italic>S.pombe</italic> zinc fingers is the &#x02018;extra&#x02019; one in comparison with the nine fingers found in other species is likely to be difficult.</p><p><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> TFIIIA includes several other deviations from the typical zinc finger consensus. Most significant among these is the absence of a C-terminal Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-coordinating histidine residue in finger nine. We have shown previously that replacement of the C-terminal histidine with other residues in at least some zinc fingers of <italic>X.laevis</italic> TFIIIA produces adverse effects on DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c48">48</xref>). Furthermore, one might expect that the absence of a C-terminal histidine would interfere with stable folding of the putative zinc finger domain, and that <italic>S.pombe</italic> finger nine would therefore not form a functional zinc finger. Although this may very well be the case, other considerations suggest that the C-terminal histidine might not be essential. Merkle <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c49">49</xref>) have shown that model zinc finger peptides can fold even in the absence of a C-terminal histidine, presumably using a water molecule as the fourth Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ligand. It is also noteworthy that a cysteine residue is found six positions C-terminal to the first putative Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-coordinating histidine, and Bohm <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c38">38</xref>) have described the existence of a small number of such variant putative zinc finger motifs in the genome of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. Although no variant zinc finger of this type has yet been studied biochemically, it is certainly possible that zinc finger nine of <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA is a functional member of this zinc finger domain subfamily.</p><p>Other unusual features of the zinc fingers of <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA include the absence of a highly conserved hydrophobic residue two residues before the first Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-coordinating cysteine of finger seven, non-consensus spacing between the Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-coordinating cysteines and histidines in finger six, and a very short spacer between fingers six and seven. Interestingly, the sixth zinc finger in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> share an identical heptapeptide (WSQLQ) preceding the first Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-coordinating histidine. In fact, the initial tryptophan residue of this sequence is conserved in all characterized TFIIIAs and has been implicated in 5S rRNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c51">51</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of the DNase I protection patterns produced on 5S rRNA genes by TFIIIAs from <italic>X.laevis</italic>, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> reveals another distinctive feature of <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf385f7">7</xref>). The overall size of the region protected by the <italic>S.pombe</italic> protein is similar to that protected by <italic>X.laevis</italic> TFIIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c46">46</xref>), but larger than that observed in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c52">52</xref>). There is, however, a striking difference in the pattern of protection within the putative ICRs of the <italic>X.laevis</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> 5S rRNA genes. Whereas the <italic>X.laevis</italic> protein completely protects the template strand from residues &#x0002b;45 to &#x0002b;96, a region of &#x0223c;11 bp, from &#x0002b;63 to &#x0002b;73, remains unprotected by <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA. The differences in the protection patterns observed with these three proteins suggest that DNA recognition occurs differently in each case. In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, the lack of protection at the 5&#x02032; end of the binding site is consistent with results from Rowland and Segall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c41">41</xref>) showing that the four C-terminal zinc fingers of TFIIIA can be deleted without affecting the pattern of DNase protection. Thus, the C-terminal zinc fingers of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> TFIIIA are unlikely to be intimately associated with the 5S rRNA gene, even though cross-linking results suggest that some extended association of TFIIIA with the 5&#x02032; end of the ICR does occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c53">53</xref>). In <italic>X.laevis</italic>, individual DNA subsites across the length of the control region can be associated with almost every zinc finger in TFIIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c56">56</xref>), even though fingers four and six have been proposed to span successive minor grooves with little or no direct DNA contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c58">58</xref>). The extended region of non-protection in the middle of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA footprint suggests that contacts made by <italic>X.laevis</italic> TFIIIA to the intermediate element of the 5S rRNA gene ICR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c58">58</xref>) may not occur in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, and that DNA contacts are restricted to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the control region. It seems likely, therefore, that binding of <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA to the 5S rRNA gene is mediated by some combination of N- and C-terminal zinc fingers only. Additional investigation of this issue is clearly merited.</p><p>Others have identified short oligopeptide sequences in both <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c26">26</xref>) and <italic>X.laevis</italic> TFIIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c21">21</xref>) that are important for transcription of 5S rRNA genes but that play no role in DNA recognition. Presumably, structures involving these sequences play a role in higher order interactions that are important for transcription complex assembly and&#x0002f;or function. Interestingly, the relevant sequences from the two species exhibit no similarity to each other, although the <italic>X.laevis</italic> sequence is conserved among tetrapod vertebrates. We can find no peptide sequence in <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIIA that resembles either of the sequences specifically important for transcriptional activity in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> or <italic>X.laevis</italic>. It will be important to determine just what region of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> protein, if any, is dispensable for DNA binding but important for transcriptional activity, and that therefore may be functionally analogous to the characterized sequences in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>X.laevis</italic> TFIIIA. It should be noted that there is also striking sequence diversity among the homologous polypeptide subunits of TFIIIC and TFIIIB from humans, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf385c59">59</xref>). It is reasonable to hypothesize that the divergent regions of TFIIIA found to be specifically important for transcription may interact with similarly divergent surfaces on one or more subunits of TFIIIC or TFIIIB.</p><p>It is intriguing that different structural organizations characterize TFIIIAs in the three evolutionary lineages represented by <italic>X.laevis</italic>, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic>, even though the same ultimate function, recognition of 5S rRNA genes and nucleation of transcription complex assembly, is served in each case. The use of different mechanisms to satisfy the same biological requirement&#x02014;synthesis of 5S rRNA&#x02014;affords an opportunity to gain insight into fundamental biochemical processes through comparative analysis of the 5S rRNA synthetic machinery in these three species.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf385f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Sequence alignment of TFIIIA from <italic>X.laevis</italic>, <italic>S.pombe</italic> and <italic>S.cerevisiae.</italic> Sequences were aligned manually to show the conservation of the structural residues in each zinc finger and to illuminate the differences in sequence and spacing in each case.
