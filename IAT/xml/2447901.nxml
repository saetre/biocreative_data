One consequence of deadenylation is the formation of nontranslatable messenger RNA (mRNA) protein complexes (messenger ribonucleoproteins [mRNPs]). Nontranslatable mRNPs may accumulate in P-bodies, which contain factors involved in translation repression, decapping, and 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; degradation. We demonstrate that deadenylation is required for mammalian P-body formation and mRNA decay. We identify Pan2, Pan3, and Caf1 deadenylases as new P-body components and show that Pan3 helps recruit Pan2, Ccr4, and Caf1 to P-bodies. Pan3 knockdown causes a reduction of P-bodies and has differential effects on mRNA decay. Knocking down Caf1 or overexpressing a Caf1 catalytically inactive mutant impairs deadenylation and mRNA decay. P-bodies are not detected when deadenylation is blocked and are restored when the blockage is released. When deadenylation is impaired, P-body formation is not restorable, even when mRNAs exit the translating pool. These results support a dynamic interplay among deadenylation, mRNP remodeling, and P-body formation in selective decay of mammalian mRNA.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>D.

Poly(A) tails are first shortened to &#x0223c;110 nt by Pan2 in association with Pan3. In the second phase of deadenylation, a complex composed of Ccr4 and Caf1 catalyze further shortening of the poly(A) tail to oligo(A). Decapping by the Dcp1&#x02013;Dcp2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lykke-Andersen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Dijk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piccirillo et al., 2003</xref>) may occur during and/or after the second phase of deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). Although Pan3 and Caf1 associate with Pan2 and Ccr4 poly(A) nucleases, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tucker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Temme et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uchida et al., 2004</xref>), their in vivo roles in mammalian mRNA turnover remain unclear. In yeast, Pan3 does not exhibit poly(A) nuclease activity but its association with Pan2 is required for proper function of Pan2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mangus et al., 2004</xref>). In vitro experiments using recombinant human Pan2 and Pan3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uchida et al., 2004</xref>) suggest that Pan3 plays a role in enhancing the poly(A) nuclease activity of Pan2 in mammalian cells. However, ectopic overexpression of Pan2 alone in mouse NIH3T3 cells results in highly rapid and processive deadenylation of an otherwise stable reporter mRNA or a premature translation-termination codon (PTC)&#x02013;containing mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>), indicating that Pan3 is not required for the nuclease activity of Pan2 for mammalian mRNA turnover. Instead, Pan3 may modulate the activity of Pan2 poly(A) nuclease or link deadenylation to subsequent decay of the mRNA body. Unlike Pan3, Caf1 exhibits poly(A) nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daugeron et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dupressoir et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Temme et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molin and Puisieux, 2005</xref>). However, studies in yeast show that Caf1 poly(A) nuclease activity per se is not required for general deadenylation in vivo, although the presence of Caf1 is necessary for proper deadenylation by Ccr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Viswanathan et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, the major poly(A) nuclease activity in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> resides in the Ccr4&#x02013;Caf1 complex, with depletion of Caf1 exerting a stronger impeding effect than depletion of Ccr4 on deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Temme et al., 2004</xref>). Mammalian Caf1 has also been shown to display poly(A) nuclease activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Viswanathan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchin et al., 2005</xref>), but the role of Caf1 in mammalian mRNA turnover remains unclear.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed the existence of specific cytoplasmic foci, known as RNA P-bodies (processing bodies), that contain proteins with known functions in mRNA metabolism (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eulalio et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kedersha and Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>). These foci are also referred to as GW bodies because they carry GW182 proteins that are required for miRNA-mediated translation repression (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding and Han, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eulalio et al., 2007b</xref>). Translationally repressed mRNA protein complexes (mRNPs), factors which are involved in translational repression including miRNA-mediated translational silencing proteins (such as Argonaute proteins and Rck/p54), decapping enzymes, and a 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; exonuclease Xrn1, are also found in these foci (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eulalio et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kedersha and Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>). Thus, recent studies of P-bodies have mainly focused on the roles of decapping and translation repression in P-body formation. The relationship of these P-body&#x02013;related machineries to deadenylation, the first step triggering mRNA decay, and the roles of deadenylation factors in P-body formation remain largely unclear. Besides, owing to the power of yeast and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genetics, the participating factors and their roles in eukaryotic P-body formation and mRNA turnover were largely identified by studies in yeast and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Little was known about these important issues in mammalian cells.</p><p>In wild-type yeast strain under normal growth conditions, neither endogenous Ccr4&#x02013;Caf1 (or Pop2) complex nor ectopically expressed Ccr4 form any discernable foci that colocalize with P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>). Although Ccr4 and Pop2 can be localized in P-bodies in mutant yeast strains with xrn1 or dcp1 gene deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>), defects in Ccr4p and Pop2p do not significantly affect P-body formation and composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the Ccr4&#x02013;Caf1 complex was also found in cytoplasmic foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Temme et al., 2004</xref>), but whether those foci are P-bodies or not was not addressed. The only mammalian poly(A) nuclease that has been shown to localize in P-bodies is Ccr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cougot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrei et al., 2005</xref>). Although knocking down Ccr4 in HeLa cells can lead to loss of P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrei et al., 2005</xref>), the effect of Ccr4 knockdown on deadenylation in these cells was not addressed. Thus, it is not clear as to whether P-body loss caused by knocking down Ccr4 is because of the impairment of deadenylation or simply because of the absence of the Ccr4 protein molecule that may be physically important for the structural integrity of P-bodies. Therefore, the role of deadenylation factors in P-body formation and the relationship between deadenylation and P-body formation in mammalian cells remain unknown. For example, are Pan2, Pan3, and Caf1 also present in P-bodies like Ccr4? Are these factors necessary for P-body formation, and are their functions in deadenylation crucial for P-body formation? Is deadenylation a prerequisite for P-body formation? In this paper, we address these questions by examining the subcellular localization and functions of poly(A) nucleases and their cofactors in relation to the formation of P-bodies and mRNA turnover in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Pan2 and Pan3 are components of P-bodies</title><p>We first determined whether Pan2 and Pan3, the factors involved in initiating mammalian mRNA deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uchida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>), are found in P-bodies of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts (the cell line used for monitoring mRNA decay kinetics by the well-established transcriptional pulsing system; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2007</xref>).

Moreover, the endogenous Pan3 also distributes in cytoplasmic foci that colocalize with the Pan2 foci in COS7 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, bottom). Because of lack of an anti-Pan3 antibody suitable for immunofluorescence microscopy of mouse NIH3T3 cells, DNA coding for HA-Pan3 (HA-tagged Pan3) was delivered into NIH3T3 cells via transient transfection. Our data show that HA-Pan3 also distributes in a focal pattern colocalized with P-bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). It is worth noting that the number of P-bodies increased appreciably when HA-Pan3 was overexpressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), suggesting a role of Pan3 in initiating or enhancing the formation of P-bodies. The HA-Pan3 foci are not stress granules, as they can be detected regardless of whether or not the cells were treated with arsenite (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801196/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801196/DC1</ext-link>), a cellular stress inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kedersha et al., 2002</xref>). Stress granules were only found in the arsenite-treated cells, as visualized by a stress granule marker G3BP1 (Fig. S2, bottom), and not in cells without arsenite treatment (Fig. S2, top). Importantly, when stress granules were induced, they did not colocalize with the HA-Pan3 foci (Fig. S2, bottom, right). Collectively, our results identify both Pan2 and Pan3 as being two new components of P-bodies in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Pan3 helps Pan2, Ccr4, and Caf1 localize to P-bodies</title><p>Although Pan2 and Pan3 can form a complex in the cytoplasm, the finding that HA-Pan3 can be detected in P-bodies when it is overexpressed alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>) suggests that Pan3 can associate with P-bodies without a coordinated expression of Pan2.

Immunofluorescence microscopic results show a strong staining in both nuclei and cytoplasm of cells (with two to six foci colocalized with P-bodies marked by GW182 in each cell) when the anti-Caf1 antibody was used (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, top), whereas only a weak and nonspecific background staining was detected when preimmune serum was used (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, bottom).

The importance of deadenylation for initiating NMD in mammalian cells is a recent insight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Shyu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>) because previous studies in yeast supported a decapping-dependent NMD pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muhlrad and Parker, 1994</xref>). Several findings demonstrate that mammalian NMD occurs in the cytoplasm and is triggered by deadenylation but not by decapping. A PTC at codon 39 of &#x003b2;-globin (BBB&#x0002b;PTC) mRNA induces accelerated deadenylation and subsequent rapid decay of the RNA body. Blocking translation initiation stabilizes the transcript, confirming involvement of the NMD pathway in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Shyu, 2003</xref>). Moreover, knocking down Dcp2 does not have any appreciable stabilizing effect on a PTC-containing mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). In the present study, we further show that NMD, ARE-mediated mRNA decay, and the default decay pathway for a stable message are all impaired when deadenylation is inhibited either by knocking down Caf1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) or by overexpressing a Caf1 dominant-negative mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, deadenylation is a necessary initial step for all major paths of mRNA decay yet recognized in mammalian cells, including NMD.</p></sec><sec><title>Deadenylation is a prerequisite and precursor for P-body formation</title><p>Several lines of evidence from this study demonstrate that deadenylation is a prerequisite and precursor for P-body formation in mammalian cells. First, impairment of deadenylation by knockdown of Caf1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) leads to loss of P-bodies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>). In contrast, Pan3 knockdown results in P-body reduction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) but has little or no impairing effect on deadenylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These results show that blocking deadenylation impairs P-body formation but that the converse is not true, thereby establishing the cause&#x02013;effect relationship between deadenylation blockage and P-body loss. Second, the inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative mutant of Caf1 on deadenylation and P-body formation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, and S4) demonstrate that P-body loss caused by knocking down deadenylation factors is because of deadenylation blockage by itself and not simply because of the absence of the protein molecules that may be physically important for P-body integrity. Importantly, coexpression of wild-type Ccr4 with the Caf1 mutant, a situation in which deadenylation blockage is released (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>, bottom, middle), allows P-body formation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, left). Third, puromycin, which increases the pool of nontranslatable mRNAs, induces P-body formation only when deadenylation is not blocked (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Thus, it appears that mRNPs in P-bodies represent poly(A)-shortened mRNAs regardless of how they arrived in P-bodies or what their future fate is.</p></sec><sec><title>Deadenylation may induce mRNP remodeling required for P-body formation</title><p>Several observations in this study suggest that an mRNP containing a poly(A)-shortened mRNA undergoes remodeling before it appears in P-bodies. First, Pan2&#x02013;Pan3 and Ccr4&#x02013;Caf1 complexes can interact with each other in vivo (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that they form a super complex to direct the two consecutive phases of deadenylation in a concerted manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>) and to elaborate subsequent mRNP remodeling. This notion is further supported by our observation that overexpression of the Caf1 mutant impaired both the first and the second phases of deadenylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). It appears that the two phases of deadenylation, although they take place sequentially, are functionally linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). Second, key components of both poly(A) nuclease complexes are all found in P-bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting a direct role for them in P-body formation. Third, although PABP can enhance Pan2 nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeck et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mangus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uchida et al., 2004</xref>) and can interact with Pan3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), PABP does not colocalize with P-bodies (Fig. S3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that the first phase of deadenylation, as well as that of mRNP remodeling involving dissociation of PABPs, occurs before appearance of an mRNP in P-bodies.</p><p>Because PABPs are not found in P-bodies and one major change in mRNPs after deadenylation is the loss of PABPs, one important implication of our observations is that PABPs play an inhibitory role and prevent mRNPs from joining existing P-bodies or nucleating P-body formation in mammalian cells. It is plausible that the 3&#x02032; poly(A) tail of an mRNA must first be shortened, not only to permit dissociation of PABPs or factors that are important for efficient translation of the mRNP but also to allow joining of translation repressors or other P-body components to the mRNP.</p></sec><sec><title>P-bodies play differential roles in mRNA turnover and are not required for all mRNA decay pathways in mammalian cells</title><p>A central issue concerns whether all mRNA decay requires P-bodies.

In this case, P-bodies provide a storage site for mRNAs before they are degraded or reenter translatable pool (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eulalio et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kedersha and Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>). On the other hand, for aberrant mRNAs, such as PTC-containing transcripts, sequestration in P-bodies may provide a rapid means to prevent accidental translation before degradation. Collectively, our results indicate that P-bodies play differential roles in mammalian mRNA turnover and are not required for all mRNA decay pathways in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Pan3 and Caf1 have distinct roles in mammalian mRNA turnover</title><p>Mammalian deadenylation is mediated by a concerted action of Pan2&#x02013;Pan3 and Ccr4&#x02013;Caf1 poly(A) nuclease complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). Although knocking down Pan3 has little effect on the first phase of deadenylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), Pan3 appears to play a role in modulating the activity of Pan2 or linking deadenylation to subsequent decay of the mRNA body. This notion is supported by the observations that ectopic overexpression of Pan2 alone results in highly rapid and processive poly(A) shortening of the otherwise stable BBB mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>) and that the deadenylation and decay kinetics of a BBB transcript in cells coexpressing Pan2 and Pan3 are similar to those observed in cells not overexpressing these two factors (unpublished data). Moreover, we show in this paper that Pan3 knockdown enhances the decay of BBB and BBB&#x0002b;ARE mRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, middle [right] and bottom [right]). Together with the newly discovered roles for Pan3 in P-body formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), our findings offer an explanation as to why this evolutionarily highly conserved protein is not required for deadenylation per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tucker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Temme et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molin and Puisieux, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Unlike Pan3, Caf1 is indispensable for mammalian deadenylation. Knocking down Caf1 or overexpressing a Caf1 dominant-negative mutant blocks deadenylation and stabilizes the transcripts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Although Caf1 and Ccr4 each exhibit poly(A) nuclease activity, these two proteins associate with each other and function as a poly(A) nuclease complex in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tucker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Temme et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006</xref>). Our data show that the poly(A) nuclease activities of Ccr4 and Caf1 in the Ccr4&#x02013;Caf1 complex have complementary roles in mammalian deadenylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Overexpression of the Caf1 catalytically mutant alone or the Ccr4 mutant alone interferes with the normal deadenylation function of the Ccr4&#x02013;Caf1 complex because these mutants have a dominant-negative effect that overrides the activity of endogenous deadenylase complexes. Overexpression of both HA-Ccr4 wild-type and HA-Caf1 mutant or overexpression of both HA-Caf1 wild-type and Ccr4 mutant promotes the formation of functional deadenylase complexes because the deadenylase activity of the wild-type protein can complement its partner in the same complex. In contrast, HA-Ccr4 mutant and HA-Caf1 mutant cannot form a functional deadenylase complex with each other, as both mutants are catalytically inactive. It is worth noting that although Caf1 knockdown severely impairs mRNA deadenylation and decay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), Ccr4 knockdown only modestly affects the second phase of deadenylation without significantly impairing overall mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the role of Caf1 in mammalian turnover is distinct from that of Ccr4 and is more significant than previously recognized.</p></sec><sec><title>A model linking deadenylation, P-bodies, and mRNA decay</title><p>Based on previous and the current findings, we envisage the following scenario for deadenylation, P-body formation, and differential mRNA decay in mammalian cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Pan2&#x02013;Pan3 and Ccr4&#x02013;Caf1 complexes first form a super complex on mRNAs in the cytoplasm. The 3&#x02032; poly(A) tail&#x02013;PABP complex then stimulates poly(A) shortening by the Pan2&#x02013;Pan3 in the super complex but inhibits the activity of Ccr4&#x02013;Caf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tucker et al., 2002</xref>), allowing the first phase of deadenylation to proceed. mRNP remodeling occurs during or after the first phase of deadenylation. Remodeling might involve dissociation of PABPs and some translation initiation factors and association of translation repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eulalio et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>) to promote the transition of mRNPs to a nontranslatable state. A remodeled mRNP may associate with existing P-bodies or nucleate formation of new P-bodies, in which the second phase of deadenylation by Ccr4&#x02013;Caf1 and/or decapping would proceed. For some mRNPs, such as a PTC-mRNP, this process may take place with the help of Pan3. Sequestration within P-bodies at this point may provide a quick means of keeping aberrant mRNPs, such as PTC-mRNPs, from being translated before their poly(A) tail or cap is removed and the RNA body degraded. Alternatively, a remodeled mRNP may undergo the second phase of deadenylation outside of P-bodies, which could induce another mRNP remodeling that determines whether the oligo(A)-mRNP would be degraded inside or outside of P-bodies.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>A model linking deadenylation, P-bodies, and mRNA decay.</bold> See Discussion for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820089f09"></graphic></fig><p>The observation that four component proteins of the two major poly(A) nuclease complexes can be found in mammalian P-bodies links all major mRNA decay factors except the 3&#x02032; exosome complex to P-bodies. The present results argue for a biological role for P-bodies in coupling deadenylation and mRNP remodeling to translation repression in an effective manner. One important conclusion from our findings in this study is that although P-bodies may be assembled via different mechanisms, deadenylation is always a necessary step that enables mRNPs to enter existing P-bodies or to initiate the formation of P-bodies. It will be interesting to see how knockdown of Pan3 or Caf1 or overexpression of the Caf1 dominant-negative mutant might impact different posttranscriptional mechanisms regulating mammalian mRNA expression, such as those mediated by miRNAs, whose functions were found to be linked to P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jackson and Standart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nilsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pillai et al., 2007</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eulalio et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>To construct a plasmid encoding HA-tagged Pan3 or Caf1, a 2.2-kb Pan3L cDNA amplified by RT-PCR from human testis total RNA (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) or an 855-bp fragment encoding Caf1 amplified from IMAGE clone 6207987 was inserted between the EcoRV and XhoI sites of pSRHisHA (gift from S.
