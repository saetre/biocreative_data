To identify novel exo- and endo-nucleases that might function in DNA repair, we undertook a proteomic screen making use of the movable ORF (MORF) library of yeast expression plasmids. This library consists of 5,854 yeast strains each expressing a unique yeast ORF fused to a tripartite tag consisting of His<sub>6</sub>, an HA epitope, a protease 3C cleavage site, and the IgG-binding domain (ZZ) from protein A, under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter for inducible expression. Pools of proteins were partially purified on IgG sepharose and tested for nuclease activity using three different radiolabeled DNA substrates. Several known nucleases and phosphatases were identified, as well as two new members of the histidine phosphatase superfamily, which includes phosphoglycerate mutases and phosphatases. Subsequent characterization revealed YDR051c/Det1 to be an acid phosphatase with broad substrate specificity, whereas YOR283w has a broad pH range and hydrolyzes hydrophilic phosphorylated substrates. Although no new nuclease activities were identified from this screen, we did find phosphatase activity associated with a protein of unknown function, YOR283w, and with the recently characterized protein Det1. This knowledge should guide further genetic and biochemical characterization of these proteins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nucleases play essential roles in nucleic acid metabolism.

The 3&#x02032; end of the invading strand initiates DNA synthesis and is displaced by helicases to pair with the other side of the break to generate non-crossover products. Alternatively, after DNA synthesis the second end is captured, forming a double Holliday junction intermediate. These junctions are resolved by HJ resolvase(s) to generate crossover or non-crossover products, depending on orientation of cleavage of the junctions by resolvase.

Much of our understanding of the mechanisms of HR is based on physically monitoring double-strand break-induced recombination in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and analysis of mutants defective for different steps in the pathway. However, until recently the identity of the nucleases functioning in the earliest step of recombination, 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; resection of DSBs, was unknown because of redundancy for this step of the pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Gravel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Mimitou1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Zhu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, no single mutant with the predicted resolution-defective phenotype has been identified in budding yeast, suggesting there is also redundancy for processing HJ-containing recombination intermediates. The Mus81-Mms4 (Mus81-Eme1 in fission yeast) heterodimeric nuclease resolves strand invasion intermediates by two sequential cleavages of branched intermediates to form crossover products. This mode of resolution is essential for meiotic recombination in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, but plays a less important role in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Boddy1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-delosSantos1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Kaliraman1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Osman1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The human Bloom's syndrome helicase complex (BLM-TopoIII&#x003b1;&#x02212;&#x003a1;&#x0039c;&#x00399;1) has been shown to resolve dHJ intermediates <italic>in vitro</italic> by a process called dissolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Raynard1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Wu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Wu2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The helicase activity of BLM branch migrates the constrained HJs and the topoisomerase activity of TopoIII&#x003b1; is thought to remove the supercoils between the two HJs eventually leading to the resolution in a non-crossover configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006993-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Biochemical approaches to identify HJ resolvases from fractionated extracts of yeast identified the mitochondrial protein Cce1 (cruciform cleaving endonuclease); this has no obvious function in nuclear HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Kleff1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Symington1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

This library consists of 5,854 yeast strains each expressing a unique yeast ORF fused to a tripartite tag consisting of His<sub>6</sub>, an HA epitope, a protease 3C cleavage site, and the IgG-binding domain (ZZ) from protein A, under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter for inducible expression. The His<sub>6</sub> and ZZ domains provide a means for affinity purification of the over-expressed proteins. The MORF library represents 93.2&#x00025; of the verified <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ORFs and most of these have either been sequenced completely or are expected to lack mutations based on the error rates of the polymerases used to amplify the yeast ORFs. This collection of strains has been successfully used to detect glycosylated proteins and the activity of proteins known to catalyze tRNA modification reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Gelperin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. One possible disadvantage of the over-expression screening approach is that proteins that are part of complexes may not be detected if only one subunit is over-expressed. A collection of yeast strains in which the endogenous locus of individual ORFs has been tagged at the C-terminus with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag is also commercially available and has been used to identify components of protein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Gavin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, because the proteins in the TAP-tag collection are expressed from the endogenous promoter and are present in single copy, pooling strategies are unlikely to be successful in identification of poorly expressed proteins. Thus, in order to screen for nuclease activities we chose to use the MORF library to accomplish a comprehensive screen of the yeast proteome more rapidly.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of Known Nucleases, Helicase and Phosphatases</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> MORF (movable ORF) fusion protein library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Gelperin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> was screened for proteins, which could degrade and/or cleave <sup>32</sup>P-labeled ssDNA, Y-shaped and HJ-containing substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006993-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To conveniently assay 5,854 proteins, the library strains were grown in pools, with each pool containing 24 strains expressing individual fusion proteins. After induction, cells were lysed and proteins were purified by IgG sepharose bead pull down, followed by cleavage with protease 3C. The pools of proteins were then assayed with the 3 different <sup>32</sup>P-labeled substrates (ssDNA, Y and HJ-X26) for nuclease activities. After activity was observed in one pool, the active pool was deconvoluted to identify the strain and ORF responsible for the activity. For pools that contained a known nuclease, a separate pool was generated of 23 strains without the nuclease to determine whether that nuclease was responsible for the activity within the 24-strain pool. The identity of each ORF was confirmed by the size as determined by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using HA antibody, and by sequencing of the plasmid DNA recovered from the yeast strain.

After deconvolution of the pool and sequencing the plasmid in the active strain, the nuclease was identified as Rad27 (FEN-1). The plate position for Rad27 is inverted compared with the spreadsheet location; another group independently found this error (P. Burgers, personal communication). Several other known nucleases, including Apn1, Pso2, Rat1 and Rex2 were also identified in this screen (data not shown). Like Rad27, the plate position for Pso2 does not match the spreadsheet location. We did not detect activity for other members of the Rad27/FEN-1 nuclease family, Exo1, Din7 and Rad2 in the pools screened, and only a very weak activity was detected for the individual strain expressing Exo1 that was grown and processed separately (data not shown). The mitochondrial HJ resolvase, Cce1, was identified using the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled HJ substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006993-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). We did not detect the recently identified HJ resolvase, Yen1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Ip1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, because this clone is absent from the MORF library.

Because these nucleases are functional as heterodimers, and only one subunit is over-expressed, it is likely the amounts of heterodimer are too low to be detected, especially as Y and intact HJs are not the preferred substrates for either Mus81-Mms4 or Rad1-Rad10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Osman1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Davies1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-BastinShanower1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

TLC confirmed that Det1 removes inorganic phosphate from ATP only at pH 4.4 and not at pH 7.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006993-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). In contrast, YOR283w exhibited a broad optimum pH between 7 and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006993-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Our results also indicated that both phosphatases do not require divalent cations for activity as would be expected for members of the histidine phosphatase superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006993-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0006993-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006993.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Characterization of the Det1 and YOR283w phosphatase activities.</title><p>Optimum pH (A) metal dependence (B) and substrate specificity (C) of Det1 and YOR283w were measured by the release of inorganic phosphate as described in Experimental Procedures. &#x003c3;, sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer; &#x029eb;, Tris-acetate or Tris-HCl buffer; &#x003bd;, CAPS/NaOH buffer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006993.g006"/></fig><p>To explore the substrate specificity of Det1 and YOR283w, assays were performed with a range of phosphorylated substrates.

At the time the screen was initiated, the identity of exonucleases involved in the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; resection of DSB ends was unknown, and the only activities known to cleave DNA substrates containing a Holliday junction were the mitochondrial protein Cce1 and the Mus81-Mms4 complex.</p><p>From the screen of pooled strains we identified several known nucleases, including Rad27, Apn1, Pso2, Rex2 and Rat1. Although Rat1 and Rex2 are exoribonucleases, they appear to have activity on DNA substrates, similar to the Rat1-related protein Kem1/Sep1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Amberg1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Johnson1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease Exo1 was not detected in the screen, but weak activity was found for the fusion protein individually purified (data not shown). The low activity could be because the protein is rapidly cleaved during extract preparation and the nuclease activity resides in the N-terminal region of the protein, not the C-terminal region that would have been recovered using the tag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Fiorentini1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The failure to detect some known nucleases by the pooling strategy raises the possibility that unknown nucleases might have been missed in the screen if they have very low activity, or are inactive in the presence of 1 mM Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> included in the reaction buffer. It is also possible that heteromeric nucleases would not be identified because only one component is over-expressed; however, we did identify a Rat1-associated protein, Rai1, in this screen. Of more concern is the lack of representation by nucleases in the library. The Dna2, Kem1 and Yen1 nucleases, as well as the catalytic subunits of DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (Pol &#x003b4;) and Pol &#x003b5;, which have intrinsic 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity, are absent from the MORF library. Dna2 has recently emerged as a candidate for 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; resection of the ends of DSBs by genetic and biochemical assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Zhu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Liao1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, and Yen1 was identified as a HJ resolvase using the TAP-tagged strain collection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Ip1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Because the MORF library requires amplification of plasmids in <italic>E. coli</italic> it is possible that nucleases expressed at low levels in <italic>E. coli</italic> are toxic to the organism and thus are under-represented in the library. Most plasmid libraries are propagated in <italic>E. coli recA</italic> strains and low expression of a nuclease might be particularly toxic to <italic>recA</italic> mutants that have no capacity for homology-dependent repair.</p><p>Although no new nuclease activities were identified from this screen, we did find phosphatase activity associated with a protein of unknown function, YOR283w, and with the recently characterized protein Det1. Our preliminary biochemical characterization of these two proteins suggest they are able to hydrolyze phosphate from several substrates, including DNA, ATP, 3-PGA, &#x003b1;-napthyl phosphate and &#x003c1;-nitrophenyl phosphate, and that Det1 is active at acid pH whereas the phosphatase encoded by YOR282w has a broad pH range. Both proteins contain the conserved RHG motif characteristic of members of the histidine phosphatase superfamily, which includes phosphoglycerate mutases and phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Rigden1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The conserved histidine residue is transiently phosphorylated during catalysis. Members of this family identified by sequence homology are frequently referred to as mutases, but most members are in fact phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Rigden1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>DET1</italic> was recently identified as a gene required for non-vesicular transport of sterols in both directions between the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Sullivan1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The precise function in sterol transport is unknown, and our biochemical characterization does not identify potential substrates. A recent study identified the insect enzyme ecdysteroid phosphate phosphatase and the related human protein Sts-1 as members of the histidine phosphatase superfamily, and demonstrated phosphatase activity using ecdysteroid and steroid phosphate substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Davies2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, YOR283w was identified as essential for the viability of the <italic>sec14 kes1</italic> double mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Fairn1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Sec14 is the major phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylinositol (PI) transfer protein in budding yeast and is essential for vesicular transport from the Golgi apparatus. Kes1 is an oxysterol binding protein family member that binds to sterols and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and regulates Golgi apparatus-derived vesicular transport. This finding raises the possibility that the physiological substrate for YOR283w could be a PI phosphate. Analysis of the activity of YOR283w and Det1 on specific phosphorylated lipids might be informative, as well as genetic studies to investigate the interaction with other components of the vesicular and non-vesicular transport pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Purification of MORF library proteins</title><p>The biochemical screen used a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> MORF fusion protein library purchased from Open Biosystems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006993-Gelperin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Yeast strains from the library were first grown individually in synthetic complete (SCG)-URA liquid media in a 96-well plate format. After growth at 30&#x000b0;C for 2 days, pools of the library strains were grown in 200 ml synthetic medium containing 2&#x00025; raffinose as a carbon source and lacking uracil (SCR-URA) until the culture reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8 to 1.0. Fusion protein expression was induced by adding 100 ml 3xYP (3&#x00025; yeast extract; 6&#x00025; bacto-peptone) and 6&#x00025; galactose, to a final concentration of 1xYP and 2&#x00025; galactose, respectively. Expression was induced for 6 hours, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with cold water, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. To obtain crude lysates, cells were resuspended in 5 ml lysis buffer &#x0005b;20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 300 mM NaCl; 1 mM DDT; 10&#x00025; glycerol (v/v); 0.5 mM PMSF; 1/1000 protease inhibitor cocktail set IV (Calbiochem)&#x0005d;. An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads was added and cells were lysed by vortexing for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and was centrifuged one more time. The cell extract was mixed with 200 &#x000b5;l IgG sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and the mixture was gently rotated for 2 hrs at 4&#x000b0;C to adsorb proteins to the beads. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was discarded. The beads were washed 3 times with 50 vol of lysis buffer and 4 times with 50 vol of 3C protease cleavage buffer &#x0005b;50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 10&#x00025; glycerol (v/v)&#x0005d;. Beads with 4 vol of 3C protease cleavage buffer were incubated with &#x0223c;10 &#x000b5;g of purified GST-3C protease overnight. After centrifugation, the supernatant fraction, containing the cleaved proteins, and the sepharose bead-bound proteins were separately assayed for nuclease activities. The plasmid for expression of the GST-3C protease was a gift from E. Phizicky (U. Rochester) and was purified by glutathione agarose affinity chromatograpy from lysates of <italic>E. coli</italic>.

The extract was mixed with glutathione sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 hrs at 4&#x000b0;C to adsorb proteins to the beads. After the beads were precipitated by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer, the GST fusion protein was eluted from the beads with 2 vol of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 200 mM NaCl; 5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol; 5&#x00025; glycerol; 25 mM reduced glutathione.
