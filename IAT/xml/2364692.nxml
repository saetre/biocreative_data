During the process of arteriogenesis, endothelial cell tubes become invested with precursor cells, which subsequently differentiate into SMCs and form the medial layer of the blood vessels (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carmeliet, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Owens et al., 2004</xref>). Although the primary function of differentiated SMCs is contraction, SMCs during embryonic development also exhibit high rates of cell proliferation, migration, and production of extracellular matrix proteins that are required for vessel morphogenesis. SMC differentiation is characterized by coordinate induction of expression of a unique repertoire of SMC differentiation markers, including SM &#x003b1;-actin, SM22&#x003b1;, SM-myosin heavy chain, and h1-calponin. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling SMC differentiation during early stages of arteriogenesis are poorly understood.</p><p>Expression of SMC differentiation markers has been shown to be controlled by a combinatorial interaction of multiple transcription factors and cofactors (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Owens et al., 2004</xref>). The promoter-enhancer regions of many SMC differentiation marker genes contain multiple CArG [CC(AT-rich)<sub>6</sub>GG] elements, and the transbinding factor serum response factor (SRF) and its coactivator myocardin play a key role in the regulation of these genes. Indeed, results of previous studies from our laboratory and others showed that <italic>myocardin</italic> was exclusively expressed in SMCs and cardiomyocytes and that it markedly induced the transcription of multiple CArG-containing SMC differentiation marker genes in the presence of SRF, whereas suppression of myocardin by either dominant-negative constructs or siRNA was associated with marked decreases in transcription of these genes in cultured aortic SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, we showed that myocardin served as a point of convergence in mediating effects of environmental cues on expression of SMC differentiation marker genes, in that angiotensin II and platelet-derived growth factor BB regulated expression of CArG-containing SMC differentiation marker genes via changes in <italic>myocardin</italic> expression in cultured aortic SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yoshida et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). However, myocardin does not appear to be required for the initial induction of SMC lineage because recent studies revealed that <italic>myocardin</italic>-null embryonic stem (ES) cells were able to differentiate into SMCs in the context of chimeric knockout mice, which were generated by injection of <italic>myocardin</italic>-null ES cells into the wild-type blastocysts in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pipes et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, results of in situ hybridization assays showed that <italic>myocardin</italic> expression was quite low or undetectable in early developmental stages of vascular SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2003</xref>). As such, although the preceding results provide compelling evidence that the CArG&#x02013;SRF&#x02013;myocardin complex plays a key role in the control of SMC differentiation marker gene expression in differentiated SMCs, the initial induction of SMC differentiation may not be dependent on myocardin and may be regulated through alternative molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Results of our previous studies have shown that Prx1 (also called as <italic>Prrx1</italic> and MHox), a homeodomain protein, plays a key role in basal and angiotensin II&#x02013;induced expression of SMC differentiation marker genes in adult differentiated SMCs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hautmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yoshida et al., 2004a</xref>). Treatment with angiotensin II in fully differentiated cultured SMCs increased expression of <italic>Prx1</italic> as well as <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic>. In addition, siRNA-induced suppression of <italic>Prx1</italic> decreased basal and angiotensin II&#x02013;induced expression of <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> in differentiated SMCs. Moreover, recombinant Prx1 protein enhanced the binding of SRF to CArG elements within the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> promoter, although studies failed to detect the stable interaction between SRF and Prx1. These studies suggest that Prx1 is important in mediating angiotensin II&#x02013;induced SMC hypertrophy in differentiated SMCs. However, there is no evidence showing that Prx1 plays a role in regulating SMC differentiation marker genes during SMC development or in SMC hypertrophy in vivo. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergwerff et al. [2000]</xref> found no evidence of defective SMC differentiation within developing embryos in <italic>Prx1</italic>, <italic>Prx2</italic>, or <italic>Prx1/Prx2</italic> knockout mice. At present, there is no direct evidence that homeodomain proteins regulate SMC differentiation in vivo.</p><p>We previously developed an in vitro inducible SMC differentiation lineage system derived from clonal lines of multipotential P19 embryonal carcinoma cells harboring an <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> promoter-enhancer&#x02013;driven puromycin-resistant gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manabe and Owens, 2001</xref>). One of these clonal lines, designated &#x0201c;A404,&#x0201d; lacked expression of any known SMC differentiation marker gene under basal conditions but showed induction of all known SMC differentiation marker genes in response to treatment with all transretinoic acid (RA) and puromycin. It is of major significance that &#x0003e;80% of A404 cells showed induction of SM &#x003b1;-actin upon treatment with a single reagent, RA, indicating that A404 is a clonal cell line poised for induction of SMC lineage. In addition, RA-induced differentiation of A404 cells into SMCs was accompanied by increases in histone acetylation levels and SRF binding within the CArG-containing promoter regions of SMC differentiation marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manabe and Owens, 2001</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the A404 SMC differentiation system is a valuable model for studying early stages of induction of SMC lineage from multipotential stem cells.</p><p>In the present studies, we performed a subtractive hybridization screen between undifferentiated and differentiated A404 cells to identify factors critical for the initial induction of SMC differentiation. We discovered Pitx2 as a homeodomain transcription factor that was rapidly induced during the differentiation of SMCs, as compared with the delayed induction of Prx1. We show that Pitx2 induces expression of multiple SMC differentiation marker genes by binding to specific cis-regulatory elements, by interacting with SRF, and by increasing histone acetylation levels within the promoter regions of SMC differentiation marker genes. Moreover, we show that knockout of the <italic>Pitx2</italic> gene in mouse embryos virtually abolishes the induction of SMC differentiation markers in early stages of SMC differentiation, thus providing the first evidence implicating a homeodomain protein in regulation of SMC development in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>Pitx2</italic> expression was induced in multiple inducible culture models of SMC differentiation</title><p>To identify factors that play a key role in the initial induction of SMC differentiation, a subtractive hybridization screen was performed between undifferentiated A404 cells and differentiated A404 cells that were treated with RA for 48 h. 44 genes were found to be induced in differentiated A404 cells as compared with undifferentiated A404 cells (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711145/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711145/DC1</ext-link>). Among these, Pitx2 was selected for further studies, because it is expressed in vascular SMCs during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kitamura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hjalt et al., 2000</xref>) and it is a transcription factor implicated in the development of multiple organs such as the pituitary gland, the eyes, and the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gage et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kitamura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 1999a</xref>). As an initial test of the potential importance of Pitx2 for SMC differentiation, we examined its expression in multiple inducible culture systems of SMC differentiation. Expression of <italic>Pitx2</italic> was rapidly induced by 5.5-fold, 48 h after RA treatment in A404 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The increase in <italic>Pitx2</italic> expression preceded the induction of <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> and <italic>Prx1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>), and all <italic>Pitx2</italic> isoforms were induced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Expression of <italic>Pitx2</italic> was also examined in an ES cell&#x02013;derived embryoid body model of SMC differentiation, which showed induction of SMC lineage in response to treatment with RA and dibutyryl cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Drab et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sinha et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, ES cell&#x02013;derived SMCs exhibited spontaneous contraction in the context of embryoid bodies, indicating that all regulatory pathways essential for formation of contractile SMCs are present within in this system. Expression of <italic>Pitx2</italic> was induced by sevenfold during the formation of embryoid bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). These results show that <italic>Pitx2</italic> is induced in multiple in vitro SMC differentiation models.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Pitx2</italic> is induced during SMC differentiation.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) A404 cells were induced to differentiate into SMCs by treatment with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml RA, followed by 0.5-&#x003bc;g/ml puromycin treatment.

Expression plasmids for Pitx2 isoforms were cotransfected with the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> promoter-reporter construct into undifferentiated (non-RA treated) A404 cells. Results showed that each Pitx2 isoform increased transcriptional activity of the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> gene in a similar manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The induction of <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> transcription by Pitx2 was also seen in 10T1/2 cells, although it was modest in NIH/3T3 cells (unpublished data). To determine if Pitx2 induces expression of endogenous SMC differentiation marker genes, an adenovirus expressing Flag-tagged Pitx2a was constructed. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Pitx2 dramatically induced expression of multiple SMC differentiation marker genes including <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic>, <italic>SM22&#x003b1;</italic>, and <italic>h1-calponin</italic> in A404 cells, although a subset of SMC differentiation marker genes, including <italic>aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein</italic> (<italic>ACLP</italic>) and <italic>smoothelin-B</italic>, were not induced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Pitx2 also increased cellular growth (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711145/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711145/DC1</ext-link>). Although increased growth is usually associated with reduced expression of SMC differentiation markers in fully differentiated SMCs (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Owens et al., 2004</xref>), it is possible that enhanced growth and subsequent changes in cell density and cell&#x02013;cell interactions may contribute to Pitx2-induced differentiation. However, the fact that Pitx2 selectively induced a subset of SMC differentiation marker genes suggests that this is not the case.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Pitx2 induces expression of SMC differentiation marker genes.</bold> (A) Luciferase assays were performed in undifferentiated A404 cells cotransfected with expression plasmids for Pitx2 isoforms and the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> promoter-enhancer-luciferase construct.

Cotransfection of <italic>Pitx2</italic> siRNA expression plasmid (pMighty-&#x003b1;Pitx2) and Pitx2a expression plasmid revealed that <italic>Pitx2</italic> siRNA efficiently and selectively suppressed expression of Pitx2 but not expression of a nontargeted protein, SRF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

In contrast, siRNA-induced suppression of <italic>Prx1</italic> did not decrease the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> activity under these conditions. However, the reduction in the transcriptional activity of the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> gene by the <italic>Pitx2</italic> siRNA was blunted at later time points of SMC differentiation in differentiated A404 cells treated with RA and puromycin, whereas <italic>Prx1</italic> siRNA reduced the activity more effectively at the same later time points. Transfection of <italic>Pitx2</italic> siRNA duplexes into A404 cells revealed that RA-mediated induction of SMC differentiation marker genes, including <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic>, <italic>SM22&#x003b1;</italic>, and <italic>h1-calponin</italic> but not <italic>ACLP</italic> and <italic>smoothelin-B</italic>, was attenuated by 40&#x02013;60% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>).

Pitx2-induced activation of the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> gene in A404 cells was not attenuated by siRNA-induced suppression of <italic>myocardin</italic>. However, it was partially reduced by siRNAs for <italic>MKL1</italic> or <italic>2</italic> alone or in combination (Fig. S2 B).

Each homozygous <italic>Pitx2</italic> knockout cell line was then tested for its ability to differentiate into SMCs in the context of embryoid bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sinha et al., 2004</xref>).

However, induction of these SMC differentiation marker genes was dramatically attenuated in <italic>Pitx2</italic>-null embryoid bodies derived from all five independent lines of homozygous <italic>Pitx2</italic> knockout ES cells, whereas induction of <italic>ACLP</italic> expression was not affected.

The domain of Pitx2a required for SRF interaction was then determined by using Pitx2a deletion mutants.

In addition, although a deletion of the amino terminus to aa 38 (Pitx2a [aa 39&#x02013;271]) did not affect SRF interaction, Pitx2a (aa 98&#x02013;271), which lacked the homeodomain and the amino-terminal domain, did not exhibit SRF interaction. Moreover, a deletion mutant, Pitx2a (aa 39&#x02013;100), which only contained the homeodomain, interacted with SRF, indicating that the homeodomain of Pitx2, which is common for all three Pitx2 isoforms, is sufficient for the physical interaction with SRF.</p><p>The domain of SRF required for Pitx2 interaction was determined by GST pulldown assays and mammalian two-hybrid assays. Although the full-length SRF bound to Pitx2, neither SRF (aa 1&#x02013;222) nor SRF (aa 1&#x02013;132) truncation mutants bound to Pitx2 as determined by GST pulldown assays (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>).

The acetylation status of histones at the promoter regions of SMC differentiation marker genes has been shown to be regulated by the histone acetyltransferase p300 and multiple HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qiu and Li, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yoshida et al., 2007</xref>). We thus tested the hypothesis that changes in the histone acetylation status, through control of the balance between p300 and HDACs at the promoter regions of SMC differentiation marker genes, contribute to Pitx2-induced activation of SMC differentiation marker genes in A404 cells. This hypothesis was supported by the following experiments. First, results of ChIP assays showed that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Pitx2 increased the acetylation levels of histone H4 within the promoter region of the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> gene in A404 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

Collectively, these results suggest that Pitx2-induced activation of SMC differentiation marker genes is mediated, at least in part, through the exchange of HDAC2 and 5 with p300 at the promoter regions of SMC differentiation marker genes, which in turn results in increased acetylation levels of histone H4 and enhanced transcription of SMC differentiation marker genes.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Pitx2 induces acetylation of histone H4 at the promoter regions of SMC differentiation marker genes.</bold> (A) A404 cells were infected with adenovirus expressing Pitx2a or empty adenovirus, and acetylation levels of histone H4 at the promoter region of the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> gene were determined by ChIP assays.

In addition, the Pitx2c isoform has been shown to be a critical factor for directing the left-right asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, mutation of the <italic>Pitx2</italic> gene in human causes Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by ocular anterior chamber anomalies causing glaucoma, dental hypoplasia, craniofacial dysmorphism, umbilical stump abnormalities, and abnormal development of the heart and pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Semina et al., 1996</xref>). As such, although it is clear that Pitx2 is required for proper embryonic development, the role and mechanisms by which Pitx2 influences differentiation of the vascular system were unclear. In the present studies, we provide several lines of evidence indicating that Pitx2 plays a key role in the initial induction of SMC differentiation. First, overexpression of Pitx2 induced expression of multiple SMC differentiation marker genes, including <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic>, <italic>SM22&#x003b1;</italic>, and <italic>h1-calponin</italic>, whereas knockout of the <italic>Pitx2</italic> gene attenuated the induction of these SMC differentiation marker genes in multiple in vitro SMC differentiation model systems. Second, Pitx2-induced activation of SMC differentiation marker genes was mediated by a combination of mechanisms, including the following: the binding of Pitx2 to TAATC(C/T) cis-elements within the promoter regions of SMC differentiation marker genes; the interaction between Pitx2 and SRF; and Pitx2-mediated exchange of HDACs with p300 to increase the histone H4 acetylation levels at the promoter regions of SMC differentiation marker genes. It is of note that the TAATC(C/T) cis-elements within the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> and the <italic>SM22&#x003b1;</italic> promoters were shown to be functional, and a similar TAATCA sequence was found at &#x0002b;336 bp within the first intron of the mouse <italic>h1-calponin</italic> gene. Third, knockout of the <italic>Pitx2</italic> gene in mice virtually abolished the initial induction of SMC differentiation markers in branchial arch arteries and the dorsal aorta during embryogenesis. Indeed, our demonstration of impaired induction of SMC differentiation markers in <italic>Pitx2</italic> knockout mouse embryos provides the first evidence that a homeodomain protein regulates SMC differentiation in vivo. Although we previously showed that Prx1 plays a key role in angiotensin II&#x02013;induced hypertrophy in cultured SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hautmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yoshida et al., 2004a</xref>), <italic>Prx1</italic> knockout had no effect on expression of SMC differentiation markers at the same time point during embryogenesis.

Collectively, our results provide evidence that Pitx2 and Prx1 may play complementary roles in modulating SMC differentiation marker gene expression but operate at different developmental stages.</p><p>Results of the present studies showed that knockout of the <italic>Pitx2</italic> gene was associated with marked decreases in expression of SMC differentiation marker genes that contain multiple CArG elements in their promoter-enhancers, including <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> and <italic>SM22&#x003b1;</italic>. Although several previous studies, including our own, have reported that the CArG&#x02013;SRF&#x02013;myocardin complex plays an important role in the regulation of CArG-containing SMC differentiation marker genes in differentiated SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>), our present results suggest a novel mechanism wherein the initial induction of CArG-containing SMC differentiation marker genes is dependent on a combination of Pitx2 and SRF rather than a combination of myocardin and SRF, based on the following observations. First, we showed that the induction of SMC differentiation marker genes was dramatically attenuated during SMC differentiation in the context of embryoid bodies derived from <italic>Pitx2</italic> knockout ES cells, whereas our previous studies showed that homozygous knockout of the <italic>myocardin</italic> gene exhibited little effect on SMC differentiation in the same embryoid body system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pipes et al., 2005</xref>). Second, although recent studies showed the transcriptional activity of the <italic>myocardin</italic> gene during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Long et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>myocardin</italic> mRNA was not readily detectable in vessels, including the descending aorta, until E12.5, as determined by in situ hybridization assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2003</xref>). Third, results of recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pipes et al., 2005</xref>) showed that <italic>myocardin</italic>-null ES cells were able to differentiate into SMCs in the context of chimeric knockout mice that were generated by injection of <italic>myocardin</italic>-null ES cells into the wild-type blastocysts. As such, these findings support the hypothesis that the initial induction of SMC differentiation is not dependent on myocardin but is regulated through alternative molecular mechanisms including Pitx2 and SRF. It is of interest that results of our recent studies showed that <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> expression during early stages of embryonic development is dependent on two MCAT elements located at &#x02212;184 and &#x02212;320 bp within rat <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gan et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, mutation of MCAT elements in transgenic mice harboring an <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> promoter-enhancer-LacZ construct revealed that MCAT elements are required for <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> expression at E10.5 and 12.5 but dispensable after E13.5 through adulthood. It is thus interesting to postulate that MCAT elements and their binding factor RTEF-1 may cooperatively regulate <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> expression with Pitx2. However, Pitx2 effects on the transcriptional activity of the <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> gene were not affected by mutation of MCAT elements (unpublished data). Moreover, MCAT elements are not present in the promoter regions of other SMC differentiation marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yoshida, 2008</xref>). Collectively, our results suggest that Pitx2 and RTEF-1/MCAT elements may regulate early induction of SMC differentiation markers through independent mechanisms.</p><p>Results of recent studies have provided evidence for diversity in transcriptional control of SMC differentiation among cells derived from different embryological origins. For example, knockout of the <italic>MKL2</italic> (also called <italic>MRTF-B</italic>) gene in mice resulted in defective formation of neural crest&#x02013;derived branchial arch arteries and severe reduction in SM &#x003b1;-actin expression selectively in these vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oh et al., 2005</xref>). These defects were rescued by neural crest&#x02013;specific restoration of MKL2/MRTF-B expression, suggesting that MKL2/MRTF-B plays a critical role in regulating differentiation of neural crest cells into SMCs. In addition, results of studies in chick embryos also showed the diversity in differentiation of SMCs among distinct embryological origins in that they showed differences in morphology, growth, and responsiveness to transforming growth factor &#x003b2; between local mesoderm-derived SMCs and neural crest&#x02013;derived SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Topouzis and Majesky, 1996</xref>). However, our results suggest that Pitx2 is required for SMC differentiation in at least two distinct embryological sources of SMCs. Indeed, expression of SMC differentiation markers in <italic>Pitx2</italic> knockout mouse embryos was abolished in neural crest&#x02013;derived SMCs located at the third, fourth, and sixth branchial arch arteries, as well as in the mesoderm-derived SMCs present in the dorsal aorta. These findings are consistent with results of previous studies showing that Pitx2 functioned in tissues from multiple embryological origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Evans and Gage, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ai et al., 2006</xref>). For example, studies using the cardiac second lineage&#x02013;specific <italic>Pitx2</italic> knockout mice showed that deletion of the <italic>Pitx2</italic> gene in the cardiac second lineage, which was derived from mesoderm, caused severe defects in alignment of the cardiac outflow tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ai et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, studies using neural crest&#x02013;specific <italic>Pitx2</italic> knockout mice revealed that Pitx2 expression in neural crest was required for optic stalk and ocular anterior segment development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Evans and Gage, 2005</xref>). As such, the function of Pitx2 is unlikely to be restricted to the single embryological origin. Further analyses of expression of SMC differentiation marker genes in conditional <italic>Pitx2</italic> knockout mice will be required to better clarify the cell type&#x02013;specific requirement of Pitx2 for SMC differentiation from different embryological origins.</p><p>Our results provide evidence that Pitx2-induced activation of SMC differentiation marker genes is mediated, at least in part, by promoting exchange of HDAC2 and 5 with p300 within the promoter regions of SMC differentiation marker genes, thereby increasing acetylation levels of histone H4 and chromatin relaxation. Consistent with this model, we previously showed that platelet-derived growth factor BB&#x02013;induced suppression of SMC differentiation marker genes was caused, in part, by HDAC-mediated hypoacetylation of histone H4 within these promoters in cultured SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yoshida et al., 2007</xref>). Pitx2-induced hyperacetylation of histones has also been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kioussi et al., 2002</xref>). The studies showed that Pitx2 activated transcription of the <italic>cyclin D2</italic> gene by increasing the acetylation levels of histone H4 at the gene promoter. They presented evidence that these changes were dependent on exchange of HDAC1 with p300, which was mediated through association of Pitx2 and Wnt-activated &#x003b2;-catenin within the <italic>cyclin D2</italic> promoter. In addition, the interaction between Pitx2 and p300 has been shown by coimmunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kioussi et al., 2002</xref>), although it is possible that other factors are required for this interaction. During the embryonic development, SMCs have been shown to exhibit a high rate of proliferation while at the same time activating expression of SMC differentiation marker genes. It is interesting to speculate that Pitx2 may play a key role in regulating both of these processes by cooperating with distinct partner proteins such as &#x003b2;-catenin and SRF, respectively.</p><p>In summary, results of the present studies provide novel evidence that Pitx2 plays a critical role in the induction of SMC differentiation during the early embryogenesis. Further studies are needed to determine whether Pitx2 contributes to the pathophysiology of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and restenosis, where SMC phenotypic switching plays a key role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs and siRNA duplexes</title><p>Rat &#x02212;2.6/&#x0002b;2.8-kb <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> promoter-enhancer-luciferase, &#x02212;155/&#x0002b;21-bp <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> promoter-luciferase, and &#x02212;125/&#x0002b;23-bp <italic>SM &#x003b1;-actin</italic> promoter-luciferase constructs were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2004a</xref>).
