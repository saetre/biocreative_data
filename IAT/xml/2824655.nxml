It also plays a crucial role in initiating and directing the adaptive immune system[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is capable of recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns expressed by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>(Mtb), such as a 19-kDa lipoprotein, lipoarabinomannan, and soluble tuberculosis factor. This recognition leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;, that are predominantly secreted by T-helper-1 cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Increasing amounts of data suggest that genetic variants of TLR2 (GenBank accession number, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_003264.3">NM_003264.3</ext-link>; MIM no. 603028) may play a role in determining the susceptibility to or severity of many infectious diseases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The human TLR2 gene is located on chromosome 4q32 and is composed of 2 non-coding exons and 1 coding exon[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To date, more than 175 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or dinucleotide polymorphisms for the human TLR2 gene have been reported in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>. The G to A (Arg753Gln) polymorphism at position 2258 in exon 3 and the guanine-thymine (GT) microsatellite repeat polymorphism (100 bp upstream of the translational start site) in intron 2, have been associated with susceptibility to clinical tuberculosis (TB) disease in Turkish and Korean patients, respectively[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Another 2 polymorphisms within the TLR2 promoter region, namely, -16934 A&#x0003e;T and -196 to -174 insertion (Ins)&#x0003e;deletion (Del), have been associated with asthma and gastric cancer, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. On the basis of the International HapMap Project, 2 tag SNPs (-15607 A&#x0003e;G and 1350 T&#x0003e;C) in the TLR2 region could be selected with a r<sup>2 </sup>cutoff of 0.8 for the Han Chinese in Beijing using the algorithm-Tagger-pairwise Tagging[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Previous studies investigating the association between TLR2 polymorphisms and diseases have targeted individual genetic markers at a single locus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. An alternative approach is to use haplotype structures that are derived from allelic variants at a number of loci on a chromosome. Although synonymous SNPs in the coding region of the TLR2 gene have been associated with tuberculous meningitis in patients in Vietnam, there are no reports of the association between variants of this gene and the development of systemic symptoms of or pleural involvement in pulmonary TB[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Expression of TLR2 in the human immune system is most predominant in myelomonocytic cells, followed by B cells, CD56<sup>+</sup>16<sup>+ </sup>cells, and T cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. TLR2 is implicated in the activation of CD3-CD56<sup>+ </sup>natural killer (NK) cells, which are a major source of early IFN-&#x003b3; in tuberculous pleurisy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It also directly controls the expansion and function of regulatory T cells and is involved in mediating B cell differentiation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The association between TLR2 polymorphisms and lymphocyte subsets has not yet been determined.</p><p>We hypothesized that (1) TLR2 microsatellite polymorphism or SNPs may predispose Taiwanese people to pulmonary TB; (2) TLR2 gene polymorphisms may predispose patients with pulmonary TB to presenting with systemic symptoms or pleural involvement; and (3) TLR2 gene polymorphisms may influence blood lymphocyte subsets. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the genotypes defined by the 5 TLR2 gene polymorphisms located at -16934, -15607, -196 to -174, -100, and 1350 influence susceptibility to pulmonary TB, its clinical presentations, and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets at diagnosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>The study population consisted of 184 patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB, who were undergoing anti-TB treatment at the Pulmonary Department of the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Kaohsiung, Taiwan) during August 2006-July 2008. The specific criterion for enrollment was defined as the presence of at least 1 of the following: (1) clinical and radiological findings indicating pulmonary TB and at least 1 positive Mtb culture from 3 separate sputum examinations or 1 bronchial washing specimen obtained from bronchoscopy; (2) pathological evidence of TB on pleural or lung mass biopsy; and (3) clinical and radiological findings indicating improvement in suspected pulmonary TB with empirical anti-TB therapy. Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or those receiving immunosuppressive agents were excluded. The control group consisted of 184 unrelated subjects recruited from the Center of Health Examination of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Kaohsiung, Taiwan). The specific criteria of enrollment were the absence of pulmonary lesions on chest radiographic examination and a negative history of TB disease. All the subjects of both the study and control groups are residents in Taiwan, where new TB cases per 100,000 populations were from 62.0 to 74.6 in the past seven years. We assume that people in Taiwan have similar exposure to M.tb, because the modes of its transmission are mainly through large droplets and small particle droplet nuclei.

Of the 4 non-microsatellite polymorphisms investigated, none had an effect individually on susceptibility to pulmonary TB. We demonstrated a distinct role of TLR2 polymorphisms on the development of different TB phenotypes. This is the first report stating that TLR2 polymorphisms were associated with elevated blood absolute NK cell counts.</p><p>Previous studies showed that Genotypes with shorter GT repeats were more common among Korean patients with pulmonary TB and non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our data showed that neither individual GT repeat allele nor the short repeat (S) was associated with susceptibility to TB. This indicates that the microsatellite marker may not be the functional disease-causing allele or a marker of other unknown causative mutation. Functional studies on the polymorphic (GT)n repeat have shown inconsistent results. One study reported that either the shortest [GT)n = 12] or longest [(GT)n = 28] alleles, rather than middle [(GT)n = 20] could lead to higher promoter activity when exposed to external stimuli[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The other study showed that shorter [(GT)13] allele had lower promoter activity than middle [(GT)20] and longer [(GT)24] alleles[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. An association between SS genotype and elevated NK cell counts was observed in our study, and indicate that TLR2 genetic variant may play a role in controlling the expansion of NK cells. Further study is needed to clarify the role of microsatellite GT repeat in mediating TLR2 transcription activity or the expansion of lymphocyte subsets.</p><p>Haplotypes represent the majority of common variations in a gene because the human genome is organized into haplotype blocks, which are undisrupted by recombination during population history of gene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The specific haplotype [A-G-(Ins)-T] consisting of 1 rare allele at -15607 position and 3 common alleles at other loci showed a significant association with susceptibility to pulmonary TB. In the European population, the -16934 A&#x0003e;T SNP has been reported with allele A being present in an equal frequency to allele T[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, in the Taiwanese population, -16934 A is a common allele occurring at a frequency of 57.3-58.4%. This may lead to the differences in the association between these polymorphisms and the disease in different populations. Of the 5 polymorphisms that were investigated, 2 have been reported to have an effect on TLR2 gene expression. The -196 to -174 deletion allele in the 5' un-translated region and the short GT repeat allele at intron2 tended to have lower promoter activity than that in the wild-type allele[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. On the basis of the FASTSNP analysis, the 1350 T&#x0003e;C variant, a synonymous SNP located at the coding region of exon 3, has been predicted to have a functional effect on diminishing the number of the putative exonic splicing enhancer motifs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The findings of these functional studies provided a possible explanation for why the specific haplotype might be linked to pulmonary TB and why the specific genotype might be related to TB phenotypes or blood lymphocyte subsets. Further studies are required to clarify the functional effect of the -15607 A&#x0003e;G SNP.</p><p>In a recent study, systemic symptoms were reported to be absent in 25% of TB patients, with fever and weight loss being absent in 37% and 38% patients, respectively[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. On the basis of our study, the -196 to -174 del/del homozygote genotype might have a preventive effect on the development of systemic symptoms, including fever, anorexia, and weight loss. An association between the -196 to -174 Del/Del genotype and steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis has been recently reported, although the functional significance of this association was not explored[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We evaluated the association between peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations and the -196 to -174 genetic variant in TB patients, and found higher blood absolute NK cell counts in those patients with the del/del genotype. Human NK cells have been demonstrated to directly recognize Mycobacterium via TLR2, and release TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Compartmentalization of the CD4(+) T lymphocytes in the infected lungs with a reciprocal decrease in peripheral blood counts of the same lymphocyte subset has been demonstrated in patients with higher grades of pulmonary TB[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, we speculated that decreased counts of NK cells are recruited to the TB lesions in the lung parenchyma in patients with higher blood NK cell counts and, hence, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines released from these cells would be lower in such patients with a lower promoter activity of the TLR2 gene. This indicates that patients with the homozygote -196 to -174 del/del genotype may possess innate immune mechanisms of resistance to the development of systemic symptoms, which may be attributed to the decreased levels of cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;.</p><p>The frequency of pleural involvement in TB has been reported to vary from 4% to 23% in different populations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We observed an association between the 1350 CC genotype and the presence of pleural effusions in patients with pulmonary TB. In addition, patients with the CC homozygote variant had significantly higher blood absolute NK cell counts than those carrying the common T allele. Published data have demonstrated that Mtb-induced IFN-&#x003b3; production by NK cells requires cross talk with antigen-presenting cells via TLR2, and that TLR2 expression of NK cells within pleural fluid is down-regulated compared with that in peripheral blood in TB pleurisy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our data suggest that TLR2-genetically determined high NK cell counts are likely to predispose TB patients to pleural involvement. However, the reason behind the altered NK cell counts associated with both the 1350 CC and -196 to -174 Del/Del genotypes needs to be further analyzed. By comparing the NK cell counts between patients with different genotypes, we identified 4 outlier values in patients carrying the common allele. This indicates that genetic variants of other immunological mediators may also contribute to controlling the expansion of NK cells.</p><p>The statistical power to detect significant associations with rare genetic variants was limited by sample size. Based on the sample size, we estimated that for a haplotype with a prevalence of 10%, there was 86.6% power to detect a 50% change in risk. We also estimated the power to be 74.4% for the comparison of NK cell counts between patients with the Insertion carrier and Del/Del genotype, and 92.3% between patients with the 1350 T carrier and CC genotype, using the standard <italic>t </italic>test formulations with a simple adjustment to the sample sizes in our study and an &#x003b1; error of 0.05 with PASS 2005 (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA) software. The population of individuals with homozygous genetic variant was too small in our study to draw strong conclusions about risk differences by individual TLR2 genetic variant. This is a major limitation of this study, and there is a need to replicate and validate these association results in another large cohort. On the other hand, genetic factors represent only part of the risk associated with complex disease phenotypes, and multiple genetic products combine to produce a phenotype. Thus, a minor effect of individual genetic variant is more frequently observed in complex diseases. Another limitation of this study is lack of adjustments for interactions with the acquired risk factors, such as DM. However, these do not generally confound genetic associations except through selection bias or modification of the TLR2 gene-pulmonary TB association.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We observed an association between the specific TLR2 haplotype and susceptibility to pulmonary TB. In patients with pulmonary TB, both the -196 to -174 Del/Del and 1350 CC genotypes were associated with an increased blood absolute NK cell counts and might have an influence on the development of systemic symptoms or pleural involvement, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>TLR2: Toll-like receptor 2; SNPs: single-nucleotide polymorphisms; GT: guanine-thymine; TB: tuberculosis; IFN: interferon; Mtb: <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>; OR: odds ratios; CI: confidence interval; NK: natural killer; PCR: polymerase chain reactions; LD: linkage disequilibrium.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YC performed the genotyping, carried out the statistical analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
