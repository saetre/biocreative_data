Peptide:<italic>N</italic>-glycanase in yeast binds to Rad23p through its N-terminus. In this study, the complex formed between Peptide:<italic>N</italic>-glycanase and Rad23p was found to exhibit enhanced deglycosylation activity, which suggests an important role for this enzyme in the misfolded glycoprotein degradation pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. To investigate the role of this enzyme in this pathway, we made stepwise deletions of the N-terminal helices of peptide:<italic>N</italic>-glycanase. Enzymatic analysis of the deletion mutants showed that deletion of the N-terminal H1 helix (Png1p-&#x00394;H1) enhanced the deglycosylation activity of <italic>N</italic>-glycanase towards denatured glycoproteins. In addition, this mutant exhibited high deglycosylation activity towards native glycoproteins. Dynamic simulations of the wild type and N-terminal H1 deletion mutant implied that Png1p-&#x00394;H1 is more flexible than wild type Png1p. The efficient deglycosylation of Png1p-&#x00394;H1 towards native and non-native glycoproteins offers a potential biotechnological application.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, newly synthesized proteins, which are destined for the secretory pathway, are subjected to a quality control system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Kopito1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Ellgaard1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Rad23p contains four structural domains connected by long unstructured flexible linker regions: an ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) at the N terminus that interacts with catalytically active proteasomes, two ubiquitin (Ub)-associated (UBA) sequences that bind Ub and a XPC binding (XPCB) domain that mainly mediates the interaction with PNGase. The surface of the XPCB domain of Rad23p is almost entirely hydrophobic, suggesting that Rad23p interacts with particular proteins via hydrophobic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Walters1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Crystal structure analysis of the Rad23p-PNGase complex revealed that Rad23p forms extensive interactions with both the N- and C-terminal helices of PNGase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Lee1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Biochemical studies have shown that the H1&#x003b1;-helix at the N-terminus of PNGase is mainly composed of hydrophobic amino acids. A recent report showed that PNGase with an extended N-terminus in mammalian cells interacts with another protein, Derlin-1, via its N-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Joshi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Lilley1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Ye1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

The formation of a stable complex between PNGase and Rad23p was suggested to open up the conformation of Rad23p, which in turn facilitates the binding of Rad23p to the proteasome and/or ERAD substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Kim1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. However, is there any structural change to PNGase upon binding Rad23p and what role does this interaction have to PNGase activity?</p><p>The crystal structure and biochemical analysis confirmed that three amino acids, Cys-191, His-218 and Asp-235, are crucial in PNGase catalysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Suzuki2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Lee1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Katiyar1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This catalytic triad is located in a &#x0201c;transglutaminase&#x0201d; motif which contributes to degradation of glycoproteins and represents one of the most conserved regions among PNGase from various organisms. Therefore, PNGase have been proposed to be part of the transglutaminase-like superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Makarova1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides the deglycosylation activity, PNGase from <italic>C. elegans</italic> also exhibits oxidoreductase (thioredoxin) activity, suggesting PNGase play an important role in higher eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Suzuki6">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the catalytic center of PNGase from yeast is located in the central part of the enzyme, and distal from the terminal domains, it is likely that both the N-terminus (H1, H2) and the C-terminus (H11, H12) regions provide binding motifs with other proteins and are not essential for PNGase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Lee1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Park <italic>et al</italic>, revealed that the N-terminal domain and the middle domain of mammalian PNGase is important for the deglycosylation activity. In this report, it was demonstrated that a PNGase C-terminal deletion mutant (amino acids 1&#x02013;471) or full-length PNGase exhibited deglycosylation activity, whereas a PNGase N-terminal deletion mutant (amino acids 171&#x02013;651), and the PNGase core region mutant (middle domain, amino acids 171&#x02013;471) exhibited no detectable activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Li1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Park1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the N-terminal H1 and H2 helices of yeast Png1p are absent in the mammalian enzyme. A recent study found that the C-terminal domain of mouse PNGase binds to the mannose moieties of N-linked oligosaccharide chains and enhances the activity of the core domain, presumably by increasing the affinity of mouse PNGase for the glycan chains of misfolded glycoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Zhou1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consequently, this observation indicates that the N-terminal H1 helix is not directly involved in catalysis. To understand the structural basis of Png1p and the role of the N-terminus, a molecular model of Png1p was constructed based on this crystallographic structure &#x0005b;1X3W&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008335-g002">Fig. 2A, C</xref>). In the model, helices H2 and H3 located on the top of the active site cleft may inhibit the correct positioning of the native substrate into the active site. The interaction of H1 with Rad23p may displace helices H2 and H3 from the active site cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008335-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Molecular simulations of the last 200 ps were performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008335.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

At the molecular level, the interaction of Png1p and Rad23p leads to the opening of the conformation of Rad23p, which in turn facilitates its binding to the proteasome and/or ERAD substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Kim1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Since no crystal structure of Png1p has been resolved, we have no information on the possible conformational changes that occur to Png1p upon binding to Rad23p; however, this interaction must play a role in Png1p function. Here, using a biochemical method, we demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> that the interaction of Png1p-Rad23p enhanced the deglycosylation efficiency of Png1p. The rapid deglycosylation of misfolded glycoproteins by the Png1p-Rad23p complex may ensure the efficient and direct transfer of deglycosylated ERAD substrates to the proteasome. A previous <italic>in vivo</italic> study also suggested that efficient degradation of glycosylated RTA (ricin A chain) requires the association of Png1p and Rad23p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Kim1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The half-life of glycoproteins in Rad23p mutant cells is longer. Consequently, both Png1p and Rad23p most likely benefit from the formation of a complex between the two proteins. The Png1p-Rad23p complex was observed to be thermally more stable than Png1p. Free Png1p in the cytosol may deglycosylate the glycoprotein fragments generated by proteolysis or unfolded glycoproteins by reducing conditions maintained in cytosol. Molecular simulations indicated that when Png1p binds to Rad23p, those residues at the contact surface experience a slight chemical shift because of the altered chemical environment. This interaction may release this region from the core domain leading to greater flexibility of the core region. We suggest that such conformational changes upon Png1p-Rad23p complex formation play a central role in regulating the degradation efficiency of misfolded glycoproteins.</p><p>The complex interface of the yeast Png1p-Rad23p complex is fundamentally different from the orthologous mammalian peptide N-glycanase-Rad23 complex. The N-terminal H1 and H2 helices of yeast Png1p are absent in the mammalian enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Zhao1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Suzuki7">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008335-Zhao2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

To characterize this postulate, the N-terminal helices of Png1p, which are mainly responsible for protein interactions, were deleted. Interestingly, the deletion mutant Png1p-&#x00394;H1 showed a significant increase in deglycosylation activity when compared with the activity of the wild type enzyme. Moreover, Png1p-&#x00394;H1 was found to act not only on denatured glycoprotein, but also on native glycoproteins <italic>in vitro</italic>.

However, the exact mechanism of this function is unknown. The observed high deglycosylation activity of Png1p-&#x00394;H1 towards native glycoprotein implies that it can be used as an important model for investigating the deglycosylation mechanism and has potential applications in the biotechnology sector.</p><p>Molecular simulations of Png1p-&#x00394;H1 were performed to interpret the observed N-terminal deletion phenomenon. RMSD results showed that the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between helices H1 and H12 could stabilize helices H2, H3 and H4, which stabilizes the protein fold (i.e. increase in rigidity)and is not suitable for the positioning of large native glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008335-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The flexibility of helices H2, H3 and H4 was found to be considerably increased following the deletion of helix H1. As a result, the originally narrow active site cleft could gradually be enlarged by the interaction forces between Png1p-&#x00394;H1 and the substrate, thus allowing substrates to access the deep active site more easily. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the contact of Png1p with a glycoprotein substrate, especially the glycan part of the substrate, will induce a conformational change of the enzyme. This indicates that Png1p will tend to adopt an open conformation. Conversely, the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between H1 and H12 helices restrict protein flexibility, therefore inhibiting the formation of an open conformation. Thus, only small polypeptides or denatured glycoproteins can slide into the narrow active site cleft. Deletion of H1 helix provides additional flexibility to the enzyme thereby allowing the enzyme to adopt a more open conformation for interaction with both native and non-native glycoproteins.</p><p>Png1p-&#x00394;H1 can be applied in many biological areas, especially where PNGase F is not efficient. Successful application in in-gel deglycosylation experiments for subsequent MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis using Png1p-&#x00394;H1 represents an initial application.

For surface preparation, RNase B (40 &#x000b5;g/ml) in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.31, was immobilized on a CT405 sensor chip using standard amine coupling chemistry following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. For kinetic analysis, duplicate injections of analytes (Png1p and Png1p-&#x00394;H1) in various concentrations (80&#x02013;1000 nM) were applied to the immobilized chip at a flow rate of 5 &#x000b5;l/min under the buffer condition of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The data obtained were analyzed with the SPRViewer software (version 1.0) provided by the manufacturer. A 1&#x02236;1 Langmuir model was globally fitted to the sensorgram data to obtain k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> values for the interaction. The equilibrium dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub> was subsequently calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>In-Gel Deglycosylation Analysis</title><p>Model glycoprotein RNase B separated by SDS-PAGE was stained with Coomassie blue.
