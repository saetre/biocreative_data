Besides providing support and containment, membrane composition denotes organelle identity and transmits cellular signals. Among the various lipids incorporated into the membrane, inositol-containing phospholipids are ideally suited for transmitting signals because their inositol head group can be reversibly phosphorylated at three different hydroxyl positions. An array of kinases and phosphatases regulates phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) signaling by controlling inositol head group phosphorylation to efficiently mediate the levels and location of specific PIPs. Proteins are able to recognize these phosphorylated head groups through specific modular domains (e.g., PH, PX, FYVE, or ENTH, etc.) and transmit this information throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lemmon, 2003</xref>). Naturally, the importance of PIP signaling is critical to a host of cellular processes ranging from receptor signaling pathways to regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Camilli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Odorizzi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simonsen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has proven useful as a genetic model system to study PIP signaling pathways because several of the lipid kinases, lipid phosphatases, and effectors are well conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Odorizzi et al., 2000</xref>). Each kinase or phosphatase localizes to a distinct region or organelle in the cell to control the levels and location of its corresponding phosphoinositide. Stt4, the yeast homologue to the human type III phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4-kinase PtdIns(4)KIII&#x003b1;, is essential in yeast and localizes to punctate dots on the plasma membrane (PM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audhya and Emr, 2002</xref>). The other essential yeast PtdIns 4-kinase, Pik1, localizes to the Golgi and acts independently of Stt4 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walch-Solimena and Novick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audhya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strahl et al., 2005</xref>). The phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) generated by either of these kinases is turned over by the Sac1 domain&#x02013;containing proteins Sac1, Sjl2, and Sjl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foti et al., 2001</xref>). Among these three proteins, Sac1 has been demonstrated to be the PtdIns 4-phosphatase primarily responsible for metabolizing Stt4-generated PtdIns4P at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foti et al., 2001</xref>). Stt4 has been indirectly implicated in regulation of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muhua et al., 1998</xref>), lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Voelker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabuchi et al., 2006</xref>), actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and activation of a MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audhya and Emr, 2002</xref>). Despite the obvious importance for Stt4 and its lipid product, PtdIns4P, the precise regulation of Stt4 activity at the PM remains poorly understood.</p><p>This study describes the analysis of a unique cortical structure, Stt4-containing phosphoinositide kinase (PIK) patches. Previous work has demonstrated that both the PM-localized lipid kinases, Stt4 and Mss4, cluster into distinct cortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audhya and Emr, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, mammalian lipid kinases often localize to patches at sites of receptor-mediated signaling or membrane attachment to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Honda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ling et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heck et al., 2007</xref>). Although PIK patches seem to be a widely adopted structure, it is unclear why cells need to maintain these arrangements. In this paper, we focus on Stt4 PIK patches and anticipate that common themes regarding these structures may emerge.</p><p>We identify two novel components of the Stt4 PIK patch: Ypp1 and Efr3. Ypp1 is an essential protein that directly contacts distinct sites on Stt4 to organize and stabilize PIK patches at the PM. Ypp1 and Stt4 colocalize on the PM to form the core of a large Stt4 complex visualized as punctate patches. Loss of Ypp1 from this complex mislocalizes Stt4 and results in the subsequent degradation of the lipid kinase. Efr3 likewise localizes with Ypp1 at Stt4 PIK patches, physically interacts with Ypp1, and is necessary for assembly of the PIK patch components Stt4 and Ypp1 at the PM. Consequently, cells lacking either Ypp1 or Efr3 fail to assemble the Stt4 PIK patch and fail to maintain proper PtdIns4P levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Initial characterization of the Stt4 PIK patch</title><p>Using a three-dimensional reconstruction of z stacks from cells expressing an N-terminally tagged <italic>GFP-STT4</italic> construct, we have been able to estimate the number of Stt4 PIK patches on the PM of an individual cell as shown in Video 1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804003/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804003/DC1</ext-link>). The three-dimensional reconstruction of the cells is a representative sample of several previously analyzed populations. The fluorescence data indicate that each cell has &#x0223c;20&#x02013;25 regions of dense fluorescence corresponding to a cluster of GFP-Stt4 within the PIK patch. Additionally, coimmunoprecipitation of HA-Stt4 with GFP-Stt4 from cells coexpressing the two epitope&#x02013;tagged Stt4 proteins demonstrates that these proteins form a physical interaction (Fig. S1 A). Therefore, we believe the dense fluorescent cluster of GFP-Stt4 represents an oligomer of Stt4 at the PIK patch site. With the understanding that roughly 850 Stt4 molecules populate the average cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>) and that the plasmid-expressed GFP-Stt4 fusion is maintained at the same concentration as wild-type Stt4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audhya and Emr, 2002</xref>), we can estimate that each Stt4 PIK patch contains &#x0223c;30 Stt4 molecules. This molecular abundance of Stt4 at a PIK patch corroborates well with the fluorescence intensity of a PIK patch measured against a known standard (Fig. S1 B). Thus, these results suggest that multiple copies of Stt4 oligomerize at PIK patches.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of a novel component of the Stt4 PIK patch</title><p>To understand Stt4 PIK patch assembly and regulation, we sought novel Stt4-interacting partners. We examined several candidate PtdIns 4-kinase regulators by experimentally testing the various Stt4-interacting proteins cataloged in the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database and identified one uncharacterized essential protein: YGR198w (recently named Ypp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flower et al., 2007</xref>]). This interaction was originally published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hazbun et al. (2003)</xref>, who isolated Ypp1 and corresponding binding partners through tandem affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometry to identify Stt4 as the primary binding partner. To determine the localization of Ypp1 in live yeast cells, the sequence encoding GFP was integrated at the 3&#x02032; end of Ypp1's chromosomal locus to generate Ypp1-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Similar to GFP-Stt4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audhya and Emr, 2002</xref>), Ypp1-GFP localized to several punctate structures on the periphery of the cell with a majority of these patches concentrated in the mother cell. Furthermore, strong colocalization of Ypp1-mCherry with GFP-Stt4 on these punctate patches suggests they reside at the same cortical structure on the PM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Ypp1 colocalizes with Stt4 at static cortical structures at the PM.</bold> (A) Cells expressing Ypp1-GFP were grown at 26&#x000b0;C and examined by fluorescence microscopy.

Stt4 is a 215-kD protein with a lipid kinase unique domain (LKU) and a PtdIns 4-kinase domain (PI4K) as its only recognizable motifs. Ypp1 is a 95-kD protein encompassing multiple TPR domains and with conserved homologues in higher species.

TPR domains exist in nearly all organisms and have been shown to mediate a variety of protein&#x02013;protein interactions (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Andrea and Regan, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>YPP1</italic> homologues are evident in several species; in humans, the closest homologue is <italic>TTC7a</italic> (TPR domain 7A; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).

However, it has been hypothesized that the Ypp1 PM structures are cortical actin patches because of their similar distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flower et al., 2007</xref>). This seems unlikely as we found no significant colocalization of Abp1&#x02013;monomeric RFP, a known component of cortical actin structures enriched in the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stefan et al., 2005</xref>), with Ypp1-GFP or GFP-Stt4. Also, treatment with latrunculin A has no effect on the localization or dynamics of Stt4&#x02013;Ypp1 PIK patches (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804003/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804003/DC1</ext-link>). We examined whether the distribution of Stt4&#x02013;Ypp1 PIK patches show similarity to another PM localized structure: Pil1-based eisosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walther et al., 2006</xref>). Pil1-mCherry and GFP-Ypp1 show very limited colocalization (Fig. S2 B). Furthermore, GFP-Ypp1 localizes normally in <italic>pil1&#x00394;</italic> cells (unpublished data). These findings show that Stt4 PIK patches and eisosomes are distinct organizational units of the PM.</p><p>Subsequently, we studied the dynamics of Stt4 and Ypp1 at PIK patches and compared it to the Stt4 product PtdIns4P. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> is a fluorescent image with the corresponding kymograph of GFP-Stt4 and Ypp1-GFP. Unlike cortical actin patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>), GFP-Stt4 PIK patches are stable over the course of 3 min. To test whether the Stt4 molecules residing in these patches were also static instead of dynamically exchanging, we performed FRAP on a region of the PM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> and Video 2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804003/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804003/DC1</ext-link>). 3 min after photobleaching a PIK patch&#x02013;rich region of the PM, none of the fluorescence had recovered. This is in stark contrast to the Stt4 product PtdIns4P as observed with a PtdIns4P reporter, GFP-2xPH<sup>Osh2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). After photobleaching a PtdIns4P-rich region of the PM, the fluorescence of the GFP-2xPH<sup>Osh2</sup> reporter recovers rapidly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> and Video 3).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Stt4 directly interacts with Ypp1 to form a stable complex.</bold> (A) Fluorescent image of GFP-Stt4 (left), Ypp1-GFP (right), and their corresponding kymographs (bottom). A representative section of the cell (the demarcated region in top panels) was examined for its relative movement at the cell membrane.

The spatial variance of the selected fluorescent region with regard to time is represented in the bottom image.

First, we determined if the two proteins interacted. A yeast strain expressing HA-tagged Ypp1 and either GFP-tagged Stt4 or GFP alone was detergent solubilized and immunoprecipitated using a GFP antibody. HA-Ypp1 showed no interaction with GFP alone, but a significant interaction with GFP-Stt4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Subsequent in vitro pulldown experiments using GST-tagged regions of Stt4 generated from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> identified at least two separate Ypp1-interacting regions. Both the N-terminal third of Stt4 (represented by amino acids 1&#x02013;736) and a central region (represented by amino acids 736&#x02013;1346) both bind full-length, <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02013;expressed HIS<sub>6</sub>-Ypp1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). The C terminus of Stt4, which embodies the lipid kinase unique domain and the catalytic lipid kinase domain, did not interact with Ypp1. Interestingly, there are no recognizable structural motifs within the N terminus even though this region of Stt4 is critical for yeast viability; truncations lacking just the N-terminal 135 amino acids fail to localize to the PM or rescue <italic>stt4&#x00394;</italic> cells (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>YPP1 and STT4 cooperate to positively maintain PtdIns4P levels</title><p>Thus far, our data suggest that Stt4 and Ypp1 directly interact within the PIK patch. We next tested the role for Ypp1 in regulating the kinase activity of Stt4. Our first approach looked at the genetic interaction of mutant alleles of <italic>ypp1</italic> in combination with the <italic>stt4-4</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audhya et al., 2000</xref>).

These <italic>ypp1</italic> mutant alleles were each carried on plasmids in the <italic>ypp1&#x00394;</italic> background as described in the Materials and methods.</p><p>Our current study utilizes the strongest of these alleles, <italic>ypp1-7</italic>, in combination with the <italic>stt4-4</italic> mutant strain to detect synthetic growth defects. The <italic>ypp1-7</italic> allele, which exhibited strong growth at 26&#x000b0;C, is dead at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

After a 15-h incubation in the presence of doxycycline, an epitope-tagged Ypp1-HA is no longer detected in cell extracts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

In this work, we focused on PIK patches containing the essential PtdIns 4-kinase Stt4 and identified two essential components critical for Stt4 PIK patch assembly and localization. Previous work had already shown the Stt4 PIK patch to be separate from the PtdIns4P 5-kinase Mss4 PIK patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audhya and Emr, 2002</xref>) and we now demonstrate that it is also distinct from two other well known PM-associated complexes: actin patches and Pil1-based eisosomes. Kymographic measurements and FRAP experiments demonstrated that Stt4 PIK patches are static with limited exchange of molecules within the patch. These interesting properties coupled to the importance of Stt4-mediated PtdIns4P production at the PM prompted us to seek novel regulatory components of the Stt4 PIK patch. We uncovered two essential proteins. The first was Ypp1, a 95-kD TPR domain&#x02013;containing protein whose role in the cell had yet to be clearly defined. The second was Efr3, an 89-kD putative membrane protein that shares homology with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RBO protein.</p><p>Our study determined that Ypp1 plays an essential role maintaining PtdIns4P levels at the PM by directly interacting with Stt4 to maintain PIK patch organization and stability of the PtdIns 4-kinase. First, we demonstrated that Ypp1 colocalizes and directly interacts with Stt4 at PIK patch sites on the PM. Second, our analysis of temperature-sensitive mutant alleles of <italic>stt4</italic> and <italic>ypp1</italic> demonstrated a synthetic lethal interaction, indicating that the two protein products were involved in the same or parallel pathways. Third, using in vitro binding experiments with <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02013;expressed proteins, we established that Ypp1 directly binds multiple regions of Stt4. Finally, by placing <italic>YPP1</italic> under the control of a doxycycline-repressible promoter, we showed that in the absence of Ypp1, Stt4 mislocalized to the diffuse cytoplasm and was subsequently degraded causing PtdIns4P levels to drop dramatically at the PM. Similarly, we found that attenuating Stt4 expression caused Ypp1 to delocalize from the PM. However, the Ypp1 protein remained intact and was not degraded. Therefore, we suggest that an intact Stt4&#x02013;Ypp1 complex is necessary for PM recruitment and subsequent organization into a PIK patch.</p><p>Our characterization of Ypp1 and Stt4 indicated that additional factors might control PIK patch organization. During the course of this work, a genome-wide study suggested Efr3 as a candidate Ypp1-interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarassov et al., 2008</xref>). We have confirmed Efr3 as a PIK patch component and characterized its role in Stt4 PIK patch assembly. A previous study identified a synthetic lethal genetic interaction between <italic>PHO85</italic> and <italic>EFR3</italic> (PHO eighty five requiring; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenburg and O'Shea, 2001</xref>).

We found that Efr3 is essential, similar to Ypp1 and Stt4. We showed that Efr3 interacts with Ypp1 and colocalizes with Stt4 and Ypp1 at PIK patches on the PM. Additionally, we generated an <italic>efr3<sup>ts</sup></italic> allele and demonstrated that at nonpermissive temperatures PtdIns4P levels dropped dramatically at the PM. Finally, we showed that upon depletion of the Efr3 protein, GFP-Stt4 mislocalized from the PM. Importantly, depletion of Ypp1 (or Stt4) did not mislocalize Efr3-GFP from the PM but instead allowed it to adopt a more uniform distribution around the membrane. We propose that Efr3 acts as a PM anchor for Stt4 PIK patches and the Stt4&#x02013;Ypp1 oligomeric complex stabilizes the distinctive clustering of Stt4 in the PIK patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Ypp1 defines a well conserved protein</title><p>Ypp1 (YGR198w) is a TPR domain&#x02013;containing protein with homologues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>.

These domains are a common structural unit throughout evolution from bacteria to humans and have been shown to be important for directing specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blatch and Lassle, 1999</xref>).

Ypp1's precise role as a TPR domain&#x02013;containing protein is consistent with what has already been established for proteins containing this structural feature. As we have demonstrated in this paper Ypp1 is essential for maintaining the integrity of the large PIK patch complex. In the absence of Ypp1, Stt4 is unstable, mislocalizes to the cytoplasm, and is quickly degraded. Therefore, one important role for Ypp1 may be to assist the folding of Stt4 and/or structurally maintain the integrity of the PtdIns 4-kinase within the PIK patch complex.</p><p>We were unable to identify a role for Ypp1 independent of Stt4 function, but it is exciting to speculate that the essential Ypp1&#x02013;Stt4 interaction is maintained throughout evolution. For example, homologues of Ypp1 in higher eukaryotes may also be important for maintaining the structural integrity of protein complexes. For example, <italic>YPP1</italic> has a potential mouse homologue, <italic>TTC7a</italic>, which previous work has found to be essential for normal cell functions. That study determined that a spontaneous retroviral insertion into a TPR domain of <italic>TTC7a</italic> produced a flaky skin (<italic>fsn</italic>) mutation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helms et al., 2005</xref>). The abnormality causes symptoms similar to lupus such as anemia and production of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies. Interestingly, the analogous TPR deletion in Ypp1 yielded a nonfunctional protein unable to bind Stt4 or rescue <italic>ypp1&#x00394;</italic> cells (unpublished data). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helms et al. (2005)</xref> speculated that an interaction with a critical TTC7a binding partner is disrupted in <italic>fsn</italic> mice. Could the Stt4 mouse homologue, PtdIns(4)KIII&#x003b1;, be that protein? Are some mammalian PIK patches no longer stable in the <italic>TTC7a</italic> mouse mutant? Future work in the mouse will be needed to directly address this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Efr3, the yeast homologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> RBO protein, acts as a PIK patch membrane anchor</title><p>We also identified Efr3, the yeast homologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> RBO, as a critical component to maintain PIK patches at the PM. RBO is a multipass transmembrane protein localized to the PM with an essential role in synaptic vesicle trafficking. Based on Efr3's capability to localize to the PM in the absence of other PIK patch components, Efr3 defined a candidate membrane anchor for Stt4 PIK patches. In support of this, a hydrophobicity diagram generated from TMpred software predicts Efr3 to be a one- or two-pass transmembrane protein. Therefore, we propose that Efr3 recruits and anchors the Stt4 PIK patch to the PM. Placing Efr3 in the PM would allow the protein to relay extracellular or membrane activities directly to the Stt4 PIK patch to mediate PtdIns4P metabolism. This idea is supported by the fact that Stt4 activity is important for maintaining cell wall integrity, and Efr3, therefore, may provide a link to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshida et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audhya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audhya and Emr, 2002</xref>). Future work will focus on how changes in the extracellular environment or within the membrane, such as cell stress or damage conditions, impact Stt4 PIK patch dynamics and kinase activity.</p><p>Can the known function of RBO provide further insight into Efr3's role in the Stt4 PIK patch? RBO has been shown to be important for synaptic vesicle exocytosis based on the observation that synaptic vesicles accumulate at the presynaptic active zone in <italic>rbo<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutant neurons shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. The authors attributed the phenotype to a disruption in the balance between synaptic vesicle consumption (exocytosis) and recycling (endocytosis), but favored the idea that RBO functions at the post-docking step of synaptic vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2006</xref>). Appropriately, many of the steps involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis are regulated by lipid composition at the active zone (including the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding proteins synaptotagmin and CAPS) and provide a potential connection to our findings on Efr3's role in PIP dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Osborne et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have indicated a link between the secretory and cell polarity pathways in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aronov and Gerst, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pruyne et al., 2004</xref>) and both Stt4 and Mss4 activity have been shown to be required for cell polarity through the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audhya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audhya and Emr, 2002</xref>). Besides impacting secretion through actin cytoskeleton dynamics, Stt4 PIK patches may enhance secretion by regulating lipids necessary for exocyst-dependent vesicle fusion. For example, studies have suggested that polarized cell growth is dependent on the exocyst complex through the PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding components Exo70 and Sec3. Disrupting the PIP binding domain of Exo70 or Sec3 mislocalizes the exocyst complex from the PM and severely impacts secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Future work will investigate potential links between Efr3 activity at the PIK patch and polarized secretion.</p></sec><sec><title>A model for PIK patches and their biological function</title><p><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> provides a model that illustrates how we propose the Stt4 PIK patch organizes at the PM. First, Ypp1 is capable of interacting with at least two separate regions within the N terminus of Stt4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). As a result, Ypp1 could act as a multivalent linker to organize/cluster multiple (&#x0223c;25&#x02013;30) Stt4 proteins into a PIK patch. Stt4&#x02013;Ypp1 complexes localize to the PM and further assemble through Efr3 to direct Stt4-mediated PtdIns4P production at the PM. Additional components, such as Sfk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audhya and Emr, 2002</xref>), may contribute to the organization and activation of this complex. Because there are potentially other factors associated with regulation of this complex, our future work will be directed toward identifying these components and determining how each factor mediates PIK patch dynamics and PtdIns4P metabolism.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Organization of Stt4 PIK patches at the PM.</bold> Ypp1 is a multivalent linker of Stt4 molecules ensuring the stability of the lipid kinase and the organization of the PIK patch.

Placing multiple PtdIns kinase enzymes into a common complex could permit coordinate activation/inactivation of all the kinases in the complex (PIK patch). This would allow the cell to regulate local levels of PtdIns4P in the PM (activation of some PIK patches while retaining others inactive). However, further experiments are needed to test this idea. Alternatively, the stability of the Stt4 PIK patch suggests they may reside at membrane contact sites linked to the ER. These contact sites have been hypothesized to be regions through which lipids can easily traffic between closely apposed membranes/organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levine and Loewen, 2006</xref>). There is some evidence to support this notion. First, Sac1, the PIP phosphatase that antagonizes Stt4 activity by turning over PtdIns4P at the PM, is an integral transmembrane protein anchored in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foti et al., 2001</xref>). Second, proteomics and genetic screens have identified several potential interactions between Stt4 and ER components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gavin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabuchi et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, Stt4 PIK patch components may be spatially restricted on the PM to sites that are juxtaposed with the ER and these sites could mediate local PIP production and signaling between the two membranes. Future work will explore the possibility that Stt4 PIK patches reside at these potential membrane contact sites and may determine the mechanism for formation and regulation of these contact sites.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmid construction</title><p>A list of all <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study and their genotypes can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>.

Proteins were subsequently concentrated and dialyzed into buffer A.</p><p>For cells expressing HIS<sub>6</sub> fusion proteins, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole) with protease inhibitors and prepared similar to GST fusion purification (previous paragraph) except that lysates were cleared by centrifugation (45 min at 13,000 <italic>g</italic>) and purified with Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN). The beads were washed extensively and the protein was eluted with buffer B plus 200 mM imidazole.</p><p>Sizing of HA-Ypp1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>) and HIS6-Ypp1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>) was performed on Superdex 300 and 200 analytical columns (GE Healthcare), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of gene transcription with doxycycline</title><p>Strains from the yTHC (Open Biosystems) were used to regulate expression of essential genes. Typically, the strain of interest was grown up in synthetic media and then diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.01, at which time doxycycline was added to a final concentration of 20 &#x003bc;g/ml. Subsequently, yeast were grown for &#x0223c;12 h and the abundance of the protein of interest was then measured to determine the relative amount remaining in the cells. Conditions varied slightly between strains tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows coimmunoprecipitation of HA-Stt4 with GFP-Stt4 from yeast lysates and quantification of GFP-Stt4 abundance in PIK patches compared with a LacI-GFP standard.
