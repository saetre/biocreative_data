The 804.6 kb region contained only two genes, LOC306664 and LOC306665. LOC306664 is predicted to translate into A Disintegrin-like and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs-16 (<italic>Adamts16</italic>). LOC306665 is a novel gene. All predicted exons of both LOC306664 and LOC306665 were sequenced. Non-synonymous variants were identified in only one of these genes, LOC306664. These variants were naturally existing polymorphisms among inbred, outbred and wild rats. The full-length rat transcript of <italic>Adamts16</italic> was detected in multiple tissues. Similar to <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> in humans, expression of <italic>Adamts16</italic> was prominent in the kidney. Renal transcriptome analysis suggested that a network of genes related to BP was differential between congenic and S rats. These genes were also differentially expressed between kidney cell lines with or without knock-down of <italic>Adamts16. Adamts16</italic> is conserved between rats and humans. It is a candidate gene within the homologous region on human Chromosome 5, which is linked to systolic and diastolic BP in the Quebec Family Study. Multiple variants, including an Ala to Pro variant in codon 90 (rs2086310) of human <italic>ADAMTS16</italic>, were associated with human resting systolic BP (SBP). Replication study in GenNet confirmed the association of two variants of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> with SBP, including rs2086310. Overall, our report represents a high resolution positional cloning and translational study for <italic>Adamts16</italic> as a candidate gene controlling BP.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Essential hypertension (EH), is a very common condition characterized by sustained high blood pressure (BP) with no identifiable cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C1">1</xref>). Genetic susceptibility factors account for &#x0223c;30% of an individual's risk of developing EH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C2">2</xref>). Mapping experiments in humans have successfully identified genetic determinants of rare, monogenic forms of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C11">11</xref>), but few have successfully defined the major susceptibility factors for EH, which represents 95% of all forms of hypertension in humans. This void has a bearing on current clinical management of EH, which is limited to symptomatic treatment with select anti-hypertensive agents.</p><p>A genome-wide association study by The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) using 2000 cases of EH and 3000 controls represents the single largest human association study for hypertension conducted to date, wherein six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were reported as being associated with hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C12">12</xref>). Comparative mapping revealed that the homologous locations of four out of these six human SNPs map within regions of the rat genome identified as BP quantitative trait loci (QTL) in our laboratory (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp218/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>). Notably, among the many strain comparisons that were used for mapping BP QTLs, all four regions are reported as BP QTL containing regions originally identified from a single linkage analysis between the hypertensive Dahl Salt-sensitive (S) rat and the Lewis (LEW) rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C13">13</xref>). Further, by combining transcriptional profiling with substitution mapping of S and LEW rats, we prioritized <italic>Nr2f2</italic> as a positional candidate locus for BP control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C14">14</xref>), an observation that was corroborated recently in humans through a haplotypic analysis of the WTCCC data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C15">15</xref>). These observations support positional identification of additional rat BP loci previously detected through the genetic analysis of S and LEW rats.</p><p>In this report, we focus on the fine-mapping of one such BP QTL (BP QTL2 on rat Chromosome 1) detected using S and LEW rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C16">16</xref>). This BP QTL in rats is homologous to a BP QTL detected on human Chromosome 5 in the Quebec Family Study (QFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C17">17</xref>).</p><p>Deriving and testing minimal congenic strains is a time-consuming process. Several studies have inferred differential segments between two congenic strains with opposite effects as QTL containing regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C20">20</xref>). Further, multiple candidate genes with non-synonymous variants and/or differential expression patterns are observed within QTL intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C23">23</xref>), which makes it difficult to pin-point the actual genetic determinant. In contrast to these scenarious, BP QTL2 region was isolated independently in a congenic strain. The congenic interval spanned 804.6 kb and contained only two expressed transcripts. Of these, DNA sequencing coupled with transcript structure and expression analysis identified <italic>Adamts16</italic> as a candidate gene harboring non-synonymous variants. ADAMTS16 is a member of a family of 19 secreted metalloproteinases, whose function, in contrast to several other family members, is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C26">26</xref>). There has been very little prior characterization of ADAMTS16. It is highly expressed in the kidney compared with other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C24">24</xref>), but previous studies reported to date on ADAMTS16 have not dealt with the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C27">27</xref>). Here we report that systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were associated with SNPs of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> in the QFS and in the GenNet study. This report therefore provides the basis for further investigation of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> as a novel gene involved in BP regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fine-mapping the BP QTL</title><p>The BP QTL described in this report, also called BP QTL region 2 was previously fine-mapped to a 2.73 Mb region flanked by the microsatellite markers D1Rat211 and D1Rat12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C16">16</xref>). Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP218F1">1</xref> is a comprehensive representation of markers genotyped for linkage analysis and for the construction and characterization of congenic strains. The detailed maps of the congenic substrains S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3B), S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3Bx1) and S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3Bx2) are shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP218F2">2</xref>. The measured BP of these congenic strains was significantly lower (19, 18 and 14 mmHg, respectively) than that of the hypertensive S rat as measured by the tail-cuff method (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DDP218TB1">1</xref>). The BP of one of these strains, S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3Bx1) was additionally tested and corroborated by the telemetry method (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP218F3">3</xref>). The BP of the congenic strain S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3Bx1) was lower than that of the S at all times, with the maximum difference between the two groups observed during the first 4 h of the resting phase. The BP of the S at this phase was 216 &#x000b1; 8.6 mmHg compared with that of the congenic strain 192 &#x000b1; 5.6 mmHg (BP effect of 24 mmHg, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). Therefore, the smallest congenic interval shared by the congenic strains, S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3B), S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3Bx1) and S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3Bx2), i.e. a fragment of 804597 bp flanked by D1MUO1 and D1MUO28, was inferred as adequate to account for the effect of BP QTL2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP218F1">1</xref>). Note that the entire 804597 bp critical region is represented as congenic intervals of two strains S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3Bx1) and S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3Bx2). The data shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP218F1">1</xref> compare the results of substitution mapping with those obtained by genetic linkage analysis of the same region. The location of the QTL determined by congenic strain analysis is closer to one end of the LOD peak from linkage analysis.</p><fig id="DDP218F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Comprehensive representation of mapping BP QTL2.

Closer inspection of the primary amino acid sequence indicated that the variant at location 274 in rat and the corresponding location of 277 in human are within putative furin cleavage sites (Arg-Xaa-Arg/Lys-Arg). ADAMTS proteases are synthesized as precursor proteins (zymogens) that are proteolytically processed at such consensus sites by furin to excise their propeptides. Propeptide excision typically converts the zymogen to an active protease. Therefore, the efficiency of cleavage of the variants within this furin cleavage site of S and LEW was tested in a protein construct containing the propeptide and catalytic domains (Adamts16 Pro-Cat). However, there were no detectable differences in the efficiency of cleavage by furin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp218/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>).

Similar associations of variants within human ADAMTS16 that were prevalent in two independent populations provide the rationale for further functional analysis of ADAMTS16 in the context of BP regulation and EH. Additional replications would be required to confirm these associations in humans.</p><p>Previously we inferred that QTL2 was localized to a 2.73 Mb region on the basis of the differential segment between two congenic strains, one with a BP effect and the other without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C16">16</xref>). By capturing the QTL in its entirety in two congenic substrains, which can be considered as replicated experiments, this QTL was shown to exert a phenotypic effect independently, i.e. without genetic interaction from introgressed LEW alleles of the previously reported strain with the BP effect, S.LEW (D1Mco4x1x3A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C16">16</xref>).</p><p>Data presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP218F1">1</xref> allowed us to compare the results of substitution mapping to the evidence obtained by genetic linkage analysis of the same region. It is interesting to note that the location of the QTL gene under study here is at some distance from the confidence intervals of LOD peaks for linkage to BP in the F2 (S &#x000d7; LEW) population. This phenomenon is known from theoretical work on simulations of linkage analysis involving two QTLs on the same chromosome and the creation of a &#x02018;ghost&#x02019; LOD peak between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C31">31</xref>). This artifact occurs when two QTLs are &#x0223c;40 cM apart and when the plus alleles at both QTLs are on the same chromosome, and the contrasting minus alleles are on the other chromosome. In the present case, the two QTLs on rat Chromosome 1 [QTL2 under consideration here and another adjacent QTL called QTL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C32">32</xref>)] are configured such that the LOD peak is generated between them, rather than directly over either of them. Other segregating populations, in which QTL1 is presumably not polymorphic, show excellent alignment of QTL2 with the LOD peak (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP218F5">5</xref>). The above situation reiterates the difficulty of mapping QTL genes solely based on linkage analysis as was often done in humans and exemplifies the power of substitution mapping in animal models to resolve QTLs by isolating them as &#x02018;monogenic&#x02019; QTL effectors. The advantage of this approach is shown by the data presented here, because the fine-mapped BP QTL did not contain any gene with previously known function related to BP.</p><p>The accuracy of mapping QTLs and detecting underlying genetic determinants depends heavily on the quality of assembly of genomes and gene predictions. Early impediments to the positional cloning effort described in this report included the incorrect assignment of the QTL region to rat Chromosome 17 and multiple, discordant gene predictions of <italic>Adamts16</italic>. The data presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP218F1">1</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DDP218TB2">2</xref> resolved the error in sequence assembly by correctly placing the region spanned by markers D1Rat211 and D1Rat12 on Chromosome 1. Similarly, the biological data that we have obtained allowed for solving the discrepancies among the available predictions for gene and transcript sequences of rat <italic>Adamts16</italic>. The most recent version of the predicted <italic>Adamts16</italic> gene at the NCBI rat genome resources website (Build 4.1) concurs with the evidence that we have provided in the present study.</p><p>It is interesting to note that in addition to other tissues, <italic>Adamts16</italic> is expressed in the kidney, which is a major organ involved in BP homeostasis. The function of Adamts16 is unknown (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/tools/genes/genes_view.cgi?id=1310046">http://rgd.mcw.edu/tools/genes/genes_view.cgi?id=1310046</uri>). Based on the roles of the ADAMTS family members and based on the presence of a metalloproteinase domain and intact active site sequence HESGH+HD within Adamts16, it is likely that Adamts16 functions as a metalloproteinase <italic>in vivo</italic>. The non-synonymous SNPs reported in this study do not reside within the metalloproteinase domain of Adamts16. However, they are located in potentially critical regions of the protease, since furin cleavage is known to relieve enzyme latency of other members of the Adamts family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C38">38</xref>), and the thrombospondin repeat domain is known to influence substrate binding and proteolysis. As the SNPs within the nucleotides coding for the furin cleavage site did not account for changes in efficiency of cleavage by furin, it is possible that the full-length protein may be required for eliciting a differential functionality of <italic>Adamts16</italic> variants. For example, a signal peptide mutation in ADAMTS10 causing Weill&#x02013;Marchesani syndrome was found to have different effects on ADAMTS10 Pro-Cat and full-length ADAMTS10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C39">39</xref>). Alternately, the ADAMTS16 thrombospondin-motifs, one of which is affected in the second non-synonymous variant (+3508), reported in our study could have key biological activities. Since a substrate is not known for Adamts16, these possibilities are currently unexplored and beyond the scope of the present work. Regardless of the functional alterations, we hypothesized that alterations of the renal transcriptome as a consequence of altered functions of Adamts16 could be important in understanding the potential link between the mechanism of action of this gene product and the physiology of BP regulation. Because the renal transcriptome of the congenic strain may not be the exclusive representation of the downstream effectors regulated by <italic>Adamts16</italic>, but may rather represent the net effect of the introgressed congenic segment, we compared the results of our study to the &#x02018;biological signature&#x02019; obtained by knock-down of <italic>Adamts16</italic>. Overlapping, multiple networks related to BP and organogenesis were perturbed in both cases. The precise mechanism through which such changes in expression lead to the alteration in BP remains to be determined in this model. The results suggested interesting gene targets for BP regulation such as histone deacetylases <italic>Hdac5</italic> and <italic>Hdac10</italic>, genes involved in epigenetic regulation. Taken together, the results are highly supportive of the kidney as one of the sites of action through which variants of <italic>Adamts16</italic> participate in the regulation of BP.</p><p>Considering the difficulty of defining what constitutes a good standard for identifying a gene underlying a QTL, Glazier <italic>et al</italic>. have suggested some criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C40">40</xref>). In a recent review on the genetic dissection of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C41">41</xref>), Cowley indicated that the gold standard for validation of a potential candidate gene for hypertension is that the rescue of the phenotype must be done in the same species and with the same genetic background that was used to identify the QTL. Our study almost meets this &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; because (i) The QTL is fine-mapped to a small region solely based on natural recombination events, thus closely mimicking the performance of a natural allele in the rat as opposed to artificially genetically manipulated systems such as transgenics and knock-ins; and (ii) we are able to map the QTL to a gene-sparse region as confirmed by comparative mapping in rats, mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C16">16</xref>), thus allowing for testing of the two expressed candidate transcripts, only one of which had coding sequence variants. One could argue that in addition to the variants within <italic>Adamts16</italic>, there may be other variants within inter-genic or intra-genic regions of the critical QTL interval that contribute to the QTL effect. Like in any positional cloning study, regardless of any criteria, such possibilities cannot be ruled out. However, with the view of improving the clinical management strategies for high BP through the identification of novel and effective drug targets, the current study in rats as model organisms with follow-up analyses in independent association studies in humans from two unrelated populations, provide the rationale for prioritization of functional studies of <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> as a candidate for the BP QTL on human Chromosome 5.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted as per pre-approved protocols by the Institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) of the University of Toledo College of Medicine (UTCOM). Dahl salt-sensitive (SS/Jr) inbred rats were from our colony maintained at UTCOM. LEW/NCrlBR (LEW rat) was originally obtained from the Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and maintained in our colony. The congenic substrain S.LEW (D1MCO4X1X3B) was derived from S.LEW (D1MCO4X1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C16">16</xref>) as the parental strain contributing to the introgressed LEW alleles. Congenic substrains S.LEW (D1MCO4X1X3BX1) and S.LEW (D1MCO4X1X3BX2) were derived from S.LEW (D1MCO4X1X3B) as the progenitor with LEW alleles at the QTL region. The congenic substrains were constructed by crossing the progenitor congenic strain to the S rat to obtain a heterozygous F1 population. An F1 &#x000d7; F1 intercross then yielded an F2 population. The F2 animals were selected for recombinants with varying sizes of the LEW RNO1 introgressed region. A new recombinant animal was backcrossed to S rats to duplicate the new recombinant chromosome. The resulting progeny were genotyped to identify heterozygotes. Heterozygotes were then intercrossed to produce progeny, which were screened for animals homozygous for the new recombinant chromosome. Finally, the homozygous animals were bred to generate a congenic strain containing the desired LEW chromosomal segment in the homozygous form on the S genetic background.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Microsatellite marker development and tracking recombination events in congenic strains</title><p>Microsatellite repeats in the region of interest were identified on the rat genomic sequence (version 3.1) at the NCBI website (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</uri>).

Changes in fluorescence polarization after excitation of the samples by plane-polarized light were measured using a Victor2 Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). The allele calling was performed with the SNP scorer genotyping software (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Details for PCR conditions and primer sequences are available upon request at <email>rankint@pbrc.edu</email>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f2"><title>GenNet study.</title><p>The GenNet study comprises 3467 individuals in total, recruited between 1995 and 2004 [1101 African Americans (AA), 839 Hispanic Americans (HA) and 1496 European Americans (EA)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP218C46">46</xref>). Individuals were recruited at two field centers: EA were recruited from Tecumseh, Michigan, and AA and HA were recruited from Maywood, IL. Recruitment was performed in families starting from a proband with high BP. DNA was available for 3205 individuals (968 AA, 824 HA and 1471 EA). Measured SBP and DBP (average over two manual measurements) was adjusted for age and sex, or age, sex and BMI, by linear regression and the residuals were used in the analysis. The impact of anti-hypertensive therapy on BP levels was empirically corrected for by adding 10 mmHg to SBP and 5 mmHg to DBP if a participant took BP-lowering medications.</p></sec><sec id="s4f3"><title>SNP genotyping in the GenNet study.</title><p>SNP genotyping was performed on all DNA samples available and genotypes could be obtained from using a 5&#x02032;-nuclease-based assay (TaqMan, ABI) analyzed on an ABI Prism 7900 Real Time PCR System according to the manufacturer's instructions. Call rates were 0.989 for rs2086310 and 0.982 for rs2964433. There was no evidence for deviation from Hardy&#x02013;Weinberg equilibrium within each ethnic group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1 for all populations in both variants tested). As additional quality control, we produced duplicate genotypes (<italic>n</italic> = 102) that gave identical results and genotypes from seven HapMap samples that were all consistent with the HapMap dataset. Minor allele frequencies were 0.3, 0.188, 0.129 (rs 2086310) and 0.1, 0.134, 0.043 (rs2964433) for AA, EA and HA, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4f4"><title>Analyses: QFS and GenNet study.</title><p>Association testing for measured SBP and DBP (average over two manual measurements) was performed with a mixed regression model using the SAS PROC MIXED procedure (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The non-independence of the data resulting from the familial structure in GenNet and QFS was accounted for in the analyses by using a sandwich procedure which asymptotically yields the same parameter estimates as an ordinary least squares or regression method but the standard errors and consequently hypothesis tests are adjusted for the dependencies. Two sets of analyses were performed, one on age- and sex-adjusted data and a second one adjusted for age, sex and BMI (for GenNet) and for age, sex, sodium intake and waist circumference (for QFS). In GenNet, the impact of anti-hypertensive therapy on BP levels was empirically corrected for by adding 10 mmHg to SBP and 5 mmHg to DBP if a participant took BP-lowering medications.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp218/DC1">Supplementary Material is available at <italic>HMG</italic> online</ext-link>.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="ddp218_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="ddp218_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (<award-id>HL076709</award-id> to B.J., <award-id>HL075414</award-id> to B.J., N.H.L., <award-id>HL45670</award-id> to C.B., <award-id>HL054512</award-id> to A.W., <award-id>AR049930</award-id> to S.A.).
