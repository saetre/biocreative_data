Metabolism of arginine, citrulline and ornithine is distributed between mitochondria and cytosol. For the shuttle of intermediates between cytosol and mitochondria transporters present on the inner mitochondrial membrane are required. Yeast contains a mitochondrial translocator for ornithine and arginine, Ort1p/Arg11p.

In addition, plastids contribute significantly to amino acid metabolism of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For instance in plants, biosynthesis, conversion and degradation of arginine, ornithine and citrulline are distributed across mitochondria, plastids and cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In many plants, arginine is stored in seeds as a major nitrogen source, e.g. in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>arginine accounts for 11% of total seed nitrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. During seed germination, stored arginine is degraded for conversion into transport forms (e.g. glutamine or glutamate). The enzyme arginase, which catalyzes degradation of arginine to ornithine and urea is localized in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus arginine needs to be imported into mitochondria to allow mobilization. Transport steps across the mitochondrial membranes are also required during biosynthesis. In yeast, ornithine, a precursor of arginine, is synthesized in mitochondria from glutamate, which is imported from the cytosol. Ornithine is transferred to the cytosol before conversion to arginine. Additionally, arginine needs to be imported into mitochondria to allow mitochondrial protein synthesis. Ornithine serves as an intermediate of arginine and proline metabolism, and of the ureide citrulline. In plants, ornithine serves also a precursor for polyamine and alkaloid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus also in various other metabolic pathways, transport of arginine, ornithine and also citrulline is required. Although mitochondrial in- and efflux of citrulline was originally described in rat liver and heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], it has not been described in plants.</p><p>Thus for metabolite exchange and coordination of all these pathways, multiple carriers must be present on the inner mitochondrial membrane of the different organisms. In the yeast genome, 35 members of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) were identified; 12 of them were characterized in terms of substrate specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. MCF proteins have similar structural features: a relatively low molecular mass of around 30 kDa, a tripartite structure (three repeats of about 100 amino acids), each consisting of two transmembrane-helices separated by a hydrophilic loop. Furthermore, a consensus sequence [P-X-(DE)-X-(LIVAT)-(RK)-X-(LRH)-(LIVMFY)], called the "mitochondrial energy signature", is present in all carriers in one to three copies at the C-terminal end of the first helix of each repeat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Most transporters belonging to this family function as antiporters. A combination of transport studies in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and reconstitution of carriers expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>lead to the identification of the first mammalian mitochondrial carrier gene belonging to the MCF family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Since then, mitochondrial transporter genes encoding various predicted transport systems have been identified in yeast and human genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The Arabidopsis genome contains at least 48 members of the MCF family, 7 with 3 copies of the mitochondrial energy transfer signature, 21 with two copies and 20 with one copy. Until now, only few plant MCF carriers have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]: the adenine nucleotide translocators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], uncoupling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and recently also a dicarboxylate-tricarboxylate carrier named DTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and a succinate transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, despite their importance none of the postulated plant mitochondrial transporters for amino acids has been identified, such as proline transporters for the compartmentalized proline metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], GABA transporters for the GABA shunt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], glutamate/aspartate transporters for photorespiratory exchange with peroxisomes or ornithine/arginine carriers for arginine metabolism that were biochemically characterized in isolated soybean mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>A yeast <italic>arg11 </italic>mutant unable to synthesize arginine was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The corresponding gene was cloned by complementation of the <italic>arg 11 </italic>mutant, revealing that Arg11p is a member of MCF. On the basis of amino acids content of the mutant, it was suggested that ARG11p would function as an mitochondrial ornithine translocator of yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The properties of Ort1p were characterized after expression in <italic>E. coli </italic>and subsequent reconstitution. The major function of Ort1p/Arg11p is ornithine export from mitochondria. Ort1p/Arg11p mediates electroneutral antiport of ornithine, arginine and lysine, and with lower efficiency also ornithine/H<sup>+ </sup>antiport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Since mitochondria of an <italic>arg11 </italic>deletion mutant retained arginine/ornithine carrier activity, a second transporter for basic amino acids named Bac1 was postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Sequence homologies to the yeast gene were used to identify the human ORNT1 transporter and to demonstrate that the HHH syndrome (Hyperornithinaemia-Hyperammoniaemia-Homocitrullinuria) is due to defects in the respective gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the case of citrullinaemia, a different member of the MCF family was defective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], namely the aspartate/glutamate carrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Yet another amino acid carrier identified by reconstitution in liposomes was the human glutamate transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However in yeast, and despite extensive attempts, none of the crucial carriers for amino acids or other metabolites was identified in genetic studies apart from <italic>arg11, acr</italic>1 and <italic>dic1</italic>, i.e. mutants have been found for all metabolic steps in many of the amino acid pathways but not the respective mutations in mitochondrial carriers. Since the yeast genome contains a large number of MCF proteins one may hypothesize that transporters have overlapping substrate specificities and yeast may thus be able to compensate loss of single MCF genes.</p><p>To date, the most efficient approach to identify plant plasma membrane transporters has been suppression cloning in yeast mutants. Since in most cases mitochondrial transporters do not contain identifiable targeting sequences, it remained open whether yeast complementation may be a suitable tool to identify the plant homologs. Searches in the Arabidopsis genome identified a gene 32% identical to the yeast Ort1p/Arg11p. The Arabidopsis gene <italic>AtmBAC2</italic>, when expressed in yeast, was able to restore growth of the yeast <italic>arg11 </italic>mutant on media lacking arginine, indicating that AtmBAC2 catalyzes the export of ornithine from mitochondria to the cytosol. RT-PCR analysis and promoter-GUS fusions were used to study expression and regulation of <italic>AtmBAC2</italic>. Absence of expression in developing seeds and in cotyledons of seedlings indicated that, in addition to AtmBAC2, another transporter, supposedly <italic>AtmBAC1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], is involved in storage and mobilization of arginine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Complementation of the yeast <italic>arg11 </italic>mutant by a plant cDNA</title><p>The yeast mutant <italic>arg11 </italic>is bradytrophic for arginine, due to deletion of the mitochondrial transporter for ornithine, an intermediate in arginine metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To identify a corresponding Arabidopsis transporter gene, the <italic>arg11 </italic>yeast mutant was transformed with an Arabidopsis cDNA library in the yeast expression vector pFL61 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Around 10<sup>6 </sup>transformants were screened for growth on a medium lacking arginine. Potentially due to the background growth of the bradytroph mutant, no genes able to complement the yeast <italic>arg11 </italic>mutant were found. Therefore, a homology search was carried out with the ORT1p/Arg11p sequence from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>against the predicted protein sequences encoded by the Arabidopsis genome and in the Aramemnon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] integral membrane protein database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aramemnon.botanik.uni-koeln.de"/>. Two putative proteins AtmBAC1 and AtmBAC2 encoded by the loci At5g46800 and At1g79900 respectively scored highest similarity values. By RT-PCR, the <italic>AtmBAC2 </italic>cDNA corresponding to the locus At1g79900 was cloned. <italic>AtmBAC2 </italic>encodes a protein of 296 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 32 kDa that shares 32% identity and 52% similarity with the yeast ORT1p/Arg11p protein. Hydrophobicity analysis of the polypeptide (HMMTOP 2.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/"/>) predicted six putative membrane spanning domains, consistent with the known structures of MCF carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Six other programs predict between zero (soluble) and five transmembrane spans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In general, the prediction of transmembrane spans in case of MCF carriers is problematic since hydrophobic domains are present, however, confidence levels are below the assumed critical value. Thus, such proteins would be missing from databases, which rely solely on membrane protein predictions. The structural prediction is supported by the presence of "mitochondrial energy transfer signatures" after the first, third, and fifth transmembrane domains. The combination of homology searches, hydrophobicity analysis and the presence of the signature motif indicate that AtmBAC2 comprises all features of the mitochondrial carrier family (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). AtmBAC2 does not contain a predicted targeting sequence for import into mitochondria, similar to many other mitochondrial proteins belonging to the MCF family.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Structural model of AtmBAC2. </bold>The prediction was performed using the TMHMM program <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0"/>. Six hydrophobic domains are depicted as black boxes and the three mitochondrial energy transfer signatures as grey boxes (amino acid positions are given).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-3-1-1"/></fig><p>The <italic>AtmBAC2 </italic>cDNA was cloned in the yeast vectors pFL61, containing the <italic>PGK </italic>promoter, and pDR195, with the stronger <italic>PMA1 </italic>promoter fragment. When expressed from the <italic>PMA1 </italic>promoter, <italic>AtmBAC2 </italic>was able to efficiently complement the yeast arginine bradytrophy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Similar experiments using the comparatively weaker <italic>PGK </italic>promoter showed only weak complementation, i.e. slower growth as compared to cells expressing <italic>AtmBAC2 </italic>under control of the PMA1 promoter (data not shown). To study the substrate specificity, AtmBAC2 was fused to a his-tag and the fusion protein was expressed under the strong PMA1 promoter fragment in yeast. Mitochondria were isolated and AtmBAC2 was purified as a 32 kDa polypeptide (data not shown). Functional reconstitution can be used to characterize the properties of AtmBAC2 in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In a parallel study, Hoyos <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] identified AtmBAC1, a closely related ornithine transporter. AtmBAC1 was successfully reconstituted into artificial proteoliposomes and was able to carry out ornithine/ornithine exchange as well as exchange of various amino acids against arginine. AtmBAC1 showed a preference for basic amino acids with highest affinity for arginine and lysine, but transported also histidine. Thus AtmBAC1, similar to many other characterized MCF transporters, is promiscuous. This may reflect that transporters do not have a binding pocket, but filtering and recognition probably take place along the translocation pathway within the pore. From an evolutionary perspective, the low selectivity may be advantageous since mutations would allow rapid adaptation to changes in compartmentation of metabolism. However, the modulation of substrate specificity makes it difficult to define the physiological function based only on the sequence. The promiscuity may also explain why so far only few mutants in mitochondrial carrier functions have been identified, e.g. <italic>arg11 </italic>in yeast or the disease related HHH syndrome.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Functional complementation of yeast. </bold>The yeast strain Y02386 (<italic>arg11</italic>) was transformed with the empty vector pDR195 (A), or with AtmBAC2 cloned in pDR195 (B).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-3-1-2"/></fig><p>So far, the most efficient methodology to characterize mitochondrial transporters was a candidate gene approach. Candidates were expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], purified proteins were reconstituted in lipid vesicles and transport properties were determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The approach is difficult and laborious and no standard protocols applicable for all candidates are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, an alternative method was developed allowing identification of mitochondrial carriers via suppression of auxo- or bradytrophic phenotypes of yeast mutants. Although there is no evidence for a mitochondrial targeting sequence in the <italic>AtmBAC2 </italic>sequence, and little is known about signals for import of nuclear encoded proteins in the mitochondria of yeast and plants, the yeast import mechanisms are able to recognize also plant mitochondrial proteins and target them to mitochondria. In this way, the identification of <italic>AtmBAC2 </italic>and of <italic>AtmBAC1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] from Arabidopsis as ornithine carriers confirms the validity of yeast complementation for the functional assignment of candidate genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic tree of MCF translocators</title><p>A detailed analysis of transporter databases indicates that the Arabidopsis MCF family is highly divergent and a full alignment showed only eight perfectly conserved residues. Since a similarity tree branches into two major clades plus a few single and very distantly related members, the phylogenetic analysis was carried out with the subgroup containing the amino acid transporters, several other Arabidopsis MCF members and selected fungal and mammalian members falling into the same branch (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These selected polypeptides can be classified into six major clades: (i) amino acid carriers, (ii) two clades of di- and tricarboxylate carriers, (iii) uncoupling proteins (UCPs), and (iv) at least two groups of carriers for which no function has been assigned yet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Within the amino acid carriers, the <italic>Saccharomyces </italic>Ort1p/Arg11p and related transporters from <italic>Neurospora </italic>and <italic>Aspergillus </italic>are most closely related to the Arabidopsis AtmBAC2 and AtmBAC1, whereas glutamate and glutamate/asparate carriers are more distantly related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. No other Arabidopsis proteins fall into this clade. Interestingly, the mammalian carnitine transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] also belongs to the amino acid carrier clade, being more closely related to the basic amino acid transporters. Since so far no evidence exists for carnitine transport in plants, one may predict that the other members of this clade and those belonging to the groups of unknown transporters may be candidates for the missing carrier involved in amino acid transport functions in mitochondria.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic analyses of AtmBAC2 and other mitochondrial carriers. </bold>The alignment was restricted to the conserved domains (between pos. 11 and 259 in AtmBAC2 amino acid sequence).
