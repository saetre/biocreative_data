Importantly, 40% of the protein-coding genes that were induced at 37&#x000b0;C have been previously implicated in virulence or intracellular growth of <italic>Francisella </italic>in other studies, associating the bacterial response to this temperature shift with pathogenesis. Forty-four percent of the genes induced at 37&#x000b0;C encode proteins of unknown function, suggesting novel <italic>Francisella </italic>virulence traits are regulated by mammalian temperature. To explore this possibility, we generated two mutants of loci induced at 37&#x000b0;C [FTL_1581 and FTL_1664 (<italic>deoB</italic>)].

Importantly, the compilation of temperature-regulated genes also defines a rich collection of novel candidate virulence determinants, including <italic>tivA </italic>(FTL_1581).

This organism causes mortality in up to 60% of infected individuals if untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Based on the potential to weaponize this organism, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has classified <italic>F. tularensis </italic>as a Category A biodefense agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is therefore vital to understand how this organism responds to environmental and host signals, and how these cues alter expression of virulence determinants. During the course of a natural <italic>Francisella </italic>infection, this bacterium may transition from an amoeba [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or an arthropod host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] to colonize human cells. Accompanying this transition, it is likely that chemical and physical signals alert <italic>Francisella </italic>that it has entered a mammalian host.</p><p>The manner by which <italic>F. tularensis </italic>integrates environmental stimuli to regulate gene expression is fundamental to the success of this organism as an intracellular pathogen. The most well-studied virulence factors of <italic>F. tularensis </italic>are encoded in the <italic>Francisella </italic>Pathogenicity Island (FPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The amount of one of the virulence proteins encoded in this cluster, IglC, increases in response to growth in macrophages and hydrogen peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, iron limitation has been shown to induce transcription and protein levels of IglACD and PdpB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] as well as stimulate siderophore production by <italic>F. tularensis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Previously, we have shown that differing culture conditions greatly influence host-pathogen interactions and the ability of <italic>F. tularensis </italic>live vaccine strain (LVS) to activate macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Prior to the current study, there has only been a single published report characterizing the global transcriptional <italic>Francisella </italic>response to an environmental cue, specifically iron limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Important insights into the regulation of virulence factors like <italic>iglC </italic>were defined in this analysis. However, numerous genes associated with virulence by other studies are not affected by different iron concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Because <italic>F. </italic>tularensis may transition between hosts, mammalian body temperature is another signal that is likely to be critical for this pathogen.</p><p>Pathogenic bacteria that encounter a shift in temperature during their life cycle sometimes respond with enhanced virulence factor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, there are discrepancies among the specific groups of genes that are affected by temperature and the mechanism of regulation between organisms. For example, <italic>Shigella </italic>increases production of its Type III secretion system in response to mammalian temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The homologous secretion apparatus in pathogenic <italic>Salmonella</italic>, however, is not regulated by temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Regarding the mechanism of regulation, genes involved in the heat-shock response are often induced at mammalian temperatures relative to those of the environment. This regulation is usually due to the presence of a conserved inverted repeat regulatory structure in the promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], or control by a &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>-type heat shock sigma factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, the bacterium responsible for whooping cough, <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, uses a two-component system comprised of BvgS and BvgA to alter transcription of genes in response to temperature. Following induction of <italic>bvgAS </italic>at 37&#x000b0;C, phosphorylation by BvgS allows BvgA-binding to promoter regions of virulence genes, such as the adhesin, <italic>fimX </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Given the uncertainty of target temperature-regulated genes and differences in mechanism among bacteria, it is necessary to define the temperature regulon in individual species. Studying gene expression changes induced by a shift to mammalian temperature could provide valuable insight into <italic>Francisella </italic>virulence.</p><p>A few previous studies have investigated the <italic>Francisella </italic>response to temperature at the molecular level. High temperature (42&#x02013;44&#x000b0;C) synonymous with heat stress has been shown to have dramatic effects on <italic>F. tularensis </italic>gene and protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] including increased production of the heat shock proteins GroEL, GroES, DnaK, and ClpB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Heat stress has also been shown to enhance the virulence of a mutant form of <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>F. novicida </italic>has been shown to alter its outer membrane at 25&#x000b0;C versus 37&#x000b0;C by differentially modifying the lipid A component of the lipopolysaccharide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In addition, it has been observed that virulent <italic>F. tularensis </italic>clinical isolates increase the mannose modification of their lipopolysaccharide when cultivated at temperatures less than 25&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The results from these previous studies suggest that a global transcript analysis following a shift to mammalian body temperature should reveal gene regulation that is critical to <italic>Francisella </italic>pathogenesis.</p><p>Here we show that a shift from environmental to mammalian body temperature significantly alters the transcriptome of <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS. Many genes that we identified as significantly induced at 37&#x000b0;C have been previously implicated in <italic>Francisella </italic>virulence, supporting the notion that this temperature shift is important for the regulation of pathogenesis. We provide evidence that the product of a gene encoding the hypothetical protein most profoundly induced by mammalian temperature contributes to virulence and intracellular growth. Moreover, data presented here indicate that a locus up-regulated at 37&#x000b0;C was required for optimal uptake by eukaryotic cells. This is the first <italic>F. tularensis </italic>gene identified to be involved in the entry of this organism into both phagocytic and non-phagocytic host cells. The results from this study support a model where detection of mammalian body temperature by <italic>F. tularensis </italic>is important for regulation of physiology necessary for successful infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS global temperature regulation</title><p>To study <italic>Francisella </italic>gene expression changes associated with exposure to mammalian temperature, we conducted a microarray analysis of LVS as a model <italic>F. tularensis </italic>strain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Gene expression of LVS cultured at 26&#x000b0;C (non-mammalian environment) was compared to bacteria shifted to 37&#x000b0;C (mammalian host body temperature). Labeled cDNA target was produced from RNA isolated from <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS and was subsequently hybridized to a custom Agilent <italic>Francisella </italic>microarray. Global gene expression data were analyzed with a J5 statistical test, which was selected to limit the number of false positives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This analysis identified 95 genes with significantly increased expression and 125 genes with decreased expression in response to a shift to mammalian body temperature (see additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, respectively). Collectively, this represents approximately ~11% of the genes in the entire LVS genome. Genes with a significant change in expression were examined with the Gene Pattern program by hierarchical clustering (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The clustered data exhibited a distinct pattern of transcript induction and repression in response to mammalian body temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Together, these data indicate that this temperature shift has a broad impact on <italic>F. tularensis </italic>transcription.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Strain, plasmid, <break/>or primer</td><td align="left">Description<break/></td><td align="left">Source or <break/>Reference</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Strains</bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;<italic>F. tularensis</italic></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;LVS</td><td align="left"><italic>F. tularensis </italic>subsp. <italic>holartica </italic>live vaccine strain</td><td align="left">Karen Elkins</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;1581d</td><td align="left">LVS with <italic>FTL_1581 </italic>disruption, Hyg<sup>R</sup></td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;1664d</td><td align="left">LVS with <italic>FTL_1664 </italic>(<italic>deoB</italic>) disruption, Hyg<sup>R</sup></td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;<italic>E. coli</italic></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;XL10-Gold</td><td align="left">&#x00394;(<italic>mcrA</italic>)<italic>183 &#x00394;

As expected, many of the induced and repressed genes were involved in central biological functions such as metabolism, transcription, translation, DNA replication, and RNA genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Heat shock proteins belong to the category labeled "posttranslational modification/protein turnover/chaperones", and as anticipated, these genes were induced at the higher temperature, providing additional support to our microarray analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The heat shock protein result was confirmed by analyzing Hsp70 protein quantity by Western blotting, which showed significantly more Hsp70 in bacteria shifted to 37&#x000b0;C versus <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS cultured at 26&#x000b0;C (data not shown). COG categories found only among the up-regulated transcripts included genes functioning in secretion and cell division, suggesting that host temperature may trigger these cellular processes and reflect, in part, enhanced growth rate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In addition, the COG for bacterial defense mechanisms, which includes type I site-specific restriction-modification systems, was uniquely down-regulated. This response may have evolved to allow this bacterium to better contend with environmental stresses, such as invading bacteriophages. We observed that a large percentage of both up- and down-regulated genes (44% and 64% respectively) did not belong to a known COG category (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We selected this gene for further study to test our hypothesis that temperature regulates genes necessary for infection. A BLAST search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] against the National Center for Biotechnology Information database of non-redundant sequences did not identify proteins from organisms other than <italic>Francisella </italic>that had &#x0003e;30% identity to FTL_1581 (data not shown). This suggested that FTL_1581 may have a function unique to <italic>F. tularensis</italic>. The primary structure of FTL_1581 was further examined by a PROSITE analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] which indicated this protein likely contained a lipoprotein signal sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) consistent with its annotation. This analysis also revealed that the signal sequence overlapped with a motif similar to that of the Enterobacterial TraT complement resistance protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Although the initial BLAST search did not retrieve homologous proteins with high degrees of identity, it did show that FTL_1581 contained a domain with 20&#x02013;24% identity and 40&#x02013;44% similarity with the vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA; jhp0819) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and paralogs (jhp0556, jhp0856) of <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>J99 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

The chicken embryo produces a robust innate immune response comprised of complement, phagocytic cells, and cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Here, chicken embryos were infected with a ~1:1 mixture of LVS and 1581d. At days 1, 2, and 3 post-infection, wild-type LVS exhibited superior survival compared to 1581d (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 at each time point) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This result was not due to a growth defect since 1581d grew identically to wild-type LVS when cultivated in bacterial growth medium (data not shown). In a separate experiment in which chicken embryos were infected only with 1581d, isolates from homogenates were all resistant to hygromycin, indicating that this mutant did not revert to wild type during infection (data not shown). Since 1581d was attenuated compared to LVS, the results suggest the function of the FTL_1581 gene product contributes to <italic>F. tularensis </italic>virulence.</p><p>We wanted to determine if the virulence attenuation of 1581d in the chicken embryo infection model was due to a reduced ability to inactivate complement, as FTL_1581 contained a putative complement resistance domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Therefore, we subjected LVS and 1581d to serum sensitivity assays. There was equivalent survival of wild-type LVS and 1581d when cultured in media containing 20% serum or 20% heat-inactivated serum for up to 20 h (data not shown). To ensure that the serum complement was functional, <italic>E. coli </italic>DH5&#x003b1; was used as a control. Here, the CFU from the serum-treated <italic>E. coli </italic>exhibited a reduction of 3 logs relative to the input or heat-inactivated serum groups after 30 min (data not shown). This suggested that the disruption in 1581d does not affect complement resistance.</p><p>We determined if FTL_1581 contributed to growth in a macrophage environment. Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages were infected <italic>in vitro </italic>with either LVS or 1581d. At various time-points, macrophages were lysed, and the lysates were diluted and plated to enumerate viable CFU. We observed attenuated growth of 1581d in macrophages at 24 h post-infection (<italic>P </italic>= 0.003) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). When FTL_1581 was complemented <italic>in trans </italic>in 1581d, wild-type level of growth was restored (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). This complementation confirmed that the reduced intracellular fitness of 1581d was due to the inactivation of FTL_1581, and not due to polar effects or alternate mutations. This experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) also suggested that the attenuation of 1581d in the chicken embryo model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) was likely due to a defect in intracellular survival. Together, the data presented here implicate FTL_1581, a <italic>Francisella </italic>ORF induced by mammalian body temperature that has no obvious homologs, with virulence and intracellular survival.

In contrast, the RAW 264.7 cells infected with 1664d produced considerably less fluorescence despite comparable inocula to the cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The results obtained by microscopy suggested the discrepancy in CFU between wildtype and 1664d was not due to killing in the early phagosome. Rather, the levels of fluorescence in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> were consistent with the CFU uptake data presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and confirmed that the temperature-regulated <italic>deoB </italic>is important for optimal uptake by mammalian phagocytes.</p><p>To determine if <italic>deoB </italic>contributed to entry into non-phagocytic cells, we exposed the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293 to either LVS, 1664d, or 1664d/pFTL_1664. At two hours post-infection, these cells were treated with gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria followed by extensive washing. Subsequently, HEK-293 cells were lysed and the lysates were diluted and plated to enumerate CFU. Here we observed that 1664d showed reduced entry into the non-phagocytic HEK-293 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The uptake defect was again rescued by <italic>trans </italic>complementation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>deoB </italic>contributes significantly to entry into both phagocytic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) and non-phagocytic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we provide evidence that <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS undergoes significant gene expression changes in response to mammalian body temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, and Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). We hypothesized that genes important for infection of mammals may be induced during transition to this higher temperature. Although some genes, such as ribosomal RNA and tRNA genes, may reflect an increased growth rate at 37&#x000b0;C, our overall hypothesis was supported by the finding that 40% of the protein coding genes induced at 37&#x000b0;C have been shown or implicated to be important for successful <italic>Francisella </italic>infection (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In addition, we showed that two specific genes induced at 37&#x000b0;C contribute to the fitness of <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS during infection. While infection of a mammalian host exerts a complex set of signals on <italic>F. tularensis </italic>in addition to temperature, it is likely that many of the unexplored genes induced at mammalian temperature have a role in pathogenesis of <italic>F. tularensis</italic>. Differential responses to temperature among virulent and less virulent <italic>F. </italic>tularensis strains will also provide a focused list of relevant candidate virulence determinants to investigate further. The products of temperature-regulated genes with central roles in physiology and virulence could be targets for novel therapeutics or mutation to generate defined live attenuated vaccines.</p><p>One gene induced at 37&#x000b0;C, <italic>tivA </italic>(FTL_1581), encodes a protein with little overall identity to other proteins. It does, however, contain regions of meager similarity to the domains of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of other bacteria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). We showed that this gene was necessary for full <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS virulence in the chicken embryo model, most likely because it contributed to optimal replication in primary human macrophages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In a previous high-throughput microarray-based, negative-selection screen for <italic>F. novicida </italic>genes important for a murine infection, the <italic>tivA </italic>allele of <italic>F. novicida </italic>(FTN_0573) was not identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. There may be intrinsic differences between <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS and <italic>F. novicida </italic>pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and their reliance on <italic>tivA</italic>. A more probable explanation is that <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS and the more pathogenic <italic>F. tularensis </italic>Schu S4 contain a single copy of this gene. In contrast, <italic>F. novicida </italic>has two homologs of <italic>tivA </italic>in its genome, suggesting the possibility of functional redundancy. These alternate forms (FTN_1103, 52% identity; FTN_1101, 49% identity) may have compensated for a mutation of <italic>tivA </italic>(FTN_0573) during the negative-selection screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], thereby masking any effects on pathogenesis. This possibility underscores the value of analyzing several different strains when probing <italic>F. tularensis </italic>pathogenesis.</p><p>Strain 1664d, a disruption mutant of <italic>deoB</italic>, exhibited significant reduction in uptake into mammalian cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) indicating that this gene's product is involved in a mechanism that enhances entry. It would be advantageous for <italic>Francisella </italic>to couple expression of a gene important for uptake (<italic>deoB</italic>) with mammalian temperature, a cue encountered early in infection. Augmenting entry would improve access to the intracellular environment in which <italic>F. tularensis </italic>proliferates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. A previous study showed that <italic>pyrB </italic>(FTT1665) from <italic>F. tularensis </italic>Schu S4 was important for invasion in the human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, a Schu S4 mutant of <italic>pyrB </italic>was not defective in uptake by J774.1 macrophage-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], suggesting that the <italic>Francisella </italic>mechanisms of optimal uptake by phagocytes and invasion into hepatocytes are separate phenomena. In another prior study, mutants of MglA, a key regulator of the FPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and mutants of six genes controlled by this protein were not defective for cell entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This suggests that <italic>Francisella </italic>has evolved separate regulatory mechanisms for enhancing uptake and for intracellular survival. However, based on our data, genes critical for both phenomena are affected by mammalian temperature indicating that this cue is an important signal for multiple regulatory networks in <italic>Francisella</italic>. The uptake defect we have shown with the <italic>deoB </italic>mutant in both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells has not been described previously.</p><p>In our system, DeoB may have a direct or indirect role in the uptake of <italic>Francisella</italic>. DeoB may influence the LPS structure of <italic>Francisella</italic>, secondarily improving interactions with host cell receptors. Importantly, complement receptors and mannose receptors are crucial for optimal <italic>Francisella </italic>phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. This model is consistent with the fact that <italic>deoB </italic>is induced at 37&#x000b0;C and the finding that <italic>Francisella </italic>LPS structure is different at lower temperature versus mammalian temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Alternatively, DeoB may directly promote <italic>Francisella </italic>entry into host cells as this protein may have an additional function aside from being a phosphopentomutase. Another possibility is that mutation of metabolic genes in pathogenic bacteria can yield pleiotropic effects, resulting in defects in virulence mechanisms, including invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Further investigation is necessary to determine the precise mechanism of <italic>Francisella </italic>DeoB in host cell entry.</p><p>The data presented here suggest that some genes important for <italic>Francisella </italic>during infection are induced by mammalian temperature. Although we showed by Q-PCR that <italic>pdpC </italic>transcripts were induced at 37&#x000b0;C, none of the other loci in the FPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] were up-regulated at mammalian body temperature. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that IglC protein levels were not induced by a shift from 37&#x000b0;C to 42&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Because many of the loci in the FPI are essential for intra-amoeba growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], which would occur at lower, ambient temperatures, it seems logical that these genes are not regulated by temperature. Therefore, the virulence associated-genes induced by mammalian temperature that we have identified are on a separate regulon than most of the genes of the FPI. This suggests <italic>Francisella </italic>possesses an intricate regulatory circuit to maximize its success in diverse environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS undergoes significant gene expression changes in response to mammalian temperature. This temperature shift is important for the regulation of pathogenesis. Our study characterizes a previously underappreciated environmental cue that regulates the expression of <italic>F. tularensis </italic>genes associated with virulence in other studies. Importantly, the collection of temperature-regulated genes also defines a rich set of novel candidate virulence determinants, including <italic>tivA </italic>(FTL_1581). Detailed investigation of <italic>tivA </italic>and <italic>deoB </italic>(FTL_1664) revealed unknown or unrecognized roles of these genes in intracellular survival and entry into mammalian cells, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>Bacterial strains used in this study can be found in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. All broth cultures were grown with agitation (250 rpm). For general cultivation of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, bacteria were grown at 37&#x000b0;C on LB agar plates, or in LB broth. <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS, a model organism for tularaemia, was used in this study. For <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS strains, frozen stock cultures were streaked onto chocolate II agar plates and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 2&#x02013;4 days. These bacteria were subsequently used to inoculate broth cultures. For experiments assessing the effect of temperature on transcript levels, Chamberlain's chemically defined broth medium (CDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] was inoculated with LVS and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C overnight. This start-up culture was used to inoculate fresh CDM (2 ml start-up culture into 25 ml fresh broth) and incubated at 26&#x000b0;C for 24 h. Following this incubation, the optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of this culture was recorded and RNA was extracted. For the temperature shift, 5 ml of the same culture was diluted into 25 ml fresh CDM and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C until attaining an OD<sub>600 </sub>comparable to the 26&#x000b0;C culture (typically ~6 h). When the 37&#x000b0;C culture reached the desired OD<sub>600</sub>, RNA was harvested. This strategy of growing bacteria to comparable OD<sub>600 </sub>prior to RNA extraction was similar to a previous study assessing global temperature regulation in Group A <italic>Streptococcus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and mitigates the effects of growth phase on the subsequent analysis.</p><p>For macrophage and chicken embryo infections, LVS strains were grown in TSBc (trypticase soy broth [Becton, Dickinson and Company] supplemented with 0.1% L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate) at 37&#x000b0;C while shaking at 250 rpm. When required, antibiotics were added to the media at the following concentrations: ampicillin at 150 &#x003bc;g/ml for <italic>E. coli</italic>; kanamycin at 35 &#x003bc;g/ml for <italic>E. coli </italic>and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml for <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS; chloramphenicol at 5 &#x003bc;g/ml for <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS; polymixin at 100 &#x003bc;g/ml; and hygromycin at 200 &#x003bc;g/ml.</p><p>The rationale for using CDM for the transcriptional analysis, while TSBc was used for all other experiments is two-fold. Using CDM for general cultivation of LVS is not practical because CDM is an aqueous mixture of 22 nutrients, some of which do not have a long shelf-life. Secondly, CDM was selected for transcriptional analyses to benefit future studies to analyze synergistic effects of temperature and media components.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction</title><p>Immediately upon removal from the shaking incubator, six ml of broth culture were mixed with 18 ml TriReagent LS (Molecular Research Center).

RNA was precipitated from this aqueous layer with isopropanol, followed by centrifugation. Pelleted material was washed in 80% ethanol and resuspended in nuclease-free water. This RNA-containing mixture was treated with DNase (Turbo DNA-<italic>free</italic>, Ambion), and then precipitated using ammonium acetate and ethanol.

Individual genes from LVS, SchuS4, and OSU18 were spotted in duplicate on this array, whereas genes from the other strains and plasmids were printed as single copies. cDNA was synthesized from RNA by reactions using random hexamers (Invitrogen) and MMLV (Agilent). The cDNA target was labelled with Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated dUTP according to manufacturer's protocol (AF555-aha-dUTP; Invitrogen). Labelling reactions were incubated at 40&#x000b0;C for 3 hours. After cDNA synthesis, RNA was hydrolyzed with with NaOH and EDTA, and subsequently, the pH was neutralized with an equivalent volume of HCl.

This online software package was used for minimum mean ratio array normalization followed by log<sub>2 </sub>transformation. Data were grouped into two categories, cultivated at 26&#x000b0;C and shifted to 37&#x000b0;C, and analyzed for significance with the J5 statistical test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The J5 metric was designed for data sets composed of limited replicates, thereby reducing the chance of generating false positives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

These reactions were carried out on a BioRad IQ5 real time machine. The bacterial 50S ribosomal protein L24 (FTL_0247) was used as an internal reference, as it was observed to have no change in expression following a shift to 37&#x000b0;C according to the microarray analysis (data not shown).

The disruption plasmids, pMQ131hyg1581d and pMQ131hyg1664d were constructed using the following procedures. First, the PvuI/SpeI fragment of pMP615 containing <italic>hyg </italic>under the control of the <italic>groEL </italic>promoter was subcloned into pMQ131 (R. Shanks and G. O'Toole, unpublished data) that had been digested with PvuI/XbaI which produced pMQ131hyg. The internal 560 base pairs of FTL_1581 were amplified by PCR using the primers 1581_560F and 1581_560R and this amplicon was initially TA cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). The KpnI/BamHI fragment of this construct containing the internal portion of FTL_1581 was subcloned into pMQ131hyg that had been digested with these same enzymes, which produced pMQ131hyg1581d. Similarly, the internal 900 base pairs of FTL_1664 were amplified by PCR using the primers 1664_900F and 1664_900R and this amplicon was initially TA-cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). Subsequently, this fragment internal to FLT_1664 was subcloned (KpnI/BamHI) into pMQ131hyg, producing the plasmid pMQ131hyg1664d.</p><p>The FTL_1581 complementing plasmid (pFTL_1581) was constructed using the following procedures. The primers 1581_clone_up and 1581_clone_down were used to amplify 600 base pairs upstream, the entire FTL_1581 open reading frame, and 100 base pairs downstream of this gene by PCR. This amplicon encompassed the predicted native FTL_1581 promoter, this gene's coding region, as well as the predicted transcriptional stop (data not shown). Initially, this amplicon was TA-cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). The SacI/SacII fragment of this construct containing FTL_1581 was subsequently subcloned into pMQ2 (R. Shanks and G.

This yielded pFTL_1581.</p><p>The FTL_1664 (<italic>deoB</italic>) complementing plasmid (pFTL_1664) was constructed using the following procedures. Initially, the Kan<sup>R </sup>gene from pFNLTP8 was deleted using an inverse PCR strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The primers F8AgeI and F8XhoI were used to amplify pFNLTP8.

The <italic>cat194 </italic>gene was amplified by PCR using the primers XhoICAT and AgeICAT with pMQ2 as a template, and this amplicon was TA-cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). The Age I/XhoI fragment of this construct that encoded the <italic>cat194 </italic>gene was subcloned into pF8AX using these same enzymes producing pF8CAT. 1664_clone_up and 1664_clone_down were used to amplify 600 base pairs upstream, the entire FTL_1664 open reading frame, and 100 base pairs downstream of this gene by PCR. This amplicon encompassed the predicted native FTL_1664 promoter, this gene's coding region, as well as the predicted transcriptional stop (data not shown).

A homologous recombination between the LVS chromosomal copy of FTL_1581 and the internal FTL_1581 fragment in pMQ131hyg1581d would disrupt the coding sequence of 38 amino acids at the C-terminus. Also, homologous recombination between chromosomal FTL_1664 and pMQ131hyg1664d would disrupt coding sequence for the C-terminal 56 amino acids of the encoded protein. Disruption constructs (either pMQ131hyg1664d or pMQ131hyg1581d) were mobilized into <italic>F. tularensis </italic>LVS by triparental mating. Mating mixes were composed of LVS (10<sup>9 </sup>CFU), <italic>E. coli</italic>/pRK2013 (10<sup>7 </sup>CFU), and either <italic>E. coli</italic>/pMQ131hyg1664d or <italic>E. coli</italic>/pMQ131hyg1581d (10<sup>7 </sup>CFU). Similarly to the previously described <italic>Francisella </italic>conjugation methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], the mating mixture here was plated on LB agar plates, and incubated at room temperature for 18 hours. Cells were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and spread onto chocolate II agar plates containing polymyxin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) and hygromycin. Hygromycin-resistant colonies were screened by PCR using primers specific for either FTL_1581 or FTL_1664 and the vector-portion of pMQ131hyg1581d or pMQ131hyg1664d.

Whiteleghorn chicken eggs (fertilized, specific pathogen free) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, North Franklin, CT, USA. Eggs were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with gentle rocking and humidity for one week prior to infection. Following the initial 7 day incubation, those without a live embryo were discarded. For infections, the surface of the egg shell was sterilized with 70% ethanol. The egg shell membrane was exposed and removed after introducing a small hole in the shell. Bacteria suspended in PBS (100 &#x003bc;l) were then injected beneath the chorioallantoic membrane. The hole in the egg shell was covered with transparent tape and subsequently eggs were incubated as previously described. On a daily basis, eggs were candled to assess viability for 6 days. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], embryos that expired within 24 h of the infection were presumed to have experienced lethal trauma during inoculation, and were removed from the experiment. Survival differences in chicken embryo infections were analyzed with the log rank test in GraphPad Prism 5.</p><p>Competition studies in the chicken embryo infection model were conducted similar to the single infections described above. Here chicken embryos were infected with a mixture of LVS and 1581d (1:1 based on OD<sub>600</sub>, ~10<sup>5 </sup>total bacteria). Actual input (6.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>total bacteria) was determined by diluting the inoculum followed by plating to enumerate viable bacteria. Three infected, viable eggs were sacrificed at 1, 2, and 3 days (9 total eggs) post infection. Egg contents were homogenized with an OMNI tissue homogenizer, and serial dilutions of the homogenates were plated on chocolate II agar plates with or without antibiotic. The total number of 1581d (plates with antibiotic) was subtracted from the number of total bacteria (plates without antibiotic) to determine the amount of viable wild-type LVS. Competition ratios (1581d: LVS) were normalized to the input to account for small differences in the inocula, as has been done previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].

Buffy coats from blood donations (Central Blood Bank, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) served as the source of monocytes. Monocytes were purified using Ficoll gradients (Amersham Biosciences) to isolate PBMCs, Optiprep gradients (Axis-Shield) to enrich for monocytes, and panning on plastic to further purify monocytes (final purity &#x0003e;95% based on microscopy). Cells were cultured in 60 mm culture dishes for 7 days at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in 7 ml of DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FCS (Invitrogen), 10% human serum (Gemini Biosciences), 25 mM HEPES (Gibco), and 1% Glutamax (Invitrogen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Macrophages were detached from the culture dish on day 7 using a lidocaine/EDTA solution (5 mM EDTA and 4 mg/ml lidocaine in PBS pH 7.2). For monocyte-derived dendritic cells, human monocytes were seeded at a density of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml in 24 well plates (Costar) in complete RPMI [10% FCS, 25 mM HEPES, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% Glutamax and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (all from Gibco)] supplemented with 1000 U/ml GM-CSF and 1000 U/ml IL-4 (both from eBioscience) and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. On day 3 of culture, 10% of the media was replaced with fresh complete RPMI supplemented with GM-CSF and IL-4 and non-adherent cells were harvested at day 5. For <italic>in vitro </italic>infections, all primary cells were washed and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 1% human serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1% Glutamax and then plated onto Primaria-coated 96-well culture dishes (Becton, Dickinson and Company) at a density of 5.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells per well.</p><p>Murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells (ATCC number TIB-71) were routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1% Glutamax with 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Two days prior to infection, the medium for these cells was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% human serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1% Glutamax, and infections were carried out using this same medium.</p><p>HEK-293 cells (ATCC number CRL-1573), a non-phagocytic cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1% Glutamax with 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin. One day prior to infection, HEK-293 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells per well in this same medium devoid of antibiotic and infections were carried out in this same medium.</p><p>For infection experiments, bacterial cultures were adjusted to an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 0.3 (approximately 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9 </sup>CFU/ml) and diluted to attain a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 500, which typically yields infection rate &#x0003e;80% after a 2 hour co-incubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Alternatively, macrophages were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% human serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1% Glutamax and transferred to culture dishes before infection. Prior to administration of the bacteria onto the macrophages, the <italic>F. tularensis </italic>strains were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 20 min in this same medium. Macrophages were infected with bacteria that had been diluted to an MOI of 40. This alternative infection protocol used a lower MOI because it took advantage of the complement-mediated uptake of <italic>F. tularensis </italic>into macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Comparable results were obtained regardless of which infection protocol was used. Actual MOIs were measured by plating serial dilutions of inocula on chocolate II agar plates.</p><p>For intracellular CFU enumeration, mammalian cells were exposed to the initial bacterial load for 2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and then incubated with gentamicin (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 20 min to kill extracellular bacteria. The cells were washed with warm Hank's balanced salt solution and then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for another 22&#x02013;48 h with fresh culture media. At the indicated time-points post-infection, mammalian cells were lysed with 0.02% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The 2 hour time point was used to determine entry similarly to a prior study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Serial dilutions of the lysates were plated on chocolate II agar plates for enumeration of viable bacteria. CFU counts were converted to log<sub>10 </sub>values and analyzed by the Student's t-Test to determine statistical differences. For uptake analysis, CFU were normalized to actual MOI to account for minor variations in the density of inocula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>For fluorescence microscopy, bacteria were stained with 10 &#x003bc;M Syto 9 (Invitrogen) for 15 min and washed three times with PBS prior to infection. Here, stained cells were diluted in DMEM supplemented with 10% human serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1% Glutamax, and were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 20 min. These bacteria were used to inoculate RAW 264.7 in this same medium at an MOI of 10.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JH wrote the manuscript, constructed plasmids and mutants, conducted the experiments, envisioned and designed the study.
