By transient transfection and in vitro protein-DNA binding assays we have delineated, within 4.7 kb of 5' flanking sequence, the M promoter proper and an enhancer located between -1615 and -1809. This enhancer stimulated up to 12-fold the activity of the promoter in the context of an intact 5' flanking sequence and close to 900-fold the activity of the minimal (+41 to -40) M promoter cloned directly downstream from it. A functional dissection of the enhancer by site-directed mutagenesis and use of oligonucleotides suggested that its activity involves the cooperative effect of six binding sites for trans-acting factors clustered within 150 bp. These sites contain either an EF-1A/E4TF1 motif (also known to bind the ets oncogene product) or a Sp1 motif, or both. The activity of the enhancer could be demonstrated in L6 myoblasts and myocytes and in FTO2B hepatoma cells. When left within the intact 5' flanking sequence, however, enhancer activity was inhibited upon differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0037-a" xlink:role="3577"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0039-a" xlink:role="3579"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0040-a" xlink:role="3580"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0041-a" xlink:role="3581"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3575"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3576"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3577"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3578"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3579"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3580"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3581"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3582"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3583"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
