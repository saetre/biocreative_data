Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indexing biomarker differences could help distinguish causal from confounded associations because of their random allocation prior to disease. We examined the association of 948 SNPs in 122 candidate genes with 12 CHD-associated phenotypes in 2775 middle aged men (a genic scan). Of these, 140 SNPs indexed differences in HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, factor VII, apolipoproteins AI and B, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, homocysteine or folate, some with large effect sizes and highly significant <italic>P</italic>-values (e.g. 2.15 standard deviations at <italic>P</italic> = 9.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;140</sup> for <italic>F7</italic> rs6046 and FVII levels). Top ranking SNPs were then tested for association with additional biomarkers correlated with the index phenotype (phenome scan). Several SNPs (e.g. in <italic>APOE</italic>, <italic>CETP</italic>, <italic>LPL</italic>, <italic>APOB</italic> and <italic>LDLR</italic>) influenced multiple phenotypes, while others (e.g. in <italic>F7</italic>, <italic>CRP</italic> and <italic>FBB</italic>) showed restricted association to the index marker. SNPs influencing six blood proteins were used to evaluate the nature of the associations between correlated blood proteins utilizing Mendelian randomization. Multiple SNPs were associated with CHD-related quantitative traits, with some associations restricted to a single marker and others exerting a wider genetic &#x02018;footprint&#x02019;. SNPs indexing biomarkers provide new tools for investigating biological relationships and causal links with disease. Broader and deeper integrated analyses, linking genomic with transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis, as well as clinical events could, in principle, better delineate CHD causing pathways amenable to treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Like many common disorders, coronary heart disease (CHD) results from a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors, complicating the identification of the causal pathways, and delaying the development of new treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C1">1</xref>). By 1981, over 200 phenotypic and other differences had been shown in those with, or at higher risk of CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C2">2</xref>). Alterations in circulating blood phenotypes (also referred to as biomarkers) such as lipid and lipoprotein particles, proteins involved in inflammation and coagulation, as well as metabolites and markers of oxidant stress, tend to cluster among those at higher risk, making it difficult to ascertain the nature and direction of biological relationships between biomarkers, and the independent effect of any one biomarker on CHD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C3">3</xref>). These associations may be causal, but alternatively could arise because they mark subclinical disease (reverse causation), other causal factors (confounding) or some combination of the two. Thus far it has only been possible to establish unequivocally a causal role in CHD for one blood phenotype (LDL-cholesterol). This was achieved in large part by developing the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) class of drugs that reduce blood level of LDL-cholesterol and testing their effects in randomized trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C4">4</xref>). However, the expense and risk associated with the development of the many selective drugs needed to target the vast array of blood phenotypes implicated in CHD, currently precludes a comprehensive and systematic approach to understanding their causal relevance and limits translation of the basic science and epidemiological findings into new treatments.</p><p>Many (if not all) of the circulating biomarkers associated with CHD behave as heritable quantitative traits, and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing their variance are now being identified both by candidate gene and genome wide studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C8">8</xref>). Unlike the associations between biomarkers, or the association of biomarkers with CHD risk, genetic associations should be protected from reverse causation because genotype is an invariant characteristic, such that there is a unidirectional flow of information from common genome variation to mRNA to protein to complex phenotype and disease. Moreover, since genotype is determined at random at conception, for SNPs affecting CHD risk, intermediate phenotypes (such as blood markers), residing off the causal pathway from SNP to disease, should be balanced evenly among the different genotypic groups, as they are in a randomized clinical trial, whereas biomarkers that mediate the effect of genomic variation on disease risks should differ by genotype. We hypothesized that SNPs, which affect the variance in biomarkers linked to CHD, could be used as unbiased tools with which to understand their causal relevance and to explore the extent to which correlation between multiple CHD-associated phenotypes are affected by confounding. This principle of Mendelian randomization has been applied to assess the causal role of individual biomarkers with CHD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C10">10</xref>). Here we applied Mendelian randomization to help distinguish causal from confounded links between multiple biomarkers.</p><p>Formerly, association studies in the cardiovascular genetics field typed SNPs in a single gene or locus of interest. More recently, genome wide association studies (GWAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C7">7</xref>) have extended the breadth of genetic information, but the focus of these studies has been on a single continuous trait or disease outcome, limiting the ability to address inter-relationships among traits. We utilized a genotyping strategy that exploits the recent finding that gene variants regulating expression commonly reside in the vicinity of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C13">13</xref>), to build a panel of SNPs influencing variance in one or more CHD-related biomarkers to investigate the nature of the association between markers.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Between-phenotype correlations and associations with CHD risk</title><p>In the prospective Northwick Park Heart Study II of 3102 initially healthy men followed prospectively for a median of 13.6 years, there were 296 definite fatal or non-fatal CHD events. Measures of 14 intermediate phenotypes were available, six with annual repeat measures (on six occasions) and single measures for the remaining eight (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp159/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>). To delineate the potential for confounding in the associations of blood markers and other phenotypes with CHD, we assessed between-phenotype correlations. Men who developed a CHD event on follow-up exhibited multiple phenotypes which distinguished them from those who remained disease free, and these differences were highly inter-correlated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP159F1">1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp159/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>).

Thus, a 2 SD difference in factor VII is associated with a standardized mean difference in apoB, CRP and fibrinogen of 0.41, 0.31 and 0.25, respectively. Individuals homozygous for the variant allele rs6046 exhibited a 2.15 SD higher blood factor VII level which is approximately equivalent to the difference in levels between the top and bottom tertile of the Factor VII distribution. However, the point estimate of the effect of rs6046 on levels of apoB and fibrinogen was null and therefore discordant from that expected from the directly observed association of factor VII with these phenotypes if this was a causal link. The point estimate of the association of rs6046 with CRP was close to that expected from a causal association, but the confidence limits spanned the null. Thus, the simplest explanation of these findings is that the factor VII is unlikely to cause an alteration in apoB or fibrinogen, but a causal effect on CRP is possible and would require a larger sample to confirm or refute reliably. For the majority of other pairwise comparisons, the point estimates of the genetic effect were either null or directionally opposite from that expected from a causal link, though because of wide confidence limits, larger studies would be required to provide definitive evidence.</p><p>The relationship between minor allele frequency and standardized effect size for 80% statistical power is plotted in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp159/DC1">Supplementary Material, Figure S3</ext-link>.

We used a gene-centric approach based on genes with a high prior probability of association with the traits of interest in NPHSII. This proved to be an efficient strategy providing a high yield of SNP-biomarker associations even at conservative levels of statistical significance and a stringent FDR threshold, with134 SNP-associations out of the 948 SNPs ( for which genotype was available), distributed among &#x0223c;36 genes. These findings are in keeping with emerging data from GWAS of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C11">11</xref>), blood proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C8">8</xref>), lipid and other non-protein traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C6">6</xref>) and metabolic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C21">21</xref>). Together these provide strong evidence that regulatory SNPs are found commonly in the vicinity of genes and validate a gene-centric approach to identify genotypes influencing multiple blood traits linked to CHD and other complex disorders. The scope and breadth of gene-centric studies is likely to be extended by the emergence of comprehensive disease-specific gene-centric custom SNP arrays such as the ITMAT/BROAD/CARE (IBC) &#x02018;cardio-metabolic chip&#x02019; that covers around 2100 genes from lipid, inflammation, coagulation, oxidants stress, matrix and other pathways linked to CHD (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://bioinf.itmat.upenn.edu/cvdsnp/index.php">http://bioinf.itmat.upenn.edu/cvdsnp/index.php</uri>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C22">22</xref>).</p><p>Although the genotyping strategy was focused on candidate genes, some novel associations also emerged, e.g. associations of SNPs in <italic>APOE</italic> with Lp-PLA2 activity.

Although <italic>APOE-C1-C2-C4</italic> SNPs also influence the level of circulating LDL, and theoretically might therefore influence Lp-PLA2 activity simply through an effect on the concentration of this particle, other SNPs that affected LDL-cholesterol concentration (e.g. <italic>APOB</italic>, and <italic>LDLR</italic>) were not associated with Lp-PLA2 activity, suggesting a more direct link between apoE and Lp-PLA2 that is worthy of further investigation.</p><p>Though 16 of the genetic associations we identified have been corroborated by both candidate gene studies and GWAS, and can be considered robust, the relevance and utility of such associations has been debated given that the proportion of the total variance in a continuous trait explained by common alleles can be small (commonly &#x0003c;5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C9">9</xref>). However, our study suggests that interpretations based on this metric alone may provide an incomplete picture. For many SNPs whose contribution to the variance in a phenotype was small, we found evidence of a substantial effect size when expressed in terms of the standardized mean difference in biomarker level between homozygous subjects. We noted many examples of differences over 0.5 SD, and several of over 1 SD for variants influencing triglycerides, apoB, Lp-PLA2 and factor VII. These would be considered very substantial effects for a drug designed to modify the level of one of these biomarkers. For example, standard doses of statin drugs in clinical use reduce LDL-cholesterol by about 1 SD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C4">4</xref>). However, even SNPs with small effect could be important, because therapies that might arise from the genetic findings could be designed to have much more potent effects than the natural genetic variation. For example, variants in <italic>HMGCR</italic> that encodes the target enzyme for cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, affect LDL-cholesterol but did not emerge among the top-ranking SNPs in recent GWAS for CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C23">23</xref>), although an association of these SNPs with CHD risk has been subsequently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C24">24</xref>).</p><p>We also noted a trend for less common genetic variants to exert larger effects when expressed in terms of the standardized mean difference but not in terms of the variance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP159F3">3</xref>). This finding is consistent with the emerging paradigm of an inverse association between allele frequency and penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Phenome scans and use of SNPs as tools to distinguish causal from confounded links between biomarkers</title><p>It has been common for genome wide and candidate gene association studies to focus on SNP associations with a single trait or disease outcome, but the pathway from disease-relevant SNP to disease potentially involves multiple phenotypic perturbations both in series and in parallel. It is therefore of interest not only to determine the full spectrum of SNPs affecting a single trait or outcome, but also the range of phenotypes altered by single SNP or gene. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C26">26</xref>). We noted several genes and SNPs with effects on multiple circulating biomarkers, suggesting that some genes may have a broad footprint of effects on the proteome and metabolome. This is often referred to as pleiotropy but it may be important to distinguish between the multiplicity of effects arising from the generation of more than one protein product as a result of alternative splicing of an mRNA transcript of a gene, from the those arising from the broad ranging downstream effects of a single protein product (such as an enzyme or transporter) involved in lipid and lipoprotein pathways (e.g. apoE or cholesteryl ester transfer protein), which is the more likely explanation for the range of SNP effects observed in the present study.</p><p>Though some SNPs exerted a broad footprint of phenotypic effects, for others (e.g. in <italic>F7</italic> and <italic>FIB</italic>), there was a more tightly restricted association of SNPs in the encoding gene with the cognate protein but no other trait, despite the extensive directly observed correlations between the protein itself and other markers. This contrast between the range of genotypic and phenotypic associations is likely to arise from the randomized assignment of alleles, and the non-randomized (clustered) association of phenotypes (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP159F1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C28">28</xref>). This renders SNPs in certain pQTGs particularly well suited as proxies (instruments) with which to investigate the causal relevance for CHD of the proteins they encode because, in contrast to the proteins themselves, the genetic associations should not be prone to confounding or reverse causation bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C31">31</xref>).</p><p>For example, CRP is strongly correlated with fibrinogen (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.43; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP159F1">1</xref>). This association could arise because of a causal relationship (in either direction) or because of a common association of both these biomarkers with another factor. This makes it difficult to assess whether CRP and fibrinogen lie on the same causal pathway to CHD, and whether it is legitimate to make statistical adjustment for fibrinogen in the many observational associations of CRP with CHD (and vice versa). Statistical adjustment, which is the orthodox approach to dealing with confounding in observational epidemiology, would be legitimate only if the association of CRP with CHD was not mediated (even in part) by an elevation in the level of fibrinogen. The absence of an association of <italic>CRP</italic> SNPs with fibrinogen level (or <italic>FIBA-B-G</italic> with CRP level) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP159F4">4</xref>I), which is consistent with the findings from other studies of these variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C32">32</xref>) indicates that CRP and fibrinogen do not exhibit a direct causal association with one another and that statistical adjustment is appropriate in observational studies of these biomarkers with CHD.</p><p>Whereas <italic>cis</italic>-acting SNPs in the encoding gene offer the most specific genetic instrument with which to assess the causal role of a protein in CHD, there may not be a single best instrument for a non-protein trait such as the level of HDL- or LDL-cholesterol that are influenced by a number of different genes encoding enzymes and transporters. We noted SNPs from a range of genes influencing the same lipid trait (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp159/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S2</ext-link>). Validation of the use of multiple SNPs for such causal analysis for non-protein traits is illustrated using the example of LDL-cholesterol, the only blood phenotype for which a causal role in CHD has already been firmly established.</p><p>Rare variants in <italic>LDLR</italic>, <italic>APOB</italic> and gain-of-function mutations in <italic>PCSK9</italic> result in extreme elevations in LDL-cholesterol, as in Familial Hypercholesterolemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C33">33</xref>), while <italic>PCSK9</italic> loss-of-function variants are associated with very low LDL-cholesterol levels and are protective of CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C34">34</xref>). In addition, common variants of <italic>APOE</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C16">16</xref>), <italic>PSRC1/ CELSR/ SORT1, LDLR</italic> and <italic>PCSK9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C35">35</xref>), including some tagged by SNPs in the current study that cause more modest changes in LDL-cholesterol, have also been associated with alterations in risk of CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C35">35</xref>), with the genetic effects on disease risk directionally concordant and in proportion to the size of the effect on LDL-cholesterol.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Implications of the current findings for future work</title><p>The principles applied in the current study could be extended to incorporate rare SNPs or copy number variants, or regulatory SNPs remote from genes using denser new generation GWAS platforms. The phenotypes evaluated could be extended both proximally to include mRNA expression and more distally to include more complex phenotypes linked to CHD such as carotid-intima media thickness or measures of coronary artery calcification. The breadth of the approach could also be extended laterally at the level of protein and non-protein phenotypes using proteomic and metabolomics, respectively. Our study highlights the importance of well-phenotyped population samples and emphasizes the requirement for large sample sizes. However, whether this approach will aid in developing causal networks and genotype: phenotype maps, as outlined recently by Rockman, remains to be seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C36">36</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate how integrating information on genotype and blood phenotypes in humans can be used to construct association networks with a high-level of credibility, due to the particular properties of genetic variants, which are randomly allocated and unmodifiable by disease process, features which are not shared by any other natural biological exposure (e.g. mRNA levels or protein levels) Our study emphasizes the potential translational application emerging from the recent genomic advances.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study design and phenotypic measures</title><p>The Northwick Park Heart Study II (NPHSII) is a prospective study of 3012 healthy middle-aged men aged 50&#x02013;64 years at recruitment, sampled from nine UK general practices between 1989 and 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP159C37">37</xref>).
