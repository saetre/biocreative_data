A key signalling molecule produced in guard cells in response to plant hormones, light, carbon dioxide and pathogen-derived signals is hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The mechanisms by which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> integrates multiple signals via specific signalling pathways leading to stomatal closure is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Here, we identify a pathway by which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, derived from endogenous and environmental stimuli, is sensed and transduced to effect stomatal closure. Histidine kinases (HK) are part of two-component signal transduction systems that act to integrate environmental stimuli into a cellular response via a phosphotransfer relay mechanism. There is little known about the function of the HK AHK5 in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana.</italic> Here we report that in addition to the predicted cytoplasmic localisation of this protein, AHK5 also appears to co-localise to the plasma membrane. Although <italic>AHK5</italic> is expressed at low levels in guard cells, we identify a unique role for AHK5 in stomatal signalling. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants lacking AHK5 show reduced stomatal closure in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is reversed by complementation with the wild type gene. Over-expression of AHK5 results in constitutively less stomatal closure. Abiotic stimuli that generate endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, such as darkness, nitric oxide and the phytohormone ethylene, also show reduced stomatal closure in the <italic>ahk5</italic> mutants. However, ABA caused closure, dark adaptation induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced NO synthesis in mutants. Treatment with the bacterial pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flagellin, but not elf peptide, also exhibited reduced stomatal closure and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in <italic>ahk5</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>Our findings identify an integral signalling function for AHK5 that acts to integrate multiple signals via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> homeostasis and is independent of ABA signalling in guard cells.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants are constantly exposed to a large multitude of environmental stimuli, and under adverse conditions, are mostly able to survive due to their ability to sense and transduce these signals into cellular and physiological responses. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a form of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by plants via several mechanisms, which include metabolic processes such as respiration and photosynthesis as well as reactions to environmental stimuli such as water deficit, high and low temperature, pollutants, UV-B light and pathogen challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Apel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. It is now well accepted that controlled or regulated production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is beneficial to the plant. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts as a signal and/or second messenger enabling the plant to activate physiological processes resulting in protection from and adaptation to environmental stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Neill1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> regulates a number of molecular and cellular processes in plants ranging from gene expression, programmed cell death, cell division, elongation growth, and stomatal closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Desikan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The molecular mechanisms by which each of these processes occurs through H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signalling have not been fully clarified. Recently, several targets for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, including protein kinases and phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Desikan2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Gupta1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In relation to stomatal closure and redox signalling, the ABI1 and ABI2 members of the protein phosphatase 2C family are redox regulated in response to ABA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Meinhard1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Meinhard2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the MAP kinase MPK3 was shown recently to be essential for both ABA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-inhibition of stomatal opening in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Gudesblat1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The protein kinase OST1 regulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in guard cells through signalling pathways requiring the ROS-producing NADPH oxidase subfamily of proteins (namely, AtRBOHD and AtRBOHF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Mustilli1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Kwak1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>). Thus, reversible protein phosphorylation appears to be a key mechanism by which cellular responses to multiple stimuli are regulated via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in guard cells and other cell types.</p><p>An alternative mechanism by which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts on proteins is by oxidation of Cys residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Cooper1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation of &#x02013;SH groups on Cys residues in proteins causes either disulfide bond formation or the formation of sulfenic acid groups. The latter can be sequentially oxidised to sulfinic and sulfonic acid groups at higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Reversal of oxidation occurs under reducing conditions, for example, by reduced glutathione or thioredoxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Cooper1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Until recently, there was little evidence that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> action on Cys residues is responsible for defined physiological responses. In recent work, we have shown that one member of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hybrid histidine kinase (HK) family, the ethylene receptor ETR1, is a potential target for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during stomatal closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Desikan4">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. ETR1 is required for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated stomatal closure, with the Cys65 residue of ETR1 being essential. Intriguingly the HK domain of ETR1 was not required for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Desikan4">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In recent developments we have also shown that ETR1 has a dual function in guard cells, that of perceiving ethylene as well as acting as a target for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, thereby mediating downstream signalling processes to initiate stomatal closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Desikan5">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The hybrid HK family of receptor proteins are part of the two-component signal perception and transduction system in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Grefen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Perception of a signal by a hybrid HK leads to autophosphorylation of a His residue in the HK domain, followed by a phosphotransfer reaction to an Asp residue on its receiver domain. Subsequently, a relay of the phosphoryl residue occurs to a His residue on a histidine phosphotransfer protein (HP) followed by phosphorylation of an Asp residue on a response regulator (RR) protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Hwang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Representative HK family members in plants are the cytokinin and ethylene receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Grefen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the plant's two-component signalling network appears to contribute to several other signal response pathways. For instance, recent work has demonstrated functional cross-talk between cytokinin and light (phytochrome B) signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Sweere1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-MiraRodado1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. These overlaps in signalling processes induced by multiple stimuli suggest that two-component proteins are key sensors and transducers of various environmental and endogenous signals.</p><p>One mechanism by which different signalling processes and pathways may be integrated is <italic>via</italic> common second messenger molecules. ROS such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are ideal candidates for such messenger molecules acting as focal points for cross-talk between a wide array of signalling cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Desikan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This is evidenced by a large overlap in the expression of genes that are regulated by ROS on the one hand and by environmental stimuli on the other. For example, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-regulated genes are also regulated by drought, cold, UV-B light and pathogen attack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Desikan6">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Kilian1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> as well as by ABA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Wang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Clearly, there exist multiple targets for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to mediate its effects in specific cells and tissues. Functional overlap is also likely to exist between these pathways, with certain targets acting as integrators of multiple stimuli.</p><p>In an attempt to identify further targets for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signalling in guard cells, the function of a least-characterised member of the HK family in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, namely AHK5, was investigated. AHK5 is predicted to be the only cytoplasmic HK, with both a canonical HK domain and receiver domain, classifying it as a hybrid HK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Grefen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data here indicate that AHK5 also co-localises to the plasma membrane. Recent work has identified a function for AHK5 in counteracting the ethylene and ABA-regulated growth response in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Iwama1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. However its role in integrating signalling responses to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is not known.</p><p>Using a combination of molecular genetic, cell imaging, biochemical and physiological tools, we show that AHK5 is a key player in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> homeostasis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> guard cells in response to environmental and endogenous signals, including NO, ethylene, darkness and bacterial flagellin. Intriguingly, AHK5 does not appear to be involved in the ABA signalling pathway in stomata. Our data suggest a regulatory function of AHK5 that is essential for guard cell response to abiotic and biotic environmental stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Intracellular localisation and tissue-specific expression of AHK5</title><p>AHK5 is predicted to be the only cytoplasmic HK amongst the canonical HK class of proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Grefen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to confirm this, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> localisation studies using 35S promoter-driven GFP fusion constructs of <italic>AHK5</italic>. In transiently transformed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts and tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>) leaf cells the full-length fusion protein was expressed and was present in the cytoplasm, independent of whether the GFP tag was fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of AHK5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002491-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002491.s003">Data S1</xref>). To substantiate our cell biological results we also performed cell fractionation experiments with extracts from transiently transformed tobacco leaf cells expressing <italic>35S:GFP-AHK5</italic> or several GFP-marker protein fusion genes. Whereas the ER marker ERS1-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Grefen2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and the plasmalemma/endosome marker BRI1-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Geldner1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> were detected in the microsomal fraction and the cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic marker ARR4-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Sweere1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> in the soluble fraction, GFP-AHK5 was found in both fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002491-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). This intracellular distribution could be substantiated by recording the wavelength-specific intensity distribution of a cytoplasm-plasmalemma-cell wall section of neighbouring tobacco epidermal cells co-expressing GFP-AHK5 and the red fluorescent plasmalemma marker pm-rk-CD3-1007 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002491-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Nelson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>). Whereas pm-rk-CD3-1007 showed one distinct peak representing the two plasmalemmata of the adjacent cells, three peaks were observed for GFP-AHK5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002491-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). The medial GFP-AHK5 peak showed a perfect overlay with pm-rk-CD3-1007, whereas the other two peaks extended to the cytoplasmic sites of the adjacent cells. Our results therefore suggest that AHK5 is a HK that is localised both in the cytoplasm and at the plasmalemma of plant cells.</p><fig id="pone-0002491-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002491.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Subcellular localisation of AHK5 in plant cells.</title><p>(A) Confocal images of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts and tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>) leaf cells transiently transformed with a construct expressing <italic>P<sub>35S</sub>:GFP-AHK5</italic> cDNA.

Although of fundamental physiological and ecological relevance, little is known of the dark-induced signalling processes leading to stomatal closure.

However, the mechanism by which AHK5-dependent phosphorelay is linked to proteins such as ABI1, 2, GORK and AtMYB61 in the guard cell signalling network is not yet known.</p><p>AHK5 also appears to be essential for mediating flagellin- (flg22) induced stomatal closure in the Col-0 ecotype, again correlating with the TCSA data demonstrating inhibition of flg22-induced stomatal closure. Surprisingly, the AHK5-mediated response seems to be specific for flg22 because the mutants showed a wild type stomatal closure response to the PAMP elf26. This is unexpected because the signalling cascades of flg22 and elf26 overlap considerably in non-guard cell tissue in respect to ethylene and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, alkalinisation, activation of MAPKs and changes in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Felix1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Zipfel1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recent work by Melotto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Melotto1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> indicates that bacterial PAMPs such as flagellin induce stomatal closure in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Our data, therefore, position AHK5 in a signal transduction cascade specific to flagellin in guard cells. The exact mechanism by which AHK5 interacts with this pathway remains to be determined, but it is likely that the interaction occurs with the flg22 receptor FLS2. It is interesting to note that the expression of FLS2 is abundant in guard cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Robatzek1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that FLS2 is a plasmalemma-bound and AHK5 is likely to be located at the plasma membrane as well as the cytoplasm, one may speculate that both receptors could physically interact at the plasma membrane allowing AHK5 to perceive high local H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations induced by the flg22-activated FLS2/BAK1 receptor complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Chinchilla1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002491-Heese1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, AHK5 also appears to contribute to the flagellin-induced regulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in guard cells (see below for detailed discussion).
