Following cell thaw, NSs were expanded in suspension culture, and in each case were used between passages 5 and 7. Undifferentiated human NS cells (stage 1) were cultured and expanded in medium containing X-VIVO15 (Cambrex, Walkersville, Maryland, United States), N2 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States), 2 &#x003bc;g/ml heparin, 10 ng/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon, Temecula, California, United States), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), and 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-2 (R&#x00026;D Systems), and they were frozen after enzymatic dissociation.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR measures of insulin mRNA expression showed that exposure of cultures grown in 5 mM glucose at stage 3 to 17 mM glucose at stage 4 induced insulin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Growth of cells at stage 2 in 5 mM glucose followed by exposure in stages 3 and 4 to 17 mM glucose also resulted in insulin expression at stage 4, but at lower levels.

Thus, reduction of glucose in stage 2 growth medium followed by a later increase in glucose at stage 3 or 4 was essential for development of IPCs.

Nicotinamide, which can stimulate in vivo pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;, did not affect cell survival, but did increase insulin C-peptide expression approximately 1.5- to 2-fold (data not shown).

Expression of these markers suggests differentiation of some neural progenitor cells toward an endoderm-like fate. We were unable to detect expression of Pdx1 and FoxA3 using immunohistochemical methods in stage 4 IPCs, (data not shown).

Thus, the sequence of gene expression accompanying formation of IPCs from NSs was similar but not identical to that described for differentiating pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, and further molecular studies are required to determine the degree of endoderm-like differentiation of cells in IPCs.</p><p>We detected expression of insulin protein by immunohistochemistry in 90&#x00025; of stage 4 cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

In stage 4 cell clusters we did not consistently detect expression of glucagon (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g004">Figure 4</xref>L), pancreatic polypeptide, or somatostatin by immunohistochemistry. The absence of glucagon gene expression in our IPC cultures was further confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown). Thus, like in pancreatic islets, insulin was the principal hormone produced by IPCs. However, the composition of IPCs was distinct from that of pancreatic islets, and further studies are required to determine the basis for this difference.</p><p>To quantify insulin expression in IPCs, we used a human insulin C-peptide-specific ELISA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g004">Figure 4</xref>P).

C-peptide levels at stages 1&#x02013;3 were low or undetectable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g004">Figure 4</xref>P), consistent with the lack of immunostainable insulin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g002">Figure 2</xref>) in cells at these earlier stages. Similarly, in cultures maintained in 17 mM glucose during stages 1&#x02013;4 (&#x0201c;HHHH&#x0201d;), C-peptide levels were not detectable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g004">Figure 4</xref>P). In cell clusters exposed to 5 mM glucose in stages 2&#x02013;3 then switched to 17 mM glucose at stage 4 (&#x0201c;HLLH&#x0201d;), insulin C-peptide levels were 0.36 fmol per cluster, and the average number of C-peptide<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells per cluster was 200. Thus, we estimate 0.0018 fmol C-peptide per NS-derived IPC. A single &#x003b2;-cell contains approximately 0.6 fmol C-peptide and insulin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b40">40</xref>&#x0005d;, so we calculate that insulin C-peptide content in one stage 4 IPC is approximately 0.3&#x00025; of the level in isolated human &#x003b2;-cells. Collectively, these experiments confirm that IPCs transcribe and translate insulin, and rule out that insulin measured in IPCs is derived from medium, as shown in another system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>IPCs Are Glucose Responsive</title><p>Glucokinase and glucose transporters like Glut-2 are essential regulators of glucose responses in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, and expression of these regulators in stage 4 insulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g001">Figures 1</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g004">4</xref>M, and 4N) suggested that IPCs could sense and respond to glucose. To test whether IPCs respond appropriately to glucose stimulation, we measured insulin release in static batch in vitro assays. We found that IPC insulin release increased markedly following a step increase of glucose from 2.8 to 25 mM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g004">Figure 4</xref>Q). To examine whether IPCs are similarly responsive to glucose stimulation in vivo, we performed a series of IPC grafting experiments in immunocompromised recipient mice. Two weeks following engraftment (1,000 IPC-containing clusters/mouse), recipient mice and sham-transplanted controls were fasted overnight, and human C-peptide levels measured. Human C-peptide was undetectable in mouse sera prior to glucose challenge, or following glucose challenge of sham-transplanted controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g004">Figure 4</xref>R).

Thus, IPCs respond to glucose challenge in vivo by releasing insulin C-peptide.

While much attention has been focused on the promise of ES cells for tissue replacement, recent work suggests that neural stem cells, like ES cells, may have an unusually broad differentiation potential. For example, Gage and colleagues demonstrated the conversion of mouse neural stem cells to the endothelial lineage, indicating that plasticity is a bona fide property of cultured neural stem cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b42">42</xref>&#x0005d;. These results were also unexpected because endothelial cells and neuronal cells normally derive, respectively, from mesoderm and ectoderm, distinct embryonic germ layers. Here we show that human neural stem cells have a similarly broad differentiation potential, and that specific in vitro culture conditions can divert neural stem-derived cells from neural lineages toward a fate with endocrine and endodermal characteristics.</p><p>Our study shows that application of endogenous signals governing pancreas development to human neural progenitor cells can generate glucose-responsive IPCs. Systematic variation of the identity, concentration, and sequence of these signals led to discovery of methods culminating in IPC formation. However, there are limitations to our findings that should be noted. First, our molecular analysis of differentiating IPCs showed that they remain distinct from mature pancreatic islet &#x003b2;-cells; in other words, the insulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells derived by our methods are not mature &#x003b2;-cells. For example, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed that IPCs were enriched for a combination of gene products that approximate those expressed in developing pancreatic islet cells. However, the temporal sequence of expression of some of these products, like glucokinase, Glut-2, and Pdx1 does not precisely recapitulate that observed in the embryonic pancreas (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;), and transcription of other genes typically expressed in &#x003b2;-cells, like <italic>Nkx6.1,</italic> was not detected in later stage IPCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, the insulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells derived in this study are not bona fide &#x003b2;-cells. Further experimentation may elucidate the basis for these differences, revealing the extent of neural progenitor cell development toward an endocrine cell fate. Recent studies suggest that neural cells can be derived from adult pancreatic epithelium &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d;, adding to a growing body of data demonstrating numerous similarities in neural and pancreatic endocrine development (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b43">43</xref>&#x0005d;). In light of these similarities, we speculate that methods leading to the production of &#x003b2;-cell factors like Nkx6.1 in stage 4 clusters may enhance the &#x003b2;-cell-like qualities of neural-progenitor-derived insulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, and thereby permit differentiation of tissues that more closely resemble endoderm-derived islet cells. Second, our immunohistochemical analysis shows that stage 4 insulin-expressing cells do not express markers like Nestin, &#x003b2;-tubulin III, MAP2, or Olig2, suggesting that these insulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are non-neuronal, but we cannot formally rule out the alternate possibility that our methods produced neural cells capable of secreting insulin. Third, we have not demonstrated fully that the stimulus&#x02013;secretion coupling apparatus in IPCs is similar to that in pancreatic islets. While insulin release by IPCs produced here appears to be glucose-sensitive, both in vitro and in vivo, future work should elaborate whether IPC insulin is stored in dense-core secretory vesicles, and whether secretogogues or secretion potentiators other than glucose (like amino acids or sulfonylureas) stimulate insulin release by IPCs, like in pancreatic islets. Lastly, we have not ameliorated glucose regulation in diabetic animal models with the human IPCs described here. Serum levels of insulin C-peptide expression achieved following IPC transplantation in glucose-challenged mice were less than 1&#x00025; of normal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020103-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, we did not attempt IPC transplantations in overtly diabetic animals, since prior studies suggest that insulin production at 10&#x00025; of normal (or greater) may be required to improve glucose regulation in diabetic patients and animal models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b41">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Additional studies to test the impact of transplanted IPCs in animal models of diabetes therefore await production of IPCs capable of insulin secretion at levels higher than achieved here.</p><p>Nevertheless, compared to other methods for IPC development from human stem cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b44">44</xref>&#x0005d;, our methods produced insulin at the highest levels yet achieved from an expandable, human stem-cell-derived tissue. Multiple experimental approaches were taken to demonstrate that these IPCs transcribe, translate, and secrete insulin, and to rule out the possibility that insulin measured in IPCs derived from the culture media. In vitro studies demonstrate that IPCs release insulin in a glucose-responsive manner, like islets. Moreover, IPCs transplanted into mice remained differentiated and released circulating human insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Thus, for the first time, we demonstrate moderately efficient production of glucose-responsive IPCs from an expandable population of human stem cells. Current islet transplantation methods require an estimated 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> &#x003b2;-cells per recipient &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b45">45</xref>&#x0005d;. From 10<sup>6</sup> cells at stage 2, we produced an average of 200&#x02013;400 clusters with approximately 2,000 cells per cluster; approximately 25&#x00025; of these cells are C-peptide<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and release 0.5&#x00025;&#x02013;1&#x00025; of C-peptide secreted by &#x003b2;-cells. Based strictly on these yields, we would need to expand IPC production approximately 10<sup>5</sup>-fold to meet the need for one transplantation. Undifferentiated NSs can be readily expanded through at least a dozen passages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020103-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting sufficient cell numbers could be generated to &#x0201c;scale up&#x0201d; this protocol for transplant-based therapies.</p><p>We did not exhaust all possible factor combinations in our study: we speculate that further method refinements may improve the efficiency of NS conversion into IPCs, as well as IPC insulin synthesis and stimulus&#x02013;secretion coupling, the hallmark functions of mature &#x003b2;-cells. If so, then human neural stem cells may serve as a valuable model for elucidating the mechanisms and factors that regulate neuroendocrine cell differentiation.

Because our method is based solely on extracellular factor modulation, in the absence of genetic manipulations, it could serve as the basis for developing replacement islets from a wide range of human stem cells, including neural stem cells and ES cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s5a1"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (<ext-link xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) accession numbers for the genes and gene products discussed in this paper are <italic>brachyury</italic> (AF012130), <italic>Cdx1</italic> (NM&#x0005f;000209), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Desert hedgehog</named-content> (NM&#x0005f;021044), <italic>En1</italic> (NM&#x0005f;001426), <italic>flk-1</italic> (AF035121), <italic>FoxA3</italic> (NM&#x0005f;004497), GAPDH (NM&#x0005f;002046), GFAP (NM&#x0005f;002055), glucokinase (M90299), <italic>Hb9</italic> (NM&#x0005f;005515), <italic>Hoxb9</italic> (NM&#x0005f;024017), <italic>Hoxc6</italic> (NM&#x0005f;004503), human insulin cDNA (J00265), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Indian hedgehog</named-content> (NM&#x0005f;002181), <italic>Isl1</italic> (NM&#x0005f;002202), MAP2 (U01828), myelin basic protein (M13577), <italic>myosin light chain-2</italic> (X57542), Nestin (NM&#x0005f;006617), <italic>ngn3</italic> (AF234829), <italic>Nkx6.1</italic> (NM&#x0005f;006168), <italic>NRSF/REST</italic> (U13879), Olig2 (NM&#x0005f;005806), <italic>Pdx1</italic> (NM&#x0005f;000209), <italic>Ptc</italic> (U59464), RAR-&#x003b1; (NM&#x0005f;000964), RAR-&#x003b2; (BC060794), RAR-&#x003b3; (NM&#x0005f;000966), <italic>Shh</italic> (L38518), <italic>Smo</italic> (AH007453), <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> (NM&#x0005f;000518), and &#x003b2;-tubulin III (BC000748).</p><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><sec id="sb1"><title>Patient Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title/><sec id="sb1a1"><title>Background</title><p>The transplantation of insulin-secreting cells has proved effective in treating severe cases of type 1 diabetes, but currently such cells have to be collected from donors after death. The process of isolation is very laborious and does not provide sufficient numbers of cells to permit wider use of this transplant-based treatment. A renewable source of these cells would be very valuable. Previous work has shown that some nerve cells can also produce insulin.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a2"><title>What Did the Researchers Do?</title><p>They took stem cells that had come from human brains and treated them with a variety of different substances, including glucose, to see if they could alter the way the cells normally develop. They managed to manipulate the stem cells so that they developed into more mature cells that secreted insulin, and could respond to glucose. They put the cells into mice, and found that there, too, they could respond to glucose by producing insulin, albeit at very low levels.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a3"><title>What Do the Results Mean for Patients?</title><p>These findings are a first step towards producing a renewable source of insulin-producing cells; however, the amount of insulin produced was quite low. In addition much more work will need to be done to ensure the safety of the procedure over the long term.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a4"><title>Where Can I Get More Information?</title><p>The National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse, part of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has an information page on islet cell transplantation: <ext-link xlink:href="http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/pancreaticislet/" ext-link-type="uri">http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/pancreaticislet/</ext-link></p><p>Diabetes UK, a charity, also has information: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.diabetes.org.uk/islets/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.diabetes.org.uk/islets/</ext-link></p></sec></sec></sec></boxed-text></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Graeme McLean, Ursula Ehmann, and Dongping He for expert technical assistance, and StemCells for providing human neural progenitor cell lines.
