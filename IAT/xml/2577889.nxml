Most eukaryotic cells form spindles and establish the chromosome&#x02013;microtubule interaction after DNA replication, but the chromosomes in budding yeast are attached by spindle microtubules before the completion of DNA replication. Interestingly, when yeast cells are arrested in S-phase by hydroxyurea, a DNA synthesis inhibitor, they show a unique spindle structure that is shorter than the metaphase spindle. The focus of this study is to address how the shorter S-phase spindle benefits chromosome&#x02013;microtubule interaction. We found that the increase in spindle length in yeast cells that are arrested in S-phase results in an improper chromosome&#x02013;microtubule interaction.

This process requires each duplicated chromosome to be captured by microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles in order to establish bipolar attachment. The establishment of bipolar attachment satisfies the spindle checkpoint, leading to the degradation of anaphase inhibitor Pds1 by APC (anaphase-promoting complex) and the subsequent cleavage of cohesins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-CohenFix1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Visintin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Uhlmann1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Improperly attached chromosomes lead to tension defects, which activate the tension checkpoint and prevent anaphase entry as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Pinsky1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike other higher eukaryotic organisms, in which kinetochore-microtubule interaction is established during M-phase, the budding yeast undergoes spindle formation and chromosome capture during S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Byers1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The real time analysis of spindle in budding yeast reveals several stages during cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Yeh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Following spindle pole body duplication, the spindle appears as a short bar on the side of the nucleus, &#x0003c;1.2 &#x000b5;M in length. After further spindle poles separation, a bipolar spindle (1.5&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;M) bisects the nucleus. On the basis of bud size, these two stages may represent S- and M-phase spindles.</p><p>In budding yeast, chromosomes are attached to microtubules during most of the cell cycle, but the duplication of centromeric DNA results in the dissociation of kinetochore proteins from centromeres, which is expected to disrupt kinetochore-microtubule interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Kitamura1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Centromere replication has been shown to result in the dissociation of chromosomes from microtubules for 1&#x02013;2 min. The detached chromosomes are recaptured by microtubules immediately after completion of centromere replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Kitamura1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous work shows that newly synthesized Cse4, the histone-H3 variant specific for centromeres in budding yeast, replaces old protein during DNA replication. Once assembled, Cse4-GFP is a stable component of centromeres during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Pearson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, the observations support the conclusion that the kinetochore-microtubule interaction is disrupted and reestablished during S-phase in budding yeast.</p><p>Hydroxyurea (HU) slows down DNA synthesis by depleting dNTP pool, and the presence of high concentrations of HU arrests yeast cells in S-phase with a short spindle. Mutant cells deficient in S-phase checkpoint exhibit elongated spindle structure in HU-arrested cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Bachant1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Krishnan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, but the cause for spindle elongation in S-phase checkpoint mutants remains uncertain. Results from the Bachant lab support the notion that the failure of bipolar attachment results from the incomplete centromere replication contributes to spindle elongation in S-phase checkpoint mutants in the presence of HU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Bachant1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In support of this notion, they observed that some kinetochore mutants, <italic>ask1-3</italic>, <italic>mif2-2</italic>, and <italic>ipl1-321</italic>, failed to maintain short spindles in the presence of HU when incubated at the nonpermissive temperature. As these mutants exhibit defects in the establishment of chromosome bipolar attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Li1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Meluh1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, the bipolar attachment is believed to restrain spindle elongation during S-phase. Data from another lab suggest that the down-regulation of microtubule-associated proteins, Cin8 and Stu2, by S-phase checkpoint is the key to the short spindle structure in HU-arrested cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Krishnan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Deletion of Cin8, a protein required for spindle elongation, has been shown to suppress the spindle elongation phenotype in S-phase checkpoint mutants. Therefore, both bipolar attachment and down-regulation of proteins responsible for spindle elongation are probably required to prevent spindle elongation in HU-arrested yeast cells. A key question that remains open is why yeast cells keep a short spindle structure during S-phase. One way to address this issue is to determine what happens to yeast cells when spindles elongate during S-phase.</p><p>We found that <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutant cells exhibited partially elongated spindles when arrested with HU at room temperature, even though the mutant cells have no noticeable cell cycle defects in the absence of HU treatment. We treated <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutant cells with HU and followed cell cycle progression after HU was washed off. Strikingly, the mutant cells exhibited normal DNA synthesis, but showed a dramatic anaphase entry delay that depends on the spindle checkpoint, indicating improper kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Deletion of <italic>CIN8</italic> suppressed the premature spindle elongation as well as the anaphase entry delay in <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutants after HU treatment. To further confirm that the premature spindle elongation contributes to the anaphase entry delay, we enforced spindle elongation in S-phase cells by overexpressing <italic>ASE1</italic> or <italic>CIN8</italic>, because their overexpression has been reported to induce spindle elongation in HU-arrested cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Krishnan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Schuyler1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. We also found that Ase1- or Cin8-induced spindle elongation in HU-arrested cells also led to spindle checkpoint-dependent anaphase entry delay after HU was washed away. Therefore, we conclude that the short S-phase spindle is required for proper kinetochore-microtubule interaction in budding yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Examination of Kinetochore Integrity in HU-Arrested Cells</title><p>In budding yeast, kinetochores interact with microtubules during most of the cell cycle, but a transient chromosome dissociation from microtubules occurs during S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Kitamura1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Hydroxyurea (HU) slows down DNA synthesis, but it remains untested whether HU treatment delays kinetochore assembly. For this purpose, we examined the association of kinetochore proteins with centromeric DNA in HU-arrested yeast cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Ask1 is one of the subunits of the DASH complex, which encircles microtubules and mediates a stable kinetochore-microtubule interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Janke1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Westermann1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Cheeseman1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The kinetochore-microtubule interaction can therefore be reflected by the association of Ask1 protein with centromeric DNA. Nnf1 is a component of the Mtw1 kinetochore complex, which is required to bridge the DASH-centromere interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Westermann1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The association of Nnf1 with centromeric DNA would indicate the assembly of core kinetochore structure.</p><p>So that the association of Ask1 and Nnf1 with centromeric DNA could be examined, cells with myc-tagged Ask1 or Nnf1 were synchronized in G<sub>1</sub> phase and then released into HU medium.

Interestingly, the association decreased after release into HU medium for 1 and 2 hrs, suggesting the failure of kinetochore assembly on some centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000262-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We speculate that either unduplicated centromeres or closely localized replication machinery could prevent kinetochore assembly in HU-arrested cells. After HU wash-off, increased centromere binding of Ask1 and Nnf1 was observed, indicating kinetochore reassembly and the establishment of kinetochore-microtubule interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000262-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These observations provide direct evidence for the presence of some centromeres that lack the association of kinetochore proteins in HU-arrested yeast cells.</p><fig id="pgen-1000262-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000262.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Kinetochore-microtubule interaction in HU-treated cells.</title><p>(A) Examination of kinetochore integrity and kinetochore-microtubule interaction during S-phase.

The majority of HU-arrested cells exhibited a single GFP dot positioned either close to the middle of the spindle (30&#x00025;) or near to one of the spindle ends (56&#x00025;). The chromosome IV in cells with a Cen4-GFP dot near to one spindle end is likely to be monopolar attached, because in a certain fraction of cells, centromeres are not yet replicated in HU and only monolopar attachment can form under these circumstances. We also found that some Cen4-GFP dots were away from the spindle axis (11&#x00025;), and we reason that these chromosomes are either detached or monopolar attached. After bipolar attachment, the applied tension on chromosomes results in a transient sister centromere separation and two dots can be visualized with GFP-marked centromeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Goshima1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-He1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken together, we conclude that detached, monopolar attached, or bipolar attached chromosomes are all present in HU-arrested cells.

The characterization of the cell cycle defects resulted from elongated spindles in S-phase-arrested cells enables us to clarify this issue. We found that <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutant cells exhibited partially elongated spindles when incubated at the permissive temperature in the presence of HU. Previous data indicate that overexpression of <italic>ASE1</italic> or <italic>CIN8</italic> induces spindle elongation in HU-arrested cells as well. With these approaches, we demonstrate, on the basis of the following observations, that premature spindle elongation in HU-arrested yeast cells results in improper chromosome-microtubule interaction. First, elongated spindles during S-phase led to pronounced anaphase entry delay. Moreover, the delay was abolished by the inactivation of the spindle checkpoint that monitors defects in kinetochore-microtubule interaction. Finally, suppression of the premature spindle elongation by <italic>cin8&#x00394;</italic> deletion alleviated the anaphase entry delay in <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutant cells after HU treatment.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>The Relative Timing of Centromere Duplication and Kinetochore&#x02013;Microtubule Interaction in Budding Yeast</title><p>Budding yeast cells form spindles and establish the kinetochore-microtubule interaction during late S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Pearson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, therefore, chromosome biorientation and spindle pole separation normally occur at about the same time. The duplication of centromeric DNA during early S-phase disrupts kinetochore structure, resulting in detached chromosomes. The recapture of these chromosomes occurs immediately after the replication of centromeric DNA, when two spindle poles have not clearly separated yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Tanaka2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In HU-arrested cells, two spindle poles separate as a consequence of spindle formation, but DNA synthesis is blocked. Our ChIP analysis demonstrates decreased association of kinetochore protein Nnf1 and Ask1 with centromeric DNA, suggesting that the duplication of some centromeric DNA is not finished yet in HU-treated cells, even though centromeres are close to early replication origins. As a consequence, bipolar attachment cannot form on these unduplicated centromeres in HU-arrested cells. After HU is washed away, duplicated sister kinetochores allow the establishment of bipolar attachment, when spindle poles have separated already. Therefore, it is likely that HU treatment uncouples chromosome biorientation and spindle pole separation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The Length Control of S-Phase Spindle in Budding Yeast</title><p>Although the two spindle poles have separated in HU-arrested yeast cells, they are relatively close and S-phase spindle is shorter than that in metaphase cells. Recent work from the Bachant lab suggests that bipolar chromosome attachments provide a force to prevent spindle extension during HU arrest, as <italic>ask1-3</italic> and other kinetochore mutant cells exhibit elongated spindles when incubated in 37&#x000b0;C medium containing HU. We found that <italic>ask1-3</italic> cells exhibited partially elongated spindles in HU-arrested cells even when incubated at room temperature. The examination of spindle elongation kinetics reveals no noticeable difference in WT and <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutants in undisturbed cell cycle at 25&#x000b0;C. Then why do these mutants exhibit abnormal spindle elongation in the presence of HU?</p><p>Our ChIP analysis indicates decreased association of kinetochore proteins with centromeric DNA, suggesting that only a few chromosomes have assembled sister kinetochores that are competent for bipolar attachment. Consistently, the examination of Cen4-GFP and Tub1-mCherry signals in HU-arrested cells indicates the presence of many monopolar attached chromosomes. Therefore, HU treatment imposes an increased requirement for kinetochores due to a reduction in inward forces resulting from fewer bipolar kinetochore-microtubule interactions. The kinetochore defect in <italic>ask1</italic>-3 mutants might result in the failure to restrain spindle elongation in the presence of HU, although the spindle is normal in undisturbed cell cycle. In support of this speculation, <italic>dam1-DDD</italic> and <italic>spc24-9</italic> mutants also exhibit elongated spindles in the presence of HU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000262-Ma1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The Spindle Length and Kinetochore&#x02013;Microtubule Interaction during S-Phase</title><p>One interesting observation is that <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutants show elongated spindles in HU-treated cells and these cells exhibit spindle checkpoint-dependent anaphase entry delay after HU is washed away. There are two possible ways to explain the observation. As Ask1 is a kinetochore protein, one possibility is that the kinetochore defects in <italic>ask1-3</italic> cause spindle elongation, which in turn inhibits additional kinetochore-microtubule interaction. Alternately, the defective kinetochore-microtubule interaction in HU-arrested <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutants contributes directly to an increase of spindle length. We favor the first model on the basis of the following observations. First, deletion of <italic>CIN8</italic> suppresses the premature spindle elongation in HU-treated <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutants as well as the anaphase entry delay after HU exposure. Since it is unlikely that <italic>cin8&#x00394;</italic> suppresses the kinetochore defects in <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutants, a reasonable explanation is that the suppression of spindle elongation in HU-treated <italic>ask1-3 cin8&#x00394;</italic> mutant cells alleviates the anaphase entry delay after HU exposure. Moreover, Ase1-induced spindle elongation in HU-arrested cells also leads to spindle checkpoint-dependent anaphase entry delay. The kinetochores should be normal in cells overexpressing <italic>ASE1</italic>, as no direct kinetochore function of Ase1 has been reported in budding yeast. Therefore, we believe that the short spindle structure in HU-arrested cells is crucial for the establishment of proper kinetochore-microtubule interaction in budding yeast.</p><p>What defects contribute to the anaphase entry delay in <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutants after HU treatment? As the delay depends on the spindle checkpoint, one possibility is the failure of chromosome attachment. If that is the case, inactivation of the spindle checkpoint in <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutants would result in dramatic chromosome missegregation after HU treatment. Unexpectedly, only a small portion of these cells (4&#x00025;) showed missegregated chromosome IV. Our explanation is that chromosomes are bipolar attached, but the kinetochore-microtubule interaction is not strong enough to generate tension, which prevents anaphase entry by activating the tension checkpoint. Indeed, we found that deletion of the tension checkpoint gene <italic>SGO1</italic> partially suppressed the anaphase entry delay in <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutant cells after HU exposure. Together, these results support the conclusion that the presence of both unattached kinetochores and tension defects prevent anaphase entry in HU-treated <italic>ask1-3</italic> mutant cells.</p><p>Short S-phase spindle ensures that kinetochores are close to the two spindle poles, which may facilitate chromosome capture. In S-phase cells with elongated spindles, however, kinetochores are close to one of the spindle poles but far away from the other, making it more difficult to achieve bipolar attachment. On the other hand, even after the achievement of bipolar attachment, the unequal distance between sister kinetochores and the two spindle poles may hinder tension generation on sister kinetochores. Therefore, it becomes more difficult to achieve bipolar attachment and tension establishment when spindles are elongated prematurely in yeast cells arrested in S-phase.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast Strains, Growth, and Media</title><p>The relevant genotypes of the yeast strains are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000262.s001">Table S1</xref> (supporting information).
