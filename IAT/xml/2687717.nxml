Not all tumors respond to this drug, however, and the characteristics that distinguish resistant tumors from sensitive tumors are not well defined. Activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint is required for paclitaxel-induced cell death.

Paclitaxel is not effective in all tumors, however, and the characteristics that distinguish resistant tumors from sensitive tumors are not well defined. Identifying the tumor molecular characteristics associated with resistance to or sensitivity to paclitaxel would help determine which patients are most likely to benefit from paclitaxel therapy.</p><p>Paclitaxel resistance has been attributed to a variety of mechanisms, including upregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; upregulation of membrane transporters such as mdr1, which increases drug efflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; point mutations in &#x003b2;-tubulin residues or altered expression of tubulin isotypes, which impair drug&#x02013;tubulin binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; upregulation of ErbB2 (HER-2) by inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1, which causes delayed mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; and high expression of microtubule-associated protein tau mRNA, which decreases paclitaxel binding to microtubules and microtubule polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>We recently reported that activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint is required for paclitaxel-induced cell death and that inactivation of this checkpoint was correlated with suppression of CDK1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. CDK1, in combination with other mitotic cyclins, is a universal master kinase and is required for the regulation of mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Previous studies that used CDK inhibitors or dominant-negative CDK1 constructs showed that CDK1 plays a critical role in paclitaxel-induced cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. CDK1 activity may therefore be a predictor of paclitaxel sensitivity.</p><p>Several studies reported that rapidly proliferating tumors have a higher response rate to chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Expression levels of cyclin A and cyclin E are suggested to correlate with the proliferation state of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These molecules are considered to drive the cell cycle by activating CDK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, a correlation between the effectiveness of paclitaxel and the tumor growth rate has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We therefore speculated that high CDK2 activity is required for increased paclitaxel sensitivity.</p><p>In the present study we measured both the kinase activity and expression level of CDK1 and CDK2 before and after paclitaxel treatment in human breast cancer cell lines and in xenograft models of human breast cancer. We defined the specific activity of CDK as a kinase activity (unit) of its protein expression (1 &#x003bc;g). We found that changes in CDK1 specific activity after paclitaxel treatment predicted the paclitaxel sensitivity of breast cancer cells and xenograft tumors. Baseline CDK2 specific activity was higher in tumors that were sensitive to paclitaxel than in tumors that were resistant to paclitaxel.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells were cultured in DMEM&#x02013;Ham's F12.

Interestingly, the baseline (before paclitaxel treatment) CDK2 activity was significantly higher in the MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 tumors than in the T47D and MCF-7 tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). The mean value of CDK2 specific activity before the treatment is 20.3 units/ng in MDA-MB-468 cells, 11.2 units/ng in MDA-MB-231 cells, 2.7 in T47D cells, and 6.5 units/ng in MCF-7 cells, respectively (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01 for each).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that an increase in CDK1 specific activity after paclitaxel treatment correlates with sensitivity of the xenografts to paclitaxel, and a lack of change in CDK1 specific activity correlates with a lack of sensitivity of the xenografts to paclitaxel. These findings indicate that analysis of CDK1 activity could be a powerful approach for predicting paclitaxel sensitivity. In our <italic>in vivo </italic>experiment, the highest CDK1 specific activity value observed after paclitaxel treatment in xenografts of the paclitaxel-resistant T47D and MCF-7 cells was 0.15 units/ng. If this value was used as the cutoff value to distinguish between paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant xenografts, the CDK1 specific activity would have a positive predictive value of 100% for the determination of paclitaxel sensitivity in our studies. Several reports have shown that conventional <italic>in vitro </italic>drug sensitivity tests such as the histoculture drug response assay are about 80% accurate in predicting sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; however, this assay is time consuming and tedious. In addition, we observed that the variation in IC<sub>50 </sub>values for paclitaxel determined by cell viability assay between the four cell lines was less than one order of magnitude (from 1.8 nM to 7.2 nM), which suggests that the conventional assay is difficult to apply in clinical practice. The results of our current study suggest that our newly developed system for measuring CDK activity <italic>in vivo </italic>would allow more accurate prediction of paclitaxel sensitivity than the conventional assay.</p><p>We reported recently that activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint is required for paclitaxel-induced cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Assessing the function of the checkpoint in human cancer by analyzing mutation of genes or protein expression, however, would be impractical. Actually, the sensitivity of paclitaxel <italic>in vitro </italic>was not consistent with the cell biological response in four cell lines. MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with paclitaxel were induced to M-phase arrest and showed ring-like staining, which was followed by apoptosis, suggesting that both cell lines possessed functional spindle assembly checkpoints. In contrast, MCF-7 cells did not show any increase in the sub-G<sub>1 </sub>fraction after paclitaxel treatment although they showed ring-like staining and increased in the G<sub>2</sub>/M fraction, indicating that the spindle assembly checkpoint &#x02013; and consequent induction of apoptosis &#x02013; was impaired. This response may be related to the known defect in MCF-7 cells in caspase 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which is necessary for paclitaxel-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This finding demonstrates that M-phase arrest in response to paclitaxel treatment does not always reflect the induction of apoptosis. In the case of T47D cells, in which no typical ring-like staining was observed, we suspect that there were point mutations in &#x003b2;-tubulins &#x02013; including important residues for drug&#x02013;tubulin binding or altered expression of tubulin isotypes. The induction of apoptosis in T47D cells upon treatment with higher concentrations of paclitaxel than the IC<sub>50 </sub>values may therefore depend on other checkpoints instead of, or in addition to, the spindle assembly checkpoint.</p><p>Notably, in the absence of paclitaxel treatment, the paclitaxel-sensitive MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors showed much more rapid growth than the resistant T47D and MCF-7 tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Several studies reported recently that rapid proliferating tumors have a higher response rate to chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Actually, we found that the rapidly growing tumors showed significantly higher CDK2 specific activity without paclitaxel treatment than did the slowly growing tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). Moreover, a correlation between the effectiveness of paclitaxel and the tumor growth rate has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. CDK2 specific activity in breast tumors would therefore be another indicator of paclitaxel sensitivity.</p><p>Consequently, accurate prediction could be expected from the combination assay of CDK1 and CDK2 activities. A clinical study is needed to validate our concept of predicting sensitivity to paclitaxel by analyzing the CDK activity in tumor tissues from patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The increase in CDK1 specific activity after paclitaxel treatment indicates that a tumor is sensitive to paclitaxel, and a lack of change in CDK1 indicates that a tumor is resistant to paclitaxel. The level of CDK2 specific activity before paclitaxel treatment was shown to correlate with paclitaxel sensitivity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consequently, accurate prediction of paclitaxel sensitivity could be realized by a combination assay of CDK1 and CDK2 activities. Validation of our concept with a clinical sample will be needed in future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CDK: cyclin-dependent kinase; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS: fetal bovine serum; IC<sub>50</sub>: 50% inhibitory concentration; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>SNa, YT, TY, TM, YK, AK, KG, and HI are employed by Sysmex Corporation.
