We show that Slit and its receptor Roundabout (Robo) are required at CB apical domains for lumen formation. Mislocalization of Slit outside the apical domain causes ectopic lumen formation and the mislocalization of cell junction proteins, E-cadherin (E-Cad) and Enabled, without disrupting overall CB cell polarity. Ectopic lumen formation is suppressed in <italic>robo</italic> mutants, which indicates <italic>robo</italic>'s requirement for this process. Genetic evidence suggests that Robo and Shotgun (Shg)/E-Cad function together in modulating CB adhesion. <italic>robo</italic> and <italic>shg/E-Cad</italic> transheterozygotes have lumen defects. In <italic>robo</italic> loss-of-function or <italic>shg/E-Cad</italic> gain-of-function embryos, lumen formation is blocked because of inappropriate CB adhesion and an accumulation of E-Cad at the apical membrane. In contrast, <italic>shg/E-Cad</italic> loss-of-function or <italic>robo</italic> gain-of-function blocks lumen formation due to a loss of CB adhesion. Our data show that Slit and Robo pathways function in lumen formation as a repulsive signal to antagonize E-Cad&#x02013;mediated cell adhesion.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: Baz, Bazooka; CB, cardioblast; Dlg, Discs-large; E-Cad, E-cadherin; Ena, Enabled; GOF, gain of function; LOF, loss of function; PC, pericardial cell; Robo, roundabout; Shg, shotgun; XS, cross section.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Lumen morphogenesis is an essential process during the formation of vascular tissue. Blood vessels are tubes formed by a single layer of polarized endothelial cells with junctional contacts enclosing a central lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis et al., 2000</xref>). Although several models have been proposed for lumen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lubarsky and Krasnow, 2003</xref>), the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive this process are poorly understood. The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryonic heart, a simple linear tube resembling a vertebrate capillary, provides a straightforward genetic model for vessel morphogenesis and lumen formation.</p><p>Several studies, both in vitro and in vivo, show that the vascular lumen is established via the formation of intracellular vacuoles, which fuse together with the plasma membrane to produce a lumen between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vega-Salas et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Camarillo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beitel and Krasnow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamei et al., 2006</xref>). Presumably, dynamic changes in cell adhesion and cell&#x02013;cell contacts must also be regulated to account for morphogenetic changes accompanying this process. The cadherin family of molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carthew, 2005</xref>) plays an important role in vessel formation via both their adhesive and signaling functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dejana et al., 1999</xref>). In vertebrate endothelial cells, VE-cadherin is localized specifically to sites of cell contact known as adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bach et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vincent et al., 2004</xref>). Recent evidence suggests the adhesive function of cells is dynamically regulated through E-cadherin (E-Cad) endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gumbiner, 2000</xref>). However, what remains unclear is how intracellular cell adhesion mechanisms are regulated by extracellular signals to control complex cell shape changes.</p><p>Slit is an extracellular matrix protein that is the ligand for the Roundabout (Robo) family of transmembrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rothberg et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>). Genetic data from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> together with in vivo studies in mice indicate a conserved role for Slit and Robo proteins in repulsive axon guidance (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dickson and Gilestro, 2006</xref>). In the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> central nervous system, expression of <italic>slit</italic> by the midline glial cells creates a repulsive cue for <italic>robo</italic>-expressing central nervous system axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>). Here, we present genetic evidence for a repulsive activity for Slit in the heart. Specifically, we show that Slit/Robo signaling is required at the apical plasma membrane of heart cells for inhibiting E-Cad&#x02013;mediated cell adhesion, thus permitting cell shape changes required for lumen formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> heart lumen formation</title><p>The alignment of cardioblasts (CBs) into rows on either side of the midline is the first of several steps during heart tube assembly. After alignment, the two rows of CBs, which are each flanked by a row of pericardial cells (PCs), migrate dorsally. Prior to merging at the midline, CBs undergo a mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition and acquire apical-basal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fremion et al., 1999</xref>). At the dorsal midline, contralateral pairs of CBs make specific dorsal and ventral contacts between their opposing apical membranes to form the lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and H</xref>). To better understand the steps leading to lumen formation, we performed EM on cross sections (XSs) of wild-type embryos at three steps during the late stages of heart development. At early embryonic stage 16, each CB initiates contact with its contralateral counterpart at the dorsalmost leading edge of the apical membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). After dorsal contact, CBs undergo a shape change and make contact at their ventral apical surfaces (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In this way, a lumen is formed between two opposing CBs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The fact that CBs specifically make contact at dorsal and ventral attachment points (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>) suggests that an inhibitory mechanism may prevent the centralmost apical surfaces between these points from coming into contact.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of Slit, Robo, and Robo2 in the heart.</bold> All embryos are wild type.

We reported that Slit and its receptors Robo and Robo2 play an important role in the dorsal migration of CBs and PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santiago-Mart&#x000ed;nez et al., 2006</xref>). Prior to merging at the dorsal midline, Slit becomes restricted to CB apical surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santiago-Mart&#x000ed;nez et al., 2006</xref>). This dynamic change in Slit localization suggests that during this late phase of heart morphogenesis, Slit has a second function in lumen formation.</p><p>To explore the function of Slit and Robos in lumen formation, we performed a detailed analysis of Slit, Robo, and Robo2 localization in the heart, focusing on stage 17 after CB migration has occurred. Whole mount antibody staining revealed that Slit's localization is polarized at the apical surface of CBs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Robo is also polarized at CB apical surfaces (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Robo2 is absent from the CBs and is restricted to the two rows of PCs, which flank the CBs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). To precisely localize these proteins, we performed immunohistochemistry on embryos that we examined in XS. Both Slit and Robo are localized to the CB apical surfaces surrounding the central lumen of the heart (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, I and J</xref>). XSs also confirm that Robo2 is localized to PCs and excluded from the lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 K</xref>). The concurrent expression of Slit and Robo at CB apical surfaces suggests that these proteins may play an important role in lumen formation.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>slit</italic> overexpression results in ectopic lumen formation</title><p>A notable aspect of heart tube formation is that although the dorsal and ventral leading edges of CB apical surfaces make connections with their contralateral partners, the innermost surfaces fail to come in contact (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Based upon Slit's localization at the CB apical domain and Slit's well-characterized role in repulsive guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kramer et al., 2001</xref>), we hypothesized that Slit may be responsible for preventing CB membranes from coming into contact, permitting the formation of a lumen. To test this idea, we used the Gal4-UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>) to overexpress <italic>slit</italic> in the heart. Using the Mef-Gal4 driver to drive UAS-<italic>slit</italic> in a <italic>slit</italic> mutant background (<italic>slit</italic> gain of function [GOF]), we achieved rescue of the heart cell positioning phenotype in which the CBs fail to migrate to the dorsal midline of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santiago-Mart&#x000ed;nez et al., 2006</xref>). However, at stage 16, Slit is no longer restricted to the apical surface of CBs and is now also localized basally and on the PCs as well (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In <italic>slit</italic> GOF embryos, Robo is now also mislocalized to CB basal surfaces (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Examination of the heart in <italic>slit</italic> GOF embryo XSs by EM revealed two lumens (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>) rather than the single lumen observed in the wild type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). We observed this phenotype in all of the embryos we sectioned (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9). The ectopic lumens were not continuous along the entire length of the heart tube but rather were confined to the pair of CBs in the section. By examining serial sections, we observed a series of disconnected lumens. Both lumens are lined with extracellular matrix, a recognizable feature in EM and shown to line the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> heart (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haag et al., 1999</xref>). To identify between which cell types ectopic lumens were forming, we performed Mef2 staining on <italic>slit</italic> GOF embryos that we examined in XS. Mef2 labels CB nuclei, and in wild-type embryos, the lumen is visible between these cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 I</xref>). In <italic>slit</italic> GOF embryos, ectopic lumens are formed between CBs and neighboring non-Mef2&#x02013;positive PC or amnioserosal cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 J</xref>). These results demonstrate that when Slit is no longer polarized, CBs are impaired in their ability to confine formation of the lumen to their apical domains.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of <italic>slit</italic> results in ectopic lumen formation</bold>.

However, an alternative explanation may be that lumen defects in <italic>slit</italic> GOF embryos are secondary to general defects in CB polarity. In <italic>slit</italic> embryos, the rows of CBs do not assemble properly and exhibit abnormal localization of several cell polarity markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Qian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santiago-Mart&#x000ed;nez et al., 2006</xref>). To confirm that the <italic>slit</italic> GOF phenotype was not secondary to defects in cell polarity, we examined cell polarity markers in these embryos. Discs-large (Dlg), a membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Woods et al., 1996</xref>), normally localizes to the apical-lateral surface of CBs in stage 16 embryos (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804120/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804120/DC1</ext-link>). In <italic>slit GOF</italic> embryos, this pattern is not significantly altered (Fig. S1 B), which indicates that the CBs are correctly polarized. In addition, the localization of &#x003b1;-spectrin, a membrane-bound cytoskeletal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 1993</xref>) that preferentially localizes to the basal-lateral surface of CBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santiago-Mart&#x000ed;nez et al., 2006</xref>), was normal in <italic>slit</italic> GOF embryos (Fig. S1 G).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>robo</italic> is required for lumen formation</title><p>In embryos mutant for <italic>slit</italic> or both <italic>robo</italic> and <italic>robo2</italic>, the rows of CBs do not properly align, resulting in gaps at the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santiago-Mart&#x000ed;nez et al., 2006</xref>). It has been found that <italic>slit</italic> mutant embryos have lumen defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MacMullin and Jacobs, 2006</xref>). However, because of the severe CB alignment phenotype in <italic>slit</italic> or <italic>robo</italic>,<italic>robo2</italic> mutants, we found it difficult to separate <italic>slit</italic>'s earlier role in ipsilateral CB cell alignment with what we believe to be a later role lumen formation between contralateral CBs. Embryos mutant for <italic>robo</italic> alone have very mild migration defects, and the majority of CBs are able to align at the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santiago-Mart&#x000ed;nez et al., 2006</xref>). EM of <italic>robo</italic> mutants (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 11) reveals that contralateral CBs are inappropriately adhered, and the lumen fails to form between these cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). In addition, Slit is no longer concentrated at CB apical domains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), which suggests that the Robo localization is important for the polarized accumulation of Slit. Moreover, the mislocalization of Slit in a <italic>robo</italic> mutant is not sufficient to induce ectopic lumen formation as in <italic>slit</italic> GOF embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>), which suggests that Robo is required for this process. To further explore the functional connection between Slit and Robo, we show that removal of <italic>robo</italic> in <italic>slit GOF</italic> embryos completely suppresses the <italic>slit GOF</italic> phenotype and blocks lumen formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and E&#x02032;</xref>). Finally, we found that Dlg and &#x003b1;-spectrin are properly localized in <italic>robo</italic> mutants (Fig. S1, E and J), providing additional evidence that during lumen formation, Slit and Robo are not required for CB cell polarity but instead function at a later step once the initial polarity of the cell has already been established.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>LOF and GOF phenotypes in the heart.</bold> All embryos are stage 17.

We further investigated these findings by first examining the localization of E-Cad in cross-sectioned embryos.

However, in 89% of <italic>robo/shg</italic> transheterozygotes (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9), the lumen was misshapen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 I</xref>), which suggests that the functions of <italic>robo</italic> and <italic>shg/E-Cad</italic> are linked.</p><p>Next, we took a GOF approach to investigate the respective roles of <italic>robo</italic> and <italic>shg/E-Cad</italic> during lumen formation. When we overexpressed <italic>shg/E-Cad</italic> in the CBs using Mef-Gal4, we observed significant heart defects. However, unlike what we observed in <italic>shg/E-Cad</italic> mutants where the CBs failed to attach (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>), the failure in lumen formation in <italic>shg/E-Cad</italic> GOF embryos is caused by the inappropriate adhesion of contralateral CBs. By EM, we observe CBs that are inappropriately attached with no extracellular space in between (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 J</xref>). We also found that Dlg and &#x003b1;-spectrin were properly localized (Fig. S1, D and I), which indicates that the defects were not secondary to loss of CB cell polarity.</p><p><italic>robo</italic> loss of function (LOF) embryos have a phenotype similar to <italic>shg/E-Cad</italic> GOF embryos, in which CBs are inappropriately attached (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, D and H&#x02032;</xref>). We hypothesize that Robo's function at this stage is to repel contralateral CBs at the central apical domain, enabling the formation of a lumen in this region. Consistent with this idea, we found that overexpression of <italic>robo</italic> in CBs using Mef-Gal4 results in severe lumen defects. Although CBs were properly aligned (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 K</xref>) and polarized (Fig. S1, C and H), with EM (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5), we observed a loss of cell contact between the dorsal and/or ventral CB apical surfaces (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 L</xref>). These results indicate that high levels of Robo prevent CBs from initiating or maintaining adhesion at the specific sites of contact and suggest that <italic>robo</italic> overexpression can overcome E-Cad&#x02013;mediated cell adhesion at these sites. Interestingly, in <italic>robo</italic> GOF embryos we found that although Slit remains polarized in CBs, we see Slit staining in intense patches (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 K</xref>) as compared with more uniform localization in the wild type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mislocalization of E-Cad and Bazooka (Baz) in <italic>slit GOF</italic> or <italic>robo</italic> LOF embryos</title><p>Based upon our findings, we hypothesize that Slit and Robo function to negatively regulate E-Cad&#x02013;mediated cell adhesion between opposing CBs. Next, we examined the localization of E-Cad in our mutant backgrounds. In the wild type, E-Cad localizes to the specific sites of cell&#x02013;cell contact between contralateral CBs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). The concentration of E-Cad at CB apical membranes can also be seen in dorsal view (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In <italic>slit</italic> GOF embryos where we observe ectopic lumen formation, we noticed changes in E-Cad expression. E-Cad fails to accumulate at high levels at the apical domain in CBs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In XS, ectopic E-Cad accumulation is seen at sites of cell&#x02013;cell contact surrounding the ectopic lumens (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). However, in <italic>robo</italic> mutants, we observed higher&#x02013;than&#x02013;wild type levels of E-Cad at the apical membrane as seen in dorsal view and in XS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and F</xref>). These results are consistent with our EM studies revealing that in <italic>robo</italic> mutants, the CBs are tightly adhered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H&#x02032;</xref>). We obtained similar results when we looked at Baz localization (Fig. S1, K&#x02013;O). Baz is a PDZ domain&#x02013;containing protein that may provide a landmark for adherens junction assembly by recruiting E-Cad to sites of cell&#x02013;cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harris and Peifer, 2005</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Examination of cell junction markers.</bold> All embryos are stage 17.

Here, we find that Ena, similar to E-Cad and Baz, is localized at the apical domain of CBs in regularly spaced puncta (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, G and J</xref>). In <italic>robo</italic> mutants, Ena is no longer concentrated at CB apical domains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, I and L</xref>). Embryos mutant for <italic>ena</italic> have lumen defects as observed by EM (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4) that are consistent with a loss of CB cell contact (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). What is the function of Ena during lumen formation? One possibility is that, similar to its role during <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gates et al., 2007</xref>), Ena may be required for protrusive behavior of the CBs to permit cell&#x02013;cell contact. Alternatively, Ena may be required for regulating E-Cad&#x02013;based adhesion. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that Ena localizes to ectopic sites along CB basal surfaces in <italic>slit</italic> GOF embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, H and K</xref>), where we observe ectopic sites of E-Cad localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and E</xref>). Interestingly, Ena has been shown to directly interact with Robo to mediate repulsive signaling during axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bashaw et al., 2000</xref>). Our data suggest that Ena may provide a critical link between Robo and E-Cad during lumen formation, and provide an avenue for further study.</p><p>For <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> heart lumen formation, CBs must be attached at specific sites but also have apical surfaces that are not adhered (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Our studies show that Slit/Robo signaling is required for lumen formation between CBs by inhibiting E-Cad&#x02013;mediated cell adhesion. Slit and Robo localize to the apical surface of the CBs facing the lumen. In <italic>robo</italic> LOF or <italic>shg/E-Cad</italic> GOF embryos, contralateral CBs are tightly bound, resulting in a failure of lumen formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). However, when Slit is ectopically expressed on basal and lateral surfaces, we observe an inappropriate loss of cell adhesion in these regions, resulting in the formation of ectopic lumens (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and H</xref>). These phenotypes are accompanied by mislocalization of the cell junction markers E-Cad, Ena (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), and Baz (Fig. S1) to these sites. How might Slit and Robo regulate cell adhesion and lumen formation? Much of our understanding of Slit and Robo signaling has emerged from studies of how Robo's activation by Slit regulates downstream cytoskeletal changes during axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dickson and Gilestro, 2006</xref>). Two recent in vitro studies support our findings that, in addition to their known role in cell migration, Robo proteins also function to either positively or negatively regulate cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaur et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we provide in vivo genetic evidence that Slit and Robo negatively regulate cell adhesion during lumen formation. The next step will be to identify the downstream mechanisms by which Slit and Robo signaling negatively regulate E-Cad&#x02013;mediated cell adhesion.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of heart tube lumen formation in wild-type and mutant embryos.</bold> Lumen formation in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> heart depends on specific sites of adhesion and de-adhesion between contralateral CBs.
