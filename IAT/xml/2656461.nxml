Proteins of the HREV107 family share four conserved domains, a proline-rich motif located at the N-terminus, followed by a conserved H-box, the NC domain and a C-terminal transmembrane domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The HREV107 family proteins are growth regulators, and have recently been classified into the NC protein family along with the lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), protein 2A from Avian encephalomyelitis virus and Echovirus 22 and a hypothetical protein At5g16360 from Arabidopsis thaliana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. HREV107 family proteins are typically localized within the endomembranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, nuclear localization has been reported for the HREV107 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>RIG1 exhibits growth suppressive and proapoptotic activities in normal keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and cancer cells of various origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The proapoptotic activities of RIG1 are mediated through caspase-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or -independent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and are initiated only by the Golgi-, but not the ER-targeted RIG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, RIG1 stimulates cellular differentiation of keratinocytes, which is mediated by the activation of type I tissue transglutaminase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Also, RIG1 inhibits the signaling pathways of Ras and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (AKT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The structure/function relationship of RIG1 has been investigated. Presence of the C-terminal transmembrane domain, ranging from 134 to164 amino acids, that targets the protein to endomembranes is essential for RIG1-mediated activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The RIG1 segment spanning amino acids 124&#x02013;164 interacts with and serves as the substrate of tissue transglutaminase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Also, the N-terminal 124 amino acid region is required for RIG1-dependent keratinocyte differentiation, and removal of the region converts RIG1 into a proapoptotic protein in human keratinocytes. Within the NC domain, the Asp<sup>112</sup>-Cys<sup>113 </sup>(NC) motif of RIG1 is the most conserved feature throughout evolution from virus to <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and the Cys<sup>161 </sup>of LRAT, corresponding to the Cys<sup>113 </sup>of the RIG1, is proposed to participate in a catalytic triad that is directly involved in the LRAT-catalyzed esterification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Recently, dodecapeptides (DPs) H-TIG-3<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>and H-Ha-Rev107-1<sub>111&#x02013;123</sub>, based on 12 conserved amino acids surrounding the NC motif within the NC domain of RIG1 and HREV107, have been shown to induce apoptosis of melanoma cells, and the Leu<sup>120 </sup>has been shown to be indispensable for this activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The H-TIG-3<sub>111&#x02013;123</sub>, which is referred to as RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>hereafter, is targeted to the nucleus where it binds and activates promoters of transcription factors involved in the G1 &#x02192; S transition. The nuclear localization and DNA binding activities of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>sharply contrasts with the character of wild type RIG1 that is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and binds to RAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and transglutaminase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The function of the proline-rich region and H-box of RIG1 has not been investigated, although the proline-rich region of HREV107 has recently been shown to bind PR65&#x003b1;, a subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A, and to inhibit the enzyme's activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>This study investigated functional regions and critical amino acids that are essential for the proapoptotic activities of RIG1 in HtTA cervical cancer cells. Both full-length RIG1 and various truncated variants were constructed with an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) tag to the N-terminus of the protein. Because RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>also functions as an anti-proliferative peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and to further evaluate critical amino acids responsible for RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123</sub>- and RIG1-mediated activities, wild type and mutated (Asp<sup>112</sup>, Cys<sup>113</sup>, Leu<sup>120 </sup>and Arg<sup>121</sup>) DPs as well as the full length RIG1 containing various mutations tagged to the C-terminal of EGFP were constructed. The NC motif was selected due to its evolutionary conservation from virus to mammalian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Leu<sup>120 </sup>is shown to play a critical role in the RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123</sub>-mediated activities in E:WM-115 melanoma cells, and Arg<sup>121 </sup>may play a role involving DNA contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, Leu<sup>120 </sup>and Arg<sup>121 </sup>were selected for the analysis. The results demonstrate that the NC motif of RIG1 is important for RIG1-mediated cell death. In addition, the NC motif, but not Leu<sup>120 </sup>is essential for RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123</sub>-mediated induction of cell death of HtTA cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The NC domain is important for RIG1 in the induction of cell death and apoptosis</title><p>To identify functional domains of RIG1 which are related to induction of cell death or apoptosis, we first constructed expression vectors that synthesized recombinant proteins containing EGFP tagged to the N-terminus of the wild type RIG1 or various truncated RIG1 variants, with the exception of RIG1&#x00394;C in which EGFP was tagged to the C-terminus of the RIG1 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The RIG1&#x00394;N1, RIG1&#x00394;N2, RIG1&#x00394;N3 and RIG1&#x00394;N40&#x02013;136 variant proteins all contained the membrane spanning domain but differed in the H-box and NC domains. The C-terminal deleted RIG1&#x00394;N4, RIG1/NC and RIG1&#x00394;C proteins vary in the N-terminal 40 amino acids including the H-box. Expression of EGFP-tagged RIG1 variants at the expected molecular weight was demonstrated in transfected cytosols prepared from HtTA cervical cancer cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The EGFP-tagged wild type and N-terminal truncated (RIG1&#x00394;N1, RIG1&#x00394;N2, and RIG1&#x00394;N3) RIG1 recombinant proteins were expressed at much lower levels compared to that of variants without C-terminal hydrophobic domain. Similar results were also observed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. With the exception of RIG1&#x00394;N1 and RIG1&#x00394;N2, which had mainly nuclear localization with weak and diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, all the EGFP-tagged recombinant proteins that contained the C-terminal hydrophobic domain and the N-terminal region between 27 and 39 amino acids (RIG1, RIG1&#x00394;N3 and RIG1&#x00394;40&#x02013;136) were primarily distributed in the perinuclear region (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), and were partially co-localized to the Golgi apparatus [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. The C-terminal truncated RIG1 with EGFP tagged to either the C- (RIG1&#x00394;C-EGFP) or N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] were diffusely expressed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. Variants (EGFP-RIG1&#x00394;N4 and EGFP-RIG1/NC) that had truncation at both the N- and C-termini exhibited similar expression patterns as the RIG1&#x00394;C-EGFP with the exception of perinuclear localization of the fusion proteins also detected in less than 5% of cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of the expression of various truncated EGFP-RIG1 fusion proteins</bold>.

With the exception of RIG1&#x00394;C-EGFP that had no effect on cell death and cell viability, wild type and the other EGFP-RIG1 deletion variants significantly increased cell death by 29%&#x02013;115% and reduced cell viability by 22&#x02013;39% after transient expression for 48 h (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), and the EGFP-RIG1&#x00394;40&#x02013;136, which lacks the NC domain, had the weakest effect on both cell death and cell viability among the RIG1 fusion proteins tested. In contrast, the EGFP-tagged RIG1 variant that contained only the NC domain (EGFP-RIG1/NC) significantly increased cell death by 82% and reduced cell viability by 36%. Similar effects of wild type and truncated RIG1 variants on cell growth were also observed in HtTA cervical cancer cells expressing the monomer red fluorescence protein (MRFP)-tagged recombinant RIG1 variants (data not shown), indicating the effects on cell growth was mediated by RIG1 fragment within the recombinant protein. The effects of EGFP-tagged recombinant RIG1 variants on cell death were further explored by the analysis of chromatin condensation in HtTA cells 48 h after transfection.

Proper expression of mutated EGFP-RIG1 fusion proteins in HtTA cells was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Expression of wild type EGFP-RIG1 for 24 or 48 h resulted in significant increase of cell death by 57 or 83%, respectively, and reduction of cell viability by 22 or 29%, respectively (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Expression of Leu<sup>120 </sup>substituted EGFP-RIG1 for 24 or 48 h resulted in significant increase of cell death by 56 or 89%, respectively, and reduction of cell viability by 24 or 26%, respectively. Mutation at Leu<sup>120 </sup>did not reduce EGFP-RIG1-mediated cell death or cell viability. Significant effects of the Arg<sup>121 </sup>substituted EGFP-RIG1 on cell death and cell viability were observed both at 24 and 48 h after transfection, although the effect was weaker than that of EGFP-RIG1. Increase of cell death and decrease in cell viability in EGFP-RIG1 variant transfectants containing double (NC &#x02192; FG) or triple (NCR &#x02192; FGE) mutations were not evident until 48 h after transfection with maximal 37% increase of cell death and 17% reduction of cell viability. The effects of double or triple amino acid substitutes were significantly less than the effects induced by EGFP-RIG1, indicating that the NC motif of RIG1 is important for the effects of RIG1 on cell death. Similar to the results shown in the Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, chromatin condensations as observed in cells expressing the EGFP-RIG1 were profoundly decreased in cells expressing double (NC &#x02192; FG) or triple (NCR &#x02192; FGE) mutated EGFP-RIG1 variants.

The conclusion is supported first by significantly decreased the effect of RIG1 on cell death of the fusion protein (RIG1&#x00394;40&#x02013;136) with deletion at the NC domain, and fusion proteins that contain only the NC domain (RIG1/NC) exhibit profound proapoptotic activity. In addition, we demonstrated that the RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>within the NC domain increases cell death of HtTA cells, and that mutation of the NC motif results in complete abolishment of this activity. The importance of the NC motif is further demonstrated by the significant decrease of cell death in cells expressing the recombinant RIG1 variants that have two (NC) or three (NCR) amino acid mutations. Significance of the NC motif in RIG1 function is supported by the evolutionary conservation of the motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although a decrease of RIG1 expression was frequently observed in several types of cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], no mutation at the NC motif of RIG1 has been reported.</p><p>Analysis of the structure/function relationship of the NC motif and adjacent amino acids has been very limited. Mondal and coworkers first demonstrated that both cysteine residues within the DP of LRAT (LRAT<sub>159&#x02013;171</sub>) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) are important for its enzymatic activity, and that the cysteine in the NC motif is the critical active-site involved in catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Consistent with previous observations that demonstrate proapoptotic activities of DPs derived from HREV107 and RIG1 in melanoma cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], we show that RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>induces cell death when introduced into HtTA cervical cancer cells as either a FITC-conjugated peptide or an EGFP fusion protein. In contrast to the significant role of Leu<sup>120 </sup>in RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123</sub>-mediated growth inhibition of E:WM-115 melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], this study demonstrated that the NC motif is indispensable, the Arg<sup>121 </sup>residue plays a minor role and the Leu<sup>120 </sup>has no effect on the anti-proliferative activities of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>in HtTA cells. This conclusion is supported first by FG for NC substitution which resulted in complete or significantly loss of anti-proliferative activities of FITC-RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>or EGFP-RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>respectively, second by profound loss of anti-proliferative activities in NC or NCR mutated RIG1 fusion proteins, third by reduced proapoptotic activities of the Arg<sup>121</sup>mutated RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>and RIG1, and fourth by the lack of effect of Leu<sup>120 </sup>mutation on proapoptotic activities induced by RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>or RIG1. In addition to HtTA cervical cancer cells, results from this and previous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] studies also show growth suppressive activities of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>on established or primary culture of melanoma cells but not normal human fibroblasts and proliferating melanocytes. Therefore, RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>is selectively toxic to tumor cells, and the significance of Leu<sup>120 </sup>in the RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123</sub>-mediated growth suppression shown previously in melanoma cells is tumor cell type specific.</p><p>RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>is predicted to have an alpha helical structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and selectively binds to cis-binding elements and activates transcription factors involved in the G1/G0 &#x02192; S transition in melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated that RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>is targeted to nuclei of sensitive HtTA and A2058 cells, and mutations that render the loss of growth inhibitory activities result in cytoplasmic distribution of the DPs. Also, RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>that has no effect on normal fibroblasts is distributed only within the cytoplasm. The tight association between nuclear localization and growth suppressive activities of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>supports the notion that RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123</sub>-mediated cell death in sensitive tumor cells is likely to be mediated through sequence-specific DNA binding that leads to alteration in gene expression involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis. Absence of nuclear localization of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>in resistant melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and normal human fibroblasts may be related to failure in nuclear trafficking or to retention of the peptide. The &#x003b1;-helical structure of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>within the EGFP-RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>fusion protein is mostly maintained predicted using SSpro and PSIPREDView programs. This supports the growth suppressive activity of EGFP-RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123</sub>. In contrast to complete loss of activities in NC- or NCR-mutated DPs, growth suppressive activities of the NC- or NCR-mutated EGFP-DP fusion proteins were significantly, but not completely, reduced. The increase in nuclear localization of the double and triple mutated EGFP-DPs, as compare to that of FITC-conjugated DPs, may be related to partial growth suppressive activities of the mutated EGFP-DPs. Currently, critical amino acids involving the binding of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>to cis transcription elements have not been addressed, although RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>has been shown to bind cis binding elements for receptors of retinoic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The fact that nuclear distribution of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>was completely disrupted by mutations at the NC motif or Arg<sup>121</sup>, and was only partially altered by Leu<sup>120 </sup>mutation suggests that the NC motif and Arg<sup>121 </sup>play a profound role and Leu<sup>120 </sup>a minor role in the binding of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>to cis-elements. In addition to the four amino acids investigated in this study, six amino acids (EHFV&#x02013;YG) within RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>are conserved across the HREV107 protein family and LRAT (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Further analysis using site-directed DP mutants will be useful in dissecting the role of the NC motif, Arg<sup>121</sup>, Leu<sup>120 </sup>and other six conserved amino acids in the DNA binding properties as well as regulation of promoter and growth suppressive activities of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123</sub>.</p><p>RIG1&#x00394;N4 and RIG1&#x00394;C are different only by 20 amino acids at the N-terminus, which consist of the proline-rich region. RIG1&#x00394;N4 that is devoid of the proline-rich region inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of HtTA cells. However, RIG1&#x00394;C fails to have effect on cell growth, apoptosis and activation of Ras and tissue transglutaminase I when the truncated protein is expressed as fusion proteins that have myc or EGFP tagged to the N- or C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These results suggest that the N-terminal proline-rich region of RIG1 may bind effectors that prevent RIG1&#x00394;C from exerting effects on the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Truncation of the N-terminal region, as demonstrated in RIG1&#x00394;N4, restores these activities. In fact, the proline-rich region of HREV107 has recently been shown to bind a subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A, PR65&#x003b1;. The binding leads to inhibiting the enzyme's activity and is important for proapoptotic activities of HREV107 on ovarian cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Identification of a binding protein for the proline-rich region of RIG1 will be important to delineate the functional domain at the extreme N-terminus of RIG1.</p><p>Most results from previous studies demonstrate perinuclear and endomembrane localization of transfected wild type RIG1, HREV107 and HRASLS, which induce cellular apoptosis and/or differentiation of normal and cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, nuclear localization of HREV107 and RIG1 was also observed in fibroblasts and cancer cells, and cytoplasmic but not nuclear targeted HREV107 is related to growth stimulation and poor patient survival of non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, proteins of this gene family may localize to multiple intracellular compartments where they have distinct activities. Previous studies in HtTA cells and keratinocytes have demonstrated that RIG1-induced apoptosis or differentiation-related apoptosis is mediated through Golgi apparatus or mitochondria via caspase 3-dependent and/or -independent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Similarly, caspase 3-mediated apoptosis is reported in keratinocytes expressing RIG1 with 124 amino acids truncated at the N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Results of this study in HtTA cells also demonstrated activation of caspase 3 during apoptosis induced by variants (RIG1&#x00394;N1, RIG1&#x00394;N2 and RIG1&#x00394;N3) that contain the C-terminal hydrophobic domain but not RIG1&#x00394;N4 and RIG1/NC that are deleted at both N- and C-termini. Although caspase 3 activation was observed in RIG1&#x00394;N1, RIG1&#x00394;N2 and RIG1&#x00394;N3, RIG1&#x00394;N1 and RIG1&#x00394;N2 are mainly distributed in the nucleus whereas RIG1&#x00394;N3 is in the perinuclear region. Therefore, presence of C-terminal hydrophobic domain rather than subcellular localization appears to play an important role in the caspase 3 activation during apoptosis induced by N-terminal truncated RIG1 variants. The nuclear targeted RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>that exhibits DNA binding and proapoptotic activities was first demonstrated by Simmons <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This study further demonstrated that proapoptotic activities of truncated RIG1 variants, RIG1&#x00394;N4 and RIG1/NC, and the nuclear targeted RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>are mediated through the caspase 3-independent mechanism in cervical cancer cells. RIG1&#x00394;N4 and RIG1/NC were found in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Whether the mechanism of apoptosis induced by RIG1&#x00394;N4 and RIG1/NC is similar to that of RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>that is mediated through regulation of gene expression, as proposed by Simmons et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], needs further investigation.</p><p>Wild type RIG1 and N-terminal truncated variants such as RIG1&#x00394;N1, RIG1&#x00394;N2 and RIG1&#x00394;N3 were expressed at much lower levels than RIG1&#x00394;N4 and RIG1/NC that were truncated at both N- and C-termini. Short protein half life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] or an increase in distribution to the particulate fraction due to N-terminal truncation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] may be responsible for the low protein levels observed in N-terminal truncated RIG1 variants. Although expressed at low levels, the extent of growth suppression on HtTA cells induced by N-terminal truncated variants was relatively similar to the RIG1&#x00394;N4 and RIG1/NC. Similar potent proapoptotic activities, despite being expressed at extremely low levels, of RIG1 variants with N-terminal truncation for 112 to 124 amino acids were also reported in keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>RIG1 is a growth regulator that suppresses cell growth through induction of cellular differentiation and/or apoptosis. The differentiation-inducing activity of RIG1 on keratinocytes is mediated through the activation of tissue transglutaminase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A structure/function analysis has demonstrated that the N-terminal region of RIG1 is required for pro-differentiation activities, regardless, the C-terminal hydrophobic region by itself is enough for the activation of tissue transglutaminase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recently, results from our [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] studies in HtTA cervical and ovarian cancer cells have demonstrated that RIG1 inhibits expression and activation of signaling molecules such as HER2, RAS, PI3K/AKT and mTOR that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and tumor invasion. Further analysis using various truncated and mutated RIG1 variants will be useful to dissect mechanisms as well as functional domains and critical motifs of RIG1 in the regulation of signal pathways involving growth factor receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, RIG1 variants exhibit growth inhibitory activity both when localized to the nucleus and when localized to the cytoplasm. The fact that caspase 3 activation was detected in N-terminal truncated variants, such as RIG1&#x00394;N1, RIG1&#x00394;N2 and RIG&#x00394;N3, but not in C-terminal truncated variants supports the existence of multiple mechanisms during RIG1-mediated growth inhibition. The NC domain, especially the NC motif, plays an important role in RIG1-mediated apoptosis in HtTA cervical cancer cells. RIG1<sub>111&#x02013;123 </sub>alone exhibits profound proapoptotic activities and appears to be useful for development as an anticancer drug.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Expression vectors</title><p>The vectors pRIG1&#x00394;C-EGFP, pRIG1-myc and pRIG1&#x00394;C-myc have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

The cells were transfected with 0.3 &#x003bc;g of various RIG1 expression vectors or empty control vector and then refreshed with complete medium immediately and 24 h after transfection. Cells were analyzed for viability using the MTT assay as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Cell viability relative to that of control transfected cells was defined as [(A570&#x02013;A660) of RIG1-transfected cells/(A570&#x02013;A660) of control transfected cells] &#x000d7; 100%. Measurement of the release of LDH using the Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was used to evaluate cell death as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Percentage LDH release was defined as [(A490&#x02013;A650) of RIG1-cells/(A490&#x02013;A650) of control transfected cells] &#x000d7; 100%. Chromatin condensation was used as a measure of cellular apoptosis. Briefly, cells in 6-cm dishes were transfected with various plasmids for 48 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, they were incubated at room temperature for 10 min with PBS containing 1 &#x003bc;g/ml Hoechst 33258 and 4% bovine serum albumin. Chromatin condensation was analyzed with an Olympus IX-70 immunofluorescent microscope (Olympus, Glostrup, Denmark).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of caspase 3 activity</title><p>HtTA cells were transfected with recombinant RIG1 expression vectors or electroporated with wild type or mutated DPs for 24 h.
