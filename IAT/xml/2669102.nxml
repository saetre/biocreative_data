(TGF-&#x003b2;) expression and thick stromal fibrosis. However, the association of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling with diffuse-type gastric carcinoma has not been investigated in detail.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used a lentiviral infection system to express a dominant-negative TGF-&#x003b2; type II receptor (dnT&#x003b2;RII) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a control in the diffuse-type gastric carcinoma cell lines, OCUM-2MLN and OCUM-12. These infected cells and the corresponding parental control cells were subcutaneously or orthotopically injected into nude mice. Angiogenesis was inhibited by infecting cells with a lentivirus carrying the gene for angiogenic inhibitor thrombospondin-1 or by injecting mice intraperitoneally with the small-molecule angiogenic inhibitor sorafenib or with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) neutralizing antibody (six or eight mice per group). Expression of phospho-Smad2 and thrombospondin-1 was investigated immunologically in human gastric carcinoma tissues from 102 patients. All statistical tests were two-sided.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Expression of dnT&#x003b2;RII into OCUM-2MLN cells did not affect their proliferation in vitro, but it accelerated the growth of subcutaneously or orthotopically transplanted tumors in vivo (eg, for mean volume of subcutaneous tumors on day 10 relative to that on day 0: dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors = 3.49 and GFP tumors = 2.46, difference = 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.21 to 1.84; <italic>P</italic> = .003). The tumors expressing dnT&#x003b2;RII had higher levels of angiogenesis than those expressing GFP because of decreased thrombospondin-1 production. Similar results were obtained with OCUM-12 cells. Expression of thrombospondin-1 in the dnT&#x003b2;RII tumor or treatment with sorafenib or anti-VEGF antibody reduced tumor growth, whereas knockdown of thrombospondin-1 expression resulted in more accelerated growth of OCUM-2MLN tumors than of GFP tumors (eg, mean tumor volumes on day 14 relative to those on day 0: thrombospondin-1&#x02013;knockdown tumors = 4.91 and GFP tumors = 3.79, difference = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.80 to 1.44; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001).

There are two types of gastric cancer: diffuse type and intestinal type. Diffuse-type gastric carcinoma, according to the Laur&#x000e9;n classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), is highly metastatic and characterized clinically by rapid disease progression and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Although the incidence of intestinal-type gastric carcinoma has continuously decreased, the incidence of diffuse-type gastric carcinoma has increased progressively during the last 30 years, so that the diffuse type constitutes approximately one-third of all gastric carcinomas diagnosed in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). In contrast to the intestinal type, infection with <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and chronic gastritis are often absent in the diffuse-type gastric carcinoma. Patients with diffuse-type gastric carcinoma often have thick stromal fibrosis with undifferentiated carcinoma cells scattered in the interstitium, which results in a stiff and thick gastric wall with reduced motility, but the tumors do not form ulcers or apparent mass lesions.</p><p>Transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) is a multifunctional cytokine that contributes to cancer progression by acting in both tumor cells and the tumor stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2; binds to TGF-&#x003b2; serine&#x02013;threonine kinase receptors type I and type II (T&#x003b2;RII) and transduces signals by phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smad2 and Smad3 proteins. Smad2 and Smad3 form complexes with Smad4, and these complexes regulate transcription of various target genes in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>Because TGF-&#x003b2; is a potent inhibitor of epithelial cell proliferation, resistance to the inhibitory activity of TGF-&#x003b2; results in increased cell proliferation and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Cancer cells in advanced tumors are often refractory to TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;induced growth inhibition, and some tumors even increase their production of TGF-&#x003b2; ligands. TGF-&#x003b2; induces deposition of extracellular matrix in the tumor interstitium, which leads to fibrosis. TGF-&#x003b2; also induces perturbations of immune surveillance and regulates angiogenesis in vivo. Moreover, TGF-&#x003b2; may promote tumor growth by inducing epithelial cells to undergo the epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), and inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling has been reported to prevent progression and metastasis of certain advanced tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In addition, decreased expression of T&#x003b2;RII, Smad2, and/or Smad4 or loss-of-function mutations in at least one of these genes has been observed in advanced stages of certain cancers, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), and these changes in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling may affect progression of these cancers.</p><p>There is limited information regarding the role of TGF-&#x003b2; in diffuse-type gastric cancers. The thick stromal fibrosis observed in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma is induced by the TGF-&#x003b2; produced by cancer cells and by cancer-associated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Production of TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been reported to be associated with the progression of diffuse-type gastric carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), although the relation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression to prognosis of gastric carcinoma is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Disruption of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by loss of Smad4 expression has also been observed in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). However, detailed investigations on the roles of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma have not been carried out. We therefore investigated the role of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma by use of OCUM-2MLN and OCUM-12 cell lines and by disrupting TGF-&#x003b2; signaling.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients, Materials, and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Lines</title><p>The OCUM-2MLN cell line was obtained from a lymph node metastasis of a mouse with orthotopically implantated OCUM-2M cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>); the OCUM-2M line was originally established from a 49-year-old woman with diffuse-type gastric carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). The OCUM-12 cell line was established from the peritoneal effusion of a 58-year-old man with diffuse-type gastric carcinoma that was diagnosed by endoscopy and histology. OCUM-12 cells were further confirmed to be tumorigenic in nude mice [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and M. Yashiro and K. Hirakawa, Osaka City University, unpublished data]. Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To disrupt TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, we introduced a dominant-negative TGF-&#x003b2; type II receptor (dnT&#x003b2;RII) that lacks the intracellular kinase domain into the OCUM-2MLN and OCUM-12 cell lines (resulting in the 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII and OCUM-12-dnT&#x003b2;RII cell lines, respectively) by use of a lentiviral infection system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). We used the same lentivirus system to generate control OCUM-2MLN and OCUM-12 cells that expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) (resulting in the 2MLN-GFP and OCUM-12-GFP cell lines, respectively) and OCUM-2MLN cells that expressed both dnT&#x003b2;RII and the angiogenic inhibitor thrombospondin-1 (resulting in the 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII+TSP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). cDNAs for dnT&#x003b2;RII or for thrombospondin-1 were produced from mRNA extracted from the cultured OCUM-2MLN cell line by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). cDNAs encoding either dnT&#x003b2;RII with a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag or thrombospondin-1 were inserted into the multicloning site of the lentiviral vector pCSII-CMV-RfA by use of pENTR, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human and mouse phosphorylated Smad2 that were used for immunoblotting were a gift from A. Moustakas and C.-H. Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). The rabbit monoclonal antibody against human and mouse phosphorylated Smad2 that was used for immunohistochemistry was from Millipore (Temecula, CA; clone A5S). The rat monoclonal antibody against mouse platelet&#x02013;endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and mouse monoclonal antibody against human and mouse Smad2 and Smad3 (clone 18) were from BD (Franklin Lakes, NJ). The rat monoclonal antibody against hemagglutinin tag (clone 3F10) was from Roche (Basel, Swiss), and mouse monoclonal antibody against GFP (clone 1E4) was from Medical &#x00026; Biological Laboratories, Co. (Woburn, MA). Mouse monoclonal antibody against human and mouse thrombospondin-1 was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK; clone A6.1). Alexa 488&#x02013; and Alexa 594&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibodies and the nuclear stain TOTO-3 for counterstaining were from Invitrogen Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). TGF-&#x003b2;3 and TGF-&#x003b2;1, which show similar biological activities in vitro, were purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot Analysis</title><p>We examined the expression of Smad2 and Smad3, phosphorylated Smad2, GFP, and hemagglutinin-tagged dnT&#x003b2;RII by immunoblot analyses in following cultured cells: 2MLN, 2MLN-GFP, 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII, OCUM-12, OCUM-12-GFP, and OCUM-12-dnT&#x003b2;RII. These cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholic acid sodium salt-monohydrate (Nacalai Tesque), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Nacalai Tesque), 1% aprotinin (Mitsubishi Pharma, Osaka, Japan), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma, St Louis, MO). The cell lysates were boiled in SDS sample buffer (100 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl at pH 8.8, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 36% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 10 mM dithiothreitol) and subjected to SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrotransferred from a polyacrylamide gel to Pall Fluorotrans-W membranes (Pall, East Hills, NY) and immunoblotted with antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected by use of an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Each experiment was conducted two times, and a representative result is shown.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Proliferation Assay</title><p>We cultured 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> 2MLN, 2MLN-GFP, 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII, or OCUM-12 cells per well in 12-well plates. On the next day (designated as day 0), some cultures were treated with TGF-&#x003b2; and control cultures were left untreated. Cells from duplicate cultures were counted as indicated with a hemocytometer. Each experiment was conducted two times, sample points were assayed in triplicate, and data were averaged. Data from one representative experiment of these are shown.</p></sec><sec><title>BALB/c Nude Mouse Model for Human Gastric Cancer</title><p>BALB/c nude male mice, aged 4&#x02013;5 weeks, were obtained from Oriental Yeast Co. (Tokyo, Japan). All animal experimental protocols were performed in accordance with the policies of the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Tokyo. A total of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 100 &#x003bc;L of DMEM (n &#x0003e; 6 mice per group) was injected subcutaneously at the left flank of each mouse and allowed to grow for 1 week (for OCUM-2MLN cells) or 3 weeks (for OCUM-12 cells) when the major axis of the tumors was approximately 10 mm long. For the orthotopic transplantation model, a total of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 50 &#x003bc;L of DMEM were injected into the gastric wall of each mouse (n = 8 mice per group) and allowed to grow for 1 week when tumor was approximately 5 mm in diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor Volume Measurement</title><p>The volume of subcutaneous xenograft tumors was measured externally every other day until the end of the evaluation period. Tumor volume was estimated by using the equation, <italic>v</italic> = (<italic>ab</italic><sup>2</sup>)/2, where <italic>v</italic> is volume, <italic>a</italic> is the length of the major axis of the tumor, and <italic>b</italic> is the length of its minor axis. The relative tumor volume was then calculated by dividing tumor volume on a given experimental day by that on day 0 (the day of initiation of treatment or evaluation). For orthotopic xenograft tumors, the tumor area on the gastric wall was measured by opening the abdomen on experimental day 14 and at the end of the evaluation period (day 21). The major and minor axes of tumors were measured with Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA), and tumor areas on the gastric wall were calculated with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Relative tumor area was obtained by dividing the area on day 21 by that on day 14.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription-PCR</title><p>Total RNAs from gastric carcinoma cells or excised subcutaneous tumors were extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA).

In subcutaneous tumors, the PECAM-1&#x02013;positive area was statistically significantly higher in 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors (8.91% per microscopic field) than in 2MLN-GFP tumors (4.78%) (n = 6, difference = 4.13%, 95% CI = 1.31% to 6.94%; <italic>P</italic> = .008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, D</xref>).

We used quantitative RT-PCR with human THBS1&#x02013;specific primers to confirm that the expression of THBS1 mRNA from human carcinoma cells was lower in the 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors (0.13 arbitrary unit) than in the 2MLN-GFP tumors (2.20 arbitrary units) (difference = 2.07 arbitrary units, 95% CI = 1.92 to 2.22 arbitrary units; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, E</xref>, left panel).

In addition to thrombospondin-1, VEGF has been reported to be involved in angiogenesis in the Smad4-deficient pancreatic tumor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). However, the level of VEGF expression, as determined with primers specific for both human and mouse VEGF, was similar between 2MLN-GFP and 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII cells in vivo and in vitro (data not shown), indicating that decreased expression of thrombospondin-1 may be involved in the enhanced angiogenesis in the 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotype of Tumors Containing a Mixture of Both 2MLN-GFP and 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII Cells</title><p>The results described above strongly suggest that regulation of structural elements in the tumor microenvironment by TGF-&#x003b2; signaling may be important to tumor formation in diffuse-type gastric carcinomas; however, it is still possible that the changes in tumor growth rate may be induced by other autonomous factor(s) in the cancer cells. To investigate further whether the tumor microenvironment serves as a major determinant of tumor growth in this model, we mixed equal amounts of the 2MLN-GFP and 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII cells and transplanted the cell mixture into nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, A</xref>). If the tumor microenvironment plays a major role in tumor growth, then the 2MLN-GFP+dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors should contain equal number of both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, A</xref>). In contrast, if the 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII portion of the tumor grows faster in cell-autonomous fashion, then the 2MLN-GFP+dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors should be composed mainly of 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII cells. Histological examination of 2MLN-GFP+dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors with GFP fluorescence and by use of hemagglutinin antibody to detect the 2MLN-GFP and 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII cells, respectively, revealed that the 2MLN-GFP+dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors contain almost equal number of the two cell types (<italic>P</italic> = .56) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, B</xref>).

The 2MLN-GFP cells expressing the microRNA construct against thrombospondin-1 were termed 2MLN-GFP+miTSP-1 cells.

Furthermore, microarray analysis of gene expression revealed decreased production of thrombospondin-1 in the 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors. Overexpression of thrombospondin-1 suppressed the growth of OCUM-2MLN tumors, but knockdown of thrombospondin-1 expression stimulated tumor growth. Moreover, we have also demonstrated that regulation of angiogenesis by sorafenib or anti-VEGF antibody efficiently prevented the growth of tumors in vivo.</p><p>Systemic administration of TGF-&#x003b2; inhibitors has been shown to suppress growth and metastasis of some tumors by acting on cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). However, we found that disruption of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma cells accelerated tumor formation. We found, in experiments with a mixture of the wild-type OCUM-2MLN cells and OCUM-2MLN cells expressing dnT&#x003b2;RII, that the increased growth of 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors appeared to be mainly attributable to alterations in the tumor microenvironment, not to autonomous properties of the cancer cells. The tumor microenvironment, which has been reported to be important during tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), contains many structural elements, including blood vessels and fibrotic tissues. Consistently, we found that absence of TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;induced expression of thrombospondin-1, an angiogenic inhibitor, is associated with increased growth of dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors in vivo, indicating that increased angiogenesis in the dnT&#x003b2;RII-expressing tumors appears to be important in the accelerated growth of such tumors.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; binds to T&#x003b2;RII and TGF-&#x003b2; type I receptorand activates Smad2 and Smad3, which transduce signals by complexing with Smad4. Decreased expression of T&#x003b2;RII, Smad2, and Smad4, or loss-of-function mutations in at least one of these genes, has been reported in various cancers at advanced stages, including breast cancer and colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Decreased expression of Smad4 has been observed in many clinical specimens of diffuse-type gastric carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Although mutations in T&#x003b2;RII have not been reported in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma, these findings indicate that disruption of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling may accelerate the progression of this type of cancer at advanced stages.</p><p>Schwarte-Waldhoff et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) reported that the lack of Smad4 in an experimental pancreatic cancer model stimulated secretion of VEGF, repressed the expression of thrombospondin-1, and led to increased angiogenesis and tumor growth. Our microarray data revealed that although expression of VEGF was not statistically significantly altered in the 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors, compared with the 2MLN-GFP tumors, expression of thrombospondin-1 was reduced. Moreover, we found that the expression of thrombospondin-1 was induced by TGF-&#x003b2; in the OCUM-2MLN cells but not in the 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII cells, in agreement with previous reports on the induction of thrombospondin-1 by TGF-&#x003b2; in certain cell types, including hepatic HuH-7 cells, osteosarcoma MG63 cells, and rat tubular epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). We obtained similar results with another diffuse-type gastric carcinoma cell line, OCUM-12. Furthermore, we found that expression of thrombospondin-1 reduced the growth of 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors in mice and that growth of tumors produced from 2MLN-GFP cells in which thrombospondin-1 expression had been inhibited was accelerated. Moreover, the association that we found between the expression of phosphorylated Smad2 and thrombospondin-1 indicated that attenuation or loss of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling results in decreased expression of thrombospondin-1 in human gastric cancer tissues. Thrombospondin-1 has been shown to inhibit growth and differentiation of endothelial cells and to induce their apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Thus, the decreased level of thrombospondin-1 in these tumor models appears to accelerate tumor angiogenesis.</p><p>The importance of tumor angiogenesis in the accelerated growth of the 2MLN-dnT&#x003b2;RII tumors was further supported by the potent inhibition of tumor growth by treatment with sorafenib, regardless of the status of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in the cancer cells. Sorafenib was effective not only in OCUM-2MLN tumors but also in OCUM-12 tumors, although the latter were relatively resistant to sorafenib's growth inhibitory effect in vitro (A. Komuro, M. R.

Thus, the effect of sorafenib on the gastric tumor models in vivo may be mostly due to suppression of tumor angiogenesis, although direct effects of sorafenib on the gastric carcinoma cells may also contribute to its growth inhibitory effect in vivo. In accordance with these results, we found that an anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody effectively reduced the growth of OCUM-2MLN tumors.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. Although we examined the growth of diffuse-type gastric carcinoma in subcutaneous and orthotopic transplantation models, the experiments were conducted with immunocompromised mice. Immune function may affect the growth of diffuse-type gastric carcinoma in human patients. Furthermore, we analyzed the growth of primary tumors but not the metastasis of tumors. The question of whether TGF-&#x003b2; signaling regulates metastasis in a cancer cell&#x02013;autonomous fashion or in a microenvironment-dependent manner should be explored in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that disruption of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in a mouse model of diffuse-type gastric carcinoma, which may be analogous to what occurs during progression of this disease in humans, promotes tumorigenesis by accelerating angiogenesis. Because the loss of T&#x003b2;RII or Smad4 expression has been reported to induce tumor angiogenesis in other types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), the administration of angiogenesis inhibitors, including sorafenib and thrombospondin-1 analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), may be useful as a treatment for those cancers with disrupted TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><grant-sponsor>KAKENHI</grant-sponsor> (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research;
