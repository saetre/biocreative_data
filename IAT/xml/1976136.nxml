Due to the large number of viral genomes now sequenced it is very important that authors present significantly detailed analyses to advance the understanding of the viral genomes. However, there is no report of the <italic>Antheraea pernyi </italic>nucleopolyhedrovirus (AnpeNPV) genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The genome of AnpeNPV, which infects Chinese tussah silkworm (<italic>Antheraea pernyi</italic>), was sequenced and analyzed. The genome was 126,629 bp in size. The G+C content of the genome, 53.4%, was higher than that of most of the sequenced baculoviruses. 147 open reading frames (ORFs) that putatively encode proteins of 50 or more amino acid residues with minimal overlap were determined. Of the 147 ORFs, 143 appeared to be homologous to other baculovirus genes, and 4 were unique to AnpeNPV. Furthermore, there are still 29 and 33 conserved genes present in all baculoviruses and all lepidopteran baculoviruses respectively. In addition, the total number of genes common to all lepidopteran NPVs is sill 74, however the 74 genes are somewhat different from the 74 genes identified before because of some new sequenced NPVs. Only 6 genes were found exclusively in all lepidopteran NPVs and 12 genes were found exclusively in all Group I NPVs. AnpeNPV encodes <italic>v-trex</italic>(Anpe115, a 3' to 5' repair exonuclease), which was observed only in CfMNPV and CfDEFNPV in Group I NPVs. This gene potentially originated by horizontal gene transfer from an ancestral host. In addition, AnpeNPV encodes two <italic>conotoxin</italic>-like gene homologues (<italic>ctls</italic>), <italic>ctl1 </italic>and <italic>ctl2</italic>, which were observed only in HycuNPV, OpMNPV and LdMNPV. Unlike other baculoviruses, only 3 typical homologous regions (<italic>hr</italic>s) were identified containing 2~9 repeats of a 30 bp-long palindromic core. However, 24 perfect or imperfect direct repeats (<italic>dr</italic>s) with a high degree of AT content were found within the intergenic spacer regions that may function as non-<italic>hr</italic>, <italic>ori</italic>-like regions found in GrleGV, CpGV and AdorGV. 9 <italic>dr</italic>s were also found in intragenic spacer regions of AnpeNPV.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>AnpeNPV belongs to Group I NPVs and is most similar to HycuNPV, EppoNPV, OpMNPV and CfMNPV based on gene content, genome arrangement, and amino acid identity. In addition, analysis of genes that flank <italic>hr</italic>s supported the argument that these regions are involved in the transfer of sequences between the virus and host.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The family <italic>Baculoviridae </italic>consists of viruses that contain circular DNA genomes ranging in size from approximately 80 to 180 kbp. This family of viruses has only been shown to be pathogenic to arthropods particularly insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and have a very variable G+C content that ranges from 28% to 59 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The virions have a complex construction and consist of an envelope and a nucleocapsid. Baculoviruses are divided into nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPVs) and granulovirus (GVs) generally. Based on phylogenetic analysis, baculoviruses can be classified into five major groups including GVs, Group I and Group II NPVs, a group of the dipteran viruses, <italic>Culex nigripalpus </italic>NPV (CuniNPV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and a group of the hymenopteran viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. NPVs are mainly found in <italic>Lepidoptera </italic>and other insects such as <italic>Hymenoptera</italic>, <italic>Diptera</italic>, <italic>Coleoptera</italic>, <italic>Thysanura </italic>and <italic>Trichoptera</italic>. The virions contain either single or multiple nucleocapsids. All hymenopteran NPVs virions contain single nucleocapsid. GVs have been found only in <italic>Lepidoptera </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Previous reports demonstrated that there are 29 conserved genes present in all baculoviruses and 33 conserved genes present in all lepidopteran baculoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and a total of 74 genes are present in all lepidopteran NPVs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To date, the complete genomes of 31 NPVs and 8 GVs are published or available in GenBank. 31 NPV genomes have been published from <italic>Autographa californica </italic>NPV (AcMNPV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] to <italic>Neodiprion abietis </italic>NPV (NeabNPV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. 8 GV genomes published include <italic>Xestia c-nigrum </italic>GV (XecnGV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], <italic>Plutella xylostella </italic>GV (PlxyGV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], <italic>Cydia pomonella </italic>GV (CpGV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], <italic>Adoxophyes orana </italic>GV(AdorGV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], <italic>Cryptophlebia leucotreta </italic>GV (CrleGV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and <italic>Choristoneura occidentalis </italic>GV(ChocGV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The Chinese tussah silkworm (also known as Chinese oak silkworm), <italic>Antheraea pernyi </italic>(<italic>Lipidoptera, Saturniidae</italic>), is an insect that can spin silk cocoons and eats the leaves of oak trees. As an important economic insect, <italic>Antheraea pernyi </italic>is commercially cultivated mainly in Middle and Northeastern China. It is also used as a source of food and for cosmetics. <italic>Antheraea pernyi </italic>NPV (AnpeNPV) can infect <italic>Antheraea pernyi </italic>resulting in nuclear polyhedrosis that can potentially result in an outbreak of infectious disease. The average incidence rate of this disease reaches approximately 30% and occasionally reaches above 70%. The yield of cocoons can be decreased by 30% when AnpeNPV occurs. This viral disease has brought about huge economic losses to sericulturist in China.</p><p>AnpeNPV belongs to the lepidopteran family of NPV. The physical map for AnpeNPV genome has been constructed and the genome was estimated at approximately 130 kbp and 128 kbp in size, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

A total of approximately 30 kbp of the genome of AnpeNPV has been sequenced and released in GenBank. In this paper, we report the complete sequence and organization of the AnpeNPV genome. The phylogeny of AnpeNPV in comparison with previously published baculovirus genomes is also addressed. Sequence and analysis of the AnpeNPV genome suggest significance for the epidemiological studies in the research community.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Sequencing, assembly, and analysis of the AnpeNPV genome</title><p>A total of 536 recombinant plasmids containing cloned viral DNA fragments (with <italic>Sau</italic>3AI partial digestion) were obtained. The size of most of the inserted fragments ranged from 2.0 to 5.0 kbp. Both ends of the inserted fragments were sequenced. The complete sequence of AnpeNPV genome was assembled from the sequenced restriction fragments and PCR amplified products. Approximately over 6 times coverage of the genome was achieved.</p><p>The entire AnpeNPV dsDNA genome was sequenced and assembled into a contiguous sequence of 126,629 bp with a G+C content of 53.5% [GenBank: NC_008035]. Of the previously published sequences of AnpeNPV, only <italic>gp64 </italic>[GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY854039">AY854039</ext-link>] showed sequence differences (nt155, nt192, nt989, nt1240, nt1327, nt1380, respectively). The reason may be the variation of different virus isolates. The cytosine of the complement of stop codon of <italic>polyhedrin </italic>was designated as the first nucleotide of the genome. Compared with other baculovirus genomes, the size of AnpeNPV genome was larger than those of NeleNPV, NeseNPV, CuniNPV, EppoNPV, AdhoNPV, PlxyGV, AdorGV, PhopGV and CrleGV. The G+C content of the OpMNPV and LdMNPV genomes was higher than that of the AnpeNPV genome. Only three <italic>hr</italic>s were identified in AnpeNPV genome, but twenty-four perfect or imperfect <italic>dr</italic>s were found in the intergenic spacer regions. In addition, 9 <italic>dr</italic>s were also found in the intragenic spacer regions of AnpeNPV genome. The number of <italic>dr</italic>s in AnpeNPV is by far the most in any baculovirus genome.

An exception regarding the size of the ORF was made for Anpe28 which encoded a protein with 48 amino acid residues and showed high homology with the <italic>ctl-2 </italic>gene of other baculoviruses. The AnpeNPV ORFs demonstrated no preference in terms of orientation (48% (71 times) forward and 52% (76 times) reverse) or clustering based on putative function or expression. Of the 147 identified ORFs, 143 had homologues in at least one other baculovirus and 4 were unique to AnpeNPV. ORF encoding nucleotides accounted for 118,035 bp, <italic>hr</italic>s for 1,095 bp and the remaining 7,499 bp represented intergenic regions. The G+C content of the coding regions was 55%, but the G+C content of intergenic regions was only 32.5%, which was significantly lower than that of coding regions.

Some of these ORFs were also present in one or more GVs. Of these 12 genes, 6 were found exclusively in all lepidopteran NPVs (Anpe26 (ac34), Anpe54 (ac55), Anpe56 (<italic>ChaB</italic>), Anpe96 (<italic>p87</italic>), Anpe100 (ac108), Anpe122 (<italic>calyx</italic>)). De Jong <italic>et al</italic>.(2005) identified 8 ORFs exclusive to all lepidopteran NPVs including ac17, ac21(<italic>arif-1</italic>) and ac57[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, due to the absence of ac17 in ChchNPV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], ac21(<italic>arif-1</italic>) and ac57 in AdhoNPV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], these 3 ORFs are now excluded from this class of ORFs. Including these 12 genes, there were still 74 (29+33+12) lepidopteran NPV specific ORFs. In the work of de Jong <italic>et al</italic>.(2005), 74 baculovirus ORFs were also identified in all lepidopteran NPVs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], however these 74 are not the same as those identified here [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>].

A homologous region between the Anpe142 and Microtuble associated protein of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>was found by BLAST search. The microtuble associated protein is required for the integrity of mitotic spindle. Additionally, a region of Anpe31 showed homology to a carbamate kinase gene of <italic>Streptococcus ratti</italic>.</p><p>In addition, another 27 ORFs [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>] were considered in the class of ORFs found in some Group I NPVs. These genes may be auxiliary genes and give viruses a selective advantage in nature. In these ORFs, Anpe89 and Anpe108 were determined as <italic>bro</italic>, a baculovirus repeated ORF, which are found in almost all baculoviruses. CfdefORF142 and HycuORF148 were identified as genes unique to CfDEFNPV and HycuNPV, respectively, but alignment of Anpe143 to Cfdef142 and Anpe3 to Hycu148 revealed high conservation (34% and 62% amino acid identity, respectively). Anpe110 was a homologue of a gene only found in HycuNPV and OpMNPV (Hycu36 and Op118, 35% and 27% amino acid identity, respectively). Anpe98 and Anpe126 were homologs of genes observed only in AcMNPV and RoNPV. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of Anpe98 (<italic>pnk/pnl</italic>) to ac86 (63% amino acid identity, e = 0) and Ro83 (63% amino acid identity, e = 0) showed high conservation in their amino acid sequences. At the same time, Anpe98, ac86, and Ro83 shared a 175 residue-long NK (Nucleoside/nucleotide kinase) motif. The percentage identity within these regions (98.9%) suggested that they are functionally important regions. Additionally, multiple alignment of Anpe126 (<italic>94 k</italic>) to ac134 and Ro127 revealed that Anpe126 matched to two regions of ac134 and Ro127 in the 5' and 3'ends (aa1-273 and aa 419&#x02013;505 in Anpe126 were 53% and 45% identical at the amino acid level to aa 1&#x02013;277 and aa 712&#x02013;800 in ac134 and Ro127, respectively. aa278-aa711 in ac134 and Ro127 was truncated in Anpe126). On the other hand, Anpe 126 also matched to <italic>94 k </italic>gene of some Group II NPVs and GVs in the two terminal regions. This implied that the function region of <italic>94 k </italic>may be in the two regions. Similarly, Anpe115 was homologous to eukaryotic <italic>trex </italic>gene, which was observed only in CfMNPV, CfDEFNPV and AgMNPV. The <italic>trex </italic>gene encodes a 3' to 5' exonuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Also, multiple alignment of Anpe 115 to Cf114 (65% amino acid identity, e = 4e-84) and Cfdef119 (87% amino acid identity, e = 5e-116) appeared to be highly conservative in their amino acid sequences. Furthermore, Anpe115 was 87% (e = 7e-117) identical at the amino acid level to <italic>v-trex </italic>gene of AgMNPV. Anpe115, Cf114, Cfdef119 and the <italic>v-trex </italic>gene of AgMNPV had a 171 residue-long EXOIII motif (exonuclease domain in DNA-polymerase alpha and epsilon chain, ribonuclease T and other exonucleases). The percentage identity (100%) within these regions indicated that this region was also functionally important. This kind of genes may give AnpeNPV a selective advantage in nature.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional Genes</title><p>Baculoviruses contain a lot of genes involved in essential and selective functions, such as viral replication, transcription, inhibition of apoptosis, protein structure, assembly and auxiliary.

Instead of a putative <italic>hr </italic>between <italic>odv-e56 </italic>and <italic>ie-2 </italic>that is present in HycuNPV, CfMNPV and EppoNPV, this was replaced in AnpeNPV by the unique gene, Anpe140 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>).

Analysis of the genome organization of AnpeNPV and other Group I NPVs demonstrated that there are one gene rearrange region in AnpeNPV with CfDEFNPV, and two gene rearrange regions in AnpeNPV with BmNPV, RoNPV and AcMNPV. Despite its close relation to OpMNPV, CfMNPV, HycuNPV, EppoNPV and CfDEFNPV, the AnpeNPV genome has several distinct features including the presence of 4 genes unique to AnpeNPV(Anpe31, Anpe71, Anpe140 and Anpe142) and 2 genes previously identified as new genes unique to CfDEFNPV and HycuNPV, respectively(Anpe3/Hycu148 and Anpe143/Cfdef142), and that, unlike other baculoviruses there are fewer <italic>hr</italic>s (only 3 in AnpeNPV), more direct repeats (24 in AnpeNPV intergenic spacer regions, 9 in AnpeNPV intragenic spacer regions) and a GT-repeat previously found only in OpMNPV. At the same time, analysis of the genes around the <italic>hr</italic>s of AnpeNPV supported the argument that an ancestral baculovirus acquired genes from ancestral insect hosts that were inserted into the regions around the <italic>hr</italic>s. There are still 29 conserved genes present in all baculoviruses and 33 genes present in all lepidopteran baculoviruses. Besides genes present in all baculoviruses and lepidopteran baculoviruses, 12 ORFs in AnpeNPV were identified in all lepidopteran NPVs.

So far, two <italic>ctls</italic>,<italic>ctl1 </italic>and <italic>ctl2</italic>, are found only in the genomes of AnpeNPV, HycuNPV, OpMNPV and LdMNPV. These differences identified between AnpeNPV and other baculovirus genomes might provide insight into their evolution, host specificity and pathogenicity. The sequence and analysis of AnpeNPV complete genome can provide a continuing resource to better follow the evolution and phylogeny of baculovirus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Virus isolation, construction of genomic DNA libraries</title><p>The AnpeNPV virus (Liaoning strain) was isolated from the natural infected tussah silkworm from a rearing yard in Liaoning province, China by the Liaoning Sericultural Research Institute. To generate a large number of polyhedra, healthy fifth instar tussah silkworms were inoculated in the laboratory and the haemolymph was collected from the sick tussah silkworms, then washed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O and centrifuged several rounds to get pure AnpeNPV polyhedra. The genomic DNA of AnpeNPV was purified according to following protocol: about 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>polyhedra was dissolved in solution (0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 0.15 M NaCl, pH10.4) on ice for 10 minutes, SDS was then added to the final concentration 0.5%, and the solution was kept on the ice for another 10 minutes. The genomic DNA was extracted by the addition of an equal volume phenol (pH8.0) two times and chloroform one time. The DNA was precipitated with 2-volumes ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 0.1 &#x000d7; TE buffer (pH8.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The random viral genomic DNA library was constructed as follows: The viral DNA was partially digested by <italic>Sau</italic>3A I, a restrict endonuclease with a 4-bp recognition site, and the fragments ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 kbp were recovered from an agarose gel. The cohesive ends were filled in partially by incubating with dATP and dGTP in the presence of Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The plasmid vector pUC19 was fully digested by <italic>Sal </italic>I, and subsequently filled in by adding dTTP, dCTP and the Klenow fragment. The vector and genomic fragments were mixed and ligated. The ligation products were transformed into <italic>E. coli </italic>competent cells TG1 and then cultured on LB plates with X-gal/IPTG and Amp (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. White colonies were selected and cultured. A one-step screening of recombinant plasmids was conducted by assessing the size of insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The recombinant plasmids were sequenced with plasmid specific primers and 'primer nesting' from both strands by using BigDye Terminator v3.1 (ABI) on Genetic analyzer 3130XL(ABI).</p></sec><sec><title>Assembly and sequence analysis</title><p>Restriction fragments from recombinant plasmids were sequenced and assembled into contigs using ContigExpress9.1.0 and SeqMan5.0 from the DNASTAR software package. PCR was used to generate gap-spanning fragments and low quality data regions after preliminary assembly. Open reading frames (ORFs) were identified using ORF finder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The criterion for defining an ORF was a size of at least 50 amino acids and minimal overlap. All BLAST searches were done through the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) website using BLAST2.2.14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and local BLAST using PowerBlast1.2.0. Multiple alignments and percentage identities were performed using the Clustal W and MegAlign from the DNASTAR software package. Genome homology plots were generated using GeneQuest5.0 from the DNASTAR software package. <italic>Dr</italic>s were identified by Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF) software with default settings. <italic>hr</italic>s containing palindromes were identified by searching the genome using <italic>hr </italic>consensus sequences reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Clustal W protein alignment based on the 29 core baculovirus genes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZMN carried out the molecular cloning and analysis of the sequences and drafted the manuscript.
