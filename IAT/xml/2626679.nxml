During a healthy immune response, activation-induced deaminase (AID) deaminates cytosines at immunoglobulin (Ig) loci, initiating somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). Protein levels of nuclear AID are tightly controlled, as unregulated expression can lead to alterations in the immune response. Furthermore, hyperactivation of AID outside the immune system leads to oncogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the estrogen&#x02013;estrogen receptor complex binds to the AID promoter, enhancing AID messenger RNA expression, leading to a direct increase in AID protein production and alterations in SHM and CSR at the Ig locus. Enhanced translocations of the c-myc oncogene showed that the genotoxicity of estrogen via AID production was not limited to the Ig locus. Outside of the immune system (e.g., breast and ovaries), estrogen induced AID expression by &#x0003e;20-fold. The estrogen response was also partially conserved within the DNA deaminase family (APOBEC3B, -3F, and -3G), and could be inhibited by tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist. We therefore suggest that estrogen-induced autoimmunity and oncogenesis may be derived through AID-dependent DNA instability.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ACT, actinomycin D; AID, activation-induced deaminase; AID-FM, AID FLAG-Myc&#x02013;tagged AID protein; AMA, &#x003b1;-amanitin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CHX, cycloheximide; CSR, class switch recombination; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;-mt, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; S32A/S36A dominant mutant; mRNA, messenger RNA; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; SHM, somatic hypermutation; sIgM, surface IgM; Tam, tamoxifen.</p></fn><fn><p>G.

The activated B cell undergoes antibody affinity maturation, which in higher vertebrates includes somatic hypermutation (SHM), gene conversion of antigen-binding V regions, and class switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>); all of these processes require activation-induced deaminase (AID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). AID initiates these events by deaminating deoxycytosine to deoxyuracil in DNA (for review see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>]). The resulting dU:dG lesion can be recognized by several different DNA repair pathways to create the aforementioned antibody diversifications. This necessity for immune diversification and sufficiency for genome instability also highlights AID as an important pathogenic regulator. In the immune system, hyper- or hypoexpression of AID can alter autoimmune pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Furthermore, SHM, by way of AID, may contribute to lymphomagenesis by mutating (proto-)oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, or by promoting chromosomal translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). There is strong evidence that AID is required for c-myc translocation, leading to tumorgenesis in a murine model for Burkitt's lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Other nonphysiological AID targets include BCL6, CD95/Fas, RHO/TTF, PAX-5, and PIM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Outside the immune system, there are indications that systemic hyperexpression of AID can induce non&#x02013;B cell cancers from lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), lymphatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) tissues.</p><p>AID has also been implicated as a developmental epigenetic reprogramming factor, and its expression levels in oocytes is almost equivalent to that in lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), suggesting that AID could be regulated by pathways other than B cell activation pathways (e.g., E-box proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>], NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>], and Pax5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>]), with hormones being plausible candidates.</p><p>Several clinical and epidemiological studies have indicated that females can have stronger and more rapid immune responses upon antigen encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). This gender bias is also reflected in the occurrence of pathogenic immune responses, as found in asthma and other autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Several nonimmune pathologies are also strongly influenced by the activity of sex hormones, most notably certain types of cancer. Estrogen and its biological and synthetic derivatives are thought to be oncogenic for breast and ovarian tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), most often being associated with their growth-promoting and differentiating capacity.</p><p>To further elucidate how AID can be regulated, both within and outside the immune system, and to determine which signaling pathways could use DNA deaminases as DNA instability factors, we analyzed the effect of estrogen on AID's expression and on downstream pathways such as SHM and class switch recombination (CSR). We show that AID can be up-regulated by estrogen, whereas tamoxifen (Tam) can inhibit this stimulation. This effect was most pronounced, but not limited to regulation at the level of transcription. Treatment with estrogen increased AID protein expression, enhanced CSR, augmented mutation frequency in Ig and non-Ig genes, and increased the translocation frequency of c-myc. Estrogen-induced AID messenger RNA (mRNA) production was independent of other B cell stimulatory pathways and could be observed outside immune tissue. We were able to identify two potential estrogen response elements (EREs) near the AID promoter, and determined enhanced ER&#x003b1; binding to the promoter after estrogen treatment in vitro and in vivo. APOBEC3, the evolutionarily related DNA deaminases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), were also responsive to estrogen treatment in different tissues and cell types. Our data indicate that the mutagenic DNA deaminases are potentially an important target for hormonal regulation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Differential effect of sex hormones on AID mRNA</title><p>Hormones such as estrogen and progesterone exert their biological effects through binding to their intracellular receptors and, upon entering the nucleus, act as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). To determine the effects of hormones on AID expression, we stimulated isolated murine splenic B cells with IL-4 and LPS, which are known to induce AID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), while adding physiological amounts of progesterone and estrogen. Progesterone addition reduced AID mRNA levels by fivefold, as revealed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This and all subsequent qRT-PCR analyses were normalized to GAPDH expression, and all enhancements or repressions were analyzed as relative changes to DMSO. To observe a stimulatory effect of estrogen, cells were only treated for a short time period (8 h) rather than the usual 24&#x02013;48 h. This was done to avoid a possible maximal induction of LPS/IL-4 caused by longer treatment. In contrast to progesterone, physiological amounts of estrogen were able to enhance AID expression threefold in these cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This antithetical effect of estrogen and progesterone indicated that AID gene regulation is embedded within a systemic sex hormone pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The effects of estrogen and progesterone on AID mRNA in murine splenic B-cells.</bold> (A) AID mRNA in response to estrogen and progesterone treatment in stimulated B cells.

Because we could determine that the expression of gene regulated in breast cancer 1 (a known estrogen response gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>) had a similar stimulation profile in B cells (unpublished data), it seemed likely that the AID gene could also be activated in uninduced B cells with estrogen. Stimulation of isolated splenic B cells with physiological amounts of estrogen produced a sevenfold increase in AID mRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This induction began to plateau at 4 h, with the earliest indication of an increase detectable at &#x0223c;2 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><p>In most systems, the synthetic hormone Tam acts as an antagonist to estrogen stimulation, presumably by binding to the estrogen receptor (ER) and altering its DNA binding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). The presence of Tam during the estrogen treatment of isolated splenic B cells inhibited the stimulatory activity, whereas Tam on its own had only a limited effect on AID mRNA expression at the concentration used (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, Estrogen 1 nM/Tam and Tam, respectively). Interestingly, at very low concentrations, Tam can have a stimulatory effect on AID mRNA (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1</ext-link>), which may reflect Tam's agonistic activity (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Hormonal regulation of AID mRNA is predominantly via transcription</title><p>Although we were able to observe an increase in AID mRNA at 2 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we needed to determine if this regulation was direct or indirect. We pretreated splenic B cells with the translational inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), followed by stimulation with estrogen, and observed an increase in mRNA production equivalent to treatment without inhibitor (Fig. S1 B). This suggested that the effect of estrogen was directly mediated on AID's mRNA synthesis. Because qRT-PCR of cDNA is a readout of steady-state mRNA, we also tested if the increase by estrogen was caused by transcription or mRNA metabolism. Treatment of cells with transcription inhibitors (actinomycin D [ACT] and &#x003b1;-amanitin [AMA]) abrogated the effect of estrogen, indicating that this alteration in AID's mRNA was not caused by message stability (Fig. S1 B). As estrogen can affect pre-mRNA to mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), we designed qRT-PCR primers to span the complete transcription unit of AID (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1</ext-link>). When we compared the relative change in expression of the various pre-mRNA's exons and introns to that of the mature mRNA, we found only a minor effect caused by estrogen treatment (the 5&#x02032;-most PCR unit, &#x0003c;100 bp away from the start of AID gene, was up-regulated to almost the same extent as the mature mRNA [Fig. S2 B]). The intron between exon 3 and 4 (7,538&#x02013;7,689 bp) showed a marginal increase in response to estrogen over that of the mature RNA, indicating a potential region for estrogen-induced splicing of AID RNA. Because the relative change did not significantly alter the overall effect, we did not pursue this analysis further, although recent data suggests that alternative splicing may influence AID expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). The experiments substantiate the notion that estrogen's main mode of action on AID is through transcriptional regulation and not mRNA metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of hormone response elements in the AID promoter regions</title><p>The rapid effect of the hormones on AID message via transcription suggested that the AID gene is a direct target for hormonal regulation. Using bioinformatic analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), we were able to identify putative EREs in the context of other response elements, such as NF-&#x003ba;B. We dissected the 1.5 kb upstream and the 2 kb downstream of the ATG regions for hormone-responsive elements in a heterologous transcription assay. The potential response regions were placed into a luciferase reporter construct and transfected into human SiHa cells, followed by treatment with the indicated hormone (or cotransfected with expression plasmids), and then analyzed for luciferase activity. As we were primarily interested in the effect of hormones on expression, we used relative change as a readout rather than absolute values, which provided a more direct evaluation of the hormone treatment but potentially obscured the individual effect of the various DNA elements. When compared with DMSO treatment, estrogen responsiveness was most significant with Fragment C, indicating that this contained the predominant estrogen-responsive DNA element. Comparable to the mRNA production of AID in B cells, Fragment C also responded in a dose-dependent manner to estrogen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Aside from the putative ERE, Fragment C also harbored the two published NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). As indicated by the qRT-PCR analysis in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, estrogen and the LPS/IL-4&#x02013;induced NF-&#x003ba;B stress-response pathway could act synergistically on AID mRNA production. To more directly stimulate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in SiHa cells, we used the cell-autonomous activator TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Interestingly, aside from the synergy (e.g., 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M), the two maxima of the dose response were offset (TNF-&#x003b1; treated, 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M; untreated, 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M), indicating a higher complexity of the two interacting pathways. To demonstrate independence of the two pathways, we analyzed the response of Fragment C to treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; and estrogen upon cotransfection of the dominant-negative mutant of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; S32A/S36A dominant mutant [I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;-mt]), which is known to inhibit the release of NF-&#x003ba;B from the cytoplasm into the nucleus after stimulation. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, the TNF-&#x003b1; activation was inhibited in the presence of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;-mt, yet estrogen was able to independently activate the transcription. This indicated that in the AID promoter, the NF-&#x003ba;B site and its proximal ERE could act independently as well as synergistically.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Human AID promoter analysis for hormone response elements.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of potential EREs (square) and NF-&#x003ba;B sites (circle) and their respective locations in the human promoter.

Thus, we analyzed ER binding to the AID promoter and focused on the more widely expressed receptor subtype ER&#x003b1;. To analyze the binding of ER to parts of the AID promoter in vitro, we prepared nuclear extracts from treated and untreated cells and performed electromobility shift assays (EMSA). For the biochemical analysis of the ER binding to the ERE, we focused on NF-&#x003ba;B proximal ERE of Fragment C. A 34-bp fragment containing the 5&#x02032;-most proposed ER binding site was incubated with untreated and treated extract (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). The estrogen treatment clearly induced a protein that could bind the fragment (arrow), which was not induced when treating the B cells with TNF-&#x003b1; before extract preparation (lane 4). Cotreatment with estrogen and TNF-&#x003b1; had the same effect as estrogen alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lane 5), indicating that the two pathways act through different nuclear proteins. Competition experiments with the ER binding site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;8) or a mutation of the proposed ER site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;11) showed a specific competition, indicating ER-like binding kinetics. Using antibodies to the DNA-binding domain of ER&#x003b1; strongly inhibited the formation of the estrogen-induced band (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, lanes 2 vs. 3&#x02013;5), but the shift was unaffected by a control antibody (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, lanes 2 vs. 6&#x02013;8, arrow).

To that end, we probed the published NF-&#x003ba;B site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) with our extracts.

As with the ER binding site, NF-&#x003ba;B binding was not altered by cotreatment with estrogen and TNF-&#x003b1; (Fig. S3 B, lanes 4 vs. 5). This indicated that the respective treatments did not alter the general DNA-binding properties of ER or NF-&#x003ba;B proteins. Because the distance, on the AID promoter, between the ER and NF-&#x003ba;B sites was larger than our EMSA probes (i.e., neither probe contained both binding sites), we could not study the effect of cooperative binding.</p></sec><sec><title>ER binding to AID promoter in vivo</title><p>Although the in vitro binding of the ER to the AID promoter indicated a direct binding, we also wanted to probe this interaction in vivo. To this end, we used the constitutive AID-expressing and mutating Burkitt lymphoma Ramos cells and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, followed by qRT-PCR. Treated cells were fixed, lysed, DNA sheared, and ER&#x003b1; or NF-&#x003ba;B immunoprecipitated, and the DNA was released for PCR. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>, the anti-ER antibody specifically immunoprecipitated the AID promoter upon estrogen stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. A control antibody was unable to precipitate this region. Analogous to the EMSA assay, we did not detect a significant increase in ER binding to AID promoter when we co-stimulated with TNF-&#x003b1;, just as TNF-&#x003b1; treatment alone did not enhance ER binding. Again, cotreatment of cells with Tam and estrogen before ChIP did reduce the binding of ER&#x003b1; to the AID promoter, whereas Tam on its own did not significantly alter ER&#x003b1; binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>, E 10/Tam and Tam, respectively), providing further evidence for a direct binding of ER&#x003b1; to the AID promoter.

We generated a DT40 cell line (a cell line derived from a chicken B cell lymphoma that constitutively expresses AID and undergoes Ig diversification) to express a double tag (3xFLAG-2xTEV-3xc-Myc) fused to the C terminal exon of endogenous AID (AID FLAG-Myc&#x02013;tagged AID protein [AID-FM]; Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1</ext-link>). The modified DT40 express a WT AID protein and an AID-FM fusion protein, both transcribed from the endogenous AID locus. Comparing the qRT-PCR induction kinetics with that of the AID-FM expression, we determined that the steady-state levels of AID protein correlated to those of the mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Using the translation inhibitor CHX (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), we showed that estrogen was not able to increase AID-FM expression in the absence of translation. In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), estrogen increased AID-FM production above that of the MG-132 alone, indicating that estrogen was not acting on the proteasome to increase AID-FM activity.

To analyze CSR, isolated mouse splenic B cells were treated with different combinations of cytokines and hormones. B cell stimulation with LPS, LPS and IL-4, LPS and IFN-&#x003b3;, or LPS and TGF-&#x003b2; results in switching to IgG3, IgG1, IgG2a, or IgG2b/IgA, respectively. To ensure we could correlate AID activity precisely, and to avoid possible proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of estrogen on stimulated B cells, we monitored the early molecular events of class switching. One of the molecular intermediates during class switching is the generation of a looped-out circular DNA called a switch circle (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1</ext-link>). The circular DNA contains a recombined transcription unit that produces switch circle transcripts; it is generated from the promoter of the downstream switch region and the Ig&#x003bc; switch region. Using a previously described qRT-PCR approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), we were able to show enhanced switching to IgG1, IgG3, IgA, or IgE after hormone treatment of splenic B cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Presumably through the increased production of AID, estrogen was able to enhance switch circle formation for all subclasses tested.

Indicated amounts of estrogen and/or Tam were added to the cells together with cytokines. Relative efficiency of class switching was determined by detecting circle transcripts with qRT-PCR, and data are normalized to the control treatment with DMSO from three independent experiments (error bars indicate standard deviations).

Ramos cells were grown in the presence of 100 nM estrogen for &#x0223c;20 doublings, followed by sequencing of 341 bp from human VH or 750 bp from human CD95/Fas locus. Splenic mouse cells were treated for 6 d with LPS and 10 nM estrogen, and switch gamma3 loci amplified and sequenced (Fig. S7).

A 3-wk estrogen treatment of Ramos HS13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), which possesses a premature stop codon embedded within the AID target motif WRC, showed enhanced surface Ig expression and VH SHM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1</ext-link>). Because Ramos expresses constitutive amounts of AID, estrogen treatment did not enhance AID production substantially; thus, we used the ex vivo treatment of spleens as a means to detect mutations in the switch region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). To this end, we treated LPS-activated splenic B cells with 10 nM estrogen for 6 d and sequenced the S&#x003b3;3 region.

As can be seen in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and Fig. S7, there was a significant (P &#x0003c; 0.02) enhancement of mutation frequency in the switch region after estrogen treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Enhanced non-Ig loci targeting of AID</title><p>It is known that AID can be mistargeted to non-Ig genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). The effect of aberrant AID targeting can lead to somatic mutations or even translocations of protooncogenes or tumor suppressors, and subsequently to oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). To determine if the activity of hormones via AID can also lead to an alteration in non-Ig loci, we chose to look at the proapoptotic tumor suppressor CD95/Fas. CD95/Fas has been shown to be somatically hypermutated in human B cells, albeit 100&#x02013;1,000-fold less frequently than the Ig genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). We analyzed the effects of estrogen on CD95/Fas mutations in Ramos HS13. As with the physiological B cell maturation events of SHM and CSR, estrogen was able to increase the potentially pathogenic mutation frequency in CD95/Fas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref> and Fig. S7 B). Because of the direct effect on AID function (mutation), this data provides evidence for a novel way in which estrogen can exert a direct genotoxic effect on oncogenes or tumor suppressors.</p></sec><sec><title>Estrogen enhances c-myc IgH translocations</title><p>The off-target effect of AID was also detected in recent work on chromosome translocations of the c-myc oncogene into the IgH locus. More importantly, the levels of AID protein directly influenced chromosome translocation frequency. This was determined from both the analysis of AID haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) and microRNA regulation of AID protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). In both cases, reduced levels of AID had a direct bearing on the number of observed c-myc/IgH translocations. Using a previously described assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>), we were able to determine that estrogen treatment of isolated splenic B cells enhances c-myc/IgH translocations in p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref> and Fig. S8, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1</ext-link>). Although, the overall frequency of translocations was low, we have not been able to observe any translocations in LPS/DMSO-treated spleen cells, yet we observed five (two in one experiment and three in another) translocations in the LPS/estrogen treatment. This highlights the importance of regulating AID protein amounts within a cell, and the potential pathogenic consequences of unregulated AID expression.</p></sec><sec><title>AID induction is not limited to B cells</title><p>In the past, we demonstrated that AID mRNA expression is not limited to activated B cells, but can also be detected in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).

Analysis of dissected organs and tissue from mice showed AID responsiveness to hormones outside the immune system in breast and ovarian tissue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). As we were primarily interested in the hormone sensitivity of the transcripts, we determined the relative fold stimulation compared with DMSO, which did not reflect the absolute AID mRNA in each tissue. Interestingly, in ovaries, AID mRNA was induced almost 25-fold, which is higher than in any other organ or tissue. Because isolated oocytes produce AID mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), we suggest that the increase was predominantly caused by oocytes or other ovarian-derived tissue, rather than infiltrating lymphocytes.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Estrogen induces AID and Apobec3 transcription in mouse tissue.</bold> The red and blue colors indicate the results for mApobec3 and mAID, respectively.

The correlation between the expression of hormones or their cognitive receptors and development of pathologies, has led to several different hypotheses; most of which involve hyperactivation of cell proliferation, unregulated differentiation, alteration in DNA repair, or repression of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Here, we propose another means by which estrogen can be a genotoxin, by directly inducing DNA deaminases such as AID. Our initial experiment using progesterone and estrogen identified AID as being part of a hormonally regulated system. Estrogen exerted its activity through the estrogen&#x02013;ER complex, directly binding to the AID promoter, whereas our preliminary data suggests that progesterone acts through an estrogen-independent pathway (unpublished data). The consequences of estrogen activation on AID mRNA could also be detected as an increase in AID protein and enhanced downstream physiological effects, such as SHM and CSR. Interestingly, AID activation (mRNA) by estrogen was more pronounced than the effect on SHM. This could indicate that although AID production is necessary for SHM, other factors (e.g., lesion processing, AID targeting, etc) can play a significant role in overall SHM efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Similar to SHM, CSR was enhanced upon estrogen treatment, but was lagging behind AID mRNA production. The most dramatic effect from estrogen-induced overexpression of AID was seen at the level of c-myc/IgH translocations. This is analogous to the recent observations that the effect of AID mRNA down-regulation (either by microRNA targeting or haploinsufficiency) was most pronounced at the level of translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>).</p><p>Autoimmunity encompasses a broadly defined area of clinical pathologies that stem from abnormalities in numerous systemic, cellular, and molecular mechanisms, a subset of which are B cell&#x02013;related pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). In systemic lupus erythematosus, abnormalities in B cell development and the production of autoreactive antibodies play an important pathological role. Overexpression of AID in autoimmune-prone mice induced a more severe systemic lupus erythematosus&#x02013;like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), whereas breeding AID-deficient mice with autoimmune-prone MRL/lpr mice significantly reduced the onset and extent of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), indicating that alterations in AID can change the severity of B cell autoimmunity. Correlating our data with the known effects of estrogen on autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>), we propose that the effect of sex-hormones on autoimmunity could partially be through AID transcription and subsequent increase in genome instability. In addition to the direct binding of the estrogen&#x02013;ER complex to the AID promoter, estrogen may also hyperstimulate AID production through the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, as we were able to demonstrate that cotreatment of TNF-&#x003b1; and estrogen enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B binding to the AID promoter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Whether this effect is caused by protein&#x02013;protein interaction or estrogen-induced chromatin modification has yet to be determined, but the synergistic or even cooperative interaction of two important autoimmune modulator pathways on AID expression may have substantially pathogenic effects. There are several hypotheses on how unregulated AID can affect autoimmunity in addition to overstimulation of SHM and CSR, e.g., debilitating mutations in the signaling pathways, of tumor suppressors, or of proapoptotic genes, or alterations that activate oncogenes or antiapoptotic genes (for review see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>]).</p><p>Mutation and subsequent loss of growth control is usually associated with oncogenesis, and this similarity with autoimmunity has previously been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>) (e.g., mutations in CD95/Fas have been associated with autoimmunity, as well as B cell lymphomas). Therefore, our data on estrogen-induced mutations in CD95/Fas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and Fig. S7), derived from increased AID production, may provide a novel molecular mechanism that is important for both pathologies. AID's targeting outside the Ig locus, its apparently crucial involvement with germinal center&#x02013;derived B cell malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>), and its ability to cause various malignancies when overexpressed in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>) are strong indicators for AID's oncogenic potential.</p><p>Estrogen is one of the most important and thoroughly studied mitogenic agents in cancer, but it does not possess any direct DNA mutability, and induces transformation by proliferation. In vitro, high concentrations of estrogen derivatives (usually metabolites) can form DNA adducts or produce reactive oxygen-damaging DNA (for review see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>]), but their role as physiological genotoxins is limited. Furthermore, because the estrogen derivative Tam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>) can inhibit estrogen's oncogenesis in breast cancer, it is unlikely that estrogen (or its derivatives) form DNA adducts under those conditions. It is interesting to note that the antagonistic activity of Tam has recently been used to inhibit some of the pathologies of estrogen-induced autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). On the other hand, because of the pharmacological action of Tam (binding and altering the ER DNA binding capacity), under certain circumstances Tam acts as an estrogen agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>). This activity leads to an increased risk in secondary (e.g., ovarian) cancer after Tam treatment for breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Thus, our findings that low concentrations of Tam induced AID mRNA (Fig. S1) also suggest that Tam acts as an agonist and indicates that the proposed usage of synthetic estrogen derivatives as a means to inhibit AID has to be carefully evaluated. Future work on identifying a potential role of AID in mouse models of hormonally induced cancers may provide further evidence on how AID can act as an environmentally stimulated oncogene.</p><p>As our data indicate, AID's response to estrogen seems to have been evolutionarily conserved among the APOBEC3 family members, different tissues, and cell lines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Fig. S8); mouse Apobec3 and human APOBEC3B, -3F, and -3G (and -H to a lesser extent) mRNA were induced by estrogen treatment. In the past, we have hypothesized that the predominant function of AID and its evolved DNA deaminase family members was to inactivate foreign DNA in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>).
