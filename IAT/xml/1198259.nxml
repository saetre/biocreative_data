Among subjects developing Be-hypersensitivity, all show sensitization, i.e. T-cell reactivity to Be revealed by either a blood or a bronchalveolar lavage cell test. Less than 50% of subjects with BH present which chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] i.e., with chronic granuloma formation in the lung maintained by the accumulation in the lower respiratory tract of CD4+ T-cells responding to Be as a specific antigen/hapten [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], presenting an effector-memory phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and producing Th1 cytokines upon Be stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The observation that beryllium disease affects only 1 to 16% of Be-exposed individuals led to the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In 1993, the HLA-DP supratypic variant characterized by a glutamic acid at position 69 of the HLA-DP molecule &#x003b2; chain (DPGlu69) was identified as a genetic marker of susceptibility to BH, an observation subsequently confirmed by seven independent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Two independent studies have also identified the HLA-DPGlu69 marker as the immune response gene responsible for presentation of Be to Be-specific T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and an immunochemical study has suggested that the structural basis for Be presentation by the HLA-DPGlu69 positive molecule is in its unique ability to bind beryllium with high affinity possibly in the context of a coordination bond formed by the contribution of other electron donor groups present in the fourth pocket of the peptide binding groove of the HLA-DP molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further, antibody inhibition studies have shown that Be-presentation to blood and lung T-cells in DPGlu69-positive subjects is inhibited almost exclusively by anti-HLA-DP antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], strongly indicating HLA-DPGlu69 as the immune response gene used by DPGlu69-positive subjects i.e., about 80% of the BH affected population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, the HLA gene which might function as the immune response gene in DPGlu69-negative BH-affected subjects i.e., in the remaining 20% of the BH affected population, has not yet been determined.</p><p>Previous studies have identified the HLA-DRB1 alleles belonging to the *01 group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] as negatively associated with berylliosis, while the HLA-DRB1 variants Ser11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], Tyr26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], Asn37 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], Glu71 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and Arg74 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and the HLA-DQ variant Gly86 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] were positively associated with BH. Analysis of the role of these markers has, however, been hampered by the small size of the populations examined in most studies. In all studies published so far, the putative susceptibility markers covered only 40 to 50% of the DPGlu69-negative subjects. In this context, our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] on 45 individuals affected by beryllium sensitization with or without demonstrable lung granulomas, showed that HLA-DR Arg74 and Tyr26 were associated with sensitization without lung granulomas, and HLA-DP Glu69 with sensitization accompanied by lung granulomas, thereby suggesting a different role for Glu69 and these markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, in the HLA-DPGlu69 negative subjects reported in the Saltini et al. study population, HLA-DR Arg74 and Tyr26 were expressed only by 11 out of 19 DPGlu69 negative sensitized subjects 10 of which without and one with demonstrable lung granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In another study in the field conducted by Rossman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] evaluating 56 BH affected subjects, four out of seven DPGlu69 negative patients carried either DRAsn37, DRGlu71 or DQGly86 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Finally, Maier and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], in 19 HLA-DP Glu69-negative BH subjects, found that HLA-DRB1*13 alleles were associated with BH susceptibility; however, they were only expressed by 12 of these subjects.</p><p>In order to search for this(these) disease associated immune response gene(s), we re-evaluated a previously described population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] after a follow up of 7 years that allowed us to extend the study to other 29 newly identified BH subjects (14 with biopsy proven lung granulomas and 15 with Be-sensitization without lung granulomas) for a total number of 74 BH subjects and 86 Be-exposed controls. This panel included a sufficiently large number of DPGlu69-negative subjects to analyze phenotypic frequencies of all aminoacid variants of the HLA-DPB1, -DQB1, -DRB1, -DRB3, -DRB4 and DRB5 genes in BH affected and Be exposed controls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The study population, already described in part in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], includes 86 Be exposed healthy controls and 74 subjects affected by beryllium hypersensitivity, all working in the same beryllium manufacturing plant, 45 of whom (23 Be-sensitized subjects and 22 berylliosis affected i.e., Be-sensitized subjects with biopsy proven lung granulomas) have been already described in the Saltini et al. report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

As a result, only HLA-DRPhe47 (OR 2.956, p &#x0003c; 0.05) was identified as independently associated with BH in the HLA-DPGlu69-negative subgroup, hence suggesting that the other HLA-DRB1, -DRB3 and -DQB1 loci shown in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> could be associated with BH due to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRPhe47. Of the 22 HLA-DPGlu69 negative subjects with BH, 21 were HLA-DRPhe47 (16 Be sensitized and 5 berylliosis affected) and only one, a Be sensitized individual, was HLA-DPGlu69 and HLA-DRPhe47 negative.</p><p>Further, in order to identify which of the HLA isotypic molecules associated with BH could function as the restriction elements of Be-stimulated T-cell proliferation in HLA-DPGlu69-negative subjects, we analyzed PBMC proliferation in response to BeSO<sub>4 </sub>in a subgroup of 15 BH affected subjects, using antibodies directed against HLA-DR, HLA-DQ and HLA-DP as probes to identify the antigen presentation restricting molecule.</p><p>In four HLA-DPGlu69-negatives, Be-stimulated T-cell proliferation was inhibited by the anti-HLA-DR MoAb (range 70&#x02013;92% inhibition) significantly more than by the anti-HLA-DP MoAb (range: 6&#x02013;29%; p &#x0003c; 0.02 compared to anti-HLA-DR) while it was not affected at all by the anti-HLA-DQ, anti-HLA class I or the anti-MTB19 control antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), suggesting a role for the HLA-DR molecule in the presentation of Be in the HLA-DPGlu69-negative subjects.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the re-evaluation of this patient population shows a higher prevalence of HLA-DPGlu69 among the subjects with lung granulomas compared to the Be-sensitized without lung involvement (86% vs 55%, p = 0.008). However, not having identified any case of disease progression from beryllium sensitization to lung disease during the 7.0 years follow-up, we could not formally assess the association of the HLA-DPGlu69 marker with progression from sensitization to disease, although the knowledge that HLA-DPGlu69 is the primary immune response gene of beryllium hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] makes it attractive to hypothesize that the gene might induce a stronger immune reaction hence inducing granuloma formation as suggested by Maier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] in which 11 out of 12 subjects progressed from sensitization to disease status were HLA-DPGlu69 positives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], as well as in more recent publication in which Be-sensitized subjects progress to berylliosis at a rate of 6&#x02013;8% per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, it could be also considered that all these data could be inferred by the possibility of misdiagnosis in the identification of the Beryllium induced granuloma.</p><p>The finding that a sizeable fraction of BH affected subjects, varying from 3 to 27% in published reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], do not carry HLA-DPGlu69 has indicated that other HLA molecules may provide the restriction element of Be-stimulated T-cell proliferation and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of susceptibility to BH.</p><p>In this regard, with all the limitations imposed by the need of performing specific antigen presentation studies using specific reagents such as HLA-DRPhe47 restricted antigen presenting cells and/or HLA-DRPhe47-engineered transfectants as already made for HLA-DPGlu69 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the T-cell studies using isotype-specific inhibition of BeSO<sub>4</sub>-stimulated T-cell proliferation with anti-HLA isotype specific antibodies in HLA typed subjects support the notion that HLA-DR genes are implicated in beryllium presentation in HLA-DPGlu69-negative. A role for HLA-DRPhe47 in Be presentation is conceivable, and the data presented suggest it.</p><p>In fact, multiple analysis has indicated that the HLA-DR aminoacid variants Ser13, Tyr26, His32, Asn37, Arg74 are indirectly associated with beryllium hypersensitivity due to linkage disequilibrium with Phe47. It is worth noticing that this analysis accounts for the association of HLA-DRArg74 and HLA-DRTyr26 with beryllium sensitization found in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These markers were identified for their positive and negative association of HLA-DR alleles with disease or sensitization using univariate analysis in the overall population analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], while in this re-evaluation of the same study population after 7-years of follow up including more subjects with Be-sensitization and disease we could use multiple logistic regression multivariate analysis on HLA-DPGlu69-negative subjects only. The fact that the alleles of the HLA-DRB1*03 group (alleles found associated with Be-sensitization and not disease in the previous evaluation of this study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]) carrying almost exclusively the HLA-DRArg74 and HLA-DRTyr26 are also carrying HLA-DRPhe47 support the notion of the linkage disequilibrium between them. Further, only a fraction of HLA-DPGlu69-negative carry only HLA-DRArg74 and -DRTyr26 (10 out of 22; 45.5%) while all except one (21 out of 22, 95.5%) carry HLA-DRPhe47 suggesting that more than an allele or set of them is a residue and the role play in the HLA-class II peptide binding pocket where he is mapping involved in the Be-presentation to T-cell determining Be-susceptibility.</p><p>Consistent with the T-cell antibody inhibition study, multiple regression analysis also indicates that the association between the HLA-DQ marker Leu26 and BH is attributable to linkage disequilibrium between HLA-DR and HLA-DQ loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It is well known that the HLA-DQLeu26 residue is expressed by all the HLA-DQB1*02 alleles and most of *03 and *06 alleles that are in linkage with the HLA-DRB1*03, 11, 12, 13 or 15 alleles which, in turn, express HLA-DRPhe47. Similar to our data, Maier and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] obtained evidence for an association of HLA-DQB1*06, a Leu26 expressing group of alleles, with BH in HLA-DPGlu69-negative subjects. They too attributed the increased frequency of this HLA-DQ marker to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DR and in particular to HLA-DR*13 alleles, a group of alleles expressing Phe47 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The data of this study take the above observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] a step further by suggesting that the HLA-DR gene, possibly the HLA-DRPhe47 supratypic variant, ought to play a functional role in Be presentation, as this (Tyr/Phe 47) polymorphism is known to be important for peptide binding and presentation to T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, HLA-DRPhe47 has been also implicated in susceptibility to the histopathological alike of berylliosis, sarcoidosis, in a very large case control population study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>How might the HLA-DRPhe47 molecule bind beryllium? Potolicchio et al. have shown that cobalt binds directly to polymorphic residue(s), likely Glu69 and/or Glu56, of the HLA-DP molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and this model may apply to beryllium interaction with HLA-DP. On the other hand, Lu et al. have recently reported that nickel interacts both with the HLA-DR backbone, with the non-polymorphic His in position 81 of the HLA-DR &#x003b2;-chain, and with a bound peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This latter mechanism could also be envisioned for beryllium interaction with HLA-DRPhe47. Residue 47 of the HLA-DR &#x003b2;-chain is located in pocket 7, together with residues 65 and 69 of the &#x003b1;-chain and residues 28, 30, 61, 67, 70 of the &#x003b2;-chain, involving to some extent residues 71 and 74 of the &#x003b2;-chain which however do primarily contribute to pocket 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In pocket 7, besides residue 47, only residues 28, 67 and 70 of the &#x003b2; chain are polymorphic. Interestingly, all of the alleles carrying the HLA-DRPhe47 in the HLA-DPGlu69-negative BH subjects, expressed always an aspartic acid residue 28 of the &#x003b2;-chain and either an aspartic acid or a glutamine, both residues which, together with the asparagine and tryptophan present at the non polymorphic residues 69 of the &#x003b1;-chain and 61 of the &#x003b2;-chain, could coordinate the positive charge of Be for presentation to Be-specific T-cells. The spatial relationships between the residues potentially involved may be defined precisely from the crystal structure of HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels A-B). As seen from the crystal structure, when Phe47 in pocket 7 is substituted for by Tyr47 in the HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 molecules, the hydrogen of the Tyr47 hydroxyl is engaged in a hydrogen bound network with the aspartic acid at position 28 and glutamine at position 70 of the &#x003b2;-chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels C-D), thereby preventing their participation in coordinating the charge of the Be ion. Thus, the presence of Phe47 in pocket 7 of the HLA-DR molecule could favor Be binding. Furthermore, the HLA-DR molecules carrying Phe47 could coordinate Be together with a bound peptide with a mechanism similar to that described for nickel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A number of considerations are likely to support this hypothesis. First, the distance between the different electron donor groups in the crystal structure of HLA-DR molecules carrying Phe47 lies between 6.7 and 12.6 &#x000c5; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] i.e., very close to the upper limits of a coordination bond with Be. Second, the two electron donor (non-polymorphic) residues &#x003b1;69 (Asn) and &#x003b2;61 (Trp) of HLA-DR pocket 7 are known to be involved in the formation of H-bonds with the backbone of the peptide antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and would therefore be unable to directly coordinate Be. Finally, the pocket 7 of HLA-DR allelic variants carrying Phe47 are capable of binding, with higher affinity than pocket 7 carrying Tyr47, aminoacid side chains with electron donor groups such as Asn, His, Met, Trp and Tyr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Analysis of the H-bond network in the pocket 7, the peptide binding pocket where the HLA-DR residue &#x003b2;47 is mapping, of HLA-DR molecules carrying HLA-DRPhe47 (Panel A: HLA-DR3 and Panel B: HLA-DR15) or its counterpart Tyr47 (Panel C: HLA-DR1 and Panel D: HLA-DR4). Molecular modelling of the PDB entry crystal structures (HLA-DR3: 1A6A; HLA-DR15: 1BX2; HLA-DR1: 1AQD; HLA-DR4: 2SEB) have been evaluated with the SwissPDB viewer v3.7b2 software (free available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ca.expasy.org/spdbv/"/>). The HLA-DR &#x003b1;-chain backbone is reported in red colored ribbon style, while the HLA-DR &#x003b2;-chain backbone is reported in grey colored ribbon. Aminoacids are colored in CPK style (C: light blue; O: red; N: blue) and residue names are reported in red. H-bonds were computed with the SwissPDB viewer (H-bond detection threshold: 1.20&#x02013;2.76 A when Hydrogen is present and 2.19&#x02013;3.30 A when Hydrogen is absent) and are shown as green dashed lines. All the aminoacids presenting electron donor groups in the pocket 7, of HLA-DR1, -DR3, -DR4 and -DR15, putatively capable of coordinating Be are shown (residues &#x003b1;69, &#x003b2;28, &#x003b2;61, &#x003b2;70 and &#x003b2;71). In the HLA-DR3 crystal structure (Panel A) with the presence of Phe47 only one of the two terminal oxygens of Asp&#x003b2;28 is engaged in a H-bond network with Lys71, leaving four other contacts points for co-ordinating Be (specifically residues &#x003b1;Asn69, &#x003b2;Asp28, &#x003b2;Trp61, &#x003b2;Gln70). A similar pattern is present in HLA-DR15 (Panel B) where, with the presence of Phe47, no H-bonds are present leaving 5 electron donor groups available for Be coordination (specifically one electron donor group for each residue &#x003b1;Asn69, &#x003b2;Trp61, &#x003b2;Gln70 and two electron donor groups for &#x003b2;Asp28). When Tyr47, the HLA-DRPhe47 counterpart, is present in HLA-DR molecules as in HLA-DR1 (panel C) and HLA-DR4 (Panel D), the H-bond network of pocket 7 results dramatically modified. Specifically, Tyr47 engages in a H-bond network with residues Asp28 and Arg71 in HLA-DR1 (Panel C) or Asp28 and Lys71 in HLA-DR4 (Panel D). As a consequence there is reduced availability of electron donor groups capable to coordinate Be.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1465-9921-6-94-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, both the HLA typing and the <italic>in vitro </italic>T-cell data in this study indicate a role for HLA-DR genes in determining susceptibility to beryllium hypersensitivity among individuals not expressing the HLA-DPGlu69 variant. The typing data point to the HLA-DRPhe47 supratypic variant as the susceptibility gene in this sub-population, and analysis of the molecule's structure suggests that HLA-DRPhe47 could bind beryllium and present it to T-cells, using a mechanism different from what used by HLA-DPGlu69. Together, HLA-DPGlu69 and HLA-DRPhe47 could account for susceptibility in almost 100% of the affected population.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>1.
