Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) exhibit flow- and stretch-dependent responses and are widely used as a model for studying mechanotransduction in mammalian cells. Platelet EC adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) is tyrosine phosphorylated when ECs are exposed to flow or when PECAM-1 is directly pulled, suggesting that it is a mechanochemical converter. We show that PECAM-1 phosphorylation occurs when detergent-extracted EC monolayers are stretched, indicating that this phosphorylation is mechanically triggered and does not require the intact plasma membrane and soluble cytoplasmic components. Using kinase inhibitors and small interfering RNAs, we identify Fyn as the PECAM-1 kinase associated with the model. We further show that stretch- and flow-induced PECAM-1 phosphorylation in intact ECs is abolished when Fyn expression is down-regulated. We suggest that PECAM-1 and Fyn are essential components of a PECAM-1&#x02013;based mechanosensory complex in ECs.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: BAEC, bovine aortic EC; EC, endothelial cell; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HAEC, human arterial EC; HUVEC, human umbilical vein EC; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs; PECAM-1, platelet EC adhesion molecule 1; VEGFR, VEGF receptor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanical force regulates a variety of physiological processes involved in cellular functions, development of tissues and organs, and the health of an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Orr et al., 2006</xref>). Although the mechanisms by which cells sense and convert mechanical force into intracellular biochemical signals have been a subject of keen interest, the problem is not easy to approach experimentally. However, some experimental systems have been developed in recent years to study specific mechanotransduction pathways. For example, Sheetz and his associates made detergent-extracted cell models and in vitro protein extension systems that can elicit certain mechanoresponses and be analyzed biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sawada and Sheetz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sawada et al., 2006</xref>). We, and others, have attached microbeads coated with either antibodies or ligands specific for cell surface proteins onto cultured cells and mechanically stimulated the cells by tugging on the beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tzima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). These studies are beginning to reveal molecular mechanisms for mechanotransduction by specific proteins.</p><p>Endothelial cells (ECs) are known to respond to fluid shear stress and mechanical stretch and are regarded as one of the best known mammalian cell systems for studying mechanotransduction. Ion channels, integrins, glycocalyx, and G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors are thought to be involved in fluid shear stress sensing by ECs because either flow provokes their activities or disruption of their function down-regulates certain flow-dependent responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Resnick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2005</xref>). However, it remains largely unknown how these molecules convert mechanical force into intracellular signaling. Platelet EC adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) is a cell adhesion molecule localized to interendothelial contacts. It forms trans-homophilic associations extracellularly and contributes to the formation and maintenance of an EC monolayer. In addition to being a cell adhesion molecule, it appears to have roles in cell signaling, as its short cytoplasmic domain contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), a motif known to be involved in signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Woodfin et al., 2007</xref>). When the tyrosine residue in the ITIM is phosphorylated, it associates with SHP-2 (SH2 domain&#x02013;containing protein tyrosine phosphatase) and activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Milarski and Saltiel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jackson et al., 1997</xref>). We have found that when cultured ECs are exposed to physiological levels of shear stress, PECAM-1 ITIMs are phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation mediates ERK activation by fluid shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Masuda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tai et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, these shear stress&#x02013;dependent responses occur when a pulling force is applied directly to PECAM-1 on the cell surface using magnetic beads coated with antibodies against the external domain of PECAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osawa et al., 2002</xref>). This experiment suggests that PECAM-1 responds directly to mechanical force, transducing mechanical force into a biochemical signal. Because PECAM-1 has no intrinsic kinase activity, some kinase must be involved in PECAM-1 phosphorylation, and identifying the kinase is essential to elucidating the mechanism for PECAM-1 mechanotransduction.</p><p>The presence of a mechanotransducer protein complex at cell&#x02013;cell contacts has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liebner et al., 2006</xref>), and PECAM-1 may be a key molecule in such a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tzima et al., 2005</xref>). We hypothesized that the kinase that phosphorylates PECAM-1 might be a component of such a complex. In this study, we made a detergent-extracted cytoskeletal model of EC monolayers that retained PECAM-1 localization at interendothelial contacts and investigated PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in it by stretch. We found that when the EC model was stretched in the presence of ATP, PECAM-1 was phosphorylated. Because PECAM-1 phosphorylation did not require exogenous kinase, the kinase that phosphorylated PECAM-1 must be a component of the cell model. Using several inhibitors targeted to different sets of tyrosine kinases, we identified Src, Yes, and Fyn as possible PECAM-1 kinases. Then, we used a siRNA technique to show that Fyn, not Src and Yes, was the kinase required for PECAM-1 phosphorylation in stretched cell models. To investigate if Fyn was also involved in stretch-induced PECAM-1 phosphorylation in intact ECs, we stretched ECs treated with Fyn, Src, or Yes siRNA and found that PECAM-1 phosphorylation was inhibited only by Fyn siRNA. PECAM-1 phosphorylation by flow was also inhibited by Fyn siRNA. Identification of Fyn as the kinase for mechanical force-elicited PECAM-1 phosphorylation provides significant insights into PECAM-1&#x02013;dependent mechanosignaling in ECs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Stretch-induced PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in live and detergent-extracted ECs</title><p>Confluent ECs were cultured on an elastic silicone membrane that was uniaxially extended by 5&#x02013;25% of the original length, causing the cells to be stretched. Increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation, a hallmark of signaling activity, became detectable within a few minutes of stretch, peaked at 10 min, and then gradually diminished (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801062/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801062/DC1</ext-link>). When ECs were stained with anti&#x02013;protein phosphotyrosine (4G10), interendothelial contacts of stretched cells became more prominently stained (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), suggesting that cell&#x02013;cell contacts are a major stretch-induced mechanosignaling site. Initially, experiments were done using cyclic stretch, but this creates movement of the culture medium, causing cells to be exposed to both fluid shear stress and stretch. To avoid this situation, we used a single sustained stretch where the silicon membrane remained stretched throughout the experiment. The membrane was stretched gently so that the shear effect would be small. For example, we took 3 s to stretch the chamber by 7.5 mm (25% stretch), thus exposing cells to a flow velocity of 2.5 mm/s at the beginning of stretch experiments. Although data from cyclic stretch experiments were more variable, cells responded to both forms of stretch in a similar manner (Fig. S2). The data illustrated are from sustained stretch experiments unless otherwise stated.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Stretch-induced PECAM-1 phosphorylation in intact ECs.</bold> (A) Confluent BAECs cultured on an elastic substrate were stretched (25% elongation) for 5 min or left unstretched and stained with anti&#x02013;protein phosphotyrosine (4G10).

It is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated at low levels, but when confluent ECs are stimulated by flow or when PECAM-1 on the surface of sparsely cultured ECs is directly pulled, PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osawa et al., 2002</xref>). Stretch is another form of mechanical stress and may also elicit PECAM-1 phosphorylation. Indeed, when bovine aortic ECs (BAECs) were stretched, PECAM-1 phosphorylation increased in confluent but not sparse cultures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>), indicating that this PECAM-1 mechanoresponse is cell&#x02013;cell contact&#x02013;dependent or, in molecular terms, only PECAM-1 that is externally engaged can respond to stretch. There was no statistical difference in phosphorylation levels at 5 min and after 5 min, indicating that the plateau is reached by 5 min. This PECAM-1 phosphorylation time course is similar to those by flow and hyperosmotic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Osawa et al., 1997</xref>). To show that this response was not limited to BAECs, we stretched human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and human arterial ECs (HAECs) and observed that PECAM-1 in these cells also responded similarly (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4 D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7 A</xref>). If PECAM-1 phosphorylation is indeed a mechanical event, it might occur when an extracted cell model is stretched.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The detergent-extracted EC model.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of the preparation and mechanical activation of the cell model.

Roughly 70% of the cell protein was extracted, but &#x0223c;80% of PECAM-1 was retained in cell models of BAECs, HUVECs, and HAECs (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801062/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801062/DC1</ext-link>).

By immunofluorescence, VE-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin localization along the cell border and actin filaments of the circumferential ring appeared unaffected by the extraction (unpublished data).</p><p>When EC models were stretched for up to 10 min in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP, 4G10 immunostaining along cell&#x02013;cell contacts increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and immunoblots with 4G10 revealed a prominent 130-kD band (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). When cell models of BAECs whose PECAM-1 expression was down-regulated by siRNA were stretched, phosphorylation of this band was attenuated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), suggesting that the protein is PECAM-1. To specifically analyze PECAM-1 phosphorylation in the model, PECAM-1 was immunoprecipitated and its phosphorylation assayed by 4G10 immunoblotting. Both sustained (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and cyclic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) stretch augmented PECAM-1 phosphorylation in the BAEC model. Cell models of HUVECs and HAECs responded similarly to stretch (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>; and see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Stretching models without ATP did not appreciably phosphorylate PECAM-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). To see if the plateau level of stretch-induced PECAM-1 phosphorylation depended on the magnitude of stretch, models were stretched by 5 (lowest stretch obtainable by the apparatus), 10, 15, 20, and 25% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>) for 5 min. We found that 5% stretch was as effective as 25% stretch in phosphorylating PECAM-1. Because the stretch apparatus used is not designed to reliably stretch cells &#x0003c;5%, no analysis was done on cells with &#x0003c;5% stretch. Our studies appear to suggest that PECAM-1 phosphorylation is triggered by a simple mechanical process achievable by a 5% extension in length. Our results together show that, other than ATP, soluble components of the cell do not play a significant role in stretch-induced PECAM-1 phosphorylation and that all proteins needed for this stretch response are in the model, presumably as a stable complex. Furthermore, they suggest that PECAM-1 phosphorylation by stretch is a mechanical phenomenon that does not require living cells. We hypothesized that the fundamental mechanism for mechanostimulus-dependent PECAM-1 phosphorylation was preserved in the model and that the kinase for this response was associated with the model.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Increased tyrosine phosphorylation in the stretched cell model.</bold> (A) Extracted BAEC models were stretched or unstretched for 10 min and double labeled with 4G10 and anti&#x02013;pan-cadherin.

Because Src, Fyn, and Yes are members of the Src family kinase and share high sequence homology, we used monoclonal antibodies made against the unique region of each kinase. Src, Yes, and Fyn were detected in cell models and localized to the cell border in both extracted and unextracted ECs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>). Thus, these kinases are associated with cell&#x02013;cell contacts in the model, and the association is not an artifact of cell extraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Fyn, not Src or Yes, is responsible for PECAM-1 phosphorylation in stretched models</title><p>Because simple association-based screening could not reduce the field of kinase candidates further, we turned to a molecular biology approach. ECs were treated with Src, Yes, or Fyn siRNA, cell models were made and stretched, and PECAM-1 phosphorylation was assayed. The mean knockdown efficiency estimated by immunoblotting was 60, 67, and 70% for Src, Yes, and Fyn, respectively. For controls, cells were treated with commercially available control siRNA, Lipofectamine treatment alone, or two scrambled Fyn siRNAs and assayed for PECAM-1 phosphorylation by stretch and for expressions of PECAM-1, Src, Yes, Fyn, and Fer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). None of these treatments negatively affected the results of these assays. Because the lot and concentration of the Lipofectamine used were the most critical factors for cell viability, monolayer morphology, and transfection efficiency, siRNA results are shown with Lipofectamine controls. No significant inhibition in PECAM-1 phosphorylation was noted in the stretched models of Src (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>) or Yes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, D and F</xref>) siRNA-treated cells. These results could mean that residual levels of Src and Yes are sufficient for the stretch-induced PECAM-1 phosphorylation but, as we will discuss in subsequent sections, this is unlikely. When we tested models of Fyn siRNA-treated cells, the PECAM-1 response was inhibited (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, E and F</xref>). Because Fyn siRNA-treated cells had normal expression of Src and Yes (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801062/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801062/DC1</ext-link>), if either of them is responsible for the stretch-induced PECAM-1 phosphorylation, the Fyn knockdown should not have inhibited the PECAM-1 response. Thus, the Fyn siRNA experiments argue against the possibility that residual Src and Yes are capable of phosphorylating PECAM-1 in the Src and Yes siRNA-treated cell models. These siRNA experiments collectively indicate that Fyn, not Src and Yes, is responsible for phosphorylating PECAM-1 in stretched cell models.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Fyn is essential for the PECAM-1 mechanoresponse in cell models.</bold> (A) Controls for siRNA experiments.

This possibility deserves special attention because PECAM-1 was phosphorylated in cells overexpressing Fer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kogata et al., 2003</xref>), even though Fer was eliminated by the first level of inhibitor screening. When BAECs were treated with Fer siRNA and stretched, PECAM-1 phosphorylation was unattenuated, showing that Fer plays no role in this PECAM-1 response (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801062/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801062/DC1</ext-link>). The result also shows that our inhibitor screening has correctly eliminated Fer, providing validity to our approach. When Fyn was knocked down by siRNA, PECAM-1 phosphorylation by stretch and flow was almost completely inhibited. This suggests that other kinases, including undiscovered ones, do not play a major role in PECAM-1 phosphorylation by mechanical stresses. Thus, although other kinases may phosphorylate PECAM-1 under different circumstances, we conclude that Fyn is the kinase responsible for stretch- and flow-induced phosphorylation of PECAM-1.</p><p>When ECs are stretched or exposed to flow, Fyn could be activated. To test this possibility, we immunoprecipitated Fyn from stretch- and flow-stimulated ECs and performed immunoblotting on the precipitates using an anti&#x02013;active Src antibody, which is known to recognize active Fyn. As a positive control, we treated ECs with hyperosmotic shock, which is known to activate Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen, 2005</xref>), and confirmed highly increased phosphorylation of Src family kinases by immunoblotting with this antibody (unpublished data). However, increased phosphorylation at the active site of Fyn was not observed in ECs exposed to stretch or flow for 10 min (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 H</xref>). These results are consistent with those reported earlier by Sawada et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sawada et al., 2006</xref>). Although these results support the idea that mechanical stress does not activate Fyn, it remains possible that a small fraction of Fyn that is critical for PECAM-1 phosphorylation is activated and that our assay is unable to detect this. Although this possibility cannot be excluded, our results show that Fyn is constitutively active at a significant level in unstimulated cells, suggesting that the early phase of the mechanostress-induced PECAM-1 phosphorylation by Fyn is equally possible without robustly activating this kinase.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>PECAM-1 and mechanotransduction</title><p>Our study has demonstrated that PECAM-1 can be phosphorylated when detergent-extracted EC monolayer models are stretched in the presence of ATP, indicating that the model contains molecules that are needed for this stretch-activated phosphorylation reaction. What is not known is whether or not the complete phosphorylation machinery is preserved in the model. For example, it is possible that this in vitro system has lost certain regulatory mechanism and, thus, the model is unregulated. However, it is reasonable to assume that proteins that are minimally needed for PECAM-1 phosphorylation by stretch are in the model. It is also reasonable to assume that the stretch-induced PECAM-1 phosphorylation reaction occurs without the soluble components of the cell and the plasmalemmal function that regulates ionic events across the membrane, although they could still play roles in fine-tuning the reaction. Using this model system, we identified Fyn as the kinase for stretch-induced PECAM-1 phosphorylation, and using siRNAs, we further demonstrated that Fyn was the primary kinase responsible for PECAM-1 phosphorylation in intact ECs exposed to stretch as well as shear stress.</p><p>It is not yet clear how Fyn and PECAM-1 interact in a mechanostress-dependent manner. The fact that PECAM-1 phosphorylation is achievable in the model appears to suggest Fyn and PECAM-1 to be closely positioned, and the two molecules interact when mechanical forces are applied. This could involve certain structural changes, as we had suggested in our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osawa et al. 2002</xref>). Another possibility is that Fyn located near the PECAM-1 phosphorylation sites is activated when the model is stretched. Highly localized activation of Fyn that our assay cannot detect remains as a possibility, but our study has shown that stretch and flow do not significantly elevate Fyn activity in ECs within the time scale of our experiments and that a portion of Fyn appears to be constitutively active. Thus, Fyn activation may not be necessary. A third possibility is that mechanostress causes already active Fyn to diffuse a small distance to phosphorylate PECAM-1. This diffusion-dependent phosphorylation may be slow and inefficient so that it may take some time for the assay system to detect an increase in PECAM-1 phosphorylation. It is of course also plausible that any combinations of these possibilities occur simultaneously. At present, the precise molecular mechanism for the mechanostress-induced Fyn&#x02013;PECAM-1 interaction remains elusive.</p><p>The presence of a supramolecular complex that converts mechanical force into biochemical reactions at cell&#x02013;cell contacts has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tzima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liebner et al., 2006</xref>), but its molecular makeup remains largely unknown. Our earlier experiments, in which PECAM-1 phosphorylation was achieved by a direct application of pulling force onto PECAM-1 which then caused ERK activation, suggest that PECAM-1 converts the mechanical force into biochemical energy (i.e., phosphorylated form of PECAM-1) which then activates intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osawa et al., 2002</xref>). In this regard, PECAM-1 may be a mechanotransducer of the hypothesized mechanoresponsive protein complex. The present study suggests that Fyn as the PECAM-1 kinase is an important component of the mechanotransducer complex. Indeed, small but detectable amounts of Fyn were coimmunoprecipitated with PECAM-1 from platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cicmil et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ohmori et al., 2001</xref>), and we also identified a small amount of Fyn in anti&#x02013;PECAM-1 immunoprecipitates from EC extracts (unpublished data). We wondered if the association between Fyn and PECAM-1 might increase in ECs exposed to stretch, but we were unable to reliably quantify the level of Fyn&#x02013;PECAM-1 coimmunoprecipitation because the amount of Fyn coimmunoprecipitated with PECAM-1 at any time point during stretch stimulation was barely above the limit of detection (unpublished data). Nonetheless, our past and present studies suggest that PECAM-1 and Fyn are important molecules in a mechanotransducer complex located at cell&#x02013;cell contacts.</p><p>There are mechanosignaling events that depend on PECAM-1 expression such as Src phosphorylation and integrin activation by fluid shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tzima et al., 2005</xref>). This PECAM-1&#x02013;dependent Src phosphorylation was reported to reach the maximum level within 15 s of flow stimulation, which is much sooner than an increase in PECAM-1 phosphorylation can be reliably detected. If the Src phosphorylation by flow requires PECAM-1 phosphorylation, it might be achieved by the fraction of PECAM-1 that is constitutively phosphorylated. Another possibility is that when the first molecules of PECAM-1 are phosphorylated by flow, which should take place immediately after flow stimulation, a mechanism for Src phosphorylation is fully activated, resulting in the robust activation of Src. A more interesting possibility, however, is that Src phosphorylation does not depend on PECAM-1 phosphorylation. This hypothesis suggests PECAM-1 to be involved in two different mechanosignaling pathways, one PECAM-1 phosphorylation-dependent and one PECAM-1 phosphorylation-independent pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanical response of in vitro models</title><p>The use of a detergent-extracted cell model is an important aspect of this study. Not only did it simplify the system but it also allowed us to use various inhibitors effectively. When an inhibitor is used with intact cells, one always wonders what the concentration of the inhibitor is inside them. This ambiguity is practically absent when a cell model is exposed to inhibitors. In addition, because the efficacy data available from the database is based on in vitro assays where inhibitors have free access to target kinases, it is important for our system to be studied with inhibitors under the same barrier-free condition. Several recent studies on mechanotransduction have successfully used cell models to elucidate certain molecular mechanisms for mechanically induced protein&#x02013;protein interactions and protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sawada and Sheetz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sawada et al., 2006</xref>). Our study has added a new dimension, inhibitor screening combined with the siRNA technique, to the use of cell models in the study of mechanotransduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinase screening</title><p>In this study, we used kinase inhibitors to make a short list of possible PECAM-1 kinases and then siRNA to identify Fyn as the PECAM-1 kinase. The same general approach may be applicable to other studies in which a specific kinase or enzyme is to be identified. For example, stretch-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins associated with focal adhesion in detergent-extracted fibroblast models was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamada et al., 2004</xref>), but the study did not identify specific kinases for the response. This would be an excellent system to which the present strategy could be applied. Kinases are particularly good targets because a sufficiently large database is available for kinase inhibitors. For effective screening, it is essential to select a set of inhibitors, some of which do and others of which do not inhibit a particular biological process under investigation. With an appropriate combination of positive and negative inhibitors, one can come up with a short list of possible kinases, which then may be screened further by other means. Due to the possible inhibitor concentration differential across the plasma membrane, this approach is more applicable to cell-free systems than living cells. A caveat is that the strategy can only be applied to known kinases. Unknown or novel kinases or those for which little to no data are available in the database cannot be studied by this approach. However, this problem should become less of an issue as the information in inhibitor databases expands.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>For culturing cells, DME, penicillin/streptomycin, and Trypsin/EDTA solution were purchased from Mediatech, Inc., medium 200 and low serum growth supplement from Cascade Biologics, and FBS from Equitech-Bio, Inc.
