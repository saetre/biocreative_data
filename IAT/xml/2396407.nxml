Also known as CaN19, S100A2 was identified as a potential tumor suppressor. Expression of <italic>S100A2</italic> is upregulated by p53. The proteins p63 and p73 are related to p53 and are expressed as several splice variants with partially overlapping tasks but also functions different from p53.

Recently, S100A2 was shown to play a crucial role during differentiation when its expression silenced by siRNA-mediated mRNA knockdown resulted in decreased expression of two keratinocyte differentiation markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In contrast to other S100 family members, S100A2 is located in the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and is involved in keratinocyte response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>S100A2 is a member of the S100 family representing the largest family within the EF-hand proteins. These proteins are characterized by two distinct EF-hand motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) flanking a central hinge region and act as Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling or Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering proteins. In addition to Ca<sup>2+</sup> many S100 family members display high affinity also towards Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions. The cDNA of <italic>S100A2</italic> codes for a 10.7-kDa protein which can form homodimers in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) with affinity to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Dimerization of S100 proteins appears to be important for their biological function.</p><p>Members of the S100 family show a large diversity in structure and function. They are involved in the regulation of contraction, motility, cell growth, differentiation, cell cycle progression, transcription and secretion. In contrast to other EF-hand proteins, S100 proteins have so far been found only in vertebrates and consequently form a phylogenetically young group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Genes of most group members are clustered in region 1q21 of human chromosome 1 which is known as epidermal differentiation complex EDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). An analogous cluster is found on chromosome 3 in mice. Usually the highly conserved gene structure consists of three exons of which the first exon is noncoding. Furthermore, S100 proteins are expressed in a cell and tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) implying that the relatively large number of family members is not due to redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>S100A2</italic>&#x02014;then named <italic>CaN19</italic>&#x02014;was identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene by differential expression in normal versus tumor-derived human mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). It was shown that <italic>S100A2</italic> expression is markedly downregulated in several tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>). Methylation of the promoter mediates <italic>S100A2</italic> repression during breast cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Furthermore, it was shown that the tumor suppressor p53 activates transcription of <italic>S100A2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In addition, S100A2 overexpression was found in gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and early-stage nonsmall cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). It was concluded that overexpression of S100A2 may be an early tumorigenic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Another finding is that S100A2 modulates transcriptional activity of p53 due to protein-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Recently it was shown that S100A2 could exert its antitumor activity by repression of <italic>cyclooxygenase-2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Many biological processes like apoptosis and development are critically regulated by members of the p53 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). p63 and p73 are a group of proteins that, like p53, are transcription factors which activate target genes through sequence-specific DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32 B33">30&#x02013;33</xref>). The high level of amino acid sequence similarity within the p53 family, particularly in the DNA-binding domain, allows transactivation of common target genes. However, members of the p53 family are not entirely functionally redundant. While p53 is known as a classical tumor suppressor, p63 seems to be capable of enforcing some of the tumor suppressive mechanisms that p53 also mediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Furthermore, p63 plays an important role in development. Mutations in the p63 DNA-binding domain cause severe phenotypes in man as autosomal dominantly inherited syndromes. This family of disorders includes the EEC, AEC, SHFM, LMS and ADULT syndromes. They are characterized by combination of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and facial clefting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37 B38 B39 B40 B41">35&#x02013;41</xref>). Recently, it was shown that p63 is able to bind DNA elements which differ from classical p53 consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). This implies that p53 and p63 can regulate different target genes.</p><p>Here we identify <italic>S100A2</italic> as a novel transcriptional target of the p63 isoform TAp63&#x003b3;. We show that mutants of p63 which are responsible for the human EEC syndrome fail to activate <italic>S100A2</italic> transcription. In addition, we find that recruitment of p63&#x003b3; proteins to the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter correlates with increased expression of <italic>S100A2</italic> following DNA damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture, transfections and luciferase assays</title><p>SaOS-2 cells obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) were cultured and transfected in 24-well plates as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).

However, no S100A2 protein was detectable after induction of p53 despite a clear increase in p53 protein expression. Taken together with the observations on the mRNA level, this finding indicates that S100A2 protein expression induced by TAp63&#x003b3; is stronger than the induction by p53.</p></sec><sec><title>TAp63&#x003b3; regulates transcription of the <italic>S100A2</italic> gene</title><p>After finding that increased expression of TAp63&#x003b3; leads to elevated <italic>S100A2</italic> mRNA and protein levels, we tested if this regulation is controlled on the transcriptional level. Initially, we used in our assays an <italic>S100A2</italic>-promoter fragment-reporter construct which was kindly provided by Dr Beat W. Sch&#x000e4;fer (University of Zurich) and had been published to be regulated by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This construct, designated S100A2 short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), was transfected into SaOS-2 cells. Increasing amounts of <italic>p53</italic>- or <italic>TAp63&#x003b3;</italic>-expressing plasmids were cotransfected. As controls, their DNA binding-deficient mutants were also assayed. Wild-type TAp63&#x003b3; was able to activate the promoter fragment about 16-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Surprisingly, p53 was not able to induce expression from the S100A2 short construct, leaving the question unanswered why <italic>S100A2</italic> mRNA increases after p53 induction. Trying to explain this discrepancy we extended the S100A2 short promoter by a fragment of about 2 kb up to the translational start creating S100A2 long. This reporter construct includes the untranslated exon 1 and the first intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Activation by p53 of this promoter results in an increase of about 3.5-fold. Much more substantial is the activation by TAp63&#x003b3; which enhances the expression of the reporter gene about 43-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>A novel site in the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter different from a previously recognized element mediates transcriptional activation by TAp63&#x003b3;.

Initially the described p53-binding element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) designated here as site 1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn132/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>) was tested. In addition to this potential p53-binding site, referred to as S100A2 site 1&#x02013;3&#x02032;, <italic>in silico</italic> analyses revealed an additional potential consensus in this region, denoted as S100A2 site 1&#x02013;5&#x02032;. Mutation of these elements results in a loss of the p53-dependent activation whereas TAp63&#x003b3; is still able to activate this promoter mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). We narrowed down the TAp63&#x003b3;-responsive part of the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter by creating and testing several deletion mutants. A region of about 80-bp upstream from the untranslated exon 1 was identified to be required for TAp63&#x003b3;-mediated transcription (data not shown). Comparison of this <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter segment to the known p53-consensus sequence revealed a potential binding element consisting of two consecutive palindromes lacking any spacer region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn132/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). This element, designated site 2, contains 4 bp which are different from the classical p53 consensus (RRRCWWGYYY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). Instead of the established core-binding element CWWG the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter shows the nucleotide sequence CAGG in each half of the palindrome. Furthermore, next to the core another 2 bp are changed in the upstream palindrome in comparison to the consensus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn132/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). Moreover, phylogenetical footprint analyses reveal a strong conservation of this site within vertebrates (data not shown), implying a possible function for this region. To test functional importance of site 2 we mutated this element in a way that the core of the site was destroyed and used the resulting reporter in transient transfection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, site 2 mut-1). Activation of <italic>S100A2</italic> transcription by TAp63&#x003b3; is essentially lost upon mutation of site 2, identifying this element as the major site for TAp63&#x003b3;-dependent transcription in the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). When this mutant was tested with other proteins of the p63/p73 family, we observed that the newly identified site 2 appears to be essential also for transactivation by these other splice variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, site 2 mut-1). In contrast, mutation of site 1 affects transactivation of the <italic>S100A2</italic> reporter by p63/p73 family members only to a minor extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, site 1&#x02013;3&#x02032; mut), emphasizing the importance of the newly identified element 2 for mediating p63/p73-dependent regulation of <italic>S100A2</italic>.</p><p>In another mutant, a <italic>bona fide</italic> p53 consensus was created by changing the guanine in position three to a thymidine in the core-binding element CAGG of site 2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn132/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). TAp63&#x003b3; was able to activate this mutant <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter clearly. Furthermore, this promoter construct shows a significant induction also after expression of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, site 2 mut-2).

Therefore, p63 is not a classical tumor suppressor despite strong structural homologies to p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Elucidating other possible p63 functions is difficult due to the presence of various p63 splice variants and their divergent expression pattern. The TAp63&#x003b3; protein closely resembles p53. One reason for the similarity is its lack of an inhibitory domain present in the &#x003b1; variants. TAp63&#x003b3; is found to be a very potent activator of p53 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and seems to be able to enforce tumor suppressive mechanisms in which p53 is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>In addition to a possible function as a tumor suppressor, it was discovered that p63 plays a role in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Heterozygous <italic>p63</italic> germ line mutations cause several skin and other developmental defects in man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). These observations suggest for p63 other transcriptional targets than for p53.</p><p>Here we identify <italic>S100A2</italic> as a transcriptional target of p63. Particularly the p63 variant TAp63&#x003b3; is rather active in enhancing <italic>S100A2</italic> expression. Selective expression of <italic>TAp63&#x003b3;</italic> leads to a dramatic increase in mRNA amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and subsequently to enhanced expression of S100A2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). A novel binding site in the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter is essential for TAp63&#x003b3;-mediated activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We demonstrated that TAp63&#x003b3; binds to this element in a sequence-specific manner <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, the recruitment of TAp63&#x003b3; to the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). A recent report showed activation of <italic>S100A2</italic> transcription by p73&#x003b1; and p73&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Interestingly, we could show that the newly identified p63-response element is the activating site also for TAp73 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). However, an additional element relevant for part of the p73-dependent activation in the second intron of the <italic>S100A2</italic> gene, as discussed by others, cannot be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). We did not observe a strong <italic>S100A2</italic> repression by &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E) as detected by other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This may be caused by different experimental approaches. Lapi and coworkers employed firefly luciferase for measurement of reporter activity and &#x003b2;-galactosidase for normalization instead of the firefly/Renilla-luciferase combination used here. The difference in protein stability between luciferase and &#x003b2;-galactosidase may result in distortion of relative reporter activities. Other differences are the use of a DNA&#x02013;binding-deficient mutant of &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; as a control instead of empty vector and employment of distinct cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, Lapi and coworkers observed under their experimental conditions that TAp63&#x003b1; is not able to activate the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter which is perfectly consistent with our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E).</p><p><italic>S100A2</italic> is known to be a transcriptional target of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Consistent with this we find an induction of <italic>S100A2</italic> mRNA after expression of p53, but activation of the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter by p53 was substantially lower than the increase in expression after TAp63&#x003b3; induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, on the protein level S100A2 increased after TAp63&#x003b3; expression, whereas an equivalent protein induction was not detectable following p53 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). These findings suggest that TAp63&#x003b3; is a more potent transcriptional activator than p53 also implying that regulation through p63 generally may be more relevant for S100A2 function.</p><p>We demonstrated that changing one nucleotide in the core of the newly identified binding element 2 is sufficient to differentiate between binding of p53 or TAp63&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). These observations are in line with previously published results which demonstrate that p63 preferentially binds to degenerate p53 consensus elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). This mechanism appears to be important for differentiating functions of p63 versus p53. Furthermore, the evolutionary conservation of the identified binding element in <italic>S100A2</italic> promoters from different species (data not shown) suggests an essential biological relevance of the TAp63&#x003b3;-dependent regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>).</p><p>One function of p63 is the regulation of developmental processes. Several mutations in the p63 DNA-binding domain are responsible for a family of human syndromes characterized by a combination of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and facial clefting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39">37&#x02013;39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). These observations led us to test the influence of disease-related p63 mutants on transcriptional activation of <italic>S100A2</italic>. In reporter assays, we found an even stronger transcriptional activation employing two TAp63&#x003b3; mutants derived from SHFM patients compared to wild-type p63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, three p63 mutants responsible for the EEC syndrome had essentially lost their activation potential on the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter. A TAp63&#x003b3; mutant related to the ADULT syndrome yielded some residual <italic>S100A2</italic> activation when compared to wild-type TAp63&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, these observations correlate with severity of the epidermal syndrome phenotype since SHFM patients, in contrast to patients suffering from EEC and ADULT syndromes, are characterized by a lack of epidermal dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the ability of p63 to stimulate expression of <italic>S100A2</italic> plays a role in developing the phenotype of these patients. Further research is required to establish a stronger link.</p><p>S100A2 was identified as a potential tumor suppressor by subtractive hybridization between normal and tumor-derived mammary epithelial cells in man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Consistent with these findings <italic>S100A2</italic> expression is markedly downregulated in several tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>). However, it was shown that <italic>S100A2</italic> expression is increased in other tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26">21&#x02013;26</xref>). It was discussed that overexpression is an early event in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, a physical interaction between S100A2 and p53 proteins enhances transcriptional activity of p53 which implies antitumorigenic properties of S100A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). A possible interaction also between p63 and S100A2 proteins has not yet been investigated. Recently, it was demonstrated that <italic>S100A2</italic> expression is able to diminish expression of Cox-2 protein which provides further evidence for a tumor suppressive function of S100A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Interestingly, in line with these observations we showed that expression of <italic>S100A2</italic> increases following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and C). The enhanced expression of <italic>S100A2</italic> correlates with binding of p63&#x003b3; protein to the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Generally, detection of different p63 isoforms on the mRNA and protein levels is difficult. It is possible to differentiate between TAp63 and &#x00394;Np63 mRNA variants. On the protein level we were able to observe p63&#x003b3; versus total p63 protein expression. After DNA damage we exclusively find an increase in the <italic>TAp63</italic> isoforms on the mRNA level. Combining these observations with the data from the ChIP assays suggests that TAp63&#x003b3; is induced after DNA damage and subsequent binding to the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter mediates its regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Supportive of this notion is the finding that p53-negative Hep3B cells also show an increase in transcription of <italic>S100A2</italic> together with enhanced expression of the <italic>TAp63</italic> isoforms after DNA damage is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). In conclusion, it is possible that regulation of <italic>S100A2</italic> transcription by TAp63&#x003b3; is a supporting mechanism to complement and enhance cellular response in preventing tumor transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). This is consistent with earlier observations implying that TAp63&#x003b3; is able to substitute partially p53 function in hepatocellular carcinomas lacking p53 expression by transactivating the <italic>maspin</italic> tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show that <italic>S100A2</italic> is a novel transcriptional target of the p63 splice variant TAp63&#x003b3;. The regulation is mediated by a novel and strongly conserved transcriptional element in the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter which is bound by TAp63&#x003b3; but not by p53. Transcriptional properties of p63 mutants derived from EEC, ADULT and SHFM syndrome patients yield evidence for a role of a TAp63&#x003b3;-mediated transcription of <italic>S100A2</italic> in developmental processes. Recruitment of p63&#x003b3; proteins to the <italic>S100A2</italic> promoter following DNA damage correlates with enhanced expression of <italic>S100A2</italic> and suggest a function in tumor suppression.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn132/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn132_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="gkn132_nar-01543-x-2007-File003.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkn132_nar-01543-x-2007-File004.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Jana Lorenz for technical assistance, Drs Bert Vogelstein and Beat W.
