We used a layered screen to identify <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mutants defective in telomere localization to the nuclear periphery. We find that events in S phase are crucial for correct telomere localization. In particular, the histone chaperone Asf1 functions in telomere peripheral positioning. Asf1 stimulates acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56) by the histone acetyltransferase Rtt109. Analysis of <italic>rtt109</italic>&#x00394; and H3K56 mutants suggests that the acetylation/deacetylation cycle of the H3K56 residue is required for proper telomere localization. The function of H3K56 acetylation in localizing chromosome domains is not confined to telomeres because deletion of <italic>RTT109</italic> also prevents the correct peripheral localization of a newly identified <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> &#x0201c;chromosome-organizing clamp&#x0201d; locus. Because chromosome positioning is subject to epigenetic inheritance, H3K56 acetylation may mediate correct chromosome localization by facilitating accurate transmission of chromatin status during DNA replication.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: COC, chromosome-organizing clamp; ETC, extra TFIIIC; H3&#x02013;H4, histone H3&#x02013;H4 complex; H3K56, histone H3 lysine 56; NPC, nuclear pore complex; ORF, open reading frame; RLC, replication factor C&#x02013;like complex; TFIIIC, transcription factor IIIC; WT, wild-type; XIV-L, XIV-left.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The three-dimensional organization of DNA within the nucleus is related to chromatin function, and the genomic DNA is organized and actively positioned within the nuclear space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gasser, 2002</xref>). Nucleosome packaging and histone modification have been implicated in chromatin domain positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanabe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambeyron and Bickmore, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zink et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Williams et al., 2006</xref>), but the precise mechanisms determining physical organization of chromosomes are not well understood.</p><p>Telomeres are the nucleoprotein structures that protect chromosome ends from degradation and ensure the telomerase-mediated length maintenance of the terminal repeat sequences. The organization of the telomeres of budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> offers a useful model system to study chromosome localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gasser, 2002</xref>). The 32 telomeres of haploid yeast cells are organized in three to six clusters at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gotta et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> subtelomeric sequences are subject to transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gottschling et al., 1990</xref>) and replicate late during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raghuraman et al., 2001</xref>). Recombination between telomeres and other chromosomal loci is suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pryde et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, budding yeast telomeres are &#x0201c;insulated&#x0201d; from other chromosomal regions both spatially and functionally.</p><p>Two partially redundant pathways have been identified that mediate tethering of telomeres to the nuclear periphery: the Sir4-dependent and Ku-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hediger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taddei et al., 2004</xref>). Sir4 is a telomere-binding protein that, along with Sir2 and Sir3, is essential for transcriptional silencing of telomere-proximal genes. Sir4 tethers telomeres to nuclear periphery through interactions with Esc1 and Mps3 on the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taddei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bupp et al., 2007</xref>). The Ku protein complex is a heterodimer consisting of Yku70 and Yku80, which binds to telomeres and is essential for their late replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cosgrove et al., 2002</xref>), as well as playing a major role in telomere length regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Porter et al., 1996</xref>). The Ku heterodimer can also mediate peripheral tethering of telomeres, but the interaction partner of Ku on the nuclear membrane has not yet been identified. Mutants lacking both Ku and Sir4 function show random positioning of all telomeres tested, but single mutants compromise the peripheral localization of different telomeres to different extents, which suggests that the 32 telomeres vary in their dependence on the two pathways for peripheral tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bystricky et al., 2005</xref>). Telomere peripheral tethering is cell cycle&#x02013;regulated: telomeres generally show perinuclear localization in G1 and S phases but not in G2 or M phases.</p><p>Telomeres are not the only genomic sequences to show localization to the nuclear periphery. Other yeast genomic loci that display peripheral localization include transcriptionally activated <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>INO1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casolari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>), and in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, the so-called &#x0201c;chromosome-organizing clamp&#x0201d; (COC) sites that behave as insulator elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noma et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae HMR</italic>-silenced chromatin is also peripherally localized, and Sir4 and Ku proteins contribute to <italic>HMR</italic> localization and confinement of its mobility within the nuclear space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gartenberg et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, mechanisms involved in telomere localization may act more generally in subnuclear organization, and identification of the factors involved in telomere localization may provide insight into mechanisms controlling the subnuclear organization of other chromosome sites.</p><p>Asf1 is an evolutionarily conserved histone H3&#x02013;H4 complex (H3&#x02013;H4) chaperone that is implicated in several chromatin-remodeling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mousson et al., 2007</xref>). Asf1 is involved along with other histone chaperones in both replication-independent and replication-coupled histone deposition pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mousson et al., 2007</xref>). Asf1 stimulates acetylation of the histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56) and loading of H3 acetylated at K56 into newly assembled chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Recht et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>), acting along with the histone chaperones CAF-1 and Rtt106, which preferentially load H3 acetylated at K56 during replication-coupled chromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Asf1 is also required under certain circumstances for integrity of the replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mousson et al., 2007</xref>), and the replicative clamp-loading complex replication factor C binds Asf1 and can recruit it to DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franco et al., 2005</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that Asf1 acts in replication-coupled histone deposition through direct interaction with the replication machinery. Asf1 has also been implicated in telomere-specific chromatin organization because either disruption or overexpression of <italic>ASF1</italic> causes defective transcriptional silencing at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Singer et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Rap1 is a telomere-binding protein involved in telomere length regulation and recruitment of the Sir protein complex to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanoh and Ishikawa, 2003</xref>). Here, we have used GFP-Rap1 as a marker protein to screen for mutants with defective telomere organization. After secondary testing of these mutants, we identified eight new genes that are required for telomere localization to the nuclear periphery. The genes identified suggest that an event in S phase is important for telomere localization. In particular, we identify the chromatin-packaging histone chaperone Asf1 as one of the components required for telomere localization, and show that its stimulation of H3K56 acetylation is crucial for correct telomere positioning at the nuclear periphery. We demonstrate the existence of a peripherally localized <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> COC site, and show that its positioning also depends on H3K56 acetylation. Collectively, our results suggest that H3K56 acetylation is crucially important for correct three-dimensional organization of chromosomes within the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Rap1 organization mutants</title><p>To identify mutants defective in telomere localization, we used a candidate-based layered screening approach. Telomere repeat sequences contain multiple Rap1-binding sites, and in cells expressing a GFP-Rap1 fusion protein, telomere clusters are detected as bright fluorescent foci at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayashi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiraga et al., 2006</xref>). We began by screening for mutants defective in spatial organization of Rap1 in the nucleus. 262 knockout mutants in nonessential genes were selected for screening based on the proposed function of their gene products in chromosome metabolism processes such as telomere maintenance, transcriptional silencing, or DNA replication, recombination, or repair, as well as localization to nuclear membrane or nuclear periphery (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806065/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806065/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>We transformed this panel of mutants with an episomal plasmid expressing GFP-Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiraga et al., 2006</xref>), and screened for those mutants that have aberrant Rap1 organization. The strains were observed microscopically, and each strain tested was categorized according to the type of GFP-Rap1 organization it displayed. Four different basic phenotypes were observed, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Categories of mutants with defective Rap1 organization.</bold> The four observed categories of Rap1 organization phenotype are illustrated in the top panels. W, WT-like (i.e., no distinct Rap1 organization defect); A, internal foci; B, diffused fluorescence in entire nucleus; C, larger number of foci mainly still localized at nuclear periphery. Microscopic images on the bottom show strains typical for each category: W, WT; A, <italic>ace2</italic>&#x00394;; B, <italic>ctf18</italic>&#x00394;; C, <italic>chl1</italic>&#x00394;.

Mutants that are defective in perinuclear telomere localization but not in telomere clustering or length control may potentially fall in this category.</p><p>Type B mutants displayed loss of any obvious GFP-Rap1 dots. Typical examples of mutants falling in this category are <italic>asf1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>ctf18</italic>&#x00394;. Various factors could cause this phenotype, such as telomere localization and/or clustering defects, severe telomere shortening causing loss of Rap1 binding sites, or a defect in telomere binding by Rap1. Partly because the Rap1 fluorescence of a single unclustered telomere is so weak as to be hardly detectable, the telomere localization phenotype cannot be unequivocally assessed for type B mutants on the basis of the Rap1 localization pattern alone, and requires further investigation (see the following sections).</p><p>Type C mutants displayed an increased number of Rap1 dots at nuclear periphery, with individual dots less intense than normal. Typical examples in this category are <italic>chl1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>tdp1</italic>&#x00394; mutants. Mutants in this category are likely to be proficient in telomere localization to the nuclear periphery, with the mutant phenotype instead probably reflecting a defect in telomere clustering. However, mutants with a very severe telomere clustering defect may not fall in this category, because if a mutant exhibits a clustering defect so severe that GFP-Rap1 foci are not detectable, the mutant will be classified as type B.</p><p>Mutants of types A, B, and C were also numerically scored (1&#x02013;3) for severity and uniformity of the phenotype. Mutants with a uniformly severe phenotype (i.e., the majority of the cells in the population displaying the defect) were assigned a score of 3. Mutants with less severe phenotypes and/or mutants in which only a small proportion of the population showed defects were given a lower score. The complete list of phenotype scores and assignments is shown in Table S1.</p><p>The exact nature of the defect in each mutant cannot be determined simply from the observed Rap1 organization patterns, and further tests were required to understand the nature of the abnormality and to ascertain whether telomere peripheral localization is compromised. We decided to examine type A and B mutants further, as well as mutants with mixed phenotypes that were partly A or B. Type B mutants were of particular interest because previously identified telomere localization-defective mutants (including <italic>yku70</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sir4</italic>&#x00394;) fell into this category. A type B GFP-Rap1 pattern does not, however, necessarily imply a telomere localization defect, as this phenotype could be caused by other abnormalities (such as telomere shortening or a severe clustering defect). Type A mutants also display a phenotype that is suggestive of telomere mislocalization and were good candidates for further study, although this category is prone to false positives arising from technical difficulty in judging whether GFP-Rap1 dots located close to the poles in a z series are perinuclear. The type C pattern suggests proficient telomere localization to the nuclear periphery, and these mutants have not as yet been further examined. 23 phenotypically A, B, or &#x0201c;mixed&#x0201d; mutants with numerical scores of 2 or 3 were chosen for further investigation (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table

A telomere can be microscopically visualized using the &#x0201c;chromosome dot&#x0201d; system, in which a chromosome site is &#x0201c;tagged&#x0201d; using GFP-LacI bound to an array of <italic>lacO</italic> operator repeats inserted at the required locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Straight et al., 1996</xref>). Deletion alleles for the various genes were transferred into a strain background where the chromosomal locus 11 kb away from telomere XIV-left (XIV-L) is visualized using this chromosome dot technique (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hediger et al., 2002</xref>). In the strain background used, the nuclear envelope is also marked using a GFP-fused allele of the nuclear pore component Nup49 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belgareh and Doye, 1997</xref>). Perinuclear telomere localization was then scored by means of the &#x0201c;three-zoning&#x0201d; method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taddei et al., 2004</xref>). In brief, cells were scored only if the telomere &#x0201c;dot&#x0201d; was observed to be close to the equatorial region in a z stack of images (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, left). If this criterion was met, localization of the telomere was then scored to one of three concentric zones with equal surface area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, right). If the telomere distributes randomly within the nucleus, localization to each zone will be 33.3%.

To investigate whether telomere length directly regulates telomere localization, we measured telomere length in the localization mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Telomeres in <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>yku70</italic>&#x00394; mutants are significantly shorter than in WT.

Subpopulations of <italic>rrm3</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sic1</italic>&#x00394; mutants have abnormally long telomeres. No distinct effect on telomere length was observed in <italic>asf1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>elp4</italic>&#x00394; mutants.

For each mutant, the lower of the G1 and S phase localization values was used in this assessment. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, no clear correlation between telomere length and localization proficiency was observed. Telomere length was also plotted against G1 and S phase localization values separately (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806065/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806065/DC1</ext-link>). Again, no direct correlation between telomere length and telomere localization defect was observed. Because some mutants display short but well-localized telomeres, whereas others contain mislocalized telomeres of normal length, we conclude that telomere shortening is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause a telomere localization defect.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Telomere delocalization does not cause shortened telomeres, and short telomeres do not preclude peripheral localization.</bold> (A) Telomere lengths of telomere localization-defective mutant strains were tested as described in Materials and methods.

Asf1 is a histone chaperone involved in assembling the histone H3&#x02013;H4 subcomplex into nucleosomes, playing a role in histone deposition during DNA replication as well as transcription-coupled chromatin remodeling. Asf1 binding to H3&#x02013;H4 also stimulates acetylation of H3K56 in vitro and is required for efficient acetylation of H3K56 in vivo.</p><p>We tested which activity of Asf1 is responsible for telomere localization. Asf1 is implicated in nucleosome loading/unloading and chromatin remodeling through its cooperation with other histone chaperones, Hir and CAF-1. If this function of Asf1 is important for telomere localization, disruption of Hir or CAF-1 components should also affect telomere localization. However, disruption of the genes encoding these histone chaperones (<italic>HIR1</italic>, <italic>HIR2</italic>, <italic>RLF2</italic>, <italic>CAC2</italic>, or <italic>MSI1</italic>) had little or no effect on Rap1 organization (Table S1), which suggests that neither Hir nor CAF-1 is crucial for telomere localization. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that redundant function of CAF-1 and Rtt106 in loading H3&#x02013;H4 into nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2008</xref>) masked an involvement of these histone chaperones in Rap1 organization.</p><p>We next tested the alternative possibility that acetylation of H3K56 is required for telomere localization. The <italic>RTT109</italic> gene encodes a histone acetyltransferase responsible for acetylation of H3K56 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Driscoll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsubota et al., 2007</xref>). Both in vivo and in vitro studies confirmed that Asf1 dramatically stimulates the catalytic activity of Rtt109. If H3K56 acetylation is important for telomere localization, telomere localization will be compromised in the <italic>rtt109</italic>&#x00394; mutant, which is deficient for H3K56 acetylation. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, we found using the chromosome dot assay that the <italic>rtt109</italic>&#x00394; mutant exhibits a severe telomere localization defect for all telomeres tested (telomeres XIV-L, VI-R, and VIII-L; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Interestingly, the defect of <italic>rtt109</italic>&#x00394; was cell cycle&#x02013;independent, in contrast to the S phase&#x02013;specific defect of the <italic>asf1</italic>&#x00394; mutant. This discrepancy suggests the possibility that Asf1-dependent acetylation of H3K56 is responsible for telomere localization only in S phase, whereas another protein with similar activity could play a role in localization during G1 phase. The <italic>VPS75</italic> gene encodes a recently identified histone H3&#x02013;H4 chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Selth and Svejstrup, 2007</xref>). In vitro studies demonstrated that, like Asf1, Vps75 can stimulate acetylation of H3K56 by Rtt109 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsubota et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, Vps75 is a candidate for a G1 phase&#x02013;specific counterpart of Asf1. We tested whether Vps75 is involved in telomere localization. A <italic>vps75</italic>&#x00394; single mutant showed no detectable telomere localization defect, which demonstrates that <italic>VPS75</italic> is dispensable for telomere localization in the presence of <italic>ASF1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). We investigated whether Asf1 and Vps75 might play redundant roles in telomere localization during G1 phase. Consistent with this idea, an <italic>asf1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>vps75</italic>&#x00394; double mutant showed a severe telomere localization defect in both G1 and S phases, essentially recapitulating the phenotype of <italic>rtt109</italic>&#x00394; (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

Overall, the components identified fall in three general categories: first, gene products implicated in chromatin structure or assembly, especially during DNA replication (Ctf18, Asf1, and Rrm3); second, gene products already known to localize to telomeres, whose role in telomere localization highlights a previously unrecognized function (Mre11 and Tel1); and third, gene products thought be involved in unrelated process, whose effect on telomere localization may be indirect (Elp4, Pgd1, and Sic1).</p><sec><title>Elp4, Pgd1, and Sic1</title><p>Elp4 is part of the multifunctional Elongator complex, which is a major histone acetyltransferase component of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, and acts as well in other processes including tRNA modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Svejstrup, 2007</xref>). <italic>PGD1</italic> (also called <italic>MED3</italic>) encodes a subunit of the Mediator global transcriptional cofactor complex, part of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme that plays an essential role in basal and activated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 1998</xref>). Elp4 and Pgd1 may affect telomere localization indirectly, possibly by altering the expression of other genes required for telomere localization, although we cannot exclude the possibility that histone acetylation activity of Elp4 plays a similar role to Rtt109 (see the following paragraphs).</p><p><italic>SIC1</italic> encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that binds B-cyclin&#x02013;Cdk complexes during G1 phase to restrain Cdk activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lengronne and Schwob, 2002</xref>). Once cells enter S phase, Sic1 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. This previously described function of Sic1 occurs in G1 phase. <italic>SIC1</italic> is, however, required for telomere localization during S phase and not in G1 phase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). Origin initiation and the DNA replication program are disrupted in a <italic>sic1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, as premature activation of Cdk activity driven by B-type cyclin leads to deregulated entry into S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lengronne and Schwob, 2002</xref>). Disengagement of telomeres from the nuclear periphery is caused by telomere replication, which normally occurs late during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebrahimi and Donaldson, 2008</xref>). The S phase&#x02013;specific telomere localization of the <italic>sic1</italic>&#x00394; mutant may therefore result from a derailed replication program, in which telomeres replicate throughout S phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Mre11 and Tel1</title><p>Mre11 and Tel1 are both telomere-binding proteins that are required for telomere length regulation. <italic>TEL1</italic> encodes an ATM/ATR-like kinase, whereas Mre11 is a member of heterotrimeric MRX complex (consisting of Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2) that is involved in telomere protection and length regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Askree et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gatbonton et al., 2006</xref>).

Consistently, no direct correlation between telomere length and localization was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ctf18, Rrm3, and Asf1</title><p>A group of gene products that are implicated in DNA replication were identified as important for telomere positioning. The group consists of Rrm3, Asf1, and Ctf18. Ctf18 is the largest of three subunits specific to the Ctf18&#x02013;replication factor C&#x02013;like complex (RLC). As we previously described, all three subunits specific to the Ctf18-RLC (Ctf18, Ctf8, and Dcc1) are required for telomere positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiraga et al., 2006</xref>). The molecular target of the Ctf18-RLC remains unclear, although Ctf18-RLC is thought to load or unload proteins at replication forks. Rrm3 is also a replication fork component; <italic>RRM3</italic> encodes a DNA helicase that interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmidt et al., 2002</xref>) and promotes passage of replication forks through protein&#x02013;DNA complexes, including the telomeric nucleoprotein structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ivessa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makovets et al., 2004</xref>). Both <italic>ctf18</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rrm3</italic>&#x00394; mutants show telomere localization defects during G1 phase, despite the fact that their primary function is believed to occur during S phase. Ctf18 and Rrm3 are similar to Asf1 in being mainly implicated in replication-coupled events, and the identification of all three proteins in our telomere-positioning screen suggests that an S phase event is required for proper telomere localization in the subsequent G1 phase.</p><p>Asf1 is of particular interest when considering the possibility that the telomere localization mechanism is coupled to DNA replication. Asf1 physically interacts with components of the replication machinery and mediates replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mousson et al., 2007</xref>). Acetylation of chromatin-associated H3K56 is detectable throughout the cell cycle but dramatically increases in S phase because of incorporation of K56-acetylated H3 into chromatin by Asf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Masumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ozdemir et al., 2006</xref>). This &#x0201c;wave&#x0201d; of H3K56 acetylation on chromatin in S phase is reversed by the histone deacetylases Hst3 and Hst4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Celic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maas et al., 2006</xref>) and at silenced loci by Sir2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We found that the histone chaperones Asf1 and Vps75 play redundant roles in telomere localization during G1 phase. Vps75 can stimulate acetylation of H3K56 efficiently in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Selth and Svejstrup, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsubota et al., 2007</xref>). Deletion of <italic>VPS75</italic> does not however detectably decrease bulk cellular levels of acetylated H3K56. One possibility is that Vps75 regulates chromatin structure at a limited number of genomic loci, including telomeric regions. Short telomeres in the <italic>vps75</italic>&#x00394; mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Askree et al., 2004</xref>) but not in <italic>asf1</italic>&#x00394; (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) are consistent with a telomeric function for Vps75. The observation that Vps75 does not substitute for Asf1 in positioning the <italic>ETC6</italic> locus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref> and Fig. S2) also suggests a telomere-specific role for Vps75 in chromosome organization. It should be noted, however, that although our results clearly show that the H3K56 acetylation cycle is important for telomere positioning, we do not know at which site acetylation matters. Modulation of H3K56 acetylation in telomeric chromatin may be the critical factor, but an alternative possibility is that the acetylation state of a distant chromosomal site affects telomere localization, perhaps indirectly.</p><p>Our identification of the role of Asf1 in telomere positioning led to our observation that H3K56 acetylation by Rtt109 is crucial for telomere localization. Lack of H3K56 acetylation resulted in loss of telomere localization both in G1 and S phases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), despite the fact that H3K56 acetylation is most pronounced after DNA replication. This observation again implies that an event during replication is required for subsequent telomere localization. The histone H3 K56Q and K56R mutants are equally defective for telomere localization, which suggests that the acetylation/deacetylation cycle that occurs after DNA replication is important for positioning (rather than simply the presence of acetylated H3K56). A role for the acetylation/deacetylation cycle is consistent with the observation that H3K56 is in fact hypoacetylated at subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Telomeres are packaged in a heritable heterochromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gottschling, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wright et al., 1992</xref>). Like transcriptional silencing, telomere localization status is subject to epigenetic inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maillet et al., 2001</xref>). A role for H3K56 acetylation in the epigenetic inheritance of chromatin structure might explain the effect of H3K56 acetylation on telomere and COC site localization. For example, one possibility is that H3K56 acetylation distinguishes &#x0201c;newly synthesized&#x0201d; nucleosomes from &#x0201c;mature&#x0201d; nucleosomes inherited as histone tetrasomes from parental DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annunziato, 2005</xref>). New histone H3 is subject to K56 acetylation at the H3&#x02013;H4 dimer stage of nucleosome assembly. Acetylated H3K56 could be required to ensure correct transmission of other histone modifications (such as N-terminal tail methylations and acetylations) to nucleosomes containing newly synthesized histones. In this model, the inherited nucleosomes, distinguished by absence of H3K56 acetylation, could be used as a template for copying the required modifications. H3K56 is positioned at the entry/exit point of DNA wound around nucleosomes, and acetylation of the residue is suggested to loosen histone&#x02013;DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Masumoto et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, nucleosomes acetylated at H3K56 may be easily repositioned to allow reorganization of chromatin to achieve a preferred local chromatin structure (e.g., the compact heterochromatin structure close to telomeres), after which deacetylation of H3K56 might &#x0201c;fix&#x0201d; the chromatin status. In this way, the acetylation/deacetylation cycle of H3K56 could be envisaged to be critical for setting up a particular chromatin status (at telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2007</xref>] and other chromosome loci including COC sites) that allows correct localization to the nuclear periphery in the ensuing cell cycle. An early study found that deacetylation of histone is required for maturation of newly replicated chromatin in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Annunziato and Seale, 1983</xref>), which suggests that such an acetylation/deacetylation cycle may establish chromatin status in mammalian cells.</p><p>In this model, the <italic>ctf18</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rrm3</italic>&#x00394; mutations could be envisaged to affect telomere positioning by affecting replication fork progression in a way that interferes with chromatin establishment, for example, by disrupting the balance between K56-acetylated and nonacetylated H3 on newly synthesized DNA.</p><p>The model we outline represents one possible route by which Asf1-stimulated H3K56 acetylation might be important for positioning chromosome domains. Further investigations will of course be necessary to understand how Asf1 and other components identified here regulate the correct organization of chromosomes within the nuclear interior.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>For screening of Rap1 organization mutants, deletion mutants were picked from the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>) and transformed with plasmid YCp-GFP-RAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiraga et al., 2006</xref>).

SoftWoRx explorer (Applied Precision, LLC) was used for subsequent measurements.</p><p>The cell cycle stage of individual cells was estimated from bud size: G1 phase, unbudded; S phase, cells with bud smaller than or equal to 2 &#x003bc;m; G2 phase, cells with bud larger than 2 &#x003bc;m and a spherical (i.e., nonmitotic) nucleus.</p><p>Quantitative evaluation of telomere localization was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taddei et al., 2004</xref>). In brief, yeast cells whose GFP dot is in any of three equatorial sections of the nucleus were chosen for counting. Localization of the GFP dot was scored in two dimensions against three imaginary concentric zones at the equatorial plane, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>. At least 100 cells were scored in each culture unless otherwise noted. P-values were calculated by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test against either random distribution or WT values.</p></sec><sec><title>Telomere length assay</title><p>XhoI-digested genomic DNA was separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1&#x000d7; Tris/Borate/EDTA buffer and blotted to neutral nylon membrane (MP Biomedicals) by capillary transfer. The telomeric TG<sub>1-3</sub> sequence was probed with a radioactively labeled 0.1-kb BamHI&#x02013;EcoRI fragment from the plasmid pVII-L-URA3-TEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gottschling et al., 1990</xref>). Images were acquired by using a phosphorimager (FLA-3000) and analyzed by using ImageGauge software (both from Fujifilm).</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Table S1 shows the results of the primary screening using the GFP-Rap1 fusion construct.
