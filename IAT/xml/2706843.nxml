It is therefore crucial that intracellular zinc level over a small concentration range must be tightly regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Bacterial zinc homeostasis is achieved mainly by the coordinated expression of zinc uptake and export systems that are separately regulated by their own regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Bacteria have evolved at least three types of Zn<sup>2+ </sup>export systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] to protect cells from high toxic Zn<sup>2+ </sup>concentrations, namely cation diffusion facilitators (e.g. CzcD in <italic>Alcaligenes eutrophus</italic>), RND type exporters (e.g. CzcABC in <italic>A. eutrophus</italic>), and P-type ATPases (e.g. ZntA in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>). CzcD, CzcABC and ZntA are regulated by an ArsR-like repressor CzrA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], a two-component system CzcR/S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and a MerR-family regulator ZntR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], respectively.</p><p>Zinc ions are transported into the cytoplasm via high- and low-affinity zinc uptake systems, which are represented by ZnuABC of <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and YciABC of <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], respectively. A broad set of zinc uptake systems including ZnuABC and YciABC are regulated by the zinc uptake regulator Zur that is a homologous to the well-known Fur family of metal-dependent regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p><italic>Yersinia pestis </italic>is the causative agent of plague that is a zoonotic disease primarily affecting rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Maintenance of plague in nature is primarily dependent upon cyclic transmission between fleas and rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>Y. pestis </italic>possesses its potential to attack humans, and the human infection usually occurs with the transmission of the pathogen from animals by the biting of an infected flea, but this deadly disease can be transmitted from person to person by respiratory route. <italic>Y. pestis </italic>can remain viable and fully virulent after 40 weeks in soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, soil appears a potential telluric reservoir for <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, which could represent an alternative mechanism for maintenance of plague [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Zinc homeostasis should be crucial for survival of <italic>Y. pestis </italic>in fleas, rodents and soil.</p><p>Up to now, regulation of zinc homeostasis by Zur is poorly understood in <italic>Y. pestis</italic>.

Three genes or operons, namely <italic>znuA, znuCB </italic>and <italic>ykgM </italic>were further identified as direct Zur targets. Subsequent determination of transcription start sites, predicted -10/-35 elements, and Zur binding sites enabled the mapping of Zur-DNA interactions for these three genes.

The cell cultures were then diluted 1:20 in fresh TMH medium and grown at 26&#x000b0;C until an OD620 of about 1.0. Finally, 5 mM ZnCl<sub>2 </sub>was added into each cell culture to ensure zinc rich conditions. Growth was continued for 30 min at 26&#x000b0;C before harvested for total RNA isolation.

For overproduction of Zur, an overnight culture from a single colony was used to inoculate 200 milliliter of LB medium. Cells were grown with vigorous shaking at 37&#x000b0;C to an optical density at 620 nm (OD620) of 0.8 and were induced with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-&#x003b2;-D-thiogalactoside) for 6 h at 37&#x000b0;C. For purification, harvested cells were treated with BugBuster<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen). Inclusion bodies were recovered by centrifugation and washed twice with the same reagent. The Zur protein was renaturated and then concentrated to a final concentration of about 0.6 mg/ml with the Amicon Ultra-15 (Millipore). The protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE with silver staining.

These results could be due to a second lower affinity binding site recognized by Zur at higher concentrations. Alternatively, like another regulator Fur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], larger amounts of Zur proteins in the buffered environments would promote the formation of much more dimmers or even polymers, and thus there might be multiple Zur molecules bound to a single DNA site.</p><p>In assaying EMSA reactions containing either no zinc or increasing concentrations of zinc (from 0.61 to 2500 &#x003bc;M), 5 pmol of Zur was incubated with 10 fmol labeled <italic>znuA </italic>promoter region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>).

Accordingly, an optimized concentration of zinc at 100 &#x003bc;M was proposed for EMSA. Zur bound to target DNA even without added zinc, which might be due to the contamination of trace amount of Zn or other bivalent metal ions in the EMSA reactions, or due to the fact that the purified Zur protein might already contain some bound zinc with it.</p><p>To further validate the effect of zinc, with 5 pmol of Zur and 10 fmol of target DNA, EDTA at increasing concentrations (from 0.61 to 2500 &#x003bc;M) was added into different EMSA reactions respectively, so as to chelate zinc or other contaminated bivalent metal ions in the reaction mixture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>). The complete inhibition of Zur-DNA binding occurred from 78 &#x003bc;M EDTA without addition of zinc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>), while that occurred from 312.5 &#x003bc;M EDTA when 100 &#x003bc;M zinc was added (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>).</p><p>The above results indicated that either zinc or Zur within a certain range of amounts was crucial for the Zur-DNA recognition.

The Zur box was found in only site 1 other than site 2. It was postulated that a Zur molecule might recognize the conserved Zur box (site 1) and further cooperatively associate with another Zur molecule to help the later one to bind to a less conserved (or completely different) binding site (site 2). Further reporter fusion experiments and/or <italic>in vitr</italic>o transcription assays, using <italic>znuCB</italic>-<italic>znuA </italic>intergenic promoter regions with different mutations/deletions within sites 1 and 2, should be done to elucidate the roles of site 1 and site 2 in Zur-mediated regulation of <italic>znuCB </italic>and <italic>znuA</italic>.</p><p>More than 50 ribosomal proteins together with three rRNAs (16S, 23S, and 5S rRNA) constitute the prokaryotic ribosome that is a molecular machine for protein biosynthesis. Most prokaryotic ribosomal proteins conserved highly, and their genes are assigned as single-copy genes in the genomes of many bacteria and are indispensable for cell viability. Some ribosomal protein genes (e.g. L36, L33, L31 and S14) have their paralogous pairs in many bacterial genomes, and it remains unclear why many bacteria possess these duplications in their genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Zinc controls transcription of L36, L33, L31 and S14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Each paralogous pairs can be classified into two types; one type contains a CxxC zinc binding motif (generally a pair of conserved cysteines; designated C+), whereas the other does not (C-) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The C- forms have lost the Zn ribbons in contrast to their original ribosomal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It was predicted that an ancient duplication of the C+ forms took place before the divergence of major bacterial lineages. Subsequently, loss of the C+ form or loss of the CxxC motif after the duplication generated the C-form) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The C+ form is stable in cell when it contains a zinc ion bound to its CxxC motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The paralogous pairs of L31 protein are RpmE (C+) and YtiA (C-) in <italic>B. subtilis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Expression of <italic>ytiA </italic>is repressed by Zur using zinc as its cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Liberation of RpmE from ribosome is triggered by the expression of <italic>ytiA</italic>, which is induced by the de-repression of Zur under zinc-deficient conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The paralogous pairs of L31 protein are RpmE (YPO0111) and YkgM (YPO3134) in <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, while those of L36 protein are RpmJ (YPO0230) and RpmJ2 (YPO3135) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. YkgM and RpmJ2 are the C- forms of corresponding ribosomal proteins. <italic>ykgM </italic>and <italic>rpmJ2 </italic>constitutes a putative <italic>ykgM</italic>-<italic>rpmJ2 </italic>operon in <italic>Y. pestis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It was shown herein that the <italic>ykgM</italic>-<italic>rpmJ2 </italic>operon was repressed by Zur. As expected, Zur bound to a Zur box-like element within the <italic>ykgM </italic>promoter region.</p><p>Almost all the L36, L33, L31, and S14 protein genes are regulated by zinc in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, and their C- paralogs was negatively regulated by Zur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Similar findings have been reported in <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Taken the above together, a regulatory cascade was proposed herein on the basis of the previous notions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Zinc was a key factor in controlling changes in the composition of L36, L33, L31 and S14 proteins in ribosome. Under zinc rich conditions, original L36, L33, L31 and S14 proteins (C+) bound with zinc ions were stable and functional in ribosome, and expression of their C- counterparts was repressed by Zur using zinc as its cofactor. Under zinc starvation conditions, these C+ proteins would not contain a zinc ion and would thus no longer be stable in the cell, while the zinc starvation would cause a de-repression of expression of their C- counterparts and would be associated with the ribosome instead of corresponding C+ proteins. The above alternation between C+ and C- ribosomal proteins might be helpful to increase the concentration of zinc ions available for other zinc-requiring proteins in the cell. Therefore, the above proposed regulatory cascade would contribute to bacterial zinc homeostasis under zinc-deficient conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A <italic>zur </italic>null mutant of <italic>Y. pestis microtus </italic>strain 201 was constructed in the present work.
