In particular, the relationship between the breast cancer predisposing gene <italic>BRCA1</italic> and XIST, the main mediator of X chromosome inactivation, has been intensely investigated, but still remains controversial. We investigated this topic by assessing XIST behaviour in different groups of breast carcinomas and in a panel of breast cancer cell lines both <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant and wild type. In addition, we evaluated the occurrence of broader defects of heterochromatin in relation to <italic>BRCA1</italic> status in breast cancer cells. We provide evidence that in breast cancer cells BRCA1 is involved in <italic>XIST</italic> regulation on the active X chromosome, but not in its localization as previously suggested, and that XIST can be unusually expressed by an active X and can decorate it. This indicates that the detection of XIST cloud in cancer cell is not synonymous of the presence of an inactive X chromosome. Moreover, we show that global heterochromatin defects observed in breast tumor cells are independent of <italic>BRCA1</italic> status. Our observations sheds light on a possible previously uncharacterized mechanism of breast carcinogenesis mediated by XIST misbehaviour, particularly in <italic>BRCA1</italic>-related cancers. Moreover, the significant higher levels of <italic>XIST</italic>-RNA detected in <italic>BRCA1</italic>-associated respect to sporadic basal-like cancers, opens the possibility to use <italic>XIST</italic> expression as a marker to discriminate between the two groups of tumors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>X chromosome inactivation (XCI) occurs early during embryogenesis and <italic>XIST</italic> (X inactive specific transcript) is the key player of the X chromosome silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005559-Heard1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005559-Erwin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.
