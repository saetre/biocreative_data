CXCL10/IP-10 (IFN&#x003b3;-inducible protein 10) and CXCL9/Mig (monokine induced by IFN-&#x003b3;) are up-regulated in CS-induced lung injury and may attract T-cell recruitment to the lung. These chemokines together with CXCL11/ITAC (IFN-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant) are ligands for the chemokine receptor CXCR3 which is preferentially expressed chiefly in activated CD8+ T cells. The purpose of this investigation was to study the contribution of CXCR3 to acute lung inflammation induced by CS using CXCR3 knockout (KO) mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Mice (n = 8 per group) were placed in a closed plastic box connected to a smoke generator and were exposed whole body to the tobacco smoke of five cigarettes four times a day for three days.

CS initiates the infiltration of innate and adaptive inflammatory cells into the airways and the lung parenchyma and further destroys the alveolar structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The role of inflammation in the development of COPD is supported by the finding of excess numbers of CD8+ T cells in lung tissues from patients with COPD and an inverse relationship to the lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. CD8+ T cells in epithelium and submucosa expressing CXCR3 were increased in numbers in smokers with COPD as compared with nonsmokers. Excessive CD8+ T cells in the lungs of COPD also produce large amounts of IFN&#x003b3; and IFN&#x003b3;-induced CXC chemokines, such as CXCL10/interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10). CXCL10, a CXCR3 ligand, was abundantly expressed in bronchiolar epithelial cells and airway smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. CXCL9/Mig, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL11/ITAC are chemokines that attract activated T cells through binding to their receptor, CXCR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that CXCR3/CXCL10 interaction may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD through T cell recruitment in airways and lung parenchyma.</p><p>A key initiating event in COPD is the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lung in response to CS exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], which is regulated by a variety of chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. CXCL9/Mig, CXCL10/IP-10 and CXCL11/ITAC, ligands for CXCR3, and CCL5/RANTES, ligand for CCR5, were shown to be elevated in sputum from COPD patients compared with nonsmokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Chemokine receptors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation in rodent models exposed to CS. For example, CXCR2 has been demonstrated to be involved in acute pulmonary inflammation induced by CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In CCR5 gene ablated mice, lung tissue inflammation and apoptosis induced by IFN&#x003b3; and CS were also significantly decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Recent reports demonstrated that CCR6, together with its ligand CXCL20/MIP-3&#x003b1;, was involved in CS-induced lung inflammation and that the interaction between CCR6 and CCL20/MIP-3&#x003b1; could also mediate accumulation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the lungs of COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In terms of CXCR3, particularly expressed on activated Th1/Tc1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], we hypothesized that CXCR3 gene deficiency would terminate or at least attenuate CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and tissue damage. To address this hypothesis, we used CXCR3 KO mice and their WT littermates to investigate the contribution of CXCR3 in CS-induced lung injury process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice and cigarette smoke exposure</title><p>CXCR3 gene deficient mouse line has been established by gene targeting as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

CXCR3 may be a key factor in CS-induced pulmonary injury by regulating the recruitment of CD8+ T cells as well as other inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages and by initiating the production of IFN&#x003b3;, IFN&#x003b3;-target CXCL10, and the expression of effector molecules from CD8+ T cells.</p><p>The local inflammatory response in CS-induced lung injury is associated with infiltration of leukocytes, which is regulated by the members of CXC family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Consistent with previous reports of murine model induced by acute CS exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], neutrophils represented the majority of cells (~50% of the leukocytes in BAL fluid and lung tissue) in this study. Neutrophilic inflammation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of COPD, and neutrophil infiltration has been shown to be essential for the subsequent recruitment of CD8+ T cells to sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In CS-exposed CXCR3 KO mice, we observed significant reduction in the severity of lung inflammation as evidenced by fewer inflammatory cells in airways and lung tissue and lesser protein leakage into the airway. These observations point to an important role for CXCR3 in the pathogenesis of CS-induced pulmonary inflammation. However, it should be pointed out that CXCR3 KO mice showed partial protection from CS-induced pulmonary inflammation in this study. We have come to realize that CS-induced pulmonary inflammation is not caused by a single chemokine receptor but that multiple chemokine receptors expressed on inflammatory and immune cells are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Further studies should be done to determine how they interact in a complex network to contribute the pulmonary inflammation caused by CS.</p><p>Th1 type cells preferentially express CXCR3 and CCR5, and the infiltrating T cells in COPD express high levels of CXCR3 and CCR5, but not of CCR4 and CCR8 that are preferentially expressed by Th2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Numerous investigations performed both in vivo and in vitro have consistently found CXCR3 to be associated with Th1/Tc1 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In accordance with these findings, we demonstrated that less CD8+ T cells infiltrated into airways and lungs of CXCR3 KO mice. In mice where CD8+ T cells have been deleted, there is resistance to the development of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The explanation for the relative difference in CD8+ T cells between CXCR3 KO and WT mice in this model may in part be due to the downstream effect of CXCR3 activation. Moreover, CD8+ T cells damage the lung interstitium through the release of lytic substances such granzyme A, granzyme B, and perforin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In support of this notion, we demonstrated that the expression of these enzymes, to some extent, was upregulated in WT mice upon CS exposure. However, the upregulation was inhibited in CS-exposed CXCR3 KO mice. This phenomenon can be attributed to the abrogation of CD8+ T cells in the inflamed lungs from CXCR3 KO mice, which led to the decreased expression of these effector molecules.</p><p>The inflammatory response in CS-induced pulmonary damage is characterized by an increased number of Th1 cells, that secrete the Th1-type cytokine, IFN&#x003b3; [27]. IFN&#x003b3; expression in BALF and lung homogenates at both mRNA and protein levels was increased after CS exposure either in CXCR3 KO or WT mice, but in CXCR3 KO mice, such increase was blunted. We also demonstrated that CXCR3 ligands were significantly elevated at the transcriptional level required for IFN&#x003b3; in CS-exposed WT mice. Notably, there was less CXCL10 in both BALF and lung homogenates in CXCR3 KO mice. This can be explained by the negative feedback effect of CXCR3 deletion, in which the reduced accumulation of inflammatory cells in airways and pulmonary parenchyma leads to a diminished release of inflammatory mediators such as IFN&#x003b3;; more importantly, this leads to inhibition of the activation of airway epithelial cells to produce CXCL10 and decrease in the recruitment of CXCR3 bearing CD8+ T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to specifically focus on the importance of CXCR3 in CS-induced lung inflammation by using CXCR3 KO mice. In conclusion, our study shows that CXCR3 regulates CS-induced lung inflammation via recruitment of CD8+ T cells into the lung to trigger the inflammatory response cascade with over-expression of IFN&#x003b3; and chemokines that activate CXCR3 ligands, particularly CXCL10. Our findings may provide a therapeutic target for treating CS-induced pulmonary injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Editors' note</title><p>Following publication of this article, we have been informed that results from this experiment looking at the effects of cigarette smoke two hours after last exposure, rather than 24 hours as in this article, have been published as: Li Nie, Ruo-lan Xiang, Yong Liu, Wei-xun Zhou, Lei Jiang, Bao Lu, Bao-sen Pang, De-yun Cheng, Jin-ming Gao: <italic>Acta Pharmacologica Sinica</italic> 2008 December; 29 (12): 1432-1439.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LN and RX performed the whole procedure of the experiments.
