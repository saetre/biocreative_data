A general model has been proposed for heterochromatin formation and epigenetic gene silencing in different species that implies an essential role for HP1a. According to the model, histone methyltransferase enzymes (HMTases) methylate the histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me), creating selective binding sites for itself and the chromodomain of HP1a. This complex is thought to form a higher order chromatin state that represses gene activity. It has also been found that HP1a plays a role in telomere capping. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that HP1a is present at many euchromatic sites along polytene chromosomes of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, including the developmental and heat-shock-induced puffs, and that this protein can be removed from these sites by in vivo RNase treatment, thus suggesting an association of HP1a with the transcripts of many active genes. To test this suggestion, we performed an extensive screening by RIP-chip assay (RNA&#x02013;immunoprecipitation on microarrays), and we found that HP1a is associated with transcripts of more than one hundred euchromatic genes. An expression analysis in HP1a mutants shows that HP1a is required for positive regulation of these genes. Cytogenetic and molecular assays show that HP1a also interacts with the well known proteins DDP1, HRB87F, and PEP, which belong to different classes of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) involved in RNA processing. Surprisingly, we found that all these hnRNP proteins also bind heterochromatin and are dominant suppressors of position effect variegation. Together, our data show novel and unexpected functions for HP1a and hnRNPs proteins. All these proteins are in fact involved both in RNA transcript processing and in heterochromatin formation. This suggests that, in general, similar epigenetic mechanisms have a significant role on both RNA and heterochromatin metabolisms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1a) is a very well known prototype protein of a general model for heterochromatin formation and epigenetic gene silencing in different species including humans.

Other recent experiments also support a positive role of HP1a in gene expression. Many euchromatic genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are down-regulated in HP1a deficient larvae. Although it is still unknown how many of these genes are direct targets of HP1a, the same study showed that HP1a is associated with some of them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-Cryderman1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Also relevant is the prior observation that, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the <italic>in vivo</italic> RNase treatment of polytene chromosomes of wild type larvae removes almost all the euchromatic HP1a immunosignals.

Most importantly, a &#x0201c;RIP-Chip&#x0201d; (RNA-immunoprecipitation on microarrays) analysis shows that HP1a associates with the RNA transcripts of more than one hundred genes. We found that HP1a positively regulates the expression of these genes by also interacting with DDP1, HRB87F and PEP, which belong to different classes of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) involved in RNA processing.

Recombinant HP1a was incubated with Hsp70 RNA which had been previously transcribed and marked radioactively. The protein HP1a was then cross-linked to the RNA by UV and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive signals at the positions corresponding to the molecular weight of the HP1a monomer and dimer show that the protein is able to bind Hsp70 RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000670-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The ability of HP1a to interact with the Hsp70 RNA <italic>in vivo</italic> was analyzed by primer extension on the population of RNA immunoprecipitated from Schneider's (S2) cultured cells with the monoclonal C1A9 (anti-HP1a) antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000670-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, Hsp70 RNA is present only in the immunoprecipitated RNA from heat-shocked cells, confirming the ability of HP1a to bind Hsp70 RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both these results indicate the association of HP1a with transcriptionally active genomic regions. To determine which part of the protein is responsible for its RNA binding, we performed a gel shift assay on the series of HP1a fragments indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000670-g001">Figure 1E</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-Perrini1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-Delattre1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-Schotta1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000670-g001">Figure 1E</xref> shows, we found that only the HP1a fragments containing the chromodomain are capable of producing a gel shift of RNA. These results strongly suggest that the chromodomain region is required for the direct binding of HP1a to RNA transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of the target transcripts of HP1a by &#x0201c;RIP-Chip&#x0201d; (RNA-immunoprecipitation on microarrays) analysis</title><p>We used an optimized &#x0201c;RIP-Chip&#x0201d; (RNA-immunoprecipitation on microarrays) protocol to screen for the target RNA transcripts of HP1a. After the advent of RIP-chip technologies, several related methods were developed using physical or chemical RNA-protein cross-linking to identify the multiple RNA targets of RNA binding protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-Keene1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. We decided not to use cross-linking in our S2 cell extracts to avoid any artifacts produced by cross-linking reagents, such as the reduction of cell lysis, the introduction of sequence bias, an increase in background and a less-than-complete reversibility. Instead, we optimized the RIP-Chip conditions to find <italic>in vivo</italic> the RNA substrates of HP1a protein while minimizing possible artifacts. Control experiments were done to ensure the absolute requirements for productive amplification and labeling in the RT reaction and to test for the presence of HP1a in the immunoprecipitated RNA (not shown). After background subtraction, the net intensity for each spot and the ratio between the IP and input were calculated. Four independent experiments were performed, and after data filtering to exclude artifacts and low-signal spots, the subsequent analysis was carried out on the 5780 cDNA clones which gave reliable signals in at least 3 out of 4 experiments. For each experiment, data were ordered by ranking, and the median rank was calculated for each cDNA clone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000670.s004">Table S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000670.s005">Table S2</xref> shows the median percentile rank (MPR) between IP and input for the cDNA clones within the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile. The same table reports the results of two independent experiments done with the identical procedure but without the antibody against HP1a. It is evident that most of the putative HP1a targets show a much lower percentile rank in these control experiments, confirming the specificity of the immunoprecipitation.</p><p>We identified 105 genuine transcript targets, reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000670.s006">Table S3</xref>. These transcripts correspond to genes that, constitutively, support a very active rate of transcription. To test whether these genes correspond to the most abundant transcripts or are specifically associated with HP1a, we identified the 200 most abundant transcripts in the input RNA and analysed their median percentile rank in HP1a IP. Only 6/200 transcripts are included in the list of the best HP1a binders (IP rank&#x02265;0.9) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000670.s007">Table S4</xref>). Moreover, the median IP rank of the 200 most abundant transcripts is 0.45, while their median rank in the mock experiments is 0.61. Thus, if there is a bias in the HP1a experiments, it is toward less abundant, rather than more abundant transcripts. The signal intensity median rank for the best HP1a binders (IP rank&#x02265;0.9) is 0.56, indicating that the RNAs bound by HP1a tend to be only slightly more abundant than average.</p><p>De Wit et al. (2007) did a high resolution analysis of HP1a binding on <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromosomes 2 and 4 using the DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-deWit1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This technique is used to make genome-wide maps of DNA-interacting proteins. DamID consists in making a fusion protein composed of the protein of interest and DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam). Expression of this protein permits the methylation of adenines around the sites of the protein-DNA binding. The methylated sequences are amplified and identified by hybridization to microarrays. The authors identified 357 genes, with an average HP1a-Dam methylase vs Dam methylase log2-ratio along the entire gene &#x0003e;1, out of 3992 genes represented on the microarray (8.9&#x00025;). A total of 189 genes (4.7&#x00025;) showed an average log2 ratio &#x0003e;2, considered a more stringent cut-off by the authors. The pattern of increased methylation typically spanned the entire gene coding regions. We looked at the average HP1a-Dam/Dam log2 ratio of 21 genes present on chromosome 2 which showed &#x0003e;0.9 MP Rank in our RNA binding experiments. No gene showed an average Log2 ratio &#x0003e;1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000670.s008">Table S5</xref>); the highest average ratio was 0.59. Moreover, only 6/21 genes (29&#x00025;) showed significant localized clusters of HP1a-Dam/Dam log2 values &#x0003e;0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000670.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These data suggest that when HP1a-Dam methylase fusion protein is bound via RNA, it retains a limited capacity to extensively methylate the DNA gene coding region. This limitation could be qualitative and/or quantitative and could be due to several factors: the methylating domain could be masked by interactions with RNA; the methylating domain could be masked by protein partners which are exclusively present when HP1a is bound to RNA; methylation could be less efficient due to a peculiar chromatin structure selectively present on HP1a RNA targets. We think that these observations should be taken in account when trying to reconstruct the complex pattern of interaction of this pleiotropic protein.</p><p>When we compare the HP1a euchromatic binding sites and the location of the genes corresponding to the RNA target sites in polytene chromosomes we find that about half of the selected targets (52/105) map in the same cytological band or in bands immediately adjacent to where HP1a has been located <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-Fanti2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000670-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000670.s006">Table S3</xref>).

Three of the genes that do not overlap with any HP1a signals did not show any significant variation between mutant and wild type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000670-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, these genes do not seem to be regulated by HP1a in larval cells. For the other two genes which do not comap with HP1a on polytene chromosomes, we observed a reduction in transcripts as in S2 cells, probably due to a down-regulation of their expression in other larval tissues; it is possible, in fact, that HP1a binds these transcripts in other larval tissues rather than in salivary glands. As observed in S2 cells, the results of RT-PCR analysis in HP1a mutant larvae clearly show no effect on the amount of the non HP1a target transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000670-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). This also implies that the lack of HP1a induces a specific effect in gene expression and not a general effect in gene expression due to a larval lethality induced by the mutation.

In which of these functions is HP1a implicated? The cytological colocalization and the direct interaction of HP1a with active Pol II seem to be compatible with an involvement of HP1a in transcript elongation. We tested this hypothesis using the transcription inhibitor DRB on heat-shock induced puffs on polytene chromosomes.

We also observed that the immunopattern of active Pol II is not affected on HP1a mutant polytene chromosomes (data not shown) indicating that RNA Pol II elongation is not disrupted in the absence of HP1a. Another suggested role for some hnRNPs is a shuttle function for the export of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-Michael1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-Michael2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Using a stringent cutoff (10&#x00025; top rank), we identified target transcripts corresponding to about 100 genes. However, we think that the number of genes whose transcripts are affected by HP1a is probably much higher.</p><p>Although these transcripts were identified in cultured somatic cells, their genes correspond for the most part with HP1a immunosignals along the polytene chromosomes of larval salivary glands. The analysis of the expression of about 15&#x00025; of these genes in S2 cells lacking HP1a and in HP1a mutant larvae showed a significant quantitative reduction in their transcripts, thus suggesting that HP1a is involved in their upregulation. For the first time we have been able to systematically identify the direct targets of HP1a in the euchromatin, and to determine HP1a's positive regulatory role on the corresponding genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>HP1a seems to be involved in RNA transcript packaging and stability by its interaction with hnRNP proteins</title><p>We found that HP1a binding sites overlap extensively with those of the DDP1, HRB87F and PEP proteins, and that it coimmunoprecipitates with these proteins. Though these proteins belong to different classes of hnRNPs, we found that they are part of a hnRNP sub-complex with an ordered assembly. They bind RNA transcripts in a hierarchical fashion beginning with DDP1 and ending with PEP.</p><p>In which aspect of RNA metabolism is HP1a involved? Our tests of the different possibilities lead us to conclude that the predominant role of HP1a may be the packaging and stability of RNA transcripts. This conclusion seems to be supported by the functional characteristics of the HP1a-interacting hnRNPs. For instance, A1 hnRNP is considered one of the best examples of a non specific RNA chaperone, probably required to prevent and resolve RNA misfolding, such as the formation of secondary structures that would be counterproductive to rapid processing of pre-mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-Herschlag1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000670-Schroeder1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. In conclusion, overall data indicate an involvement of HP1 in packaging and stability of RNA by binding to nascent transcripts at the transcription sites. We do not know yet if HP1-containing complexes also include processed RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>A novel role of hnRNP proteins in heterochromatin formation</title><p>The HP1a-containing hnRNP sub-complex also plays a role in heterochromatin formation. We found that the HRB87F and PEP proteins, like DDP1, are located on the heterochromatin, where they probably bind both RNA and single-stranded DNA, since they are partially removed from the chromocenter of polytene chromosomes after <italic>in vivo</italic> treatments with RNase. Importantly, we also found that these proteins, like DDP1, are dominant suppressors of heterochromatin-induced gene silencing. This strongly suggests that at least some hnRNP proteins have a novel and unexpected role in heterochromatin formation. A comparison of the heterochromatic immunopatterns of all these proteins reveals that DDP1, HRB87F and PEP are located in sub-regions of the chromocenter while HP1a is present on the entire chromocenter. Localization of each protein on polytene chromosomes of mutant larvae for each of the other genes also shows that DDP1 seems to be necessary for the recruitment of HRB87F and PEP proteins on the chromocenter. DDP1 and Hrb87F mutations only partially affect the HP1a heterochromatic pattern. It reasonable to think that DDP1, HRB87F and PEP bind some unknown non-coding RNA and/or single-stranded DNA. The partial modification of the HP1a immunopattern in DDP1 and HRB87F mutants implies that HP1a also binds a non-coding RNA in some heterochromatic sub-regions. Supporting this idea is our observation of a partial removal of the HP1a heterochromatic immunopattern after RNase treatment (unpublished data). The new role of HP1a in RNA processing suggests a possible additional contribution to the classical role of such protein in PEV. It is possible that genes inserted into or near heterochromatin could be transcribed more slowly, and enhancement of processing by HP1a could result in aberrant transcripts leading to post-transcriptional silencing. Reduced dosage of HP1a could shift the balance toward more productive transcripts, resulting in suppression of PEV.</p><p>It is evident that HP1a is a functionally multifaceted adaptor involved not only in heterochromatin formation, gene silencing and telomere capping, but also in the regulation of gene expression. What molecular mechanisms are responsible for the functional versatility of HP1a? Either HP1a possesses several modes of action, or HP1a always performs the same activity but with different partners in different contexts. In either case, we think that conformational changes due to post-translational modifications, generating a sort of an epigenetic sub-code, would permit the different interactions of HP1a in different contexts.</p><p>We propose that, regardless of the mechanism(s) of action, the main function of HP1a is nucleic acid compaction: HP1a's interaction with modified histones and specific hnRNP proteins, and perhaps some non coding RNA, produces a compaction of DNA that is the basis for heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, while HP1a interaction with RNA-packaging hnRNP proteins induces a compaction of RNA with the consequent stabilization that reinforces gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p>The <italic>Ore-R, In(1)w<sup>m4</sup></italic>, <italic>T(2;3)Sb<sup>v</sup></italic> and <italic>T(3;Y)BL2</italic> stocks used here have been kept in our laboratory for many years.
