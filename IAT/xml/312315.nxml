The presence of this alternatively spliced RNA in 10T1/2 fibroblast cells, mouse liver and testis suggests that this alternative splicing may be universal. The level of alternatively spliced p53 RNA was increased coordinately with that of regularly spliced p53 in 10T1/2 cells in response to epidermal growth factor. Immunoprecipitation analysis of epidermal cells using monoclonal antibodies which recognize different epitopes of p53 suggested that distinct p53 proteins may be translated from both RNA species. Considering previous observations on the potential importance of carboxyl terminal sequences in p53 function, knowledge of the ubiquitous presence of alternatively spliced p53 is important for future studies of p53 function in normal cells and in oncogenesis.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00082-0138-a" xlink:role="1980"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00082-0138-b" xlink:role="1980"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00082-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1979"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00082-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1980"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00082-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1981"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
