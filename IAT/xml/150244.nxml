This is achieved by the expression of the site-specific DNA recombinase Cre in conjunction with the target gene containing two Cre recognition sites (<italic>loxP</italic>). In the conditional mouse mutant, inactivation of the target gene is restricted in a spatial and&#x0002f;or temporal manner, depending on the expression pattern of the recombinase. Since the initial demonstration of this technology in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c4">4</xref>), an increasing number of conditional knockout experiments have been published, most of which employed tissue-specific promoters to control Cre expression. Spatially regulated gene inactivation has proven to be powerful in dissecting the role of different cell types in a physiological process, as demonstrated for example by studies concerning the role of insulin receptor signaling in glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c5">5</xref>). The method of choice for precise gene function analyses in adult mice, however, is the temporal control of gene inactivation as it can prevent impaired embryonic development until the time of induction. In particular, inducible gene targeting in all organs would be a useful tool if the major site of gene action is not precisely defined. Optimally, such a system should permit a tight control of gene inactivation, efficient recombination in every single cell of the body upon induction, and the opportunity to produce sufficient numbers of inducible mouse mutants within a short time.</p><p>The major drawback of the current strategy is the long time frame required for the derivation of a conditional mouse mutant. Since two copies of the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked allele must be combined with the recombinase transgene, at least three breeding steps (3 months each) are required to obtain a reasonable number of mice with the desired genotype (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f5">5</xref>A). While the first conditional mouse mutants can be expected within 14 months, additional time for breeding is usually needed to obtain sufficient numbers of mice for phenotypic analysis. To date, only a few mouse strains permitting ubiquitously inducible gene targeting are available, all of which suffer from incomplete recombination upon induction or background activity in the absence of inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c10">10</xref>). Recently, a mouse strain has been generated by the insertion of a tamoxifen-inducible CreER fusion protein gene into the ubiquitously expressed <italic>Rosa26</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c11">11</xref>). While this strain represented the most efficient tool for ubiquitously inducible gene targeting so far, a low affinity ER domain was used that requires high doses of the inducer 4-hydroxytamoxifen to achieve the maximal rate of recombination. Therefore, the side effects of the inducer may interfere with the phenotypic outcome of target gene inactivation. Taken together, there is a need for improved methods which both enable efficient gene knockout in all organs at non-toxic concentrations of the inducer and which accelerate the production of inducible mouse mutants.</p><p>In this paper we describe a novel approach for the rapid generation of inducible mouse mutants, which overcomes the drawbacks of the current technology. The approach is based on a ubiquitously expressed, high affinity CreER fusion protein that allows the efficient inducible inactivation of a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked target gene in most organs. In addition, we demonstrate that hybrid ES cells tolerate at least three consecutive gene targeting cycles including selection with the antibiotics G418 and hygromycin B without affecting the potency to complement tetraploid blastocysts. Our findings provide a new concept allowing the rapid production of ES cell-derived, inducible knockout mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of vectors</title><p><italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>.

The ER<sup>T2</sup> domain is composed of amino acids 282&#x02013;595 of the human estrogen receptor and carries three mutations (G400V&#x0002f;M543A&#x0002f;L544A) that confer a 10&#x000d7; enhanced sensitivity to the synthetic ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen in mice as compared to the previously used ER<sup>T</sup> (G521R) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c18">18</xref>). The <italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> coding region was inserted into the ubiquitously expressed <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus through homologous recombination to obtain a configuration that allows the inducible inactivation of genes in all organs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f1">1</xref>). The <italic>Rosa26</italic> targeting vector containing the <italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> gene is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f1">1</xref>A.

Independent recombinant ES cell clones were obtained at a frequency of 2&#x00025; as verified by Southern blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f1">1</xref>B). Deletion of the <italic>neo</italic> gene did not affect the level of <italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> expression as determined by western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f1">1</xref>D). A <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked hygromycin resistance gene was introduced into the second allele of <italic>Rosa26</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f1">1</xref>A and C) to provide a similar test substrate for Cre as the widely used <italic>Rosa26</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c20">20</xref>).

Half-maximal activation of CreER<sup>T2</sup> occurred at a concentration of 10 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f1">1</xref>F) as compared to 100 nM for the CreER<sup>T</sup> fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of ES cell-derived mice</title><p>The three types of recombinant and wild-type V6.5 and ART4.12 ES cells were injected into tetraploid blastocysts and ES mice were obtained upon transfer of these blastocysts into pseudopregnant females. The proportion of transferred blastocysts that further developed into live born pups was in the range 8&#x02013;17&#x00025; and did not significantly decrease when ES cells were used that had undergone up to three sequential rounds of transfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f2">2</xref>A). In contrast, the production of ES mice using inbred ES cells was inefficient (0.2&#x00025;), confirming the &#x02018;hybrid vigor&#x02019; effect described in Eggan <italic>et al</italic>.

These results demonstrate that mice can be produced by tetraploid blastocyst complementation using cells that have undergone three consecutive rounds of transfection, including two drug selection cycles.</p></sec><sec><title>Ubiquitously inducible gene targeting in mice</title><p>For the induction of CreER<sup>T2</sup> in mice, we applied 1&#x02013;5 mg tamoxifen orally for 5 days in the following experiments. We preferred to use this protocol, as the LD<sub>50</sub> of tamoxifen in mice is 15-fold higher via the oral route than by i.p. injection (200 mg versus 5 g&#x0002f;kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c21">21</xref>). It has been recently demonstrated that the oral application of tamoxifen is as efficient as i.p. injection of 4-hydroxytamoxifen for the activation of CreER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c22">22</xref>). <italic>Rosa</italic>(<italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>&#x0002f;<italic>lacZ reporter</italic>) mice were fed with daily 5 mg tamoxifen for 5 days and recombination of the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter was analyzed 3 days after the last administration. Southern analysis of genomic DNA from different organs showed up to 50&#x00025; recombination, without detectable background activity in untreated animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f3">3</xref>A). This is a significantly higher degree of inducible recombination as compared to the results obtained with the <italic>Rosa26-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c11">11</xref>), indicating that the ER<sup>T2</sup> domain is indeed more sensitive to 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Upon recombination, the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene turned out to be inserted non-functionally, presumably due to a second start codon upstream of the coding region.</p><p>Since the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus has a limited accessibility for Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c11">11</xref>), we were interested to test the <italic>rosa</italic>(<italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>) configuration in the context of other <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked loci. As the second substrate, we used the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked DNA polymerase &#x003b2; gene segment (<italic>pol</italic>&#x003b2;<sup><italic>flox</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c4">4</xref>). This allele had been used to characterize a number of tissue-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c26">26</xref>) as well as inducible Cre strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c12">12</xref>), and shows an intermediate accessibility for Cre (F.

The <italic>pol</italic>&#x003b2;<sup><italic>flox</italic></sup>&#x0002f;<italic>rosa</italic>(<italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>) mice were fed with 5 mg tamoxifen&#x0002f;day for 5 days and analyzed 3 days later. Southern blot analysis revealed that the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked polymerase &#x003b2; gene segment was excised in more than 90&#x00025; of cells in all organs except brain, whereas no background recombination was detected in untreated mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f3">3</xref>B). As a third substrate, we used a 2.5 kb <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked segment of the <italic>ect2</italic> gene. Again, up to 100&#x00025; recombination in most tissues was achieved upon tamoxifen treatment of <italic>ect2</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup>&#x0002f;<italic>rosa</italic>(<italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>) mice, without detectable background recombination in uninduced controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f3">3</xref>C). A similar degree of recombination was achieved when a shorter (0.5 kb) <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked segment in the same position of the <italic>ect2</italic> gene was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f3">3</xref>D). &#x02018;Low dose application&#x02019; of 5 &#x000d7; 1 mg tamoxifen was sufficient to achieve complete recombination of the <italic>ect2</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup> allele in most organs, further demonstrating the improved sensitivity of the ER<sup>T2</sup> domain <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To investigate whether the low recombination efficiency in brain was due to low <italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> expression we performed western analysis using antibodies specific for the human estrogen receptor. The 74 kDa band corresponding to the CreER<sup>T2</sup> fusion protein was detectable in all organs including brain, with the highest levels in thymus, small intestine and testis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f4">4</xref>). The limited degree of recombination in brain may thus reflect a lower local concentration of 4-hydroxytamoxifen rather than a reduced expression level of CreER<sup>T2</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We describe an optimized system that allows ubiquitously inducible gene targeting in mice. This system is based on a fusion protein consisting of Cre recombinase and a mutated ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor that is expressed under the control of the ubiquitously active <italic>Rosa26</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c19">19</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>Rosa26-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup> mouse strain published by Vooijs <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c11">11</xref>), we used the ER<sup>T2</sup> domain that responds at an &#x0223c;10-fold lower dose of the synthetic inducer 4-hydroxytamoxifen as compared to the ER<sup>T</sup> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c18">18</xref>). In mice, the <italic>rosa</italic>(<italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>) configuration achieved nearly complete inducible excision of multiple <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked gene segments in all organs except brain, without background recombination in the absence of inducer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f3">3</xref>). Thus, our system permits the tight temporal control of ubiquitous gene inactivation, allowing precise gene function analysis in animals that have undergone normal embryonic development. The lower degree of deletion observed with the <italic>Rosa26</italic> allele (<italic>lacZ reporter</italic>) confirms the position dependency of Cre-mediated recombination described by Vooijs <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c11">11</xref>). Since all other targets tested so far achieved near complete excision with the <italic>rosa</italic>(<italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>) configuration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f2">2</xref> and unpublished observations), a limited accessibility may be restricted to only a minority of <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked loci. As the <italic>rosa</italic>(<italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>) allele permits inducible gene inactivation in all organs, it should find broad application as a research tool in reverse mouse genetics.</p><p>We have employed the tetraploid blastocyst complementation approach for <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of the <italic>rosa</italic>(<italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>) configuration, allowing the generation of ES cell-derived mice (ES mice) in a single step without the requirement of time-consuming breeding. Tetraploid blastocysts are not capable of completing normal development, but, when complemented by the introduction of diploid ES cells, support the development of solely ES cell-derived mice. The efficient generation of such ES mice using non-transgenic hybrid ES cells has been recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c16">16</xref>). In this study, the authors also succeeded in generating a single ES mouse through tetraploid blastocyst complementation using transfected cells that had undergone two consecutive rounds of selection. However, it remained unclear whether ES cells maintain their potency to complement tetraploid embryos with sufficient efficiency and reproducibility even after additional genetic modifications, which is a prerequisite for the strategy depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f5">5</xref>B. We introduced both the <italic>CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> coding region and a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter construct into hybrid ES cells by targeted insertion into the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus. The targeting strategy involved three consecutive rounds of transfection and selection with the antibiotics G418 and hygromycin B. We found that all targeted ES cell clones produced ES-derived mice with high efficiency. The proportion of transferred blastocysts that developed into live born pups was in the range 8&#x02013;17&#x00025; and did not significantly decrease using ES cells that had undergone three consecutive transfections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f2">2</xref>A). Thus, we demonstrate that hybrid ES cells can be exposed to at least three transfection cycles without affecting the potency to complement tetraploid embryos, allowing the analysis of complex genetic alterations in ES cell-derived mice within the time of a single mouse generation.</p><p>Our findings provide the proof of principle for a new concept allowing the rapid production of inducible knockout mice using tetraploid blastocyst complementation. So far, the derivation of conditional mouse mutants had been a time-consuming undertaking since three breeding steps (3 months each) are usually required to obtain mice combining two copies of the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked allele and the recombinase transgene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f5">5</xref>A). To address this limitation, we propose a new strategy that involves the tetraploid blastocyst complementation approach for the one step generation of conditional mouse mutants from genetically engineered ES cells. The generation of ES cells from <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mice is feasible using standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c15">15</xref>), as demonstrated by O&#x02019;Gorman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng012c27">27</xref>). Three transfection cycles are sufficient to introduce <italic>loxP</italic> sites into both alleles of the target gene in ES cells, following the strategy depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f5">5</xref>B. Thus, by using <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic ES cell lines for the generation of the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked alleles, it will be possible to produce conditional mouse mutants directly from the targeted ES cells through tetraploid blastocyst complementation. Using this scheme, adult (2 months old) inducible mouse mutants available for phenotypic analyses can be obtained within 6 months, required for three gene targeting steps (1 month each) and one mouse generation time (3 months) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f5">5</xref>B). This saves more than 50&#x00025; of time as compared to the current conditional gene targeting protocol, which requires 14 months including two targeting steps and four mouse generations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng012f5">5</xref>A). Since the described approach is simple and technically not more demanding than the current knockout protocol, we expect that this strategy will become a widely used tool in reverse mouse genetics.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gng012f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Generation of targeted ES cells.
