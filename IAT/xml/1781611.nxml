The serum levels of both bFGF and TGF-beta1 were found to be significantly higher in the CLL group (median 40.5 pg/ml and 38.6 ng/ml respectively) when compared to the control group (median 9.4 pg/ml and 18.9 ng/ml, respectively) (p&#x0003c;0.001). The levels of endostatin were not significantly different in CLL and control groups (median 12.3 ng/ml and 8.4 ng/ml, respectively) (p=0.09). In the group of CLL patients the level of bFGF was significantly higher in patients with progressive disease as compared with patients with stable disease (median 90.5 pg/ml and 40.5 pg/ml respectively) (p&#x0003c;0.001). Patients in Rai stage III and IV also had significantly higher levels of bFGF than patients in Rai stage 0-II (median 100.1 pg/ml and 29.3 pg/ml respectively) (p&#x0003c;0.001). The levels of both TGF-beta1 and endostatin were lower in patients in Rai stage III and IV (median 28.9 ng/ml and 9.1 ng/ml respectively) than in patients in Rai stage 0-II (42.8 ng/ml and 13.1 ng/ml respectively) (p&#x0003c;0.001 and p=0.002 respectively). The level of endostatin was also lower in the group of CLL patients with progressive disease (median 10.0 ng/ml) as compared to patients with stable disease (median 20.5 ng/ml) (p=0.008). In conclusion, the disturbance in the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors may have an important influence on the course of CLL.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
