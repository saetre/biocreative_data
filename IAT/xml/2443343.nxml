The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme lies at the apex of the ubiquitination cascade, and its activity is necessary for all subsequent steps in the reaction. We have isolated a temperature-sensitive mutation in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans uba-1</italic> gene, which encodes the sole E1 enzyme in this organism. Manipulation of UBA-1 activity at different developmental stages reveals a variety of functions for ubiquitination, including novel roles in sperm fertility, control of body size, and sex-specific development. Levels of ubiquitin conjugates are substantially reduced in the mutant, consistent with reduced E1 activity. The <italic>uba-1</italic> mutation causes delays in meiotic progression in the early embryo, a process that is known to be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The <italic>uba-1</italic> mutation also demonstrates synthetic lethal interactions with alleles of the anaphase-promoting complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The <italic>uba-1</italic> mutation provides a sensitized genetic background for identifying new <italic>in vivo</italic> functions for downstream components of the ubiquitin enzyme cascade, and it is one of the first conditional mutations reported for the essential E1 enzyme in a metazoan animal model.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Proteins that control an organism's development must first be turned on at the proper time and place, and then turned off when they are no longer needed. One of the &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; signals occurs through the attachment of a small protein, known as ubiquitin, to the target protein, which typically leads to the destruction of the target. Attachment of ubiquitin is controlled by a series of enzymes, the first of which is known as E1. Most organisms have a single gene for the E1 enzyme, and its activity is crucial for the degradation of a wide range of target proteins throughout development. We have identified a temperature-sensitive mutation in the E1 enzyme of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. By manipulating the growth temperature, we have determined the various functions of E1 at different stages of development. We find that this enzyme controls embryonic and larval development, sperm fertility, and body size. We also characterized sex-specific roles for E1; males exhibit progressive paralysis and defects in the tail, which is used for mating. In addition to the knowledge gained, this mutation provides a means of identifying both the functions of other ubiquitin enzymes during development as well as the target proteins that are marked for destruction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Post-translational modification of proteins performs a critical role in regulating protein activity, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis has emerged as the key player in the control of protein turnover. Ubiquitin, a highly conserved small protein, is covalently attached to a target protein through an enzymatic cascade, and the assembly of a poly-ubiquitin chain typically specifies that protein for rapid degradation via the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Hershko1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis thus provides an &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; switch for governing the spatial and temporal distribution of proteins that are no longer needed. This mode of regulation is essential for normal cellular processes (e.g., cell cycle progression and differentiation), and defects have been implicated in human diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Nakayama1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Ardley1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Ubiquitination of target proteins can also regulate function by mechanisms other than proteasome-mediated degradation. Mono-ubiquitination serves a signal for endocytosis and trafficking of various cell surface proteins, and is also implicated in histone and transcription factor regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Schnell1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Mukhopadhyay1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The assembly of poly-ubiquitin chains can occur at different lysines within ubiquitin, which promotes different outcomes for the labeled protein. Conjugation at lysine 48 typically leads to proteasomal degradation, while linkage through lysine 63 can modulate protein activities in processes as diverse as nuclear localization, DNA repair, or inclusion formation in neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Geetha1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Lim1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A trio of enzymes mediates the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate protein: the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and E3 ubiquitin ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Hershko2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Repeated cycles of ligation to the initial ubiquitin lead to poly-ubiquitination. Substrate specificity is conferred by the selective binding of individual E3 ligases to one or a few target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Jackson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Eukaryotes typically possess a single gene encoding the E1-activating enzyme, tens of E2-conjugating enzymes, and as many as several hundred E3 ligases. Some E3 ligases are themselves multi-subunit complexes, in which a substrate recognition subunit specifies the protein targeted for ubiquitination.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> roles for ubiquitination in organismal development have been determined primarily through the characterization of specific E3 ligases. In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, E3 ligases regulate processes as diverse as sex determination, cell cycle progression, and synaptic signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Starostina1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Schaefer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is a multi-subunit E3 ligase that is essential for completion of meiosis immediately after fertilization of the oocyte by the sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Golden1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Davis1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis also plays a role in the degradation of several proteins that are involved in establishment of anterior-posterior (A-P) polarity in the early embryo. These proteins become asymmetrically localized at the first cell division, and failure to degrade these components correlates with developmental defects such as changes in cell fate specification and embryonic lethality. Formation of the A-P axis and progression of the embryonic cell cycle requires the activities of a class of E3 complexes known as Cullin-RING ligases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Bosu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-DeRenzo1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Viability of these outcross progeny is high (96&#x00025;), suggesting that oocyte development (which occurs subsequent to sperm production in the hermaphrodite) is largely unaffected by the mutation. Detailed characterization of the spermatogenesis defect (described below) indicates that these hermaphrodites produce appropriate numbers of morphologically normal sperm, but that the sperm are incapable of fertilization.</p><p>All of the above phenotypes are fully recessive, as heterozygous hermaphrodites are indistinguishable from wild type.

The tail of the wild-type male possesses a cuticular fan containing nine pairs of sensory rays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, first panel), which are involved in mate detection and the behavioral responses necessary for locating the hermaphrodite vulva. The size of the fan is greatly diminished in <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> homozygous males raised at 25&#x000b0;C, which results in shortening of the tail tip and sensory rays as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, third panel). The number of rays is not affected, and other male reproductive structures appear superficially normal by light microscopy. The shortened fan phenotype is semi-dominant: the fan expanse in heterozygous <italic>&#x0002b;</italic>/<italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> males is less than in wild-type but greater than in homozygous animals (data not shown). Therefore, proper formation of the male copulatory structures appears to be quite sensitive to the dosage of UBA-1 protein.</p><p>The male tail structures are critical for mating behavior and sperm transfer, so aberrations in the fan or in spicule function might adversely affect male reproductive success. Sperm from wild-type males take precedence over hermaphrodite sperm such that only outcross progeny are produced until the male sperm are depleted, at which time the production of self progeny continues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Ward1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Male sperm produce male and hermaphrodite progeny in equal numbers, while hermaphrodite sperm produce exclusively hermaphrodite progeny. Therefore, the number of outcross progeny, an indicator of male reproductive success, can be readily calculated by determining the number of males produced.</p><p>Reproductive success was ascertained for homozygous <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> males grown at the permissive temperature. Some of these animals have protruding spicules, which might be predicted to impair sperm transfer. The fertility of <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> hermaphrodites at 15&#x000b0;C demonstrates that sperm function is normal at this temperature, so the production of outcross progeny was used as an indicator of successful mating. Mating to wild-type males produced males and hermaphrodites in the expected 1&#x02236;1 ratio, indicating that all of the offspring in the measured time interval resulted from fertilization by male sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, WT). In contrast, mating with <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> males produced an average of only 56 male vs. 236 hermaphrodite progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>uba-1</italic>), suggesting that the number of outcross progeny is reduced. The same data could be explained if the nullo-X sperm, which produce male progeny, are less competent for fertilization than the X-bearing sperm that produce hermaphrodites. This explanation seems unlikely, because the percentage of male progeny is elevated if the density of males for mating is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>uba-1</italic>, high #). To eliminate conclusively this possibility, <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> males were mated to <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> adult hermaphrodites that lack sperm. Only outcross progeny are produced in this experiment and, although the numbers were low, males and hermaphrodites were observed in a ratio of 1&#x02236;1 (data not shown). Therefore, the protruding spicule phenotype observed in <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> males at the permissive temperature decreases the successful transfer of sperm for fertilization.</p><p>Reproductive success was also characterized in the same manner for <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> males shifted to the restrictive temperature at L3. No outcross progeny were observed from matings to either wild-type or <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> hermaphrodites. This failure might arise from the inability of sperm to fertilize the oocytes (as is true for hermaphrodite sperm at 25&#x000b0;C), or might be a consequence of the severe morphological defects in the male copulatory apparatus that occur at the restrictive temperature. A direct assessment of sperm transfer was performed to discriminate between the two possibilities. Males from <italic>him-5(e1490)</italic> strains that are wild-type or mutant for <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> were raised at both 15&#x000b0;C and 25&#x000b0;C, stained with a fluorescent dye, then mated to <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> hermaphrodites that lacked sperm. Wild-type males reared at either temperature and mutant males reared at 15&#x000b0;C were successful in mating 50&#x02013;70&#x00025; of the time, as revealed by the presence of labeled sperm in the <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, first two panels). In contrast, <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> males raised at 25&#x000b0;C successfully transferred sperm in only two out of 10 instances. Although the efficiency of mating is reduced at 25&#x000b0;C, defects in the male copulatory structures arising from the <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> mutation do not completely abrogate sperm transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, third panel). However, even those relatively rare successful matings do not give rise to outcross progeny, indicating that <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> sperm from males are incapable of fertilization at the restrictive temperature.</p><p>An additional, sex-specific phenotype was observed <italic>in uba-1(it129)</italic> males: a late onset, progressive paralysis in two-thirds of the animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g002">Figure 2, D&#x02013;F</xref>). The paralysis initiates at the posterior of the male and proceeds anteriorly as the worm ages, culminating in a completely paralyzed animal with a significantly shortened lifespan. Progressive paralysis is restricted to males, as <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> hermaphrodites exhibit normal motility and lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The phenotype is not a consequence of aberrant somatic development but instead occurs post-developmentally, since delaying the temperature shift until adulthood still results in paralysis. Therefore, the <italic>uba-1</italic> gene product is required for the maintenance of neuromuscular function in the adult male.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sperm-Specific Defect of <italic>uba-1</italic> Mutation</title><p>Sperm development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been described in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Wolf1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Ward2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, which allows the identification of specific cytological and functional defects in the developmental program that occur as a consequence of mutation. Normal spermatogenesis initiates from a mitotically dividing population of germ line stem cells. Primary spermatocytes separate from a syncytial cytoplasmic core and undergo a coordinated program of meiosis and differentiation. The two meiotic divisions give rise to four haploid spermatids with highly condensed nuclei. These small round cells separate from a larger residual body, which contains components not needed for subsequent steps in development. Activation by an extracellular signal converts the immotile spermatids into mature crawling spermatozoa capable of fertilization, and several compounds that promote activation <italic>in vitro</italic> have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Nelson1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Shakes2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Activation in hermaphrodites occurs in the spermatheca, where the mature spermatozoa are stored. Activation of male spermatids occurs at the time of insemination, and the male spermatozoa crawl from the uterus into the spermatheca. Fertilization takes place within the spermatheca as the oocyte squeezes into this chamber of hermaphrodite reproductive tract, and the newly formed zygote then passes into the uterus. Most of the spermatozoa are dislodged and must crawl back into the spermatheca to await the next oocyte.</p><p>Sperm-specific sterility caused by the <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> mutation was characterized in greater detail, beginning with the early events leading to spermatid formation. DAPI staining of L4 and young adult hermaphrodites and males revealed no differences in meiotic progression, the number of sperm produced, or (for hermaphrodites) their initial localization to the spermathecae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g003">Figure 3</xref>, A&#x02013;B and data not shown).

Spermatozoa are displaced from the spermatheca into the uterus by each passing oocyte, and must return to the spermatheca and await the next egg. Fertilization efficiency is essentially 100&#x00025; in wild type animals, with nearly every sperm being utilized for reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Ward1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the number of sperm in the spermatheca decreases in concordance with an increase in the number of progeny produced. Because <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> spermatozoa are motile but incapable of fertilization, one might predict that numbers within the spermatheca would remain high throughout oocyte production. Instead, the opposite phenomenon was observed, as sperm counts declined more rapidly in <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> hermaphrodites than in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, significant numbers of spermatozoa were detected in the uterus instead of the spermatheca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>uba-1</italic>). These cells are swept from the spermatheca by the unfertilized oocyte but are unable to return, and instead are expelled through the vulva when oocytes are deposited. Thus, although sperm motility and localization initially appear normal, these processes are clearly impaired in older animals. This observation may indicate a defect in the maintenance of sperm quality over time, which adversely impacts either motility or sperm-spermatheca interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Identification of <italic>it129</italic> as <italic>uba-1</italic></title><p>The identity of the <italic>it129</italic> allele was determined through a combination of genetic and physical mapping strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

The identical phenotypes reported for <italic>it129</italic> homozygotes were observed for <italic>ok1374/it129</italic> heterozygotes: embryonic lethality, larval lethality, sperm-specific sterility, defects in male tail formation, and male-specific progressive paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, and data not shown). Thus, <italic>ok1374</italic> and <italic>it129</italic> fail to complement each other and are both alleles of <italic>uba-1</italic>.</p><p>The <italic>ok1374</italic> deletion is a putative null allele, while the <italic>it129</italic> mutation is probably hypomorphic (i.e., reduction of function; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). Therefore, we sought to ascertain whether <italic>it129/ok1374</italic> heterozygotes were more adversely affected than <italic>it129</italic> homozygotes. Most of the phenotypes observed in the <italic>it129</italic> homozygous animals are highly penetrant, making enhancement difficult to detect. However, data from the complementation assay for sperm-specific sterility strongly suggest a more severe defect in <italic>it129/ok1374</italic> animals. Cross-fertilization of sterile <italic>it129</italic> homozygous hermaphrodites by wild type males yields progeny with high viability (96&#x00025;; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, cross-fertilization of sterile <italic>it129/ok1374</italic> hermaphrodites produces embryos with very low viability (6&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the same data demonstrate that the number of fertilized embryos is significantly lower for <italic>it129/ok1374</italic> heterozygotes than <italic>it129</italic> homozygotes (10 vs. 48, respectively). Sperm are normally the limiting gamete for fertilization in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but these results suggest that oocyte production might be defective in <italic>it129/ok1374</italic> hermaphrodites. Therefore, we examined the gonads of these strains directly by DAPI staining.</p><p>Germ cell development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> proceeds distally to proximally within the gonad, and is most readily distinguishable by changes in nuclear morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Hirsh1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In hermaphrodites, the proximal arm of the wild-type adult gonad contains a row of individual oocytes whose nuclei are arrested at diakinesis of meiosis I. Our analysis indicates that the germ lines of <italic>it129</italic> homozygotes are similar to wild type hermaphrodites, and the proximal gonad contains morphologically normal oocytes whose six diakinetic bivalents are easily seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, top and bottom left panels). In contrast, the germ lines of <italic>it129/ok1374</italic> animals show an increased population of germ cells and a concommitant reduction in the number of oocytes in the proximal arm of the gonad. This defect in oogenesis is variable; some germ lines appear largely normal, while in other examples oocytes are absent and have been completely supplanted by an excess number of germ cells (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, top and bottom second panels). A similar phenotype has been reported for mutations in a number of genes that govern the proliferation vs. meiosis decision, such as <italic>glp-1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Berry1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition, we also observed a spermatogenesis defect in the germ line of males. Wild-type adult males accumulate large numbers of highly condensed spermatid nuclei within the seminal vesicle. The <italic>it129</italic> homozygous males likewise contain an abundance of compact spermatid nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, top and bottom third panels). However, the seminal vesicle of <italic>it129/ok1374</italic> males contain relatively few nuclei that also appear larger or less condensed than spermatid nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, rightmost top and bottom panels). In both hermaphrodites and males, the mitotic and pachytene regions of the germ line in the distal gonad appear normal (albeit occasionally reduced in size). These results suggest that the differentiation of gametes in both sexes is impaired in the <italic>it129/ok1374</italic> heterozygous mutants, but with opposite effects depending upon the type of gamete: males possess fewer spermatids than normal, while hermaphrodites contain an excess of germ cell nuclei rather than oocytes. Gamete-specific differences in proliferation and differentiation have been reported previously. For example, loss of <italic>gld-1</italic> causes germ line overproliferation only in hermaphrodites undergoing oogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Francis1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, while loss of <italic>puf-8</italic> causes overproliferation only in sperm-producing germ lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Subramanian1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Transgene rescue of <italic>it129</italic> with the wild type <italic>uba-1</italic> gene further confirmed its identification. Initial attempts at rescue by germ line microinjection indicated that worms might be exquisitely sensitive to the dosage of this gene. Control injections with the <italic>rol-6</italic> marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Mello1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> produced numerous F1 rolling progeny with stable transmission in subsequent generations. In contrast, coinjection of <italic>uba-1</italic> with <italic>rol-6</italic> at typical concentrations resulted in low brood sizes with very few F1 rollers and no stably transmitting lines, suggestive of transgene toxicity. To reduce the gene dosage, the concentration of <italic>uba-1</italic> DNA was decreased relative to <italic>rol-6</italic> and genomic N2 DNA was also included in the injections. At the lowest concentration tested, four of sixteen stably transmitting lines exhibited partial rescue of both sperm-specific sterility and embryonic lethality at the restrictive temperature. Therefore, the wild type <italic>uba-1</italic> transgene is able to complement the <italic>it129</italic> mutation.</p><p>Expression of a <italic>uba-1::GFP</italic> reporter transgene has been reported in a variety of somatic tissues but not the germ line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-McKay1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, although a functional role for UBA-1 in this tissue is indicated by the mutant phenotype.

Abundant expression was detected in germ cells that had initiated meiosis in wild type hermaphrodites (during sperm and oocyte production) and males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

We tested this hypothesis directly by using ubiquitin-specific antibodies to assess the amount of ubiquitination in worm protein lysates. To control for variations in ubiquitination activity at different stages of development, we extracted protein from age-synchronized young adult hermaphrodites shifted as L3 larvae.

In wild-type hermaphrodites, OMA-1::GFP protein is evenly distributed throughout the cytosol and excluded from the intact pronuclei of the one-celled embryo. Our observations at 25&#x000b0;C indicate that the protein is also concentrated on the sperm centrioles and mitotic spindle. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis at the first cell division degrades the bulk of OMA-1::GFP. The protein is absent in the anterior (A) cell of the two-celled embryo, and the remaining OMA-1::GFP becomes associated with P granules in the posterior (P) cell. In <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> animals, the pattern of OMA-1::GFP in one-celled embryos is indistinguishable from wild-type. OMA-1::GFP degradation during the first cell division is likewise identical, and the protein persists only in the P cell. However, progression of the zygote through the first division is slower than normal for <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> embryos. The delayed progression leads to an increase in the number of one-celled embryos within the uterus, which is easily visualized by the presence of OMA-1::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

Activation by E1 is the first step in the enzymatic pathway that leads to the conjugation of ubiquitin to target proteins. Manipulation of E1 activity by temperature shift provides a mechanism for identifying the many roles for ubiquitination throughout development. Effects of the <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> mutation are manifested at both the organismal (i.e., embryonic and larval lethality, reduction in body size) and cellular (sperm-specific sterility) levels, and also result in sex-specific differences of developmental (formation of the male copulatory apparatus) and post-developmental (late-onset male paralysis) processes. The <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> mutation causes a substantial reduction of <italic>in vivo</italic> levels of ubiquitin-conjugated substrates, exhibits synthetic embryonic lethality with components of the anaphase promoting complex (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), and produces delays in early embryonic events known to be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.</p><p>Taken together, the data indicate that the <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> mutation results in a temperature-sensitive reduction in its ubiquitin-activating enzymatic activity. Since the <italic>uba-1</italic> gene product is the only E1 enzyme in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a reduction in its activity is predicted to negatively impact the function of E2 and E3 enzymes globally. This reduction would extend the half-life of proteins normally targeted for the proteasome, as well as altering the localization and/or activities of other ubiquitin-conjugated substrates. Some of these downstream pathways will be more or less sensitive to a reduction in E1 activity, but the result will be a decrease in the rate of ubiquitination for a wide variety of substrate proteins. In support of this model, Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies demonstrated an overall reduction in ubiquitin labeling of extracts from the <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000131-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Also, structural data from related E1 enzymes predict that the Pro1024Ser mutation in <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> might alter its catalytic activity. Finally, the model is consistent with our results in the candidate gene screen (in which reduced levels of UBA-1 by RNAi reproduced both the embryonic lethality and male tail defects) as well as the phenocopy of APC hypomorphic alleles rather than strong loss-of-function mutations (i.e., multicellular vs. one-celled embryonic arrest).</p><p>An alternative hypothesis, that the <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> mutation blocks only one or a few E2/E3 pathways, is less likely. The observed reduction of <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination in the mutant would require that the bulk of ubiquitin conjugation be mediated by one or a few E3 ligases; however, the hundreds of E3s that are present in <italic>C. elegans</italic> argue against this model. Furthermore, the range of phenotypes produced by the <italic>uba-1</italic> mutation is much broader than those reported for inactivation of any single E2 or E3 enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Kipreos1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, consistent with its participation in multiple E2/E3 pathways. We clearly demonstrate genetic interactions between <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> and one E3 pathway, the APC, via synthetic embryonic lethality with <italic>mat-3</italic> or <italic>fzy-1</italic> alleles. However, the sperm-specific fertilization defect appears to involve a different E3 pathway. This phenotype is not observed in APC mutants but has been reported for mutations in <italic>spe-16</italic>, which has recently been determined to encode an E3 ubiquitin ligase homolog (Steve L'Hernault, personal communication).</p><p>Some effects of the <italic>uba-1</italic> mutation can be interpreted in light of the variety of phenotypes that arise from the loss of individual E2 or E3 activities. For example, embryonic and larval lethality have been reported for a number of E2 and E3 homologs in large-scale RNAi screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Jones1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Sonnichsen1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the majority of these genes have not been further characterized and, absent additional knowledge of which proteins are substrates for particular E2 and E3 enzymes, it's difficult to speculate on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed lethality.</p><p>In other instances, the <italic>uba-1</italic> mutant phenotype suggests a previously unidentified role for ubiquitination. Body size in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is governed by a canonical TGF-&#x000df; signal transduction pathway that initiates with the DBL-1 ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Savage1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Components of the TGF-&#x000df; pathway in other organisms are known to be regulated by ubiquitin conjugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Itoh1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Different ubiquitin modifications produce antagonistic effects on signal transduction: mono-ubiquitination of Co-Smad stabilizes the protein and promotes signaling, while poly-ubiquitination of R-Smad leads to its proteasomal degradation and down-regulation of signaling. Given the effects of the <italic>uba-1</italic> mutation on <italic>C. elegans</italic> body size, it seems likely that components of the DBL-1/TFG-&#x000df; pathway are similarly regulated by ubiquitin.</p><p>The sperm-specific sterility of <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic>, coupled with the recent identification of <italic>spe-16</italic> as an E3 ubiquitin ligase homolog (Steve L'Hernault, personal communication), indicate a previously uncharacterized role for ubiquitin in <italic>C. elegans</italic> spermatogenesis. Ubiquitination is known to be essential for sperm function in a wide variety of organisms, and roles in mammalian spermatogenesis include regulation of the meiotic cell cycle, histone modification and chromatin remodeling, protein sorting during sperm differentiation, and quality control for defective sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Baarends1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Morokuma1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, early events like meiosis appear unaffected by the <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> mutation, suggesting that the infertility of these morphologically normal spermatozoa is due to a later defect in sperm development. In a manner analogous to mammalian sperm, ubiquitination in <italic>C. elegans</italic> might function in protein sorting as the spermatids divide from the residual body. Errors in this process are known to adversely affect sperm function: mutation of <italic>spe-15</italic>, which encodes a myosin homolog, impairs the asymmetric segregation of proteins during spermatid budding and causes sperm-specific sterility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Kelleher1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, ubiquitination might promote proteasomal degradation of a protein that inhibits fertilization, and decreased activity of UBA-1 would lead to inappropriate persistence of the proposed inhibitor. Spermatid activation and downstream events occur in the absence of new protein synthesis, so degradation of pre-existing component(s) is a plausible mechanism of regulation. Another possibility is that <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> infertility might reflect a role for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in the sperm-oocyte interaction.

One intriguing possibility involves the recently discovered role for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in the sex determination pathway. The TRA-1 transcription factor is the critical regulator of somatic and germ line sex determination and acts primarily as an inhibitor of male sexual fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Hodgkin2">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>.

Starostina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Starostina1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrate that the FEM proteins form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with CUL-2 that binds to and promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of TRA-1. Impairment of UBA-1 function by mutation would be predicted to decrease activity of the FEM/CUL-2 E3 complex, leading to an increase in TRA-1 levels that would inhibit male developmental processes. This weakly feminizing effect might act synergistically with one or more of the E3 pathways described above. If this hypothesis is correct, then some of the sex-specific defects of the <italic>uba-1</italic> mutation might be suppressed by a decrease in TRA-1 activity.</p><p>The observation of synthetic embryonic lethality between <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> and mutations in components of the APC suggests a powerful approach for identifying new functions for downstream components of the ubiquitin pathway.

Transformation rescue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Mello1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> was obtained by germ line microinjection of a 6.0 kb genomic fragment of the wild-type <italic>uba-1</italic> gene mixed with plasmid pRF4, which contains the dominant roller marker <italic>rol-6(su1006)</italic>, and linearized N2 genomic DNA at concentrations of 1, 50, and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml, respectively. Stable roller transgenic lines were generated from <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> hermaphrodites maintained at 15&#x000b0;C, then rescue of sperm-specific sterility and embryonic lethality was scored after shifting to 25&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The molecular lesion of the <italic>uba-1(it129)</italic> allele was identified by PCR amplification of the 6.0 Kb <italic>uba-1</italic> genomic interval from mutant worms followed by sequence determination. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization for <italic>uba-1</italic> germ line expression was performed on dissected gonads following fixation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000131-Lee2">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>. Digoxigenin-labeled, single-stranded sense and antisense probes were generated from a 1 kb cDNA fragment by linear amplification according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Following hybridization, probe detection was by colorimetric assay with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies and NBT/BCIP substrate.</p><p>Western blot analysis was performed on soluble worm lysates from age-synchronized young adult hermaphrodites shifted to 25&#x000b0; as L2 larvae. Lysates were obtained by one freeze-thaw cycle, homogenization, and centrifugation for 10 minutes at 10,000 RCF. Protein concentration of the soluble fraction was quantified by Bradford assay. 10 &#x000b5;g samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were detected by mouse anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (1&#x000b0;) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (2&#x000b0;; both Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI). Duplicate gels were stained with Gelcode Blue (Pierce, Rockford, IL) to visualize total protein.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Diane Shakes for isolating and Sam Ward for
