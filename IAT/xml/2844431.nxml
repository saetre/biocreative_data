A kind of timing, widespread in all groups of organisms, is circadian timing. Endogenously generated 24-hour rhythms give organisms the ability to anticipate predictable environmental change and provide a framework for temporal coordination both within and among individuals. To explore the possible interaction between development and circadian timing, we undertook to determine whether circadian timing is a feature of mammalian embryonic development. We assessed circadian timing in mouse embryos and compared the findings to circadian timing expressed in maternal tissues.</p><p>Circadian rhythms are a ubiquitous property of living systems. They are expressed in organisms from bacteria to humans and regulate processes from gene expression to behavior. In animal cells, circadian rhythms arise from transcription/translation feedback loops involving several essential circadian regulatory genes (CRGs). These loops interact with a number of other molecules and processes forming the circadian regulatory cycles (CRCs) which in turn integrate with other cellular pathways ranging from the cell cycle to signal transduction. Circadian rhythms are normally entrained to environmental cycles, most commonly the light/dark cycle. In some animals, such as Zebrafish or Drosophila light interacts directly with tissues throughout the body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Whitmore1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Plautz1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In mammals, entrainment by light is mediated by the retina and a central circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN entrains rhythms in other tissues via neural, endocrine and/or other physiological systems in ways that are not fully understood.</p><p>In mammals, CRGs include the bHLH-PAS transcriptional regulators, <italic>clock</italic>, <italic>npas2</italic>, and <italic>bmal1</italic> that activate genes for the PAS domain proteins, <italic>per1</italic>, <italic>per2</italic>, <italic>cry1</italic>, and <italic>cry2</italic> via E-box enhancers. These proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus where PER-CRY heterodimers inhibit their own transcription. The <italic>clock</italic> (or <italic>npas2</italic>)/<italic>bmal1</italic> complex also activates <italic>Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic>, which represses transcription of <italic>bmal1</italic> through inhibition of the ROR family of transcriptional activators acting at ROR response elements (RORE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Sato1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Clock</italic>/<italic>bmal1</italic> also regulates transcription of albumin D element-binding protein (<italic>Dbp</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Ripperger1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, a member of the PAR leucine zipper transcription factor family that in turn controls the expression of other regulatory genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Gachon1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

These studies do not adequately discriminate between circadian clock disruptions acting through maternal deficiencies or through direct effects on embryonic development. Nevertheless, it is possible that the pervasive influence of CRCs extends to development, affecting fundamental processes such as proliferation, growth and differentiation. Surprisingly little is known about the expression of CRCs during mammalian development.</p><p>Previous research on the ontogeny of mammalian circadian rhythms focused on the structural and functional development of the hypothalamic pacemaker, the SCN. Much of this work was performed before the discovery of CRGs. The major finding of this early work was that even in rodents with relatively short gestations, a circadian clock, probably in the SCN, becomes functional before birth and is entrained by maternal rhythms. The consensus was and still is that as soon as SCN neurons become post mitotic and the nucleus forms, the SCN begins to generate oscillations even though synapses are rare and the normal input for entrainment from the retina has not yet developed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Davis1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Moore1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this earlier work, CRGs are expressed in the SCN before birth. In rats and hamsters, however, in situ hybridization failed to detect prenatal rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Sladek1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Li1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Kovacikova1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Other studies suggest that molecular rhythms are entrained by maternal rhythms just before birth even if the rhythms are difficult to measure until after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Shimomura1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Ohta1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Ohta2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-ElHennamy1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In transgenic rats with a luciferase reporter driven by the <italic>per1</italic> promoter, fetal SCN and liver cultured a day before birth expressed rhythms that appeared to be influenced by the timing of the mother's feeding schedule during gestation, suggesting the presence of active and entrainable CRCs in those tissues before birth. It is likely that in at least some portion of SCN cells CRCs become active between completion of SCN neurogenesis and birth, but maturation of the SCN as a robust pacemaker appears to occur after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Sladek1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The discovery of CRCs in most adult tissues extends developmental questions to tissues other than the SCN and to earlier times in development. It is possible that embryonic tissues express CRCs that are entrained by the same signals that entrain those in maternal peripheral tissues. mRNAs of several CRGs (<italic>per1</italic>, <italic>cry1</italic> and <italic>bmal1</italic>) have been detected in preimplantation mouse embryos (before E4), but it was not determined whether the mRNAs were rhythmic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Johnson2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. A more recent study of preimplantation mouse embryos also reported CRGs immediately after fertilization both <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic>, especially <italic>clock</italic> and <italic>bmal1</italic> (probably of maternal origin initially), but rhythms were not seen over the first four days up to the blastocyst stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Amano1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. In utero imaging of transgenic rat embryos revealed bioluminescence driven by the <italic>per1</italic> promoter from E8 to E22. Expression steadily increased from E10 onward and there was a suggestion of day night differences. A clear rhythm could not, however, be established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Saxena1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. In another study, CRGs were measured by PCR in fetal and newborn rat liver, and only <italic>Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> showed a rhythm on E20. It was not until sometime between postnatal days 20 and 30 that all of the measured CRGs showed rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Sladek2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, more recent studies using transgenic rats with a luciferase reporter of <italic>per1</italic> promoter activity observed rhythms <italic>in-vitro</italic> from livers collected the day before birth or the first day after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Yamazaki1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Ohta3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Earlier ages were not examined. Thus the limited studies on the initial expression of CRCs in mammalian peripheral tissues are inconsistent; <italic>in-vitro</italic> measurements indicate the presence of rhythms at earlier ages than do measurements of tissues collected <italic>in-vivo</italic>. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the presence or absence of a circadian clock in embryonic and maternal tissues using both <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> measurements in mice. To assess CRC activity we measured components of the core transcription/translation feedback loops, several CRGs and one protein (PER2). While some other type of CRC involving different mechanisms could exist in adult or embryonic cells, in this study CRC refers to the regulatory cycles known to depend on the key components we measured.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals and Care</title><p>Wild-type C57Bl6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) or Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).

Ultimately, CRC activity in cells also influences systems physiology and behavior. To determine if embryonic development is also influenced by CRC activity, it is first necessary to determine the ontogeny of this regulatory mechanism. The present study found that circadian regulatory genes (CRGs), are expressed in mouse embryos at all ages examined (E10 to E18). At three embryonic ages (E10, E14, and E18) we sampled whole embryos at different times of day every four hours but were unable to detect circadian variation in mRNA accumulation (RT-PCR) or in PER2 protein levels (acute luciferase measurements). A required condition for the measurement of a rhythm in this type of protocol (independent samples collected at different times of day) is that the rhythms in each sample, if present, are synchronized. A population rhythm would not be measured if the samples are not synchronized. The absence of a population rhythm in whole embryos, as observed here, was, however, likely due to the absence of rhythms in individual whole embryos. Individual embryo rhythms would require that a significant portion of tissues and cells within each embryo were rhythmic and synchronized. This hypothetical within embryo synchrony would likely require an external signal such as maternal rhythms. Such a signal would, however, also produce synchrony among embryos and it therefore would have been possible to detect a rhythm by sampling the population if rhythms were in fact present in each embryo.</p><p>The absence of circadian rhythms in whole embryos does not exclude the possibility that individual tissues or cells within an embryo express rhythms. Even if entrained by an external signal such as maternal rhythms, different tissues could be entrained with different timings of mRNA peaks and troughs (i.e., different phases). If so, then when assayed together individual tissue rhythms might be obscured. Although the phases of most peripheral rhythms are similar in adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Yoo1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Davidson1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, this could be different in embryos. Alternatively, or in addition, if only a few tissues are rhythmic, the rhythm could be hard to detect when assayed with a majority of non-rhythmic tissues. This would certainly be true for the suprachiasmatic nucleus if it expresses rhythmicity during prenatal development as reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Shimomura1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. To address these possibilities, we measured CRGs in individual embryonic tissues, heart, kidney and liver. These tissues show robust rhythms in adults. Even in these individual tissues, rhythms were undetectable at embryonic ages. This result has three possible explanations. A particular tissue could express a rhythm (facilitated by coupling mechanisms internal to the tissue) but is not entrained to a common external signal such as maternal rhythms. In this case, the rhythm is unlikely to be detected by sampling different fetuses at different times of day. There is little evidence for strong coupling signals within a tissue, even in adults, making this possibility unlikely. Alternatively, tissue level rhythms could be absent, either because individual cells within the tissue are rhythmic but unsynchronized or because individual cells lack rhythms. A lack of tissue level rhythms, regardless of the explanation, demonstrates a clear difference between embryonic and maternal tissues with respect to circadian regulation.</p><p>In six instances (out of 30 possible) statistically significant time of day variation was seen in whole embryos (E14-15, <italic>bmal1</italic> and <italic>per2</italic> and E10-11 <italic>per1</italic> and <italic>Dbp</italic>) and in a specific tissue (heart, E18-E19, <italic>bmal1</italic> and <italic>per2</italic>). These variations were much lower than the rhythms observed in maternal tissues and the patterns were unusual (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that there are low amplitude CRCs in embryonic tissues with distinctive profiles, but we do not consider occasional statistical significance to be strong evidence for circadian rhythms.</p><p>The explanation that embryonic tissues do not express rhythms because individual cells within the tissue are rhythmic but unsynchronized requires that individual cells do not receive or are insensitive to synchronizing signals. In addition, this hypothesis suggests that while individual cells express a CRC, there is no tissue level function that requires synchrony among cells and the resulting tissue level rhythm. It is likely that there are abundant and robust potential signals from maternal rhythms but that the CRCs in embryonic cells, if expressed, are insensitive to them.

Although continuous measurements from a single piece of tissue (as used for <italic>in-vitro</italic> analysis) might be a more sensitive assay of variation than is the analysis of multiple samples, the latter approach easily detected circadian variation in maternal and other adult tissues. Embryonic tissues are clearly distinct from adult tissues in the expression of CRCs.</p><p>The expression of a PER2::LUC rhythm in fetal tissues <italic>in-vitro</italic> is consistent with the possibility that cells within an embryonic tissue are rhythmic but unsynchronized <italic>in-vivo</italic>. Previous measurements of circadian rhythms from cells <italic>in-vitro</italic> indicate that the absence of a rhythm in a population of cells is due to a lack of synchrony among cells rather than the absence of rhythms in each cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Nagoshi1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Welsh1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Welsh2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. A variety of treatments such as fresh medium or the addition of serum causes synchrony among cells, thereby inducing a population rhythm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Nagoshi1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Welsh2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Izumo1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. A particular stimulus synchronizes a population of cells by bringing the CRC in each cell to approximately the same phase. Consequently the resulting population rhythm will have a characteristic phase relationship to the stimulus. We found that the rhythms expressed <italic>in-vitro</italic> by embryonic tissues had the same phase relative to the time of the culturing procedure regardless of the time of day or time in the mother's circadian cycle when the procedure was performed. This is the expected result if CRCs within the cells are synchronized by the procedure. While it is possible the procedure initiated CRCs in individual cells, there is no precedence for this in previous studies of cells or tissues <italic>in-vitro</italic>. When zebrafish develop in the absence of an external synchronizing signal (the light/dark cycle), individual cells begin to express a CRC but they are not synchronized across the embryo. Exposure to even a single light pulse synchronizes the CRCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Dekens2">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>By E18, cells of embryonic mouse tissues are capable of expressing a CRC and this can be measured at the tissue level <italic>in-vitro</italic>. It is not known, however, when cells first express a CRC <italic>in-vivo</italic> and when they become sufficiently synchronized to produce a measurable tissue-level rhythm. The present results indicate that synchrony does not occur during prenatal development despite exposure to maternal rhythms. Published reports of <italic>in-vivo</italic> CRG mRNA levels indicate that rhythms in CRGs similar to those of adults are not present in rat heart and liver until after postnatal day 20 although some CRGs show 24-hour variation as early as postnatal day 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Sladek2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Sakamoto1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, CRGs have been measured in pre-implanted embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Johnson2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Hamatani1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Amano1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Kiessling1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref> but circadian rhythms have not yet been reported. A knock-down of one CRG (<italic>cry1</italic>) in oocytes by inhibitory RNA led to slower completion of meiosis suggesting a regulatory role for <italic>cry1</italic> unrelated to circadian rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Amano1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. This might be the case for other CRGs at other times in development as well. For example, lipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation in mice requires the CRG, <italic>bmal1</italic>, but there is no evidence that these processes also require active CRCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Shimba1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. While CRGs that are transcriptional regulators might have roles during cellular differentiation independent of participation in active CRCs, it is also possible that CRCs are necessarily uncoupled from cellular processes during development. For example, mutations of CRGs affect cell proliferation during liver regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Matsuo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, proliferation in primary fibroblast culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Miller1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and progression of the hair follicle cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Lin1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>, but similar mutations do not have obvious affects on growth during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Vitaterna1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Bunger1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009855-Vitaterna2">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, the present results indicate that embryonic mouse tissues do not express CRCs even though they express CRGs and have the potential to express a CRC <italic>in-vitro</italic>. Embryonic tissues appear poised to express CRCs but for some reason do not. It is possible that individual cells within embryonic tissues express a CRC but are not synchronized by maternal rhythms or by signals intrinsic to the tissues. When placed in culture, however, the cells could become synchronized, creating a tissue level rhythm and possibly reinforcing the oscillations in individual cells. This raises interesting questions about how embryonic tissues are shielded from synchronizing perturbations <italic>in-vivo</italic>. Specific mechanisms, in the placenta for example, could facilitate this. Further examination of CRC expression in developing tissues could provide insight into the normal mechanisms of peripheral tissue entrainment in adults. It is possible that CRCs are not expressed even at the level of individual cells in embryonic tissues. The technology required to assess the status of individual cells <italic>in-vivo</italic> is beyond the scope of the present study. The absence of active CRCs in embryonic mouse tissues, as found here, does not exclude the expression of robust CRCs in tissues during prenatal development in mammals with longer gestations, such as humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009855.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Twenty-four-hour expression profiles of Cry1, Per1, Dbp and Rev-erb&#x003b1; mRNA in whole embryos and maternal liver during embryogenesis measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
