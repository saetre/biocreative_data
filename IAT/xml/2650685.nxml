In humans, <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>is a significant cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients and despite effective treatments, patients with advanced <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>pneumonia (PcP) have poor outcomes with mortality rates as high as 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The source of <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>infection in humans and animals remains unknown, but it has been proposed that persons with colonized with <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>may act as a reservoir of infection and as a source of infectious organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Results from both human and animal studies demonstrate that colonization with <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>is not a rare event and may lead to worsening of other pulmonary conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization has been associated with increasing the severity of other pulmonary conditions such as chronic obstructive disease and chronic bronchitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Instances of <italic>P. murina </italic>colonization in commercial laboratory mouse colonies have been associated with various defects in the host immune response; however, under experimental conditions normal mice may also become infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A high incidence of colonization has been described in numerous strains and colonies of laboratory rats, but no specific risk factors for colonization of rats with <italic>P. carinii </italic>have been identified. <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>colonization has also been reported in a simian immunodeficiency virus infected macaque model of human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In humans, cigarette smoking and certain locations of residence demonstrate a positive correlation with the incidence of <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>SP-A is a member of the collectin family of proteins and a component of the pulmonary innate immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is the most abundant surfactant protein, but SP-A deficient (KO) mice do not display any obvious pulmonary deficiencies under normal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, KO mice are more susceptible to infection by a variety of pulmonary pathogens and mount hyperinflammatory responses to some of these infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The antimicrobial properties of SP-A act through several mechanisms that lead to enhanced clearance of pathogens from the lung. Opsonization by SP-A through interaction of its carbohydrate recognition domain with carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens increases the attachment and uptake of the organisms by alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. SP-A increases the microbiocidal actions of macrophages through induction of reactive oxygen-nitrogen species and stimulating chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. SP-A also appears to have a direct microbiocidal effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Binding of SP-A to the surface of some pathogens results in killing that is caused by permeabilization of the cell membranes or walls of the organisms.</p><p>Corticosteroid immunosuppressed SP-A KO mice develop higher levels <italic>P. murina </italic>infection than WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Immunocompetent and CD4+ T-cell depleted KO mice also display delayed clearance following infection by intratracheal inoculation compared to WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. SP-A appears to act directly and indirectly in the host response to <italic>P. murina </italic>infection; opsonization with SP-A enhances the recognition of <italic>P. murina </italic>by mouse alveolar macrophages and KO mice with <italic>P. murina </italic>infection display a more exuberant inflammatory response than infected WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that SP-A prevents the development of a <italic>P. murina </italic>colonization in immunocompetent mice following exposure to an environmental source of the organism. In most animal studies, <italic>P. murina </italic>infection is established by a rather intense exposure, i.e., housing na&#x000ef;ve mice with animals that have PcP, or by intratracheal or intranasal inoculation of a fixed dose of organisms. By contrast, in this study the mice were not experimentally exposed to <italic>P. murina </italic>but acquired the infection through environmental exposure. Environmental exposure involves a non experimental route of infection, in which the mice come in contact with <italic>P. murina </italic>during standard laboratory animal handling and housing conditions. The advantage of this model is that it more closely resembles the natural course of the infection in humans than animal models that involve exposure to large numbers of organisms. Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that SP-A acts as an innate immune surveillance molecule protecting the immunocompetent host from <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>colonization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of C3H/HeN SP-A deficient mice (KO)</title><p>Black Swiss SP-A KO mice were generated by targeted gene inactivation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

The cages are changed in a biocontainment hood, 2&#x02013;3 times per week. Sentinel mice from the animal room are tested for a standard panel of mouse pathogens on a quarterly and semi annual basis. Over the past 5 years, none of these pathogens have been detected in the sentinel mice from the animal room used for these studies.

Approximately 50 mgs of frozen lung tissue was reconstituted in 1.0 ml Trizol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and total RNA was isolated. The RNA was treated with RNAase free-DNAase and recovered by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The RNA was evaluated in a spectrophotometer at 260 &#x003bb; and 280 &#x003bb;. cDNA was made from 1 ug of RNA using the SuperScript&#x02122; II RNAase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Quantitation of the amount <italic>P. murina </italic>large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (mtLSU) message in the samples was performed on the iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad, Hercules, CA) using a previously described TaqMan assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The threshold cycle for each sample was identified as the point at which the fluorescence generated by degradation of the TaqMan probe increased significantly above the baseline. To convert the threshold cycle data to <italic>P. murina </italic>nuclei, a standard curve was generated using cDNA made from RNA isolated from 10<sup>7 </sup><italic>P. murina </italic>nuclei. The level of infection of the samples was then estimated using the standard curve. The efficiency of the standard curve qPCR reactions consistently approached 100%. Detection of <italic>P. murina </italic>mtLSU with this assay has also been shown to correlate with viability of the organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>To ensure that high quality RNA was isolated from all samples and that cDNA synthesis was successful, a SybrGreen incorporation qPCR assay for the mouse vimentin gene mRNA was performed on all samples. Primers were designed to amplify a 109 base pair product from mouse vimentin mRNA (Vimentin-Forward Primer 5'-GTGCGCCAGCAGTATGAAAG-3', Vimentin-Reverse Primer 5'-GCATCGTTGTTCCGGTTGG-3'). qPCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), with SybrGreen (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) added to the buffer, in the iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The following reaction conditions were used: Cycle 1. 95&#x000b0;C for 3:00 minutes; Cycle 2. 95&#x000b0;C for15 sec, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 sec with 40 repeats. The fluorescent signal generated by incorporation of SybrGreen into the double-stranded product was collected at 86&#x000b0;C for 10 sec during each repeat to determine the threshold cycle for each sample. The fidelity of the qPCR reactions was confirmed by analysis of the melt curve of the vimentin qPCR product. A single peak with an approximate melting temperature of 88&#x000b0;C was consistently identified in the reactions.

The sequence of the PCR products was confirmed, and they were cloned into the pET30 expression vector (Novagen) in the correct reading frame and were expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins were expressed in inclusion bodies within E. coli and were purified by standard methods. In brief, bacterial cultures expressing recombinant MSG fragments were harvested by centrifugation, the cell pellet was sonicated and washed 3 times in binding buffer without urea (5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, and 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9]), and the final pellet was dissolved in binding buffer with 6 M urea. The recombinant preparations were purified by affinity chromatography using HISbinding resin (Novagen), with the urea being removed during the wash stages. Eluted proteins were dialyzed overnight against PBS (pH 7.4), were filter sterilized, and were frozen at -70&#x000b0;C. Protein concentration was determined by A280 using a standard curve generated with bovine serum albumin.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of <italic>P. murina </italic>specific serum antibodies by ELISA</title><p>It is clear that different subclasses of IgG mediate diverse host defense mechanisms such as binding of IgG to the various Fc receptors on effector cells.

All mice used in these analyses were bred and housed under identical conditions as described in the material and methods. The mice were grouped at two-week age intervals and were only caged with mice within the group. Mice within a group were housed together up to 5 mice per cage. Some cages contained less than 5 mice depending on the number of mice in a group. All mice were housed in the same room. No <italic>P. murina </italic>specific mtLSU message was detected in WT mice of any age. In KO mice, the level of detection of the mtLSU message increased over time peaking in mice 8&#x02013;10 weeks of age and then declined to undetectable in mice 16&#x02013;18 weeks old (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The percentage of mice within a group with detectable mtLSU also varied over time (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The frequency of the detection peaked in the 8&#x02013;10 week group when mtLSU was detected in all of the mice Vimentin was used as a housekeeping gene marker to verify that the failure to detect mtLSU message in negative mice was not due to poor quality RNA or cDNA in the samples. Vimentin message was detected in all of the mice and no significant differences in the levels of expression were evident (data not shown). Lungs from immunocompetent KO and WT mice were also evaluated for the presence of <italic>P. murina </italic>cyst forms by CEV staining. The level of colonization in the KO mice was below the limit of microscopic detection as demonstrated by the inability to detect cyst or nuclei forms in the lungs of any of the mice following CEV or DQ staining by standard enumeration techniques.

The source of <italic>Pneumocystis spp</italic>. infection in humans and animals remains unknown. Various species have been detected by environmental sampling techniques, suggesting a possible environmental source of the infection; yet, the infectious potential of these environmental samples has not been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

Several studies have demonstrated that recurrence of PcP following successful treatment involves <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>of a different strain from the initial infection, suggesting that the recurrence is the result of infection from an exogenous source that may be either due to environmental exposure or person-to-person transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>The development of sensitive PCR techniques led to the search for the presence of low levels <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>in the lungs of immunocompetent and immunocompromised humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].

In addition, a more recent study also indicated that healthy subjects may not be colonized with <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. These results suggest that <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>does not exist in a latent stage in immunocompetent individuals.</p><p>Although, <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization was not detected in healthy individuals, <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization has been described in some hospitalized patients with moderate to severe underlying immunodeficiency suggesting that this patient population could serve as a reservoir of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Results from a recent study suggest that <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization in HIV + hospitalized patients may also be a source of infection. In that study, it was found that 68% of hospitalized HIV + patients with non PcP pneumonia were colonized with <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In another recent study, <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization was detected in 46% of the autopsy specimens of HIV+ individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Also, in that study, cigarette smoking and city of residence were discovered to be risk factors for colonization. In a study, examining bronchoalveolar specimens, a lower level of colonization was detected in persons infected with HIV, but these authors also propose that this carriage may be a reservoir of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>P jirovecii </italic>colonization in patients with other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstruction pulmonary disease, without significant underlying immunosuppression, has also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>The findings of an early study indicated that <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization was not associated with cystic fibrosis. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].

Interestingly, it has also been show that <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization in cystic fibrosis patients is a dynamic process, in which clearance and recolonization occurs over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>Several reports of <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been published. In an early study, a colonization rate of only 10% was detected and the authors postulated that since this rate of colonization was similar to the rate of PcP being seen in immunocompromised patients at their site, PcP arose from a latent infection and was not the result of a new infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization has also been linked with severity of COPD as measured by spirometric lung function in a study that examined autopsy specimens. In that study, colonization was detected in 37% of smokers with severe COPD, but only 5.3% of those with less severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization in persons with COPD has also been associated with higher levels proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that the host mounts an immune response to the colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this study, colonization was detected in 55% of induced sputum samples from COPD patients, a much higher rate of colonization than previously reported. The variation in reported colonization rates may be related to the type of samples that were tested or due to differences in the detection methods that were used. Alternatively, the different colonization rates may indicate that some demographic areas may have higher rates of colonization than others, as was reported in colonization rates in HIV+ individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Animal-to-animal spread of the infection has been well documented and supports the role of immunocompetent hosts as reservoirs of <italic>Pneumocystis spp</italic>. infection. In studies using mouse models, transmission of <italic>P. murina </italic>infection through cohousing with infected mice initiates infection in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. In normal mice, the colonization is self-limiting; immune-mediated clearance occurs 5&#x02013;6 weeks post initiation of infection and involves both humoral and cellular immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Normal mice with this transient colonization have also been shown to be able to transmit the infection, further supporting the normal host as a reservoir of infectious organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p><p>It was surprising to detect environmental exposure of <italic>P. murina </italic>within our barrier animal facility; however, this finding may not be totally unexpected. Previously, both <italic>P. murina </italic>and <italic>P. carinii </italic>outbreaks have been described in commercial animal facilities, demonstrating the ability of <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>to circumvent isolation systems designed to limit cage-to-cage exposure. It has been shown that air may circulate into cages with micro isolator tops not through the filter on top of the cage, but rather through the edges of the cage which may not be rigorously sealed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Even though cages are changed within a laminar flow hood, another source of potential environmental exposure to <italic>P. murina </italic>would be during cage changing procedures. Cages of mice used in these studies were changed 2&#x02013;3 times per week which may have lead to increased environmental exposure and development of colonization in the KO mice. This could result in cross-contamination of cages within the colony. Colonization is a very common finding in immunocompetent rat colonies that have been screened by PCR, but it usually goes undetected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. A systematic survey of normal mouse colonies has not been performed, but both colonization and active <italic>P. murina </italic>infection in several genetically immunodeficient mouse colonies has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. These findings demonstrate that colonization of laboratory animals occurs in spite of maintenance of strict barrier conditions, and suggests that these practices are not sufficient to prevent the development of <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p><p>In the present report, both WT and KO mice apparently encountered <italic>P. murina </italic>through environmental exposure within the animal facility, based on the development of <italic>P. murina </italic>specific serum antibodies in both strains of mice. In WT mice, it seems that the <italic>P. murina </italic>is eliminated from the lungs and never establishes an infection; yet, in KO mice the <italic>P. murina </italic>establishes a transient colonization. Based on these results, we propose that there are two potential outcomes of environmental exposure to <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>in the immunocompetent host: 1) <italic>Development of transient colonization</italic>. In this scenario, <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>escapes detection by the innate immune response and establishes a colonization that may be eventually cleared by the adaptive immune response. 2) <italic>Elimination of Pneumocystis without development of colonization</italic>. In this situation, the innate immune response recognizes and eliminates the <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>prior to it being able to establish an active infection.</p><p>It is likely that the level of environmental exposure within the animal facility is very low and sporadic. WT mice appear to be able to defend against such a low level exposure; however, the absence of SP-A in the KO allows the <italic>P. murina </italic>to escape innate host responses, which are likely to be involved in protection of the host from initial infection. It is interesting to note that at the time that these studies were performed at the UC LAM facility, colonization was not detected in <italic>SCID </italic>mice housed under the same conditions in microisolator cages. It was thought that the absence of colonization in the <italic>SCID </italic>mice reflected the presence of SP-A and/or residual immune function. Recently, our mouse colonies have been relocated to a different animal facility. The housing conditions in this facility are similar to conditions used in the previous facility, but sporadic colonization has been observed in <italic>SCID </italic>mice housed in microisolator cages in this facility. These new findings indicate that <italic>SCID </italic>mice are susceptible to development of colonization following environmental exposure, and support the idea that all of the mice within the facility are environmentally exposed to <italic>P. murina</italic>. These data also emphasize the complexities of developing animal models of <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>colonization. On the one hand, acquisition of <italic>P. murina </italic>colonization via natural environmental exposure most closely mimics the situation in humans, as other methods of transmitting <italic>P. murina </italic>such as intratracheal inoculation, intranasal inoculation, or co-housing infected with uninfected mice ("seeding") involve larger or more intense types of exposure. On the other hand, environmental exposure studies are uncontrolled and become difficult to interpret when <italic>P. murina </italic>infection already exists in some members of an animal colony.</p><p>Although immunocompetent SP-A KO mice are susceptible to <italic>P. murina </italic>colonization, they can limit and ultimately clear the infection. Not surprisingly, CD4+ T cells appear to play an important role in this process. Increased numbers of CD4+ T-cells were detected in the KO mice compared to the WT mice, and antibody mediated CD4+ T-cells depletion resulted in higher levels of infection in the KO mice. Further characterization of the SP-A independent factors involved in clearance of colonization will provide insight into the mechanisms immunocompetent hosts utilize to defend against <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>infection.</p><p>SP-A is a member of the collectin family of proteins, innate immune molecules containing a collagen-like amino terminus and a C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain at the carboxyl terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Structurally similar to C1q, mannose-binding protein and surfactant protein D (SP-D), it is secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells. SP-A KO mice have provided valuable information on the role of SP-A in host defenses against <italic>P. murina </italic>and other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These animals have normal lung morphology, physiology, surfactant phospholipids and other surfactant proteins (SP-B, SP-C or SP-D), but are deficient in tubular myelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. KO mice have impaired clearance of infectious agents following experimental exposure, which is usually accompanied by increased proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that SP-A null mice raised in an environment heavily contaminated with bacteria were more susceptible to bacterial peritonitis than WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Although the lungs were not involved in the infection in this model, the results demonstrate that SP-A KO mice may also be susceptible to infections following environmental exposure.</p><p>It has been previously shown that immunosuppressed SP-A KO mice are more susceptible to <italic>P. murina </italic>infection, and when immunosuppressed, they develop higher levels of PcP than WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Immunocompetent KO mice also display delayed clearance following infection by intratracheal inoculation compared to WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. However, SP-A did not enhance clearance of <italic>P. murina </italic>in a steroid treated mouse model of infection. In this model, KO mice cleared the infection just as efficiently as WT mice following withdrawal of the corticosteroid induced immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>SP-A plays a role in early host defenses by enhancing the uptake of infectious agents by alveolar macrophages and has been shown to facilitate the adherence and/or phagocytosis of most of the organisms with which it has been tested[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. In vitro studies have demonstrated that under certain conditions SP-A enhances attachment of <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>to AMs; however, inhibition of <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>binding to alveolar macrophages by SP-A has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. In our laboratory, preincubation of <italic>P. murina</italic>, which was isolated from KO mice, with SP-A resulted in enhanced attachment to mouse alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>SP-A also displays other protective activities in the host response. Binding of SP-A to gram-negative bacteria, <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum </italic>has been shown to result in killing of the organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. SP-A also increases aggregation of organisms that leads to enhanced clearance from the respiratory tract by mucociliary actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition to these direct activities, SP-A interacts with a variety of immune cells and modulates their responses to pulmonary pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. SP-A has been shown to inhibit maturation of dendritic cells and limit their ability to activate T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. In addition to its regulation of the innate immune response, there is rising interest in the interaction of SP-A with the adaptive immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. A recent report showed that SP-A binds to the Fc portion of IgG and facilitates the uptake of IgG coated erythrocytes by AMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. These other SP-A activities have not been characterized in the host response to <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>; however, it is likely that prevention of colonization involves both innate and adaptive immune response mechanisms and that SP-A may have additional activities beyond enhancing uptake by alveolar macrophages.</p><p>The current study demonstrates a new role for SP-A in protecting the immunocompetent host from <italic>P. murina </italic>infection by preventing the normal host from becoming infected with <italic>P. murina </italic>following environmental exposure. The protective effects of SP-A in this situation, may involve direct action of the molecule on <italic>P. murina </italic>viability, indirect modulation of other factors of the host immune response, or enhanced recognition of <italic>P. murina </italic>by alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. SP-A could also exert its protective effects by a combination of all these activities.</p><p><italic>Pneumocystis </italic>colonization in immunocompetent hosts may be a mechanism that the organism uses as a survival and transmission strategy, thus is relevant to the care of immunocompromised patients. The detection of significant <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization rates in humans suggests the need for caution in interactions between hospital staff and immunocompromised patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Identification of factors involved in protecting the immunocompetent host from becoming infected with <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>, may provide tools to eliminate this reservoir of infection and reduce spread of the disease to highly susceptible immunocompromised patients.</p><p>A role for SP-A in host defense against <italic>P. murina </italic>infection has been clearly demonstrated in KO mouse models and by in vitro experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, the role of SP-A in the host response to <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>infection in humans has not yet been established. It has been shown that immunodeficient individuals with HIV/AIDS and PcP have increased levels of SP-A in BALF compared to individuals with bacterial pneumonias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. In that work, the authors did not demonstrate a functional role for SP-A in the host response to <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>in humans, but the results suggest that SP-A may be involved. The results presented in the current study indicate that SP-A may also be involved in protecting the immunocompetent host from <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>colonization. As described above, the pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization in humans, in addition to immunodeficiency, include chronic pulmonary diseases and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. In humans, SP-A levels within BALF have been show to vary considerably among normal individuals and also among persons with various lung diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. It is interesting to note that SP-A levels have been shown to be decreased by smoking and smoking has also been identified as a risk factor for <italic>P. jirov</italic>ecii colonization. Recent work has also demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke leads to increased burdens of <italic>P. murina </italic>in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Two unique variants of SP-A (SP-A1 and SP-A2) are expressed from two different genes in humans and more than 30 alleles have been described for the SP-A genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. It has been shown that the SP-A variants have functional differences and postulated that SP-A2 may be more active in the innate immune response than SP-A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. Based on these findings it is possible that decreased SP-A levels or expression of particular SP-A variants may lead to enhanced susceptibility to <italic>P. jirovecii </italic>colonization in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data in this study support an important role for SP-A in protecting the immunocompetent host from <italic>P. murina </italic>colonization, and provide a model to study <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>colonization acquired via environmental exposure in humans. The results also illustrate the difficulties in keeping mice from exposure to <italic>P. murina </italic>even when housed under barrier conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>PcP: <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>pneumonia; UC: University of Cincinnati; LAM: Laboratory Animal Medicine; SP-A: surfactant protein A; WT: wild type; KO-SP-A: knockout; qPCR: reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mtLSU: large mitochondrial ribosomal RNA gene; SCID: severe combined immunodeficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None of the authors has a commercial or other association that might pose a conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MJL led he design and supervision of the experiments, data analysis, and preparation of the manuscript.
