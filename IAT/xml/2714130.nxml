Thus far, little is known regarding the ability of chondrocytes to adjust to variations in the extracellular glucose concentration, resulting from hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia episodes, and so, to avoid deleterious effects resulting from deprivation or intracellular accumulation of glucose. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of normal and OA chondrocytes to regulate their glucose transport capacity in conditions of insufficient or excessive extracellular glucose and to identify the mechanisms involved and eventual deleterious consequences, namely the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Chondrocytes, isolated from normal and OA human cartilage, were maintained in high-density monolayer cultures, in media without or with 10 or 30 mM glucose. Glucose transport was measured as the uptake of 2-deoxy-<sc>D</sc>-glucose (2-DG). Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) mRNA and protein content were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and western blot, respectively.

Glucose deprivation increased 2-DG uptake and GLUT-1 protein both in normal and OA chondrocytes. Exposure to high glucose (30 mM) for 18 or 48 hours decreased those parameters in normal but not in OA chondrocytes. GLUT-1 mRNA levels were unaffected by high glucose, either in normal or OA chondrocytes. The high glucose-induced reduction in GLUT-1 protein in normal chondrocytes was reversed by treatment with a lysosome inhibitor. High glucose induced ROS production, which lasted significantly longer in OA than in normal chondrocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Normal human chondrocytes adjust to variations in the extracellular glucose concentration by modulating GLUT-1 synthesis and degradation which involves the lysosome pathway. Although capable of adjusting to glucose deprivation, OA chondrocytes exposed to high glucose were unable downregulate GLUT-1, accumulating more glucose and producing more ROS. Impaired GLUT-1 downregulation may constitute an important pathogenic mechanism by which conditions characterized by hyperglycemia, like DM, can promote degenerative changes in chondrocytes that can facilitate the progression of OA.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder and a major cause of disability that affects diarthrodial joints, being characterized by cartilage degradation, accompanied by local inflammation and changes in the subchondral bone. Increasing age, excessive loading or injury, genetic predisposition and obesity are important risk factors for the development and progression of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Present evidence, including epidemiologic studies, suggests the existence of a positive correlation between OA and conditions that affect glucose metabolism; namely, glucose imbalance, metabolic dysfunction and diabetes mellitus (DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The association between DM and OA has already been suggested in early epidemiologic studies that showed a higher incidence of radiographic OA, with an earlier onset and more severe manifestations, in diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, the fact that the incidence of both OA and DM, especially type 2 DM, increases with age raises the possibility that these two conditions coexist by chance alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this case, whether the metabolic and systemic disturbances, due to hyperglycemia and/or altered insulin plasma levels characteristic of DM, have consequences in joint tissues is largely unknown, but several mechanisms may contribute to aggravate OA and promote its progression, especially in type 2 DM patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Despite improved therapeutic possibilities, strict control of glycemia in diabetic patients is still impossible, so that hyperglycemia and, less frequently, hypoglycemic episodes occur in those patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Since fully developed articular cartilage is an avascular tissue, glucose reaches chondrocytes through diffusion from the synovial fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], where its concentration is identical to and reflects that in the plasma, both under normal conditions and in noninflammatory and inflammatory types of arthritis, excluding those associated with infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To our knowledge, no information is available comparing the synovial fluid and plasma glucose concentrations in diabetic patients, and, despite many possible complicating factors, DM-related variations in glycemia are likely to cause similar changes in the synovial fluid glucose concentration, and thus affect glucose delivery to the articular cartilage. Articular chondrocytes are highly glycolytic cells, requiring a steady supply of glucose for optimal energy production and cell homeostasis, as well as for anabolic functions; namely, the synthesis of cartilage matrix molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As such, articular chondrocytes may be especially sensitive to alterations in the synovial fluid glucose concentration due to hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia episodes.</p><p>Studies evaluating the role of high and low extracellular glucose concentrations in articular chondrocyte functions are scarce, but glucose deprivation or inhibition of its uptake were shown to increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], an enzyme that contributes to cartilage degradation in late OA. In another study, exposure to either low or high glucose concentrations induced insulin-like growth factor-1 resistance and decreased proteoglycan synthesis, which may constitute important pathogenic mechanisms in OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Exposure to elevated glucose concentrations was also shown to decrease dehydroascorbate transport into chondrocytes, which can compromise the synthesis of type II collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, in intervertebral disc cells, which share many common phenotypic characteristics with articular chondrocytes, glucose deprivation has been shown to reduce the synthesis of type II collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], which is the major collagen in the articular cartilage matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The molecular mechanisms involved in the effects reported in those studies were not elucidated, but increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been shown to mediate the damaging effects of hyperglycemia in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Moreover, ROS contribute to the pathogenesis of OA by mediating many of the effects induced by catabolic cytokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, in articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Among other responses, ROS have been shown to decrease the synthesis and induce the degradation of cartilage matrix proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], to promote cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and to alter the regulation of transcription factors such as activator protein-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] that are involved in cartilage degradation and joint inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Facilitated glucose transport represents the first rate-limiting step in glucose utilization by chondrocytes, and thus may contribute to any effects due to changes in plasma and synovial glucose concentrations. Several members of the facilitative glucose transporter family &#x02013; the GLUT/SLC2A transporters &#x02013; have been identified in human articular chondrocytes, among which glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) is especially important as it is regulated by both anabolic and catabolic stimuli, while others, like glucose transporter-3, are constitutively expressed and unaffected by those stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition, various cell types have been shown to adjust to high and low glucose concentrations, mimicking hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia episodes, by changing the GLUT-1 content and the rate of glucose transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study reported that glucose uptake in equine chondrocytes represents a constant fraction of the glucose concentration in the culture medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], implying that glucose transport in these cells depends on the extracellular glucose concentration. Whether and how human chondrocytes can also adjust their glucose transport capacity to changes in the extracellular glucose concentration, and whether modulation of GLUT-1 content is involved, remain to be elucidated.</p><p>The aim of the present study was therefore to determine and compare the ability of normal and OA chondrocytes to modulate the GLUT-1 content and glucose transport in response to high and low extracellular glucose concentrations, since failure to do so may cause cell damage and affect chondrocyte functions, contributing to the development and progression of OA, especially in DM patients. Since the results obtained showed that OA chondrocytes, unlike their normal counterparts, are unable to downregulate the GLUT-1 content and glucose transport when exposed to high glucose concentrations, the molecular mechanisms involved in GLUT-1 downregulation were investigated. Furthermore, and to determine whether altered glucose transport in OA chondrocytes under high glucose conditions can have deleterious consequences on their functions, the production of ROS was compared in normal and OA chondrocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cartilage samples and chondrocyte culture</title><p>Human knee cartilage was collected from the distal femoral condyles of 15 multiorgan donors (28 to 35 years old, mean age 31 years; normal cartilage) or with informed consent from 18 patients (52 to 77 years old, mean age 66 years; OA cartilage) undergoing total knee replacement surgery at the Orthopedic Department of the University Hospital of Coimbra.

Moreover, GLUT-1 is constitutively expressed in both normal and OA chondrocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The kinetic characteristics of glucose uptake in normal and OA chondrocytes, as reflected by the affinity and maximal velocity values determined, are in the same range, although slightly higher, as those previously reported in bovine chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These results are in agreement with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], although GLUT-1 expression in chondrocytes has also been reported to be exclusively inducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and to be either increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] in OA chondrocytes relative to normal cells. The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear, but OA in humans is now understood to be a broad continuum and it is possible that GLUT-1 expression is increased and then decreased at early and later stages of the disease. Alternatively, the observed differences may be related to species investigated or to the culture conditions used in these studies. Nonetheless, we cannot discard the possibility that <italic>in situ </italic>normal and OA human chondrocytes can express distinctly different GLUT-1 levels &#x02013; especially due to the presence in the OA joint of proinflammatory catabolic cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2;, which has been shown to induce GLUT-1 expression both in the present study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and in other studies, along with TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Regulation of GLUT-1 has been shown to occur in various cell types and to involve changes at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, depending on the stimulus and cell type considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, subcellular redistribution between the plasma membrane, intracellular compartments of the Golgi apparatus and protein degradation structures, such as the lysosome, have been shown to mediate high-glucose-induced and low-glucose-induced changes in GLUT-1 protein content and hexose uptake capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, glucose deprivation similarly upregulated 2-DG transport (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and GLUT-1 protein levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) in normal and OA chondrocytes. This upregulation was also observed in other cells, being considered a protective mechanism that maximizes the cell's ability to capture glucose and thus to overcome stressful conditions, such as glucose scarcity or even deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Under such conditions, glycogen stores act as a source of sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. When those stores are depleted, due to persistence or recurrence of glucose shortage or deprivation, a hypoglycosylated form of GLUT-1 accumulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and alternative sources of sugars, such as glycoproteins, may start to be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In a previous study using the human chondrocytic cell line C-28/I<sub>2</sub>, glucose deprivation elicited the appearance and accumulation of the hypoglycosylated form of GLUT-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In the current study, however, no such band was detected in either normal or OA chondrocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This indicates that human chondrocytes deprived of glucose can still carry on processes such as protein glycosylation, suggesting they can store more glycogen than transformed C28/I<sub>2 </sub>cells.</p><p>In contrast, normal chondrocytes responded to high glucose by decreasing the 2-DG uptake (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and the total GLUT-1 content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), suggesting that downregulation of GLUT-1 mediates the decrease in glucose transport. This mechanism can protect articular chondrocytes against the deleterious effects of excessive intracellular glucose accumulation, as seen in other cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Accordingly, after the initial increase, ROS production in normal chondrocytes exposed to high glucose concentrations for 18 hours returned to control levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>), accompanying the decrease in GLUT-1 content &#x02013; whereas ROS production remained elevated in OA chondrocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>), paralleling their inability to downregulate glucose uptake and the GLUT-1 content (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). Since ROS are involved in the pathophysiology of OA, their prolonged production when OA chondrocytes are exposed to excessive amounts of glucose is likely to directly damage those cells and to aggravate catabolic processes that can contribute to OA progression in diabetic patients. On the other hand, the increased production of ROS observed in normal chondrocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>), although lasting a shorter time than in OA cells, may not be devoid of deleterious effects, especially if prolonged exposure to high glucose occurs, as may be the case in poorly controlled diabetic patients.</p><p>Lysosomal degradation is probably the main mechanism accounting for high-glucose-induced GLUT-1 downregulation in normal chondrocytes, since GLUT-1 mRNA levels remained unchanged (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>) and only the lysosome inhibitor (chloroquine) effectively counteracted the GLUT-1 decrease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This observation is in agreement with studies in other cells where high glucose, glucose re-feeding after deprivation or diabetic conditions led to GLUT-1 routing to intracellular compartments followed by lysosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Since GLUT-1 mRNA levels remained unchanged in OA chondrocytes exposed to high glucose concentrations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>), their inability to downregulate the GLUT-1 content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>) is probably due to impaired GLUT-1 protein degradation. Further studies are required to identify the primary defect responsible for that impairment, which may lie in any process from glucose sensing and metabolism to GLUT-1 intracellular trafficking and lysosomal degradation. Whether that defect already exists or is induced by exposure to high glucose also warrants further investigation.</p><p>From another perspective, the inability of chondrocytes to modulate GLUT-1 gene transcription in response to high glucose concentrations, unlike other cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], may render chondrocytes especially susceptible to hyperglycemia episodes &#x02013; especially when the episodes are prolonged, as is often the case in poorly controlled type 2 DM patients. In such circumstances, augmented GLUT-1 degradation may not be sufficient to prevent deleterious increases in the intracellular glucose concentration. This insufficiency is even more striking in OA chondrocytes, which completely failed to downregulate both 2-DG uptake (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and GLUT-1 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>) under high glucose concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study has shown that normal human chondrocytes adjust to variations in the extracellular glucose concentration by modulating GLUT-1 synthesis and degradation through the lysosome pathway. OA chondrocytes are unable to adjust to high extracellular glucose, however, showing defective GLUT-1 downregulation that leads to the intracellular accumulation of glucose, and increased oxidative stress. This downregulation can constitute an important pathogenic mechanism by which conditions characterized by hyperglycemia, such as DM and other situations involving impaired glucose metabolism, can promote degenerative changes in chondrocytes that facilitate the development and progression of OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>2-DG: 2-deoxy-<sc>D</sc>-glucose; DM: diabetes mellitus; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GLUT-1: glucose transporter-1; IL: interleukin; NF: nuclear factor; OA: osteoarthritis; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; RGM: regular glucose medium; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RT: reverse transcriptase; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SCR carried out chondrocyte cultures under different glucose concentrations, 2-DG uptake assays, some of the western blots, the ROS production assay and real-time RT-PCR experiments, and participated in the study design and in drafting the manuscript.
