While CD11a is expressed widely on leukocytes, expression of CD11b and CD11c was thought to be confined to cells of myeloid origin and these molecules have been used as markers to define certain cell populations, e.g. CD11b for macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and CD11c for dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrins are of critical importance for the development of functional immune responses; a mutation in the CD18 gene, resulting in decreased expression of &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrins and in defective migration of granulocytes, causes an immune defect termed leukocyte-adhesion deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. CD11a/LFA-1 has been shown to be involved in T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], T cell recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and target cell killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] by binding to its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54) thus mediating adhesive cell-cell-interactions. Over the past ten years several groups have reported that CD11b is expressed on activated cytotoxic T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and that it is also involved in T cell migration into inflamed tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. CD11c expression on T cells has been detected initially on a population of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and more recently on CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells following systemic viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The studies regarding &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrins on T cells were mostly conducted in mouse-models of infection with LCMV, a virus that induces systemic immune responses involving many different organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Here, we studied CD11c<sup>+ </sup>T cells during a localised infection of the lung with RSV, monitoring their distribution and comparing the pulmonary to the systemic immune response. We hypothesized that CD11c is a marker of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, which is expressed following activation, rather than being transferred from APC during cell-cell interactions. Such a transfer from APC to T cells has been described for the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, we sought to define a function of CD11c when expressed on T cells following RSV infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Virus and animals</title><p>Human RSV, type A2 from ATCC (Rockville, MD) free of mycoplasma contamination was used.

On days 21 to 23 mice were challenged intranasally with 75 &#x003bc;l 1% OVA in PBS. Mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the last OVA challenge. Organs were disrupted using a steel mesh, and red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer.

To study the kinetics of these cells during infection, BALB/c mice were infected with RSV, lungs were harvested at several time points after infection and CD3-positive lymphocytes were monitored for expression of CD11c by FACS. In na&#x000ef;ve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a, c</xref>) as well as mock-infected mice (data not shown) only as little as 0.7 &#x000b1; 0.3% of pulmonary CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells expressed CD11c.

In all of these organs small increases in CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells were detected from dpi 4 onwards but their percentage returned to baseline rapidly. Only in MLN, numbers of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells expressing CD11c remained significantly elevated on dpi 10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). However, numbers of CD8<sup>+ </sup>CD11c<sup>+ </sup>cells in the lungs were 8 &#x02013; 12-fold higher than in any other organ at any time point assessed after RSV infection. Next, we asked if expression of CD11c on CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells is unique to primary infection. Analysis of T cells from mice which were re-infected with RSV on dpi 28 showed that 31.9 &#x000b1; 1.4% of pulmonary CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells were positive for CD11c already 4 days after secondary infection. Again CD11c expression was much lower in MLN, spleen or blood and was not increased on CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>- </sup>cells (data not shown). Since both primary and secondary RSV infection resulted in appearance of CD8<sup>+ </sup>CD11c<sup>+ </sup>T cells we asked if CD11c expression on T cells is a general phenomenon in lung inflammation irrespective of etiology. To this end, allergic airway inflammation was induced in mice using a protocol, which leads to airway eosinophilia, as well as antigen-specific Th2 cytokine production by CD4<sup>+ </sup>lung cells (data not shown). In this setting, only 3.8 &#x000b1; 1.0% of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells expressed CD11c and no changes were observed in the CD3<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>- </sup>population. To examine if other markers, expressed predominantly on cells of the myeloid lineage, are also increased on T cells during RSV infection we analyzed expression of CD11b and F4/80 on T cells from lungs, MLN, spleen and blood. Kinetics of CD11b expression on T cells paralleled CD11c expression, with lower percentages of CD11b<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in the lungs on dpi 8 and 10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>).

Compared to CD11c<sup>- </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells, CD11a was up regulated on CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells and CD11b was co-expressed on a subpopulation of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CD11c mRNA is expressed by both activated and resting CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells</title><p>Surface molecules such as CD80 can be transferred from APC to T cells by cell-cell contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since both CD11c and CD80 are expressed widely on murine APC we asked whether the presence of CD11c on CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells is due to expression by T cells rather than to membrane transfer from APC during T cell priming. CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells were purified from lungs and spleens of RSV-infected or na&#x000ef;ve mice, RNA was isolated and the expression of CD11c analyzed by quantitative PCR. CD11c<sup>+ </sup>pulmonary cells served as a positive control while LA-4 cells, a pulmonary epithelial cell line, and P815 cells, a mastocytoma cell line, were used as negative controls. In two separate experiments, expression levels of CD11c normalized to GAPDH were nearly equal in CD11c<sup>+ </sup>(relative expression = 1.05 &#x000b1; 0.06, n = 4) and CD8<sup>+ </sup>(relative expression = 1.08 &#x000b1; 0.03) cells from the lung following RSV infection. Surprisingly, CD11c mRNA could also be detected in comparable amounts in CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells isolated from spleens of na&#x000ef;ve mice (relative expression = 1.12 &#x000b1; 0.08). CD11c mRNA was neither detectable in P815 cells nor in LA-4 cells. These findings suggest that CD11c mRNA is constitutively expressed in CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells are IFN&#x003b3; producing, virus-specific, potent cytotoxic T cells</title><p>To characterize the function of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>T cells in RSV infection we determined their capacity to produce IFN&#x003b3;. Pulmonary cell suspensions, harvested 8 days after RSV infection, were incubated with medium or PMA/ionomycin and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells were analyzed for intracellular IFN&#x003b3; production. In un-stimulated cells IFN&#x003b3; was detectable in less than 3% of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>or CD11c<sup>- </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells while following stimulation the percentage of IFN&#x003b3;-producing CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells was significantly higher than in CD11c<sup>- </sup>cells (38.4 &#x000b1; 5.0% versus 25.5 &#x000b1; 3.0%, respectively, n = 4, p &#x0003c; 0.05). The crucial function of CTL in viral infections is to induce apoptosis and lysis of infected cells to eliminate replicating virus. To determine if CD11c<sup>+ </sup>T cells are more effective CTL during RSV infection than their CD11c<sup>- </sup>counterparts we initially analyzed induction of apoptosis in RSV M2 peptide-labeled P815 cells. CD8<sup>+ </sup>lung cells were isolated by MACS and enriched for CD11c<sup>+ </sup>by FACS sorting, resulting in about 80% of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CTL in the positive population, while the negative fraction still contained about 25% of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. These CD11c<sup>+ </sup>and CD11c- CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell populations were used as effector cells in a cytotoxicity assay. Loss of membrane integrity in apoptotic CFSE<sup>- </sup>target cells enables detection of dying cells by staining of DNA with the fluorescent dye 7-AAD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). CD11c<sup>+ </sup>T cells were significantly more efficient in inducing apoptosis in target cells than CD11c<sup>- </sup>T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Pre-incubation of effector cells with anti-CD11c-mAb had no effect on the cytotoxic activity of either CD11c<sup>+ </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>) or CD11c<sup>- </sup>cells (data not shown). To assess the frequency of RSV-specific CTL directly we stained lung cells with RSV M2-pentamers, which recognize cells specific for this dominant CTL epitope. About 38% of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CTL were M2-Pentamer<sup>+ </sup>and at 81% the majority of T cells expressing the RSV-M2 specific TCR was found to be CD11c<sup>+ </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). In contrast, only about 10% of CD11c<sup>- </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells were specific for RSV M2-peptide. These results show that CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells, which include the majority of RSV specific CTL, are highly effective in inducing target cell apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic>. To compare antiviral efficiency of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>and CD11c<sup>- </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, these cells were isolated by FACS sorting from lungs on dpi 8 and adoptively transferred one hour after RSV infection of recipient mice. Transfer of low numbers (2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CTL (purity &#x0003e; 83%) significantly reduced lung RSV titers on dpi 4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>). Transfer of the same numbers of CD11c<sup>- </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells (purity &#x0003e; 99%) did not have any effect, but transfer with tenfold higher numbers of CD11c<sup>- </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells also reduced RSV titers in the lung significantly (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Target cell lysis, binding of RSV M2-pentamer and reduction in viral titers by CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells following RSV infection. </bold>Lungs were harvested on day 8 after RSV infection and CD8<sup>+</sup>11c<sup>+ </sup>or CD8<sup>+</sup>11c<sup>- </sup>cells were isolated.

In lungs of na&#x000ef;ve mice 52.9 &#x000b1; 13.6% of transferred CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells were CD11c<sup>+</sup>, while only 12.2 &#x000b1; 3.6% stained positive for CD11c in the spleen.

Previously, we have described a population of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in the lung expressing the &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin CD11c following RSV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To characterize these cells in more detail, we have performed a time course analysis of CD3<sup>+ </sup>cells displaying CD11c, thus excluding cells of myeloid origin. In mediastinal lymph nodes, where CD11c<sup>+ </sup>cell numbers increase during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], CD8&#x003b1; expressing dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] could be mistaken for CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells if analyzed based on CD11c and CD8&#x003b1; only. Following RSV infection, CD11c expression on lung CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells increased with up to 50% of CD8 T cells positive for CD11c on dpi8, while, in contrast to LCMV infection, percentages of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CTL in spleen and blood were low. CD11c up-regulation on mucosal T cells has previously only been described in the intestine where a subpopulation of intraepithelial T cells expresses CD11c constitutively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the lung, expression of CD11c on T cells was restricted to CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells and was paralleled by increases in CD11b. In contrast to CD11b and CD11c, expression of F4/80 was hardly detectable on pulmonary T cells following RSV infection. Expression of F4/80 may be dependent on both mouse strain and organ analyzed: F4/80<sup>+ </sup>T cells seem to be more prevalent in C57Bl/6 than in BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and were detectable in significant amounts only on splenic CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells, as shown here and by Lin and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast to viral infections, allergic airway inflammation elicited by sensitization to OVA, resulted only in a small population of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in the lung, demonstrating that up-regulation of CD11c is not a consequence of T cell activation and migration per se or of an inflammatory environment, but that it is dependent on the underlying pathology. Interestingly, reactivation of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>memory T cells by OVA results in CD11c up-regulation when cells are primed with an OVA-expressing virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This suggests that MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation as well as co-stimulatory factors induced by viral infection, e.g. IFN&#x003b1;, favor expression of CD11c on CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. Several studies have demonstrated up-regulation of CD11a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], expression of CD11b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or CD11c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] on T cells following viral infections. Here, we demonstrate that following RSV infection a population of CTL co-expresses CD11a<sup>hi</sup>, CD11b and CD11c. Furthermore CD11c mRNA was detectable in resting as well as activated CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. Contamination by CD11c<sup>+ </sup>non-T cells cannot be excluded completely but is very unlikely to account for CD11c mRNA detection in CD8 T cells since no major difference in CD11c mRNA quantity was detected between CD8<sup>+ </sup>and CD11c<sup>+ </sup>cell populations. CD11c mRNA seems to be expressed constitutively in CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells while expression of CD11c protein on the cell surface requires activation. This notion is supported further by the finding that activation markers were up regulated on CD11c<sup>+ </sup>T cells both in the lung and in the draining MLN. Interestingly, CD11b mRNA is also expressed in resting as well as activated human T cells but CD11b becomes detectable on the cell surface only following stimulation of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Taken together these observations make it tempting to speculate that there may be a common mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin expression following T cell activation.</p><p>Assessing functional properties of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells, we found that these were more efficient than CD11c<sup>- </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in IFN&#x003b3; production, target cell lysis <italic>in vitro </italic>and induction of viral clearance <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is likely due to the fact that the CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CTL population contains the majority of activated T cells specific for the RSV M2<sub>82&#x02013;90</sub>-peptide, the immuno-dominant CTL epitope of RSV in BALB/c mice. Thus, we show an association of adhesion molecule expression and high cytotoxic activity of pulmonary CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells during a respiratory viral infection, parallel to findings in lymphoid organs in LCMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A subset of CD11c<sup>- </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells expressed high levels of the activation marker CD69 and low levels of CD62L. Cytotoxic effects induced by CD11c<sup>- </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells could be due to this subpopulation of activated CD11c<sup>- </sup>CTL. We cannot exclude this, since we did not assess cytotoxic effects of isolated subpopulations of CD11c<sup>- </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. We believe though, that contamination with CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CTL is a more likely explanation for cytotoxic activity observed when CD11c<sup>- </sup>cells were used as effectors. In contrast to a study implicating CD11c on human T cell lines in target cell binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] we could not detect an inhibitory effect of anti-CD11c-mAb on the cytotoxic activity of T cells. In addition to target cell binding, &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrins are involved in migration of leukocytes and a role for CD11b in recruitment of T cells into inflamed areas has been shown by antibody blocking experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In our model, the percentage of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>cells within the CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell population differed between the organs assessed, being lowest in MLN and spleen, higher in the blood, where a short-lived increase of these cells was noted during the acute phase of infection, and highest in the lung. This indicates that CD11c marks effector T cells, which are recruited to the site of infection. An analogous pattern of tissue distribution has been described for VLA-4<sup>hi </sup>T cells following intra-cerebral LCMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Interestingly, following adoptive transfer we observed efficient recruitment of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells to the lung in na&#x000ef;ve mice, while only a small percentage of these cells were recruited to the spleen. This preferential recruitment of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells to the lung was even more pronounced in RSV infected recipients. Pre-treatment of transferred cells with anti-CD11c-mAb did not reveal a unique function of CD11c for homing of activated CTL to the lung. These observations suggest that CD11c is a marker for activated CTL, which are recruited preferentially to the lung, while the CD11c molecule itself may not be directly involved in the process of T cell recruitment to the lung. Functional redundancy of &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrins in target cell binding or migration into effector sites is a possible explanation of our results. CD11a has been shown to be important for target cell binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], recruitment of activated lymphocytes into the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and generation of an effective cytotoxic T cell response during primary RSV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrate that the &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin, CD11c, identifies a subset of activated, virus-specific, cytotoxic CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells.

CD11c is expressed by CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells, but this molecule may not be directly involved in effector functions.
