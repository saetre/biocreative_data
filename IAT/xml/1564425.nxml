Genotyping several hundred thousand loci in a single assay by hybridizing genomic DNA to oligonucleotide arrays provides a powerful technique to improve precision linkage mapping. The genotypes of two accessions of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were compared by using a 400,000 feature exon-specific oligonucleotide array. Around 16,000 single feature polymorphisms (SFPs) were detected in ~8,000 of the ~26,000 genes represented on the array. Allelic variation at these loci was measured in a recombinant inbred line population, which defined the location of 815 recombination breakpoints. The genetic linkage map had a total length of 422.5 cM, with 676 informative SFP markers representing intervals of ~0.6 cM. One hundred fifteen single gene intervals were identified. Recombination rate, SFP distribution, and segregation in this population are not uniform. Many genomic regions show a clustering of recombination events including significant hot spots. The precise haplotype structure of the recombinant population was defined with unprecedented accuracy and resolution. The resulting linkage map allows further refinement of the hundreds of quantitative trait loci identified in this well-studied population. Highly variable recombination rates along each chromosome and extensive segregation distortion were observed in the population.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>A goal of many genetic studies is to discover the underlying genetic condition (the genotype) of a specific physical manifestation in an organism (the phenotype), such as diabetes in humans or leaf rust in cultivated wheat. A limitation to making such discoveries is the ability to resolve genotype. Gene arrays carry representations of the genome, called features, at high-density on a surface the size of a thumbnail. In this study, microarrays designed to measure gene expression were used to detect DNA sequence polymorphisms. DNA from two different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> strains was hybridized to arrays representing nearly the entire coding region of the genome. Differences in hybridization intensity indicated differences in DNA sequence. The sequence differences, termed single feature polymorphisms, were then assayed in a population of 100 plants derived through inbreeding the progeny from the two parental strains. The precise location of the genetic recombination breakpoints was defined for each line. As a result, Singer et al. were able to generate one of the first very high-resolution genotyping data sets in a multicellular organism that allowed the construction of a high-resolution genetic map of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.

In an organism with an annotated genome sequence, linkage analysis goes beyond associating traits and discrete molecular markers: the molecular markers and traits co-segregate with known and characterized genomic regions. Linkage mapping resolution, that is, the size of the region confidently associated with a trait, is a function of marker density, recombination rate, and the proportion of the phenotypic variation due to genetic factors. An increase in any one of these factors can improve resolution. Technological advances have made it possible to genotype several hundred thousand loci in a single assay by hybridizing DNA to a high-density oligonucleotide array. This approach has been reported in yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Anopheles</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, human &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. The underlying principle of detecting sequence polymorphisms by using an oligonucleotide array is based on the observation that mismatched target DNA hybridizes with less affinity than a perfectly matched target to an oligonucleotide feature on an array, resulting in weaker signal intensity. Each oligonucleotide feature that exhibits a significant reduction in hybridization intensity, referred to as a single feature polymorphism (SFP), functions as a marker &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. When integrated with a completely sequenced genome, the exact genomic location of each feature is known, thus adding to the utility of the marker.</p><p>In a comparison between the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accession Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> (L<italic>er</italic>) and the reference strain Columbia (Col), ~4,000 SFPs were identified at a 5&#x00025; false discovery rate (FDR) by using an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome array that consisted of ~8,300 probe sets corresponding to ~7,000 genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. The Affymetrix ATH1 array, designed to detect ~26,000 transcripts, allowed identification of more than 8,000 SFPs between various accessions (L<italic>er</italic>, Kas-1, Lz-0, Bur-0, and Nd-1) and Col &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Genotyping by hybridizing genomic DNA to oligonucleotide arrays (also referred to as array genotyping) has proven to be particularly well-suited for bulk segregant analysis, where phenotype-based pools of individuals from a segregating population, e.g. recombinant inbred lines (RILs) or F<sub>2</sub>s are assayed collectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Because pools of individuals are assayed, the usefulness of the genotyping data is restricted to the study at hand, and is therefore fleeting.</p><p>A lasting and far-reaching approach is to genotype independently each individual in a segregating population, preferably comprised of fixed recombinants such as RILs, which are derived from successive generation of self-pollination of progeny derived from a cross between two inbred lines. After eight generations of inbreeding, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines should be nearly homozygous (99.2&#x00025;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, each RIL is a mosaic of both parental genomes in which recombination events have been fixed. Advantageously, a population of RILs represents a permanent mapping population that needs to be genotyped only once, but may be repeatedly phenotyped, a practice amenable to accurately measure quantitative phenotypes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. One such population was derived from a cross of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions Col and L<italic>er</italic> followed by eight generations of inbreeding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition to being extensively phenotyped, this population has been thoroughly genotyped using several types of molecular markers: restriction fragment length polymorphisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, simple sequence length polymorphisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, amplified fragment length polymorphisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The genetic linkage map that was constructed from 237 SNP markers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; resulted in an average resolution greater than 3.5 cM, whereas the largest gap between markers was approximately 15 cM. The most recent integrated map dates from May 2001 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.info/new_ri_map.html">http://arabidopsis.info/new&#x0005f;ri&#x0005f;map.html</ext-link>) and was constructed by placing new markers into existing framework markers by linkage analysis. This marker set is limited by more than 5&#x00025; missing genotypes for over 80&#x00025; of all available markers (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 1,357). These include, for example, all SNP markers that were scored in 68 of the 100 RILs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, many markers map to multiple positions in the genome, rendering uncertain the precise location of the marker map-position. Inaccuracies and missing marker data limit mapping resolution and usually result in statistical support of large intervals that consist of hundreds or thousands of genes, thus hampering candidate gene identification.</p><p>The aim of this study was to generate a high-density genetic linkage map and describe phenomena such as frequency and distribution of recombination that influence mapping as a gene discovery tool. We first used an exon-specific whole-genome array to identify a large number of significant SFP markers between the parental accessions Col and L<italic>er</italic>. These enabled us to measure variation of gene copy number and the distribution and density of SFPs across the genome. We subsequently identified 815 recombination breakpoints by genotyping 100 Col/L<italic>er</italic> RILs. Further, we defined the exact location of the genes that border each genetic interval. Because SFP marker density greatly exceeds the number of recombination events in this population, only the number of recombination breakpoints, rather than marker density or genotyping information, limits the resolution of the resulting linkage map. The detailed information derived from the high-resolution genotyping of the recombinant population enabled the characterization of recombination hot spots and measurement of widespread segregation distortion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Single Feature and Gene Copy Polymorphisms</title><p>We measured SFPs between the accessions Col and L<italic>er</italic> as significant differences in hybridization intensity of genomic DNA to oligonucleotide arrays. Depending on the significance threshold, we identified 20,450 SFPs (FDR &#x0003d; 0.05) corresponding to 7,920 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020144-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-st001">Table S1</xref>), or 15,928 SFPs (FDR &#x0003d; 0.01) corresponding to 6,600 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020144-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-st002">Table S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In general, 4&#x02013;5&#x00025; of all features on the array resulted in an SFP, that is, one SFP was identified for approximately one-third of all genes, occurring on average every 9 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-st004">Table S4</xref>). We observed, however, that the SFP-distribution along the chromosomes was not uniform. A significantly higher frequency of polymorphisms was found in peri-centromeric regions on each of the five chromosomes and in some other regions, for example, on the lower arms of Chromosomes 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020144-g001">Figure 1</xref>), 4, and 5 (Fisher's exact test, <italic>p</italic> value &#x02264; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020144-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Genes with high polymorphism rates were often located in clusters such as the disease resistance gene clusters on Chromosomes 1, 3 (Resistance to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Peronospora parasitica</named-content> &#x0005b;RPP&#x0005d;-1 clusters), 4 (RPP-4, RPP-5, and RPP-2 clusters), and 5 (Resistance to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas syringae</named-content> cluster) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Often those highly polymorphic gene clusters consist of multiple homologous genes belonging to one gene family, like leucine-rich repeat kinases, P450 proteins, and others. In addition, we observed 234 instances where all of the features corresponding to an entire L<italic>er</italic> transcript appeared not to hybridize, suggesting that the entire gene is not present in the L<italic>er</italic> accession (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-st003">Table S3</xref>). This could be due to a deletion event in L<italic>er</italic> or an insertion event in the reference Col sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>RIL-Population Genotyping</title><p>Next, we genotyped 100 RILs derived from a cross between Col and L<italic>er</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; by array hybridization (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020144-g002">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg003">Figures S3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg007">S7</xref>). In total, we identified 815 breakpoints at which crossovers had occurred (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020144-t001">Table 1</xref>). Comparison of breakpoint locations revealed that lines CS1935 and CS1936 (recombination frequency &#x0005b;r&#x0005d; &#x0003d; 0.988), as well as lines CS1983 and CS1988 (r &#x0003d; 0.999) had nearly identical marker genotypes across the five chromosomes and therefore are likely redundant entries in the RIL mapping population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020144-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg003">Figures S3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg007">S7</xref>). To rule out experimental error such as mislabeling of samples or files, we repeated sample preparation and array genotyping of each of the putative duplicate lines and corroborated the previous result. The redundant entries may have occurred while developing the original RIL set or during seed propagation at the stock center. Thus, this set contains 98 unique lines useful for linkage mapping.</p><p>Among the 98 RILs, we identified 31 lines with the greatest number of breakpoints over the five chromosomes. Therefore, these lines should be the most informative for mapping purposes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020144-t002">Table 2</xref> for a list of RILs and number of breakpoints for each line). Incidentally, 12 of these lines are different from those previously identified as the most informative RILs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. We identified 89 instances in 61 RILs for which no crossover had occurred along one, two, or three chromosomes. On average, 1.7 recombination events occurred per chromosome and 8.3 breakpoints in each line. Recombination breakpoints were flanked by two, non-overlapping SFPs, which can be nearby or distant. Therefore, breakpoint resolution is SFP-density dependent. Given the array-based genotype data, the average distance between two SFPs flanking a breakpoint was 33 kb. The smallest interval for which we could define a breakpoint was 5 bp and the largest interval was 385 kb.</p><p>Since the markers are all located in regions annotated as exons, it was possible to characterize the recombination events relative to genic regions. In 57 RILs we observed 105 instances (12&#x00025; of all breakpoints) for which a breakpoint could be mapped within a single gene, ranging from one to four events per line. Therefore, intragenic recombination seems to occur frequently. Moreover, we observed seven instances where recombination occurred within the same gene in independent RILs. For example, a three-exon glycosyl hydrolase gene recombined in four different RILs (CS1939, CS1971, CS1978, and CS1990) and a 13-exon metallo-&#x003b2;-lactamase gene recombined in three different RILs (CS1920, CS1977, CS1994). Interestingly, in all instances the same pair of probes defined the recombination breakpoints. Although the exact location of the recombination event is not known, one explanation of this phenomenon is that RIL lines were not derived independently, i.e., one F<sub>2</sub> plant gave rise to multiple F<sub>3</sub> plants. Thus, a single recombination event would be preserved in more than one line. On the other hand, some genes may indeed be more prone to recombination than others. Further studies of newly generated F<sub>2</sub> plants are needed to investigate this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Genetic and Physical Map</title><p>Since there were many more SFPs than breakpoints in the population, recombination was not observed between most of the markers. While markers that co-segregate without exception have different physical positions in the genome, they are genetically redundant. To create a minimal set of informative mapping markers, the RILs were divided into intervals of markers exhibiting the same genotype pattern across the 98 lines. An interval was defined as the smallest region flanked by two recombination breakpoints across 98 RILs with the exception of the terminal intervals, which were adjacent to telomeres. An SFP marker in the middle of each interval was selected as a proxy and declared an informative marker. In total, 676 informative markers were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020144-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg008">Figure S8</xref>).

The recombination rate in the RIL population varied extensively within each of the five chromosomes, ranging from as high as 4 kb/cM (251 cM/Mb) to as low as ~3 Mb/cM (0.3 cM/Mb) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-st010">Table S10</xref>). Extreme peaks in recombination rate may indicate recombination hot spots whereas flat recombination rates indicate regions of suppressed recombination. To identify regions in the genome where significantly more crossovers occurred than expected by chance, we divided each chromosome into 50-kb windows and calculated a chi-square test-statistic for each window. After Bonferroni multiple-testing correction we found 37 windows with significantly elevated recombination rates (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.001) indicating the existence of recombination hot spots. Six to eight significant hot spots were found on each chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020144-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg009">Figures S9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg011">S11</xref>). A characteristic of recombination hot spot was that the gene or genes where crossovers occurred were mostly located in very small genetic intervals, consisting mostly of 1&#x02013;2 genes, and that those genes almost always harbored one or more SFPs. Recombination also often occurred adjacent to the single-gene interval at the hot spot at the gene closest to the interval.</p><p>We calculated the average recombination rate for each chromosome from the slope of linear regression through the plot of the cM distance of each marker versus its physical position on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-st010">Table S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg009">Figures S9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020144-sg011">S11</xref>). For all five <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chromosomes we estimated the average genome-wide recombination rate to be 260 kb/cM (~4.0 cM/Mb) with the lowest recombination rates at the centromeres. Occasionally, other smaller regions along all five chromosomes exhibited depressed recombination rates as well. The largest section with the lowest recombination rate was in a region that comprises the heterochromatic knob &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; and the centromere on Chromosome 4. High recombination rates were observed at localized regions along the chromosomes and at the proximal telomeres of Chromosomes 2, 3, and 4 as well as the distal end of Chromosome 5. Clusters of peaks in recombination frequency also occurred either on one side (Chromosomes 3 and 5) or on both sides of the centromeres (Chromosomes 1, 2, and 4). Also, significantly more SFPs were identified in genomic regions where one or more recombination events occurred, suggesting a correlation between the occurrence of SFPs and recombination frequency (Fisher's exact test, Chromosomes 1&#x02013;5, <italic>p</italic>-values &#x02264; 7.95 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;22</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Segregation Distortion</title><p>Next, we tested the fit of the expected equal segregation ratio of Col and L<italic>er</italic> alleles in the RILs.

The number of SFPs detected with this approach is in part a function of the number of loci measured, corresponding to oligonucleotide array features. Approximately 4,000 SFPs were detected by hybridizing triplicate samples of Col and L<italic>er</italic> to the AtGenome1 Affymetrix array with features corresponding to ~7,000 genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, we aimed to increase the number of highly significant SFPs between Col and L<italic>er</italic> by increasing the number of replicates and features on the array. We used an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> whole genome array designed to detect ~26,000 distinct transcripts that represent ~10 Mb of sequence. Having identified ~16,000 (FDR &#x0003d; 0.01) and ~20,500 (FDR &#x0003d; 0.05) SFPs, this approach detected approximately 5-fold more SFPs than a preceding study. Approximately one-third of all genes harbor an SFP with one occurring every 0.5&#x02013;0.6 kb of exon sequence. Using another method to detect SNPs between Col and L<italic>er</italic>, a polymorphism rate of one SNP per 1,000 kb was reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The greatest estimate for SNP rates in exons (one SNP every ~250&#x02013;300 bp) was derived from sequencing 876 short fragments of 96 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. These results suggest that we detected ~50&#x00025; of all possible SNPs with the exon array.</p><p>The distribution of SFPs along the chromosomes was not uniform with SFP density greatest near the centromeres, a phenomenon reported for amplified fragment length polymorphisms in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> potato, barley, soybean, and maize &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Peri-centromeric regions consist mainly of inactive heterochromatin that is primarily comprised of silenced retrotransposons and transposable elements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, a high degree of sequence divergence between those sequences is not surprising. Genes that exhibited significantly more SFPs than average were often closely clustered and are involved in disease resistance, defense, and signaling.</p><p>Linkage mapping accuracy is in part dependent of genotyping accuracy. Genotyping errors lead to ambiguous marker locations and paucity of markers diminishes trait-mapping accuracy. Both, ambiguous markers and reduced mapping accuracy complicate candidate gene discovery. Of the 1,357 markers scored in the Col/L<italic>er</italic> RIL population, only six have complete genotyping data and less than 20&#x00025; were successfully genotyped in greater than 95&#x00025; of the RILs. In our study the array features used to detect SFPs were derived from exon sequences and the exact genomic location of each marker is unambiguous. We array-genotyped all 100 individuals of the Col/L<italic>er</italic> RIL mapping population for all ~16,000 significant SFP markers. We were able to reliably predict recombination breakpoints with an established statistical method that is routinely employed to detect changes in econometrics and stock market trends &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. It is a context-free method that detects significant changes in a dataset, regardless of how it was generated, even if it is noisy and lacking multiple replicated data points. Although some SFPs could not be assigned to either genotype or mis-scoring of genotypes may have occurred, these analyses are still likely to delineate the correct locations of crossovers. Residual heterozygosity, new mutations or gene conversion events may not have been detected with the number of replicates used in this study. Also double crossover events were not detected if an interval consisted only of a single feature. Nevertheless, recombination breakpoints were resolved with unprecedented resolution, in some instances defining a breakpoint between two adjacent features within a single gene or even exon. We found that intergenic recombination occurred frequently and that in several instances independently in multiple lines in the same gene. The true independence of these observations requires further examination in a newly generated F<sub>2</sub> population. Based on the breakpoint locations, we defined genetic intervals in which no recombination occurred across all 98 RILs. Only ~4&#x00025; of the ~16,000 SFP markers were required to identify a representative informative marker for each interval. Thus, the genetic resolution of our map is limited only by the number of recombination breakpoints in the Col/L<italic>er</italic> RILs population and not by the availability of markers. Even though resolution of this map is limited due to lack of introgression and population size, still 115 intervals harboring only a single were identified.</p><p>To estimate the increase in resolution, we compared our linkage map with a linkage map we derived from the existing public marker set. Using stringent selection criteria for marker inclusion from the public set, we expected to find fewer breakpoints than with the SFPs. Surprisingly, the number of breakpoints estimated using the public marker set exceeded the number of breakpoints using SFPs by more than 200. This discrepancy is either due to genotyping errors or missing genotype data in the existing public dataset, erroneously inflating the recombination breakpoint estimate. On the other hand it also possible that we may have overlooked small intervals created by double crossovers. An alignment of marker genotypes of the public dataset with our SFP-marker genotype data is difficult, since for many of the public markers (e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphisms) the exact physical position is not known. In cases where we genotyped one entire chromosome to be either Col or L<italic>er</italic> our data usually was in perfect agreement with the public dataset (e.g Chromosome 1 lines CS1994 and 1975, or Chromosome 4 lines CS1995 and CS1996). Also, there is complete agreement of the segregation distortion measured by Lister and Dean &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; with relatively few restriction fragment length polymorphism markers.</p><p>The total length of our SFP-based linkage map (422.5 cM) is considerably longer than that of the map derived from the previously published markers (397.1 cM), consistent with the observation that map length should increase with increasing marker density &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the resolution of the SFP-based linkage map is considerably greater than previous maps, the number of breakpoints in this mapping population delineates its genetic resolution. A larger population or a highly intercrossed population would have been desirable to increase map resolution.</p><p>One global measure of recombination rate is the relationship between physical distance and genetic distance. Our estimate of the genome-wide average recombination rate in the Col/L<italic>er</italic> RIL population was 285 kb/cM (3.5 cM/Mb). This is within the range of earlier reports estimating an average recombination rate of 221 kb/cM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d; and 208 kb/cM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020144-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.

A two-point analysis was performed using 676 markers with the default linkage criteria. Pairwise comparison of all loci with the &#x02018;big lods' command (minimum LOD score 25.0, max distance 5.0 cM) showed that markers adjacent to each other by physical position were also linked with the highest LOD scores. For each chromosome, three-point analysis was performed. Map order was determined with the &#x02018;order' command using full multipoint analysis. A permutation test of map orders was performed with the &#x02018;ripple' command after each step to verify marker positions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0020144-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>The T-Statistic Distribution Used to Determine Significant SFPs</title><p>The values of the observed t-statistics (solid line) corresponding to 331,031 unique features are plotted against the expected &#x0201c;null&#x0201d; distribution (dotted line) obtained after 210 permutations.

Rate, and Segregation Ratio</title><p>Figures for the remaining four chromosomes are included in Supporting Information.</p><p>(A) Feature and SFP-distribution on Chromosome 1. The chromosome was divided into 50-kb windows. Red triangles represent number of features per window. The number of SFPs per feature in each window was compared to the number of SFPs per feature in all windows using Fisher's exact test. A <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated and a Bonferroni multiple testing correction was applied to test for significance. Blue diamonds indicate windows with significantly higher SFP density (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.05).</p><p>(B) Variation of recombination rate along Chromosome 1. Recombination rate was calculated as the genetic distance (in cM/50 kb) between pairs of neighboring informative SFP markers and plotted versus the average physical distance between the same markers. Pink stars indicate hot spots of recombination that exceed the expected recombination rate significantly (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.001, Chi-square test, after Bonferroni-correction). <italic>P</italic>-values are depicted next to the peaks. All values were normalized to 50 kb. Average genome-wide recombination rate is marked as a dotted horizontal line. The location of the centromere is marked with a black bar.</p><p>(C) Segregation distortion of SFP markers on Chromosome 1. Segregation ratios of genotypes for each informative SFP marker were calculated across 98 RILs and plotted along the chromosome. The vertical scale shows allele ratios. The expected equal distribution of Col and L<italic>er</italic> alles accross 98 lines should result in a ratio of 1 and is depicted as a dotted horizontal line. SFP markers with allele ratios above the line indicate segregation distortion towards the Col allele, SFP markers with allele ratios below the line indicate segregation distortion towards the L<italic>er</italic> allele. Empty diamonds represent SFP markers with no significant segregation distortion from the expected ratio of 1 between Col and L<italic>er</italic> genotypes. Filled triangles represent markers that show a significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05, Fisher's exact test) segregation distortion towards the Col genotype.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020144.g001"/></fig><fig id="pgen-0020144-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Graphical Genotype of Chromosome 1 for All Col/L<italic>er</italic> RILs</title><p>(A) The 100 lines are arranged in numerical order according their CS number.
