The breakpoint on chromosome 8 is localized 28 kb to the 3' side of the c-myc protooncogene, the breakpoint on chromosome 2 was found to be within an aberrantly rearranged VK gene (abbreviations ref. 1). Novel features of the immunoglobulin moiety involved in this process include insertion of extra nucleotides in the V-J junction which have the characteristics of a N segment as it has been found up to now only in heavy chain and T cell receptor genes; the occurrence of somatic mutations in 8q+ and not in 2p-. These data allow a reconstruction of the course of events in the cell line JI; remarkable sequence regularities at the chromosomal breakpoints consisting of symmetrically placed dinucleotides and elements related to the hepta- and nonanucleotide recombinase recognition sequences are discussed in the context of the translocation mechanism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4877"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4878"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4879"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0182.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4880"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4881"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4882"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4883"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4884"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4885"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4886"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4887"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00256-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4888"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
