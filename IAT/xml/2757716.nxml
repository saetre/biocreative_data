Lcn2 binds and sequesters the iron-scavenging siderophore enterobactin (Ent), preventing bacterial iron acquisition. In addition, Lcn2 bound to Ent induces release of IL-8 from cultured respiratory cells. As a countermeasure, pathogens of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family such as <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> produce additional siderophores such as yersiniabactin (Ybt) and contain the <italic>iroA</italic> locus encoding an Ent glycosylase that prevents Lcn2 binding. Whereas the ability of Lcn2 to sequester iron is well described, the ability of Lcn2 to induce inflammation during infection is unknown. To study each potential effect of Lcn2 on colonization, we exploited <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> mutants that are predicted to be susceptible to Lcn2-mediated iron sequestration (<italic>iroA ybtS</italic> mutant) or inflammation (<italic>iroA</italic> mutant), or to not interact with Lcn2 (<italic>entB</italic> mutant). During murine nasal colonization, the <italic>iroA ybtS</italic> double mutant was inhibited in an Lcn2-dependent manner, indicating that the <italic>iroA</italic> locus protects against Lcn2-mediated growth inhibition. Since the <italic>iroA</italic> single mutant was not inhibited, production of Ybt circumvents the iron sequestration effect of Lcn2 binding to Ent. However, colonization with the <italic>iroA</italic> mutant induced an increased influx of neutrophils compared to the <italic>entB</italic> mutant. This enhanced neutrophil response to Ent-producing <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was Lcn2-dependent. These findings suggest that Lcn2 has both pro-inflammatory and iron-sequestering effects along the respiratory mucosa in response to bacterial Ent. Therefore, Lcn2 may represent a novel mechanism of sensing microbial metabolism to modulate the host response appropriately.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> require iron and use secreted molecules called siderophores to strip iron from mammalian proteins. When bacteria colonize the upper respiratory tract, the mucosa secretes the protein lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) that binds to the siderophore enterobactin (Ent) and disrupts bacterial iron acquisition. In addition, Lcn2 bound to Ent stimulates release of the neutrophil-recruitment signal IL-8 from cultured respiratory cells. Some pathogens avoid Lcn2 binding by attaching glucose to Ent (to make Gly-Ent) or by making alternative siderophores. To determine the effect of Lcn2 on bacterial colonization, we colonized mice that express or lack Lcn2 with <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> mutants that express or lack Ent, Gly-Ent and the alternative siderophore Yersiniabactin (Ybt). Our results indicate that mucosal Lcn2 inhibits colonization through iron sequestration and increases the influx of neutrophils in response to <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> producing Ent. Therefore, Lcn2 acts as a barrier to colonization that pathogens must overcome to persist in the upper respiratory tract.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria utilize iron for electron transport, amino acid synthesis, DNA synthesis, and protection from superoxide radicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Earhart1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Under aerobic conditions, iron is primarily in the ferric (Fe (III)) oxidation state and readily forms insoluble complexes. Sequestration of the scarce quantities of soluble iron is a prototypical protective response against invading bacteria, mediated by the iron-binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin and the storage protein ferritin. To acquire iron within the host, bacteria secrete siderophores such as enterobactin (Ent) that bind ferric iron with greater affinity than mammalian proteins.</p><p>In the thrust and parry between bacteria and their host to obtain iron, a new form of competition has been identified. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2, also known as NGAL, siderocalin and 24p3) is a member of the lipocalin family of small-molecule transport proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Goetz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Lcn2 specifically binds Ent with an affinity similar to the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Ent receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Goetz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and competes with bacteria for Ent binding.</p><p>Lcn2 is able to bind both ferric and aferric Ent, thereby depleting Ent from the microenvironment and inhibiting bacterial uptake of Ent-bound iron. As a result, Lcn2 is bacteriostatic. Bacterial growth can be restored by the addition of excess iron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Goetz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> or Ent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Flo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In a murine sepsis model, serum Lcn2 is protective against an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain that requires Ent to obtain iron. Accordingly, Lcn2-deficient mice (<italic>Lcn2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) succumb to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Flo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

In mice, the nasal mucosa responds to <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> colonization by increasing Lcn2 mRNA expression (65-fold) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Nelson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, protein levels increase in olfactory glands and respiratory and olfactory epithelial cells. Lcn2 is secreted into the nasal lumen and bathes the colonized mucosa. Lcn2 is also induced by <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> colonization, suggesting its production is a general response to colonizing bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Nelson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to sequestering iron, Lcn2 can act as a signaling molecule. A murine Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, has been identified and is widely expressed in tissues including the lung and in lymphoid and myeloid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Devireddy1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In lymphocytic cells, 24p3R is able to internalize Lcn2 alone or Lcn2 bound to a siderophore. Internalization of Lcn2 bound to an iron-loaded siderophore increases the intracellular iron concentration. However, internalization of Lcn2 bound to an iron-free siderophore depletes intracellular iron levels by binding to cellular iron followed by export from the cell through recycling endosomes. In respiratory epithelial cells, Lcn2 elicits chemokine release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Nelson2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In A549 and other human respiratory epithelial cell lines, incubation with aferric Ent produces a dose-dependent increase in the secretion of the chemokine IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Nelson2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This response is potentiated by the addition of Lcn2 to form aferric Ent-Lcn2. In contrast, ferric Ent (Fe-Ent) does not elicit significant IL-8 release.

IL-8 is a neutrophil attracting chemokine, suggesting that signaling by Ent-Lcn2 leads to the recruitment of neutrophils. Accordingly, Ent-producing <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> induce nasopharyngeal neutrophil influx in an Lcn2-dependent manner.</p><p>The potential signaling pathway between Lcn2, Ent and neutrophil recruitment is unknown. There is no direct IL-8 (CXCL-8) homologue in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Jeyaseelan1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, although there are several CXC chemokines such as Mip-2, KC, and LIX that have been shown to be induced by <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> respiratory infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Standiford1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies to determine the effects of Ent and Lcn2 on murine CXC chemokine production from the murine respiratory mucosa are underway.</p><p>The data from this study suggest the following model in which Lcn2 monitors iron utilization by bacteria and activates the immune response when iron stores become depleted: At low bacterial density, secreted Ent binds Fe and Lcn2 in turn binds Fe-Ent to prevent delivery of iron to bacteria. The Fe-Ent-Lcn2 complex is internalized by respiratory epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Nelson2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and could serve as both a signal of controlled colonization and a mechanism of iron recycling. We hypothesize that as bacterial density increases Lcn2 becomes a pro-inflammatory signal. When bacterial growth outpaces Fe availability, an increased proportion of Ent will be aferric. This aferric Ent-Lcn2 complex could be internalized and serve as a signal of uncontrolled bacterial replication to the respiratory epithelium. <italic>In vitro</italic>, respiratory cells respond to Ent-Lcn2 by induction of chemokines, an effect that could explain the increased neutrophil influx seen in response to Ent-producing <italic>K. pneumoniae in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The combined data from neutrophil and bacterial counts are consistent with the hypothesis that Lcn2 has a continuum of iron-sequestering and pro-inflammatory activities. Specifically, Ent-producing <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> elicit neutrophils in <italic>Lcn2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice without showing a defect in colonization. The bacterial density of colonization by <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> is relatively low (&#x0223c;1e<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml) compared to counts from the pneumonia model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Lawlor2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. If Fe is not depleted during colonization, then Lcn2 may bind primarily Fe-Ent. The small percentage of aferric Ent-Lcn2 could be sufficient to produce a modest increase in the number of neutrophils elicited by <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> colonization. Whereas total depletion of neutrophils leads to increased bacterial numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000622-g003">Figure 3</xref>), this incremental increase in neutrophils is not sufficient to affect the density of colonizing organisms. If a perturbance in the microenvironment caused a large increase in bacterial levels, we would predict a greater pro-inflammatory response elicited by Ent-Lcn2. Alternatively, if <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> reaches the lower respiratory tract where it can replicate to high numbers (&#x0003e;10<sup>9</sup> CFU/gm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Lawlor1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, there may be a dramatic increase in Ent-Lcn2 formation with a more significant effect of Lcn2 on the immune response. Consistent with this model, Chan and colleagues report that Lcn2 limits growth of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 43816 (the parent strain of our wild type KPPR1) during pneumonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Chan1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Since Ent is dispensable for growth during pneumonia from KPPR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Lawlor1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, iron sequestration by Lcn2 cannot account for the observed growth inhibition. This suggests that Lcn2 controls bacterial growth by an additional mechanism such as neutrophil recruitment. Whether Ent production stimulates Lcn2-dependent inflammation during pneumonia remains to be determined. Studying the pro-inflammatory effects of Lcn2 on the mucosal surface could reveal a new paradigm of innate immune signaling in response to bacterial metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains and media</title><p>KPPR1, a rifampin-resistant derivative of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> subsp. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 43816), with a type 1 O antigen and type 2 capsule was used as the wild-type strain in these studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000622-Lawlor2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.
