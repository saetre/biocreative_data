Here, we study the conservation of the neuron-specific splicing factors Nova1 and Nova2 and of the alternatively spliced exons they regulate in mouse brain. Whereas Nova RNA binding domains are 94&#x00025; identical across vertebrate species, Nova-dependent splicing silencer and enhancer elements (YCAY clusters) show much greater divergence, as less than 50&#x00025; of mouse YCAY clusters are conserved at orthologous positions in the zebrafish genome. To study the relation between the evolution of tissue-specific splicing and YCAY clusters, we compared the brain-specific splicing of Nova-regulated exons in zebrafish, chicken, and mouse. The presence of YCAY clusters in lower vertebrates invariably predicted conservation of brain-specific splicing across species, whereas their absence in lower vertebrates correlated with a loss of alternative splicing. We hypothesize that evolution of Nova-regulated splicing in higher vertebrates proceeds mainly through changes in <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, that tissue-specific splicing might in some cases evolve in a single step corresponding to evolution of a YCAY cluster, and that the conservation level of YCAY clusters relates to the functions encoded by the regulated RNAs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Alternative splicing generates different mRNA isoforms from a single gene and thus increases the number of proteins a cell can produce. This is particularly important in the brain, which possesses a number of brain-specific splicing factors. In this study, we have looked at evolution of brain-specific splicing regulation by one such factor, Nova. Previous studies have identified &#x0223c;100 alternative exons that are regulated by Nova in mouse brain. We find that the Nova protein sequence changed little during vertebrate evolution from fish to human, whereas the RNA targets themselves have evolved significantly. Interestingly, the presence of conserved Nova binding elements in an RNA transcript in most cases correlates with conservation of brain-specific splicing. In addition, the evolution of Nova-dependent splicing relates to the functions encoded by the target RNAs, such that Nova-regulated splicing of RNAs encoding core roles such as synaptic adhesion, ion channel, and cytoskeletal proteins is on average more conserved than splicing of the RNAs encoding regulatory roles, such as transmembrane receptor and signal transduction proteins.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Jelen N, Ule J, &#x0017d;ivin M, Darnell RB (2007) Evolution of Nova-Dependent Splicing Regulation in the Brain.

When these are positioned within 200 nucleotides of the splice sites, their position predicts whether Nova functions to inhibit or enhance alternative exon inclusion, following the rules of an RNA map. So far, biochemical studies and analysis of mouse genomic sequence have found 76 different YCAY clusters located within Nova-regulated pre-mRNAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Fifty-four of these clusters are located in genes that are expressed both in brain and liver. This allowed us to analyze the splicing pattern of Nova-regulated exons from brain and liver mRNA of different vertebrates and relate it to the conservation of YCAY clusters. We found that a brain-specific splicing pattern was conserved across species in all (24/24) tested cases where YCAY clusters were conserved. We also found seven cases lacking the brain-specific splicing pattern, which correlated with the absence of detectable YCAY clusters in the corresponding pre-mRNAs. Interestingly, in all of these cases, we also observed a loss of alternative splicing (i.e., a single isoform detected in brain and liver). This suggests that some RNAs might have acquired brain-specific splicing regulation in a single step by addition of the YCAY cluster, without the need for preliminary mutations that would create an alternative exon.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Recently, an RNA map was constructed to relate Nova-dependent splicing regulation in brain to the position of its binding site (YCAY cluster) on the pre-mRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. This RNA map defines how YCAY clusters at five major positions on pre-mRNA direct the action of Nova on the splicing of neighboring alternative exons. At two such positions, YCAY clusters act as splicing enhancers and at three positions as splicing silencers. Seventy-six such YCAY clusters were found within Nova-regulated pre-mRNAs, providing a tool to relate the conservation of YCAY clusters to the evolution of brain-specific splicing.

Indeed, manual analysis of sequence alignments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030173-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) shows that the orthologous sequences often contain more dispersed YCAY clusters than the mouse genome. To be able to take these YCAY clusters into account, we modified the algorithm for the purpose of this study to detect clusters with distance of up to nine nucleotides between YCAY motifs.

We find that most RNAs with conserved YCAY clusters encode adhesion and cytoskeletal scaffold proteins, ion channels, and signaling proteins.

In comparison, RNAs with YCAY clusters that are conserved only in mammals encode receptors (such as glycine (GlyR&#x003b1;2) and kainaite (GluR6) neurotransmitter receptors) and signaling proteins (neurochondrin, Lrp12, Gpr45). It is possible that RNAs with conserved YCAY clusters more often encode proteins that are indispensable for synaptic development and function, while the RNAs with YCAY clusters present only in mammals more often encode proteins that modulate synaptic function. This hypothesis cannot yet be statistically analyzed since not enough is known about the detailed synaptic functions of each Nova-regulated gene.</p><fig id="pgen-0030173-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Conservation of YCAY Cluster Can Provide Insight into Evolution of Functionally Coherent Coregulated Network</title><p>The diagram shows a subset of proteins encoded by Nova-regulated transcripts for which we were able to obtain orthologous sequences for analysis of YCAY cluster conservation.

How did this relationship between an RNA-binding protein and its set of RNA targets evolve? We approached this question by analyzing evolutionary changes in Nova proteins, YCAY clusters, and splicing of corresponding alternative exons in mouse, chicken, and zebrafish. In this paper, we developed a hypothesis that evolution of Nova-regulated splicing proceeds mainly through changes in <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, while Nova proteins themselves show little evolutionary change.</p><p>This is the first study to analyze the conservation of tissue-specific splicing between species other than mouse and human. While bioinformatic analysis shows alternative exon conservation between mouse and human to be roughly 75&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, we find &#x0223c;80&#x00025; (31/39) conservation of brain-specific splicing patterns between evolutionarily much more diverse mouse, chicken, and zebrafish species. This estimate might be a bit higher than the average conservation rate, since we were not able to define orthologous positions in chicken and zebrafish genomes to analyze splicing of a subset of Nova-regulated exons, due to the lower level of their genomic sequence conservation. However, the finding agrees with previous comparisons of splicing in mouse and human tissues showing that exons with tissue-specific splicing are more conserved than the rest of the alternative exons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. It will be interesting in the future to study the conservation of tissue-specific exons between such diverse species as fish and human in order to test more generally if exons with brain-specific pattern, in addition to those regulated by Nova, have particularly high conservation rates.</p><p>This study modified the original YCAY cluster algorithm by relaxing the requirement for the maximal distance between two YCAY motifs from three to nine nucleotides. The greater ability of the modified algorithm to detect conserved YCAY clusters is evident by analyzing the 31 cases where RT-PCR analysis in this study detected conservation of brain-specific splicing in chicken or zebrafish. Whereas the original more-stringent algorithm detects YCAY clusters in only 15 cases, the modified algorithm detects a conserved cluster in 24/31 cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030173-st001">Table S1</xref>). A shortcoming of our current algorithm is that it analyzes the YCAY motifs as being separated by a linear RNA molecule, even though in reality YCAY motifs that appear dispersed on a linear RNA may be in relatively close proximity once the RNA assumes its in vivo structure. This may be one reason why the original study did not detect YCAY clusters in all the pre-mRNAs regulated by Nova in mouse brain, and why the current study didn't detect conserved YCAY clusters in all cases where brain-specific splicing pattern was conserved.</p><p>Of 15 pre-mRNAs in which we didn't detect a conserved YCAY cluster, seven had conserved brain-specific splicing patterns. In these instances, our algorithm may be failing to detect some types of conserved Nova-binding sites; in particular, those where RNA structure might bring multiple YCAY motifs in proximity. Alternatively, many alternative exons are regulated by multiple <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. For instance, splicing of alternative exon 19 in NMDA receptor1 (NR1) is regulated by Nova and several other factors including Napor, hnRNP A1, hnRNP H, and CaM kinase IV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b030">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that during a long evolutionary time, the importance of different <italic>cis</italic>-acting sites for the tissue-specific splicing pattern varies, allowing for other factors to compensate for the absence of YCAY clusters in these eight cases. We note that in our previous study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, we demonstrated that YCAY clusters located within 200 nucleotides of splice sites predict Nova-dependent splicing regulation, but we do not know whether these clusters are the only ones required for Nova action. It is possible that in some cases Nova may be able to regulate its target exons via additional YCAY clusters located in introns further than 200 nucleotides from the splice sites, which would have been missed in this study.</p><p>We found seven cases of pre-mRNAs lacking brain-specific splicing pattern and also lacking YCAY clusters. Interestingly, in all of these cases, rather than just lacking tissue-specific splicing, we detected no evidence of alternative splicing at all in brain and liver. This observation contrasts with the currently prevailing model, which proposes that tissue-specific splicing generally evolves from the regulation of preexisting alternative exons, so that mutations in consensus 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites and enhancer sequences would precede subsequent mutations that lead to tissue-specific splicing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. We observed no case where an alternative exon would subsequently evolve a tissue-specific splicing pattern, although our sample size was limited. Our data suggest that tissue-specific splicing might have evolved directly, at least in some cases. This model of direct evolution of Nova-dependent alternative splicing is also supported by the observation that splice site consensus scores and exonic enhancer density in Nova-regulated exons are on average similar to constitutive exons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>One of the exons that obtained a Nova-dependent brain-specific splicing pattern in more recent evolution is Munc18&#x02013;2 (Stxbp2) exon 3. The role of Munc18&#x02013;2 in the brain is unexplored since an early study has termed it a non-neuronal Munc18&#x02013;1 (Stxbp1/Sec1) homologue &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. However, given that Nova regulates brain-specific splicing of its exon 3 in higher mammals, Munc18&#x02013;2 might play a similar role in regulating neurotransmitter release as Munc18&#x02013;1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, in a way that would contribute to brain function of higher mammals.</p><p>There is an ongoing debate regarding the functional significance of splice variants, particularly those encoded by minor exons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b036">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

Furthermore, the functional significance of Nova-regulated exons is corroborated by conservation of reading frame; 70&#x00025; (54/77) of internal cassette exons had a length multiple of three in all species in which they were present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030173-st004">Table S4</xref>), agreeing with previous reports that conserved alternative exons show significant increase in frame preservation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The composite Nova binding site allows variation in the number and density of YCAY motifs to fine tune the affinity of the RNA for Nova &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, we observed no case where YCAY cluster would change in position in a way that would qualitatively change the outcome of Nova binding (i.e., change from a splicing enhancer to silencer). We hypothesize that these features of Nova&#x02013;RNA binding might allow selection in higher vertebrates to act gradually via changing the Nova binding site, rather than Nova itself, similarly to other cases where <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements were suggested as the main force for phenotypic evolution &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements could help fine tune the functional coherence of the whole network of RNAs regulated by Nova (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030173-g005">Figure 5</xref>), which were found in previous studies to primarily encode synaptic proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, tight evolutionary fixation of Nova is essential to preserve regulation of an array of brain-specific splicing events.

How can we reconcile the high conservation of the functional Nova binding sites analyzed in the current study with the much lower conservation of sites isolated via biochemical studies? We hypothesize that in addition to the highly conserved functional sites that were analyzed in this study, Nova might also bind less conserved sites, which could contribute to ability of the organism to evolve. To explore this question further in the future, biochemical analysis of Nova&#x02013;RNA binding in brains of different species would need to be related to the alternative exons regulated by Nova in each species.</p><p>Taken together, the current work finds that brain-specific splicing patterns of Nova-regulated exons are highly conserved and are related to conservation of YCAY clusters in the pre-mRNAs. The presence of YCAY clusters is 100&#x00025; predictive for the brain-specific alternative splicing of exons, whereas their absence significantly decreases the ratio of conserved splicing to 47&#x00025;. The data also agree with the hypothesis that alternative splicing might in some cases evolve via addition of <italic>cis</italic>-acting sites that bind tissue-specific splicing factors such as Nova. Moreover, it is shown that the genes encoding adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins generally display deeper evolutionary fixation of YCAY clusters than the genes encoding receptors and signaling molecules, suggesting evolution of Nova function through evolution of target RNA sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genomic alignments.</title><p>We searched for human (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Homo sapiens</named-content>), opossum (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Monodelphis domestica</named-content>), chicken (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Gallus gallus</named-content>), frog (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Xenopus tropicalis</named-content>), and zebrafish (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Danio rerio</named-content>) genomic orthologous sequences with the Liftover tool on University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030173-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; using genomic data from March 2006 for human, February 2006 for mouse, January 2006 for opossum, May 2006 for chicken, August 2006 for frog, and March 2006 for zebrafish.

The picture also shows the structures of different mRNA isoforms with Nova binding site indicated (red circle for splicing enhancers and blue circle for splicing silencers).</p><p>Agrin: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is not present in chicken and zebrafish. But the splicing pattern of alternative exon, orthologous to mouse alternative exon 31a, in these two species is similar to that in mouse, where Nova regulated alternative exon 31a is more included in the brain. In both species, the alternative forms are weakly expressed.</p><p>Ank3: Mouse niss2 cluster is very well conserved in chicken, but it is not conserved in zebrafish. Splicing of chicken alternative exon, orthologous to mouse alternative exon 31, is conserved, with exon more excluded in brain (and more included in liver). We were not able to construct PCR primers for analyzing splicing of this alternative exon in zebrafish.</p><p>Aplp2: The main mouse YCAY cluster is conserved in chicken, but it is not present in zebrafish. Zebrafish has no detectable YCAY clusters in the downstream vicinity of the alternative exon. Splicing pattern of alternative exon, orthologous to mouse exon 12a, is conserved in both chicken and zebrafish, with alternative exon being more included in the brain. We also checked alternative splicing in opossum, which has a conserved YCAY cluster and also found conserved splicing pattern (unpublished data).</p><p>Brd9: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is extremely conserved in chicken and also very good in zebrafish. The splicing pattern of the chicken and zebrafish alternative exon, orthologous to mouse exon 5, is also conserved in both organisms, with alternative exon more included in the brain than in the liver. Note that the alternative exon 5 lies downstream of the YCAY cluster and is not shown in the alignment.</p><p>Cacna1b: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is conserved in chicken and zebrafish. The zebrafish cluster is located a little more upstream than in other organisms and so it is not visible in this alignment. Splicing pattern of the alternative exon, orthologous to exon 24a in mouse, is conserved in both chicken and zebrafish, with the exon more included in the brain.</p><p>Interestingly, it looks like zebrafish has a slightly different gene structure from other organisms, with an additional alternative exon adjacent to the known alternative exon.</p><p>Camk2g: The main mouse Nova binding cluster nise2 is not present in chicken and zebrafish (although it is conserved in human, dog, rat, and opossum). Chicken and zebrafish have a strong cluster located more downstream (approximately 100 nt further away from the alternative exon 13a than that of the mouse, which still corresponds to the nise2 area), which is not shown in this alignment. In chicken, the splicing pattern of the alternative exon, which is orthologous to mouse alternative exon 13a, is the same as in mouse, with the exon more included in the brain. In zebrafish, it looks as though the exon that is orthologous to mouse alternative exon 13b is more regulated, possibly because of the position of the cluster.</p><p>Clasp1: Mouse nese1 cluster is not conserved in chicken, but it is conserved in zebrafish (where the cluster is even stronger than in mouse, with five YCAY repeats). Interestingly, chicken has a splicing pattern more similar to that of the alternative exon, orthologous to mouse exon 9, than to that of the mouse, with the exon more included in the brain. We were not able to construct PCR primers for analyzing splicing of this alternative exon in zebrafish.</p><p>Clstn1: The main mouse YCAY cluster is not conserved in chicken or zebrafish. Interestingly, the chicken alternative exon, which is orthologous to mouse exon 10, has the same splicing pattern as in mouse, with the exon predominantly included in the brain. We were not able to construct PCR primers for analyzing splicing of this alternative exon in zebrafish.</p><p>Dab1: Mouse alternative exons 7b and 7c are preceded by niss2 elements. Exon 7b is not conserved in chicken, but it is conserved in zebrafish and the peptide sequence encoded by the two exons suggests that one of the two exons was generated via a duplication event during the evolution of mammals. Interestingly, these species also lack one of the niss2 elements, suggesting that duplication of the exon has also duplicated the upstream YCAY cluster. Splicing pattern of the conserved exon 7c in chicken is the same as in mouse, with the exon predominantly excluded in the brain. It looks as though in zebrafish both exons are conserved, with a conserved pattern of splicing (more often excluded in the brain). The gel has only three bands because both exons are probably the same length.</p><p>Efna5: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is conserved in chicken, but is not present in fish (where the whole area is actually missing). Splicing pattern of alternative exon, orthologous to mouse exon 3a, is conserved, with exon slightly more excluded in the brain than in the liver. Interestingly, the zebrafish alternative exon also shows a brain-specific splicing pattern, although the pattern is reversed, with the exon more included in the brain.</p><p>Epb4.1: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is conserved. Chicken has a weak YCAY cluster (the distance between the first and second YCAY is 17 nt and 0 nt between the second and third cluster, respectively), and zebrafish has a stronger cluster with five YCAY tetranucleotides (5 nt between the first and second YCAY, &#x02212;1 between the second and third, 4 nt between third and fourth, and 3 nt between fourth and fifth). Splicing pattern of exon, orthologous to mouse alternative exon 14, is conserved in chicken, with the exon more included in the brain. In zebrafish, it looks like the exon orthologous to mouse alternative exon 13 has a conserved tissue-specific splicing pattern.</p><p>Epb41L2: Mouse alternative exon 12a and 12b are controlled by two YCAY clusters, nise2 and nise3. Neither of these clusters is conserved in the chicken (we could not obtain orthologous sequence for zebrafish), but chicken has one YCAY cluster in a very similar position to that of the mouse nise3 cluster. Both alternative exons in chicken display a tissue-specific splicing pattern, with the exon orthologous to mouse exon 12a more included in the liver, while the exon orthologous to mouse exon 12b is more included in the brain.</p><p>Gphn: Mouse niss1 cluster is not conserved in chicken or zebrafish. On the other hand, mouse niss2 and ness2 clusters are completely conserved in chicken (we could not get the orthologous sequence for zebrafish). Splicing pattern of the chicken exon orthologous to mouse alternative exon 7a is the same as in mouse, with the exon predominantly excluded in the brain (and predominantly included in liver).</p><p>Golga4: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is not conserved in chicken (we could not obtain orthologous sequence for zebrafish) and the exon orthologous to the mouse alternative exon is not present in chicken, so there is no alternative splicing present.</p><p>Kcnma1: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is located in the 5&#x02032; constitutive exon; in chicken, this YCAY cluster is not conserved, but in zebrafish, this cluster is very similar to that in mouse, with four YCAY motives (&#x02212;1 nt between the first and second YCAY, 11 nt between the second and third, and &#x02212;1 nt between the third and fourth). The splicing pattern of the alternative exon orthologous to mouse exon 24a is conserved both in chicken (even though here the YCAY cluster is not conserved) and zebrafish, with the exon more included in the brain.</p><p>Lrrfip1: The mouse nise1 element, located in alternative exon 17a, is conserved in chicken, but it is not present in zebrafish. Note that mouse alternative exon 17 acts as an alternative 3&#x02032; mRNA end. Splicing of the alternative exon orthologous to mouse exon 17a is conserved in chicken (even though the YCAY cluster is not conserved), with the exon more included in the brain. We were not able to construct PCR primers for analyzing splicing of this alternative exon in zebrafish.</p><p>Map4: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is not present in chicken and zebrafish. Chicken has similar splicing pattern to mouse (exon more excluded in brain, compared to liver), while in zebrafish there is only one form of the transcript (with exon included) and there is no splicing, even though the exon is conserved.</p><p>Map4k4: In mouse, Nova binds to two YCAY clusters in the vicinity of alternative exon 22a, niss1 and ness2. We obtained orthologous sequences only for the ness2 element, which is present in the alternative exon. The element is completely conserved in chicken, but is absent in zebrafish. In chicken, splicing of the exon orthologous to mouse alternative exon 22a follows the conservation of the ness2 element, with more exon exclusion in brain than in liver. We were not able to construct PCR primers for analyzing splicing of this alternative exon in zebrafish.</p><p>Neo1: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is located in alternative exon 27 and is almost perfectly conserved in all species (chicken and zebrafish actually have one additional YCAY sequence). The exon orthologous to mouse alternative exon 27 is predominantly excluded in the brain of chicken and zebrafish (slightly more in zebrafish &#x0005b;76&#x00025; versus 90&#x00025;&#x0005d;).</p><p>Plcl3: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is conserved in chicken, but is not conserved in zebrafish. Zebrafish has one YCAY cluster located very close (3 nt) to the 5&#x02032; end of the alternative exon (chicken: 4 nt between first and second YCAY, 1 nt between second and third YCAY; fish: 4 nt between first and second YCAY, 12 nt between second and third YCAY). Splicing of the exon orthologous to mouse alternative exon 22a is conserved in both chicken and zebrafish, with the exon more included in the brain.</p><p>Ptprf: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is present in chicken and zebrafish, with five YCAY tetranucleotides in zebrafish versus three in chicken. The splicing pattern in chicken and zebrafish of the exon orthologous to mouse alternative exon 6a is very similar to that in the mouse, where the exon is predominantly excluded outside brain.</p><p>Ptprf: Alternative exon 19a in mouse is regulated by two Nova binding sites, nise3 and nese2 element. Neither of the two elements is conserved in chicken or zebrafish (even though the element nese2 is located in the 5&#x02032; constitutive exon, which is strongly conserved). But there is also a conserved YCAY cluster, preceding the nise3 element, which is present in chicken but not in zebrafish. (We could not obtain the orthologous sequence from opossum, so we excluded this sequence from our nucleotide alignment). The splicing pattern of the chicken exon orthologous to mouse alternative exon 19a is the same as in mouse, where the exon is more included in the brain. We were not able to construct PCR primers for analyzing splicing of this alternative exon in zebrafish.</p><p>St7: Genomes of chicken and zebrafish does not have sequence orthologous to the mouse Nova-regulated alternative exon 7 and downstream sequence containing the Nova binding site. The PCR of chicken and zebrafish brain and liver showed only one form of this gene and the exon was not present.</p><p>Stxbp2: The main mouse Nova binding cluster is located on the border of alternative exon 3. The cluster is not conserved in either chicken or zebrafish. On the other hand, the exon orthologous to mouse alternative exon 3 is conserved in both organisms. The exon shows no alternative splicing in these two organisms and the only detected form is the one with the exon included.</p><p>Tacc2: The mouse nise3 cluster is not conserved in chicken (we could not obtain orthologous sequence for zebrafish).Although mouse alternative exon 10 is strongly conserved in chicken (even in exon length), it is not alternatively spliced but is constitutively included into mRNA. In addition, expression of the gene is low in liver. We were not able to construct PCR primers for analyzing splicing of this alternative exon in zebrafish.</p><p>(1.4 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030173.sg002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030173-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>YCAY Cluster Scores of Orthologous Sequences within Pre-mRNAs That Were Identified by Splicing Microarray As Regulated by Nova in Mouse Brain</title><p>Analysis of YCAY cluster scores in human (<named-content content-type="genus-species">H. sapiens</named-content>), opossum (<named-content content-type="genus-species">M. domestica</named-content>), chicken (<named-content content-type="genus-species">G. gallus</named-content>), frog (<named-content content-type="genus-species">X. tropicalis</named-content>), and zebrafish (<named-content content-type="genus-species">D. rerio</named-content>) sequences.

We examined their expression pattern with RT-PCR and found that Brd9 and Cp110 are expressed in brain and liver, while we could not detect Skip in the liver.
