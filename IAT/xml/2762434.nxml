The pro-inflammatory status may be counteracted by appropriate treatment, such as in rehabilitation. We compared serum fractalkine concentrations of 46 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and 47 insulin-dependent diabetic patients (IDDM) following rehabilitation with those of 50 control subjects. Following rehabilitation serum fractalkine levels (477 &#x000b1; 225 pg/mL) in CHD patients were similar to those in control subjects (572 &#x000b1; 205 pg/mL; <italic>P</italic> = 0.303), whereas fractalkine levels were lower in IDDM patients (430 &#x000b1; 256 pg/mL; <italic>P</italic> = 0.042). No significant difference between CHD and IDDM patients was present (<italic>P</italic> = 0.319). Postprandial hyperlipemia may influence inflammation; thus, we investigated fractalkine levels four and eight hours after inducing postprandial hyperlipemia. However, we did not find any significant alterations in CHD and diabetic patients, whereas the fractalkine levels in controls were reduced. <italic>In vitro</italic>, lipofundin used as a hyperlipemic stimulus was added to vessel wall cells and reduced fractalkine levels.

In addition, other leukocytes, such as mast cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-vhrm-5-849">5</xref> or T-cells,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-vhrm-5-849">6</xref> are also found in atherosclerotic lesions. The invasion of the vessel wall starts when blood cells adhere to the endothelium. However, the mechanisms underlying the initial activation have still not been completely defined. The leukocyte-endothelial interaction involves rolling, firm adhesion, and migration into the neointima, which is mediated by selectins and other adhesion molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-vhrm-5-849">7</xref> as well as by chemokines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-vhrm-5-849">8</xref> Chemokines attract and direct cells along a chemotactic gradient. Furthermore, they may activate other atherosclerosis-relevant functions of vessel wall cells or leukocytes, for example, by activating adhesion molecules on the endothelium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-vhrm-5-849">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-vhrm-5-849">9</xref></p><p>The recently discovered chemokine fractalkine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-vhrm-5-849">10</xref> and its receptor CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 have emerged as interesting intermediaries in atherosclerosis. Fractalkine is a multidomain protein expressed on the surface of a variety of cells, including activated endothelial and smooth muscle cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-vhrm-5-849">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-vhrm-5-849">15</xref> Fractalkine exhibits features which have not been described for other members of the chemokine family, including its exceptionally large size of 95 kDa and the presence of a transmembrane anchor. Furthermore, a soluble form can be released from its membrane-associated form by extracellular cleavage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-vhrm-5-849">16</xref> CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 is a seven-transmembrane-spanning fractalkine receptor, mediating its signal by G-proteins, as most cytokines do. This receptor mediates the firm adhesion to fractalkine even in the absence of G-protein activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-5-849">17</xref> and thus plays a role as an adhesion molecule in addition to functioning as a chemokine. In this way, membrane-bound fractalkine contributes to the adhesion of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-expressing leukocytes. On the other hand, soluble fractalkine, after enzymatic cleavage and release, has potent chemotactic activity for monocytes and lymphocytes but, like CC chemokines, not for granulocytes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-vhrm-5-849">18</xref></p><p>Cytokines, including chemokines, and other innate compounds are strongly involved in the inflammatory pathways contributing to atherosclerosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-vhrm-5-849">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-vhrm-5-849">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-vhrm-5-849">8</xref> Thus, evidence has been provided that fractalkine plays a role in various cardiovascular diseases. For example, increased fractalkine levels have been reported in patients after cardiac allograft rejection. In a murine model, allograft survival was prolonged from 7 &#x000b1; 1 days to 49 &#x000b1; 30 days (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.0008) by administering fractalkine antibodies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-vhrm-5-849">19</xref> These studies identified a critical role for fractalkine in the pathogenesis of acute rejection and suggest that fractalkine inhibition might be a potential therapeutic target. Fractalkine levels have only been rarely determined in patients; however, it has been shown that Alzheimer patients express enhanced fractalkine levels, correlating with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-vhrm-5-849">20</xref> Another study also reported that fractalkine levels are enhanced in Wegener&#x02019;s granulomatosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-vhrm-5-849">21</xref> In patients with coronary artery disease fractalkine plasma levels were enhanced and then reduced after statin therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-5-849">22</xref> When CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 genotypes were analyzed in patients with acute coronary syndromes and healthy controls, CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-I249 heterozygosity was associated with a markedly reduced risk of acute coronary events, independent of established coronary risk factors such as smoking or diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-vhrm-5-849">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-vhrm-5-849">24</xref></p><p>Both the risk and the rate of development of atherosclerosis are increased in diabetic patients, but the underlying mechanisms are still not completely understood. Epidemiologic and pathophysiologic evidence suggests that lipoproteins, platelets, or soluble clotting factors represent contributing factors. Furthermore, both balance of the prostaglandin-metabolites prostacycline and thromboxane and blood pressure regulation are disturbed. On the other hand, the metabolism and proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells are modified.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-vhrm-5-849">25</xref> Many of these alterations accompany hyperinsulinemia and may account for the recent evidence that hyperinsulinemia is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Cytokines and chemokines may contribute to regulate atherosclerosis-related pathways in diabetes or its associated diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-vhrm-5-849">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-vhrm-5-849">27</xref> However, little is known about the expression of fractalkine and its receptor in diabetes, although the mRNA of fractalkine and its receptor were upregulated in diabetic rats in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-vhrm-5-849">28</xref></p><p>To the best of our knowledge, fractalkine levels have not yet been analyzed in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes following rehabilitation. An optimized medical treatment consisting of medication such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and statins plays an important role during rehabilitation. Some of the aforementioned drugs may also exert anti-inflammatory properties, which could contribute to their beneficial effects. Indeed, fractalkine levels were reduced in patients with coronary artery disease after a six-week statin treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-5-849">22</xref> Thus, rehabilitation may normalize levels of fractalkine.</p><p>In diabetic patients postprandial hyperlipemia may represent a potential risk factor for atherosclerosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-vhrm-5-849">29</xref> Postprandial hyperlipemia can induce an inflammatory state by activating granulocytes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-vhrm-5-849">30</xref> leukocytes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-vhrm-5-849">31</xref> or endothelial cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-vhrm-5-849">32</xref> Triglyceride-rich lipids (TRL) may even penetrate the arterial wall and activate vascular smooth muscle cell genes differently, depending on the composition (ie, butter, vegetable oil/fish oil, or olive oil) of the lipid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-vhrm-5-849">33</xref> Furthermore, chylomicron remnants containing TRLs have been shown to potently activate smooth muscle cell MCP-1 production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-vhrm-5-849">34</xref> Postprandial hyperlipemia may promote inflammation in patients and oppose therapy. However, it is not clear whether therapy during rehabilitation may prevent postprandial hyperlipemia from inducing inflammation.</p><p>Thus, in the present study we investigated the expression of serum fractalkine in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and patients with insulin-dependent diabetes following optimized medical treatment after a period of rehabilitation. Subsequently, we analyzed the effect of postprandial hyperlipemia. We found that fractalkine levels in CHD and diabetic patients after rehabilitation were comparable to those in control subjects and that the postprandial fractalkine levels were not significantly increased.

Besides fractalkine, atherosclerosis-relevant serum markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]) and lipid metabolism (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]; total cholesterol [TC]; and triglycerides [TG]) were measured. The lipid markers were routinely determined by standard clinical laboratory analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of postprandial hyperlipemia</title><p>Postprandial hyperlipemia was induced by eating a high calorie fatty meal.

It was composed of 105 g fat (consisting of approximately 52 g saturated fat, 53 g unsaturated fat, and 300 mg cholesterol), 48 g carbohydrates, and 32 g protein. Probands were instructed to eat the meal within 15 minutes and not to eat any other food until the subsequent blood samples were taken. Before the meal (time-point 0) the diabetic patients received a dose of insulin subcutaneously, which was individually adapted to the meal described above. Glucose levels were measured every two hours until the end of the study period in order to prevent severe hypo- or hyperglycemia. All glucose levels were in an acceptable range; thus, no glucose or further insulin administration was required until the end of the eight-hour study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and culture of human vascular vessel wall cells</title><p>Human vascular smooth muscle cells were isolated from unused portions of saphenous veins obtained following bypass surgery, as described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-vhrm-5-849">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-vhrm-5-849">36</xref> Use of the specimens that would otherwise have been discarded was approved by the local ethics committee.

Compared with CHD patients and control subjects, the IDDM patients were older. The BMI was not significantly different, and the distribution of sexes was similar among the three groups. More smokers were found among the healthy control subjects than in the two patient groups. On the other hand, more subjects with hypertension or a family history of CHD were present in the patient groups. As anticipated, medical treatment with statins, &#x003b2;-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics was more prevalent in the patient groups. Except for diuretics, medication was similar in the tested patient groups. Healthy controls did not suffer from any obvious atherosclerotic, metabolic, or inflammatory disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>The fractalkine levels in diabetic patients are lower than in healthy control subjects</title><p>Fractalkine levels have not been measured yet in diabetic patients following rehabilitation. Thus, we analyzed the expression of fractalkine in the IDDM and CHD patients who received optimal medical treatment and underwent rehabilitation for four weeks. The fractalkine levels of the patients were compared to those of the control subjects. A comparison of the fractalkine levels in CHD and IDDM patients after rehabilitation and healthy controls (time-point 0) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-vhrm-5-849">Figure 1</xref>.

However, it was unclear whether postprandial hyperlipemia affects inflammatory parameters in rehabilitation patients as compared to control subjects. Thus, after the first blood sample was taken (time-point 0), a defined postprandial hyperlipemia was induced in the three investigated groups. Four and eight hours after the first blood sampling and eating the defined meal the next samples were taken (time-point 4; time-point 8). At time-point 4 the fractalkine levels were higher in diabetic patients (548 &#x000b1; 300 pg/mL) than in CHD patients (437 &#x000b1; 228 pg/mL; <italic>P</italic> = 0.033); however, they were not different from the control levels (474 &#x000b1; 203 pg/mL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-vhrm-5-849">Figure 2</xref>). At time-point 8 the fractalkine levels were 432 &#x000b1; 212 pg/mL in the CHD group, 454 &#x000b1; 262 pg/mL in the IDDM group, and 393 &#x000b1; 166 pg/ml in the control group. These values were not significantly different from each other. Comparing each group at the different time-points by ANOVA revealed that only the differences in the values for healthy control subjects were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004). Post hoc analysis showed that the fractalkine levels at time-point 8 were different from those at time-point 4 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.046) and time-point 0 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001), whereas at time-points 0 and 4 they were not significantly different. In contrast to control subjects, ANOVA analysis of IDDM and CHD patients did not reveal significant differences between the three time-points (<italic>P</italic> = 0.080 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.574, for diabetes and CHD, respectively). Post hoc analysis showed the same result at the 0.01 level. However, the IDDM time-points 0 and 4 were different at the 0.05 level (<italic>P</italic> = 0.033). Taken together, the data indicate that the fractalkine levels were only reduced in control subjects, whereas in CHD the levels remained low and in IDDM patients the levels fluctuated, although the differences were not significant according to ANOVA. In order to investigate the influence of hyperlipemia <italic>in vitro</italic> we incubated vascular smooth muscle cells, which represent a potential source of fractalkine in atherogenesis, with several lipofundin concentrations.

These data indicate that the lipid-lowering aspect of the IDDM and CHD medication worked properly. The correlation analysis revealed that there was no significant correlation between fractalkine serum levels, CRP, the lipid markers, age, or body mass index (BMI). BMI did not correlate with cholesterol, triglycerides, or LDL either. On the other hand, and as expected, BMI inversely correlated with HDL-C (&#x02212;0.264; <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001); the high CRP levels inversely correlated with high HDL levels (&#x02212;0.242; <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001); and cholesterol levels correlated well with triglycerides (0.463; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and LDL-C (0.847; <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Fractalkine in coronary artery bypass graft surgery and multivessel disease</title><p>Among the CHD patients the subgroup of patients who had currently received coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were analyzed because these patients express the highest pro-inflammatory state prior to rehabilitation.

Furthermore, we investigated the relation between fractalkine and classical risk factors for atherosclerosis in patients with CHD and IDDM in a state of postprandial hyperlipemia.

These results are in line with the data shown in the present manuscript, which are in the range of those for the controls or statin-treated patients. Fractalkine has been demonstrated to be involved in diabetic nephropathy in murine models. Upregulated fractalkine and CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 levels were present in the early stage of diabetic kidney disease in rats.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-vhrm-5-849">28</xref> The aforementioned data suggest that fractalkine and CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 have an important role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, functioning as an arrest chemokine in monocyte/macrophage adhesion before migration into the kidney. Blockade of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system and treatment with statins currently represent the only clinical strategies for treating the inflammatory process in diabetic nephropathy. Newer strategies include chemokine receptor antagonists and even immunosuppressive therapy, but these are still in the experimental stage. In contrast to the CHD patients, no data exist about the fractalkine levels in untreated diabetic patients. We are currently addressing this question. However, the cited data indicate that fractalkine levels are enhanced in CHD patients. The low fractalkine levels in the same patient group in the present study suggest an analogous reducing effect caused by 1) the rehabilitation process, and/or 2) alleviating the acute status of the disease.</p><p>Serum fractalkine levels in CHD and IDDM patients following rehabilitation did not differ from those in healthy control subjects. This may partly be explained by the optimal medical and lifestyle treatment that patients benefit from during rehabilitation. Thus, blood glucose, heart rate, and blood pressure are continuously monitored and promptly corrected. Furthermore, patients profit from physical activity and controlled food intake, ie, lifestyle improvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-vhrm-5-849">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-5-849">40</xref></p><p>On the other hand, patients with CHD and IDDM in rehabilitation are no longer in an acute phase of the disease. The baseline characteristics of our study population indicate that medical treatment in the two patient groups was more prevalent than in control subjects. The majority (96%) of the CHD and IDDM patients were on statin therapy compared to only 4% in controls. In addition to their lipid-lowering activity, statins may also have anti-inflammatory effects. During the constrictive remodeling status, statins have the ability to stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-vhrm-5-849">41</xref> In addition, their anti-inflammatory effect was measured by their ability to lower CRP levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-vhrm-5-849">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-vhrm-5-849">43</xref> The lipid and CRP data in the latter publications are in line with those for the control population presented here. The lipid data in the present study patients also indicate that the treatment had a similarly beneficial effect. However, the CRP levels did not reach the control values, which might be explained by the type and dose of statins used in the current study. This may have influenced the expression of the inflammatory parameters.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-5-849">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-vhrm-5-849">41</xref> Other therapeutic agents in atherosclerotic diseases include ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Both agents can reduce the expression of angiotensin I and II receptors on endothelial cells and monocytes. Thereby, they may reduce various inflammatory processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-vhrm-5-849">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-vhrm-5-849">43</xref> ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy was used in 72% of the CHD and IDDM patients, compared to only 10% among the healthy controls. We hypothesize that the low fractalkine levels in the two patient groups may be caused by the combined ACE inhibitor, ARB, and statin treatment.</p><p>An approximate measure of treatment efficacy is shown by the differing responses to postprandial hyperlipemia found in the present experiments. Postprandial hyperlipemia significantly reduced fractalkine levels in the controls, whereas it had no effect in the patients. We assume that this lack of response was caused by the anti-inflammatory capacity of the drugs being used. On the other hand, the lower (systemic) fractalkine levels may reflect reduced shedding, which in turn may indicate enhanced vascular inflammation. However, this suggestion remains somewhat speculative since no corresponding data have been published. However, we found that lipid treatment (lipofundin) reduced fractalkine release in vascular smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent fashion in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. The reduction in the fractalkine levels in the controls also indicates that the selected measurement time-points were adequate. Other reports used similar time-points for postprandial measurements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-vhrm-5-849">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-vhrm-5-849">32</xref> On the other hand, we found that cytokines could already be detected in bypass patients after three hours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-vhrm-5-849">44</xref> The enhanced fractalkine level at the four-hour time-point may reflect activation of the inflammatory genes by insulin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-vhrm-5-849">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-vhrm-5-849">46</xref> However, insulin is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects.</p><p>Similarly to other studies we were not able to show any significant correlation between fractalkine levels and other classical risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as lipid metabolism (HDL-C, LDL-C, TC, and TG), age, BMI, or diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-5-849">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-vhrm-5-849">23</xref> In our study, fractalkine serum levels were not significantly elevated in patients who received CABG surgery within two weeks before attending rehabilitation. This indicates that the acute inflammatory phase in these patients has already subsided. Furthermore, fractalkine levels in patients with two or three occluded coronary arteries were not higher than those in patients with only one stenosed coronary artery. These data suggest that the differences in the inflammatory situations between controls and CHD patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-5-849">22</xref> or as suspected here, between controls and diabetic patients are leveled by rehabilitation. Serum fractalkine levels are increased in patients with CHD during the acute inflammatory state of the disease, such as acute myocardial infarction or acute heart failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-5-849">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-vhrm-5-849">47</xref> After the acute phase of a cardiovascular inflammatory disease optimized medical treatment, such as that given during rehabilitation, may decrease the inflammatory status, as shown by the similar serum fractalkine levels in patients and healthy controls in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate the relevance of optimized medical treatment, such as that given during rehabilitation, for patients with CHD and IDDM. The present data show that in CHD and diabetic patients, in whom an activated inflammatory state is expected, inflammation as determined by serum levels of fractalkine was at the control level. Even in an elevated inflammatory state caused by postprandial hyperlipemia, no significant increase in fractalkine serum levels was found in the two patient groups compared to control subjects. The results may be explained by the quiescent disease state, optimized anti-inflammatory treatment with statins, ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and the controlled environment of the CHD and IDDM rehabilitation patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.
