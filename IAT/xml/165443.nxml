Additionally, a blood pressure quantitative trait locus (QTL) has been mapped to rat chromosome 6 in a New Zealand genetically hypertensive rat strain (GH rat). ABCG5 and ABCG8 (encoding sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 respectively) have been shown to be responsible for causing sitosterolemia in humans. These genes are organized in a head-to-head configuration at the <italic>STSL </italic>locus on human chromosome 2p21.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To investigate whether mutations in <italic>Abcg5</italic> or <italic>Abcg8</italic> exist in SHR, SHRSP, WKY and GH rats, we initiated a systematic search for the genetic variation in coding and non-coding region of <italic>Abcg5</italic> and <italic>Abcg8</italic> genes in these strains. We isolated the rat cDNAs for these genes and characterized the genomic structure and tissue expression patterns, using standard molecular biology techniques and FISH for chromosomal assignments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both rat <italic>Abcg5</italic> and <italic>Abcg8</italic> genes map to chromosome band 6q12. These genes span ~40 kb and contain 13 exons and 12 introns each, in a pattern identical to that of the <italic>STSL </italic>loci in mouse and man. Both <italic>Abcg5</italic> and <italic>Abcg8</italic> were expressed only in liver and intestine. Analyses of DNA from SHR, SHRSP, GH, WKY, Wistar, Wistar King A (WKA) and Brown Norway (BN) rat strains revealed a homozygous G to T substitution at nucleotide 1754, resulting in the coding change Gly583Cys in sterolin-1 only in rats that are both sitosterolemic and hypertensive (SHR, SHRSP and WKY).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The rat <italic>STSL </italic>locus maps to chromosome 6q12. A non-synonymous mutation in <italic>Abcg5</italic>, Gly583Cys, results in sitosterolemia in rat strains that are also hypertensive (WKY, SHR and SHRSP). Those rat strains that are hypertensive, but not sitosterolemic (e.g. GH rat) do not have mutations in <italic>Abcg5 </italic>or <italic>Abcg8</italic>. This mutation allows for expression and apparent apical targeting of <italic>Abcg5</italic> protein in the intestine. These rat strains may therefore allow us to study the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the human disease of sitosterolemia.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The human disorder of sitosterolemia, also known as phytosterolemia (MIM 210250), is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the marked elevation of plasma phytosterols e.g. &#x003b2;-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Hypercholesterolemia primarily during childhood, accelerated atherosclerosis in some adult patients leading to premature death, as well a hemolytic anaemia, arthralgias and tendon and tuberous xanthoma formations are other clinical features. Studies have shown that the sitosterolemic patients hyperabsorb all sterols (cholesterol and phytosterols) and fail to excrete phytosterols into bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Positional mapping of the <italic>STSL </italic>locus to human chromosome 2p21 led to the identification of two genes, ATP binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters G5 and G8 that were mutated in affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The protein products of these two genes (sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 respectively) are thought to form heterodimers to constitute a functional transporter, based primarily on the genetic evidence that affected individuals are either completely mutated in sterolin-1 or sterolin-2, but not both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. More recently, evidence from in vitro expression of these proteins has been presented that these two proteins co-immunoprecipitate, supporting this conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. ABCG5 and ABCG8 appear to be present in all mammalian genomes examined to date and are highly conserved between species, indicating that these genes may have a similar function in other species. In order to identify naturally occurring animal models of sitosterolemia, we previously reported a screen of 20 in-bred mouse strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This screen showed considerable genetic variation at these loci in the mouse strains, but none of these strains exhibited sitosterolemia. However, a literature search revealed that a few strains of rats, studied primarily for investigation of hypertension and stroke, have been reported to be sitosterolemic as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We hypothesised that these rat strains may be mutated in either <italic>Abcg5 </italic>or <italic>Abcg8</italic>. Tissue (and plasma) plant sterol levels in the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) were significantly higher than in Wistar and WKA rats fed either a regular chow diet or diets that have higher plant sterols and these were correlated with increased death, or red cell hemolysis etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Dietary sterol absorption rates were increased, with a decrease in sterol excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], characteristics similar to that observed in sitosterolemic patients.</p><p>In this study, we report the gene structure organisation, cDNA and tissue expression patterns of rat <italic>Abcg5</italic> and <italic>Abcg8</italic>. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, the rat <italic>STSL </italic>locus was assigned to the chromosomal 6q12. Interestingly, a cluster of 2 blood pressure (BP) quantitative trait loci (QTL) in (GH &#x000d7; BN) F2 with LOD scores 4.63 (tail BP) and 6.82 (intra-arterial BP) has also been reported to map to rat chromosome 6 between <italic>D6Mit3 </italic>and <italic>D6Mit12</italic>, an area containing the <italic>STSL </italic>locus. We interrogated this region for genetic variations and found a correlation between sitosterolemic strains and a missense mutation in <italic>Abcg5</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>DNA Samples of rat strains</title><p>The DNA samples from the following rat strains were used: Sprague Dawley (SD, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), Wistar (Sea: Wistar, Outbred, SPF, Seac Yoshitomi) and WKA (WKA/Sea, inbred, SPF, Seac Yoshitomi), WKY (WKY/NCrj, inbred, SPF, Charles River Japan, Kanagawa, Japan or Charles River, Wilmington, MA), SHR/Crl (Charles River, Wilmington, MA), SHRSP (SHRSP/Sea, inbred, SPF, Seac Yoshitomi, Fukuoka, Japan), GH and BN. The genomic DNAs from GH and BN rats were a kind gift from Dr. E. L Harris (New Zealand). The liver tissue genomic DNAs from SD, WKY and SHR rats were extracted by digestion overnight at 55&#x000b0;C in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic analysis and determination of exon-intron boundaries</title><p>Rat cDNAs for <italic>Abcg5</italic> and <italic>Abcg8</italic> were identified previously by amplification of these sequences from a Sprague Dawley rat enterocyte cDNA library, using primers located in areas conserved between mouse and human (Genbank AF312714 and AF351785 respectively). For <italic>Abcg5</italic>, the first PCR fragment was obtained by PCR using primers, ABCG5 F4, 5'-ATCCTCAAAGATGTCTCCTTGTAC-3', and ABCG5 R3, 5'-TCCTGACTCTCCTGGTCGCT-3'. For <italic>Abcg8</italic> cDNA sequences, the primers, F11 5'-AGATGCTGGCCATCATAGGG-3' and R13 5'-GATGGAGAAGGTGAAGTTGCC-3', were used to amplify rat <italic>Abcg8</italic> cDNA fragments. These products were sequenced and used to design primers specific for rat cDNA and a rat intestinal cDNA library was screened by anchor PCR.</p><p>Direct sequencing of the PCR products led to the identification of rat cDNA sequence and allowed for design of rat specific primers (Table 1, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>). Based upon the structure of mouse genes, putative rat-specific exonic primers were designed and used to amplify rat genomic regions as previously described. All PCR products were directly sequenced and both strands were sequenced as a routine. The complete rat genomic sequences have been deposited with GenBank (AY145899).</p></sec><sec><title>Chromosomal localisation by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</title><p>For FISH analysis, metaphase chromosomes were prepared from rat embryo fibroblasts. The cells were cultured in DMEM medium at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 days and treated with 0.05 &#x003bc;g/ml colcemid for 45 min. The cells were harvested by mitotic shake-off and resuspended in 0.075 M KCl at room temperature for 10 min. Fixation was carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed essentially according to Pinkel et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] with minor modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The rat sequences used for FISH labelling were amplified genomic DNA fragments (<italic>Abcg5 </italic>exons 6&#x02013;10, primers RG5-F6 and RG5-R10, and <italic>Abcg8</italic> exons 4&#x02013;13, primers RG8-F4 and RG8-R13, Table 1, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>). The two gene fragments were labelled separately with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) by nick-translation (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Appropriate length (50 to 500 bp) of the nick translated fragments was monitored by checking the nick-translation products on a 1 % agarose gel. The two gene fragments were precipitated separately using 800 ng of labelled DNA with 20 &#x003bc;g unlabeled rat C<sub>o</sub>t1 DNA, which was included in order to suppress probe hybridization to repetitive sequences. The probe DNA mixtures were ethanol precipitated and dissolved in hybridization buffer (50 % formamide, 2 &#x000d7; SSC, 10 % dextran sulphate). After denaturation, the highly repetitive sequences in the probe mixture DNA were allowed to bind to the C<sub>o</sub>t1 DNA (10 min at 37&#x000b0;C). The probe mixtures were then applied to rat fibroblast metaphase chromosome slides (previously denatured at 73&#x000b0;C for 2 min in 70 % formamide, 2 &#x000d7; SSC). Hybridization was allowed to proceed in a moist chamber for 70 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, the slides were washed for 15 min at 45&#x000b0;C in 55 % formamide, 2 &#x000d7; SSC, and then in 2 &#x000d7; SSC (pH 7.0) at 43&#x000b0;C for 9 min. The labelled probe molecules were detected with rhodamine anti-digoxigenin (Oncor, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and the slides were washed 3 times in PBS and 0.1 % Nonidet NP-40. Finally, chromosome spreads were counterstained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) in an antifade solution (Vectashield<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The images were captured using the LEICA DM RXA in combination with the Q-FISH software for microphotography.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue expression of <italic>Abcg5</italic> and <italic>Abcg8</italic></title><p>A rat multiple tissue Northern blot (Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD) containing immobilised poly A<sup>+</sup> mRNA from Sprague Dawley rat was used. Rat sterolin cDNA probes were labelled and hybridization and washing steps were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Total tissue RNAs were extracted from multiple tissues from a Sprague Dawley rat using Trizol reagent as described previously. Random hexamers were used as primers for reverse transcription of 2 &#x003bc;g of rat RNA from the multiple tissues. The primers were annealed to template at 25&#x000b0;C for 10 min, and the reaction were incubated at 53&#x000b0;C for 1 h in the presence of Superscript Reverse transcriptase, 5 mM dNTP mix and RN'ase Out inhibitor. The rat <italic>Abcg5</italic>-specific primers (RG5c-F1 and RG5Fc-R1), <italic>Abcg8</italic>-specific primers (RG8c-F1 and RG8c-R1) and &#x003b2;-actin primers (sense: 5'-CTACGTCGCCCTGGACTTCGAGC-3', antisense: 5'-GATGGAGCCGCCGATCCACACGG-3') were used for further PCR amplification (an initial denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min, 35 cycles of PCR amplification with each cycle consisting of 30 min at 94&#x000b0;C, 45 s at 60&#x000b0;C, and 2 min at 72&#x000b0;C, followed by an extension step of 72&#x000b0;C for 5 min). The resultant PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-Time PCR</title><p>For quantitation, real-time PCR was employed. Primers used were based upon previously published mouse primer sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], or designed using MacVector from cDNA sequences between exons, avoiding the amplification of potentially contaminating genomic DNA in the total RNA sample (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">3</xref>). Samples of total RNA (2 &#x003bc;g) from rat livers were reverse transcribed according to the SuperScript' First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using random hexamers with a final volume of 20 &#x003bc;l. Real-time PCR was performed on a PE Biosystems GeneAmp 5700 sequence Detection System (Forest City, CA). Standard reaction volume was 10 &#x003bc;l and contained 1X QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 0.002 U AmpErase UNG enzyme (PE Biosystems, Forest City, CA), 0.7 &#x003bc;l of cDNA template and 100&#x02013;500 nM of oligonucleotide primers. Initial steps of RT-PCR were 2 minutes at 50&#x000b0;C for UNG erase activation, followed by a 15 minute hold at 95&#x000b0;C. Cycles (n = 40) consisted of a 15 second melt at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by a 1 minute annealing/extension at 60&#x000b0;C. The final step was a 60&#x000b0;C incubation for 1 minute. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Threshold cycle (CT) analysis of all samples was set at 0.5 relative fluorescence units.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sequence of the rat

Based upon the known conservation between the murine and human <italic>STSL </italic>loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we designed oligonucleotides in putative exonic regions and used PCR amplification of rat genomic region to characterise the genome organisation. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows a summary composite of the genomic organisation. The intron-exon boundary sequences are indicated in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">3</xref>. In keeping with the human and mouse <italic>STSL </italic>loci, the rat <italic>Abcg5</italic> and <italic>Abcg8</italic> genes are arranged in a head-to-head configuration, with a distance of 379 bp separating their respective initiation codons. The exact start transcriptional sites for either gene has not been definitively established. Comparison of the DNA sequence of isolated cDNAs, as well as the polypeptide sequence with human and mouse sequences revealed a very high degree of homology (&#x0003e;80%). To assign the chromosomal location, we performed FISH analyses, and we were able to unambiguously map the rat <italic>STSL </italic>locus to chromosome 6q12 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). There is specific labelling of both chromatids of both homologues of rat chromosome (RNO) 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Based on the DAPI-banding pattern the <italic>Abcg5 </italic>and <italic>Abcg8 </italic>genes were sub-localized to RNO6q12. The <italic>STSL </italic>locus was mapped to the same position as shown by the diagrammatic representation of the rat Chr. 6 as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.

Thus, the <italic>ABCG5 </italic>and <italic>ABCG8 </italic>genes fit into a group of genes that are syntenic both in HSA2 and in RNO6. A conserved segment between HSA2, RNO6, and MMU17 on RNO6q11-q16 has been demonstrated by Zoo-FISH analysis and gene mapping data, confirming this synteny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Organisation of the rat <italic>Abcg5 </italic>and <italic>Abcg8 </italic>genes </bold>The top line indicates the restriction endonuclease map of the <italic>STSL </italic>locus; B, <italic>Bam </italic>HI; E, <italic>Eco</italic>RI; S, <italic>Sal I</italic>, X, <italic>Xba</italic>I.

To confirm that this insertion resulted from an alternatively spliced mRNA, we amplified and sequenced the intragenic region between exons 2 and 3 and identified a 66 bp exon (exon 2b), flanked by canonical splice-sites (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">2</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We next screened total liver and intestinal RNA, using RT-PCR, from SD, SHR and WKY rats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In all samples a larger DNA fragment of low abundance was identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and direct sequencing showed that these fragments contained exon 2b sequences (data not shown). It is not established whether these transcripts are a result of aberrant splicing, or are translated and code for a slightly larger sterolin-2. Careful interrogation of the mouse and human genomic sequences did not identify any homologous sequences, suggesting this is unique to the rat. Additionally, both the mouse and human <italic>Abcg8</italic> genes have alternatively spliced mRNA, involving a CAG repeat at exon 2 and exon 8 splice acceptor sites respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

A reliable antibody to sterolin-1 was available only and was used to probe liver microsomal lysates from Sprague Dawley, SHR and Wistar rats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Although equal amounts of microsomal protein lysates were loaded from the livers of these different strains, we consistently observed that the protein expression patterns were always different between SHR and the control strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel C, cf. tracks 5, 6 and 8). Thus, all of the data were normalised in one of two ways, either by using total microsomal protein, or by using the intensity of transferrin signal, after western blotting. Both of these methods gave consistent results and indicated that expression of <italic>Abcg5</italic> was increased approximately 2-fold in the SHR but not the Wistar or SD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). To further assess if the mutant protein is mis-targeted, we performed immunolocalization, using an anti-peptide rabbit antibody, on various rat liver and intestinal sections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). We did not observe any differences between the staining patterns observed for the control rat strains (Wistar or SD) and the mutant hypertensive strains (SHR, SHRSP).

Sterols are essential constituents of cellular membranes in human, animals and plants. In humans and animals, cholesterol is the sterol that is synthesised, absorbed and utilised, whereas plants do not synthesise cholesterol, but use molecules that are similar, such as sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol. Although similar amounts of cholesterol and plant sterols are present in the typical human diet, the intestine of normal subjects provides an efficient barrier against the absorption of the majority of plant sterols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. On average, &#x0003c; 1&#x02013;5% of dietary plant sterols are absorbed and retained compared with ~55% of dietary cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, in healthy individuals, there exists an exquisite mechanism that allows the body to distinguish between cholesterol and non-cholesterol sterols. ABCG5 and ABCG8 are two genes located adjacently in a head-to-head configuration on human chromosome 2p21, encoding for two half-transporters, sterolin 1 and sterolin 2 respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Mutations in either of these genes causes sitosterolemia, characterized by hyperabsorption of phytosterols, reduced excretion of sterols into the bile and very elevated levels of plasma plant sterol levels. In sitosterolemic patients, the absorption of phytosterols in intestine is dramatically increased, with absorption of plant sterols to about the same extent (~60%) as cholesterol.</p><p>Interestingly, a similar whole-body accumulation of plant sterols, less severe than in human sitosterolemia, has been reported recently in SHR, SHRSP and WKY rats, but not in the other genetically related rat strains, such as SD, Wistar and WKA rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These rats exhibit defects at two levels: increased absorption of sterols (plant and animal) at the intestinal level and decreased excretion of sterols into bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The higher sterol absorption in the intestine and the lower biliary excretion of plant sterols in these rat strains led us to hypothesise that <italic>Abcg5</italic> or <italic>Abcg8</italic> gene mutations may be responsible for the sitosterolemia observed in these hypertensive rats.</p><p>Characterization of the rat <italic>STSL </italic>locus showed that it is highly conserved in organization, and maps to rat chromosome 6q12, a region also syntenic with the mouse and human <italic>STSL </italic>loci. Rat <italic>Abcg5</italic> and <italic>Abcg8</italic> are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with expression confined to the liver and the intestine. We sequenced the <italic>STSL </italic>loci in sitosterolemic and control rat strains and identified a number of nucleotide changes. Most of these nucleotide changes were in intronic regions and, based upon their locations, are likely to be 'silent'. However, one change, G1754T in exon 12 was identified that led to a coding change of Gly583Cys in sterolin-1 (<italic>Abcg5</italic>). This change was found only in rat strains that were confirmed to be sitosterolemic (WKY, SHR and SHRSP), but not in any of the other strains screened (SD, Wistar, WKA, GH or BN).</p><p>The significance of other genetic variances in <italic>Abcg5 </italic>and <italic>Abcg8 </italic>in different rat strains documented in this study is presently unknown. Plant sterol metabolism has been extensively evaluated in different rat strains, but the accumulation of plant sterols occurs only in SHR, SHRSP and WKY rats. The predicted 6 trans-membrane domain model of sterolin-1 indicates that the Gly583Cys missense mutation is located within the third extracellular loop (residues 554&#x02013;620), in a conserved region (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) and is adjacent to two potential <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites (residues 585 and 594). Thus a mutation at residue 583 could disrupt the first site. Finally, both the sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 are cysteine-rich proteins (16 cysteines in sterolin 1 and 14 in sterolin 2), five of these cyteines in sterolin-1 are present in the extracellular loop containing the mutation. It is tempting to speculate that the gain of an additional cysteine in sterolin-1 by the Gly583Cys missense mutation might affect intracellular trafficking or the heterodimerization with sterolin-2. This possibility is diminished but not eliminated by the demonstration that in both the mutant and control rats, <italic>Abcg5</italic> is located apically in the intestine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Evidence that sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 may heterodimerize has now been presented, based upon in vitro analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, our preliminary analyses of immunohistochemistry, using an antibody to sterolin-1 suggests that the pattern of expression in the liver and intestine is similar for both SD as well as WKY or SHR rats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). These studies are limited in scope, as antibody reagents to detect rat sterolin-2 are not currently available.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Immunohistochemical detection of <italic>Abcg5</italic> in liver and intestine from different rat strains. </bold>The panels on the left hand show liver sections and those on the right hand show intestinal sections. The right hand images of each panel show the hematoxylin stained images, viewed with transmitted light and the left hand images show the fluorescence images captured at the same laser wavelength and intensity. Panel A shows results obtained with the pre-immune serum, panel B, C and D the results for Wistar, WKY and SHR rat tissues. All sections were captured at 40 &#x000d7; magnification. Scale bars (50 &#x003bc;m) are shown in the bottom left hand corner of each image. The data for SD rat tissues were similar to those obtained with Wistar and are not shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2261-3-4-9"/></fig><p>Another formal possibility not excluded is that the Gly583Cys missense mutation may have no significance in the accumulation of phytosterols in WKY, SHR and SHRSP, and that the alteration in the 3' UTR or even the intronic changes reported above may be the causative 'mutations'. Our analyses of the mRNA and protein profiles would not strongly support these possibilities. However, further investigation will be required to determine if the 3-base insertion in the predicted 3'UTR of <italic>Abcg8</italic> has any functional consequence. In the absence of a direct assay for sterolin-1 and -2 function, the genetic changes presented, together with the correlation of the phenotypes, remains the strongest evidence that these genetic alterations are functional, and that the Gly583Cys is a mutational change.</p><p>A more relevant question raised in this study is whether the plant sterol accumulation in hypertensive rat strains has significance in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Recent linkage mapping studies mapped hypertension QTLs to a number of chromosomal regions in SHR and SHRSP rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our FISH study assigned the <italic>STSL </italic>locus rat chromosome 6q12, a region where a cluster of blood pressure QTL with Lod score 4~6 has been reported to be present (M6MIT12-M6MIT3, 39 cM distance) in a New Zealand genetically hypertensive rat (GH rat) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. With respect to hypertension, although the SHR and SHRSP strains carry the Gly583Cys mutation, in extensive QTL mapping studies using these strains, no loci mapping to the rat <italic>STSL </italic>region have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In our study, the GH rat is neither sitosterolemic, nor has any nucleotide alteration at the <italic>STSL </italic>locus that would implicate this region as mutated. Thus we do not believe the <italic>STSL </italic>locus plays a role in determining blood pressure. However, it may play a significant role in modifying the pathophysiology.</p><p>Studies reported by different investigators have shown that a dietary intake of 10 % canola oil (as part of semi-purified diets) significantly shortened the life-span of SHRSP rats, with accumulation of phytosterols in plasma, red blood cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Lower red blood cell (RBC) membrane deformability, lower density of platelets, as well as a higher blood pressure were also observed, when compared to a SHRSP group fed with vegetable oils lower in phytosterols (10 % soybean oil <italic>vs. </italic>10% canola oil). Canola oil has a higher sitosterol content than soybean oil. In comparison, extensive studies on evaluation of high phytosterol diets in SD rats (non-sitosterolemic) have consistently shown to be safe without any adverse consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. These intriguing differences between SHRSP and SD rats may now be explained, at least in part, by presence of the Gly583Cys missense mutation in sterolin-1. The WKY rat also carries this mutation and a high dietary intake of phytosterols will also increase the blood pressure and decrease the density of platelets, though to a lower extent than that observed in SHRSP rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These data support a pathological role of elevated plant sterols in these rats and support the notion that the <italic>STSL </italic>loci evolved to not only allow for the excretion of cholesterol into bile, but also to keep 'xeno-sterols' from accumulating in the body. With respect to sitosterolemia in humans, although atherosclerotic complications have been well-described, hypertension has not been mentioned as feature. However, it is not known whether the atherosclerosis in sitosterolemic patients with hypertension is accelerated, relative to those affected individuals with lower blood pressures.</p><p>The Gly583Cys mutation in <italic>Abcg5</italic> is likely to have originated in the original outbred Wistar colony bred in Kyoto (from which WKY was subsequently derived), which has been widely employed as a normotensive control in experimental studies of hypertension. It gave rise to the SHR and SHRSP strains. Thus, this mutation in WKY, SHR and SHRSP lines may not contribute to the hypertension phenotype <italic>per se</italic>, but may only be responsible for sitosterolemia. The original Wistar colony was established at the Wistar Institute in 1906, and the Sprague Dawley colony was derived by Dawley in approximately 1925 from a single male of unknown origin and a Wistar female. The SHR strain was derived by selective inbreeding from the Kyoto outbred Wistar colony, and both SHR and SHRSP, as well as WKY strains have been maintained over many generations through brother-sister matings <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/tools/strains"/>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Healthy WKA and GH rat strains were also generated from outbred Wistar rat strains, but these strains were isolated independently in Japan and New Zealand, respectively (and maintained at other sites as well). The GH rat was selected for systolic hypertension that increased with successive generations and maintained through filial matings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In view of this, the Gly583Cys missense mutation of <italic>Abcg5</italic> might result from occurrence of a <italic>de novo </italic>mutation during breeding at the stage of developing inbred WKY strains and propagated into the SHR and SHRSP lines. In contrast, the 143 nucleotide fragment insertion polymorphism in the 3'-UTR of <italic>Abcg8 </italic>may have resulted from acquisition of a foreign chromosomal fragment during the Wistar rat strain breeding and established as homozygous change in the WKY, SHR and SHRSP, as well as GH rat strains. In this context, it is important to note that 3 other mutant loci have been reported in the SHR rat; missense mutations in the <italic>KAT-1 </italic>(kynurenine aminotransferase-1), <italic>Srebf-1 </italic>(sterol regulatory element binding factor-1) and <italic>CD36 </italic>(fatty acid translocase) are all present as homozygous changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The generation of congenic lines may assist with addressing many of these issues. Such lines will be useful in demonstrating that the variant sterolin-1 protein is responsible for causing sitosterolemia, but will allow comparisons between animals that are hypertensive and those that are hypertensive and sitosterolemic. Currently, there are no appropriate genetic controls available, as SHR, SHRSP and WKY are all maintained as colonies by brother-sister matings. While this manuscript was in review, Scoggan <italic>et al </italic>also reported identifying Gly583Cys alteration in <italic>Abcg5</italic> of SHR, SHRP and WKY rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Three rat strain, WKY, SHR and SHRSP, that are hypertensive are also sitosterolemic. All of these strains are homozygous mutant for Gly583Cys in sterolin-1, encoded by <italic>Abcg5</italic>. This mutation is not present in rats that were not sitosterolemic, even though one of these was hypertensive (the GH rat). The rat <italic>STSL </italic>locus, comprising of <italic>Abcg5 </italic>and <italic>Abcg8</italic>, maps to rat chromosome 6q12, a region syntenic with both mouse and human <italic>STSL </italic>loci. Preliminary antibody studies show that this mutant protein is expressed and appears to be apically targeted in the intestinal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HY conceived this study, HY, BP, and KL performed the molecular genetic studies, EK performed the real time PCR and the western blotting assays, M-HL performed the immunostaining, KH performed the FISH assay, RK and AB performed the sterol analyses, MS and NE performed the DNA isolations from the rats.
