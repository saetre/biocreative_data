We have recently shown that FimH, the adhesin portion of type 1 fimbria, can induce the innate immune system via TLR4. Here we report that FimH induces potent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> innate antimicrobial responses. FimH induced an innate antiviral state in murine macrophage and primary MEFs which was correlated with IFN-&#x003b2; production. Moreover, FimH induced the innate antiviral responses in cells from wild type, but not from MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, Trif<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, IFN&#x02212;&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or IRF3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Vaginal delivery of FimH, but not LPS, completely protected wild type, but not MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, IRF3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice from subsequent genital HSV-2 challenge. The FimH-induced innate antiviral immunity correlated with the production of IFN-&#x003b2;, but not IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3;. To examine whether FimH plays a role in innate immune induction in the context of a natural infection, the innate immune responses to wild type uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (UPEC) and a FimH null mutant were examined in the urinary tract of C57Bl/6 (B6) mice and TLR4-deficient mice. While UPEC expressing FimH induced a robust polymorphonuclear response in B6, but not TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, mutant bacteria lacking FimH did not. In addition, the presence of TLR4 was essential for innate control of and protection against UPEC. Our results demonstrate that FimH is a potent inducer of innate antimicrobial responses and signals differently, from that of LPS, via TLR4 at mucosal surfaces. Our studies suggest that FimH can potentially be used as an innate microbicide against mucosal pathogens.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The innate immune system is an evolutionarily conserved defence mechanism that protects the host from infection by microbes such as viruses, bacteria and fungi. Incoming pathogens are recognized by a set of evolutionary conserved receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), that can be found on the surface of epithelial cells at the mucosal surface. We recently found that FimH, a specific adhesin located at the tip of type 1 fimbriae in uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, binds directly to TLR4. Here, we demonstrate the biological significance of this interaction. In the context of a natural infection, recognition of FimH by TLR4 is important for the host to mount an innate immune response against uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>. Furthermore, we show that purified FimH protein induces a potent innate antiviral response, both in tissue culture and in animal models. This response is mediated predominantly by the production of type I interferon. Our results suggest that FimH is an excellent candidate for development as a microbicide against pathogen infection.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the early defence against microbial infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Biron1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Biron2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Ashkar1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Duerst1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Fawaz1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Matsuo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Examples of PAMPs include lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a ligand for TLR4), flagellin (a ligand for TLR5), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA, a ligand for TLR3), bacterial CpG DNA (a ligand for TLR9) and profillin (a ligand for TLR11). Upon ligand binding, TLRs initiate intracellular signalling through their cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 (TIR) domain. These signalling pathways can be divided into common (MyD88-dependent) and specific (MyD88-independent) categories. TLR2, 5, 7&#x02013;9 and 11 signalling is mainly MyD88-dependent, while TLR3 and 4 signalling is mediated through either MyD88 or Trif.</p><p>Recently, we and others have reported that CpG ODN/TLR9 signalling leads to the induction of potent innate protection against herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) infection both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Ashkar1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Ashkar3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Harandi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Pyles1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Sajic1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Bellocchio1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Local intravaginal (IVAG) delivery of CpG ODN or Poly I:C resulted in rapid proliferation and thickening of the vaginal epithelium and induction of a innate antiviral state that did not block virus entry but inhibited viral replication in vaginal epithelial cells. This TLR ligand-induced innate protection correlated with production of IFN-&#x003b2;, but not IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3; or TNF-&#x003b1;.

It is well documented that FimH adhesin of uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> type 1 fimbriae bind to mannose on epithelial cells. Blocking the mannose-binding portion of FimH with D-mannose had no effect on the FimH-induced innate antiviral activity. This suggested that FimH may bind to TLR4 independent of mannose to induce antiviral responses. We were unable to detect any IFN-&#x003b1; from FimH treated RAW264.7 or B6 MEFS by ELISA. This suggested that IFN-&#x003b2; is the key factor in the FimH-induced innate antiviral state. Given the importance of the transcription factor IRF3 in the production of IFN-&#x003b2; in fibroblast and epithelial cells, FimH also failed to induce IFN-&#x003b2; production from IRF-3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs and did not protect these cells against VSV.

Our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data clearly showed that the antiviral activity of FimH was not due to contamination with LPS. We have used all possible controls to confirm that FimH was responsible for the innate antiviral responses. First, control samples from bacteria that contained empty vector and processed in exactly the same manner as FimH had no antiviral activity assuring that the antiviral response seen with FimH is not due to low levels of LPS contamination. Second, both enzymatic digestion and heat inactivation of FimH protein significantly abrogated the activity of FimH protein <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. To also confirm that FimH, but not LPS, is responsible for <italic>in vivo</italic> innate antiviral responses, we performed several experiments. First; local delivery of LPS or digested/heat-inactivated FimH protein gave no protection against subsequent IVAG HSV-2 challenge in B6 mice compared to treatment with intact FimH protein. Second; local delivery of recombinant PapG protein, another adhesin of fimbriated bacteria which was prepared exactly with the same protocol as FimH, gave no protection against subsequent IVAG HSV-2 challenge in B6 mice compared to FimH. However, PapG protein had the same levels of LPS compared to FimH. In addition, our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments clearly showed that low levels of LPS present in our samples cannot provide any protection against viral infections. In addition we have shown that FimH can directly bind TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Mossman1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and un-published data). Furthermore, while FimH induced dramatic changes in genital mucosa, there was no difference in the histomorphology of the genital mucosa from LPS- or PBS-treated mice. More importantly, our recent data indicates that FimH signals in cells unresponsive to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Mossman1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and un-published data).</p><p>It is well known that FimH play an import role in attachment of bacteria to epithelial cells and contributes to pathogenecity of UPEC. Our data show that TLR4 is involved in FimH signalling with epithelial cells. FimH-expressing UPEC were able to induce recruitment of PMNs to the urinary tract of wild type mice, while isogenic bacteria lacking FimH did not. Interestingly, this response is controlled by TLR4 expression and is abolished when we used FimH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> UPEC, even in the presence of TLR4. These data are similar to the PMN response seen following infection with a type I fimbriated derivative of non-adhesive <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Fischer1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Because these UPEC strains share expression of another TLR4-activating PAMP (LPS), these data suggest that the dominant innate immune-activating PAMP on uropathogengic <italic>E. coli</italic> may in fact be FimH. In support of this, deletion of <italic>fimH</italic> resulted in decreased colonization of the bladder as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000233-Langermann1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> but the level of colonization by <italic>fimH<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> UPEC was similar in a B6 and TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background. These data suggest that FimH-independent signaling through TLR4 is not likely a major contributor to infection control in B6 mice.</p><p>This is the first report to show that FimH has potent innate antiviral activity which also requires TLR4, MyD88, Trif, IRF-3 and type 1 IFNs, particularly IFN-&#x003b2;. So far, TLR ligands such as dsRNA, ssRNA, and CpG DNA have been associated with the induction of innate antiviral immunity. Protein ligands of TLRs have not been associated with the induction of innate antiviral immunity. Here, however, we demonstrate that FimH, but not LPS, mediates innate antiviral activity at the genital mucosa. It is of particular interest that both TLR5 and TLR11 ligands signal via MyD88, whereas FimH protein signals through both MyD88 and Trif, leading to activation of the IRF-3 pathway. Results from this study may provide the basis for a novel mucosal innate microbicide for a vast variety of mucosal viral infections such as HSV-2, HIV-1 or other sexually transmitted infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>Female C57BL/6, 129SVPasCrl mice, 8&#x02013;12 weeks old, were purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Quebec, Canada).
