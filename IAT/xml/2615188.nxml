At fertilization in mammalian eggs, the sperm induces a series of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations via the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production appears to be triggered by a sperm-derived PLC&#x003b6; (phospholipase C-&#x003b6;) that enters the egg after gamete fusion. The specific phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolytic activity of PLC&#x003b6; implies that DAG (diacylglycerol) production, and hence PKC (protein kinase C) stimulation, also occurs during mammalian egg fertilization. Fertilization-mediated increase in PKC activity has been demonstrated; however, its precise role is unclear.</p><p><italic>Results</italic>. We investigated PLC&#x003b6;- and fertilization-mediated generation of DAG in mouse eggs by monitoring plasma-membrane translocation of a fluorescent DAG-specific reporter. Consistent plasma-membrane DAG formation at fertilization, or after injection of physiological concentrations of PLC&#x003b6;, was barely detectable. However, when PLC&#x003b6; is overexpressed in eggs, significant plasma-membrane DAG production occurs in concert with a series of unexpected secondary high-frequency Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. We show that these secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations can be mimicked in a variety of situations by the stimulation of PKC and that they can be prevented by PKC inhibition. The way PKC leads to secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations appears to involve Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the loading of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores.</p><p><italic>Conclusions</italic>. Our results suggest that overproduction of DAG in PLC&#x003b6;-injected eggs can lead to PKC-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and subsequent overloading of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. These results suggest that DAG generation in the plasma membrane of fertilizing mouse eggs is minimized since it can perturb egg Ca<sup>2+</sup> homoeostasis via excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>Ca<sup>2+</sup> store</kwd><kwd>diacylglycerol</kwd><kwd>egg activation</kwd><kwd>fertilization</kwd><kwd>protein kinase C</kwd><kwd>phospholipase C-&#x003b6; (PLC&#x003b6;)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>BAPTA, bis-(<italic>o</italic>-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;-tetra-acetic acid</kwd><kwd>CHE, chelerythrine chloride</kwd><kwd>cps, counts per seconds</kwd><kwd>DAG, diacylglycerol</kwd><kwd>fura 2/AM, fura 2 acetoxymethyl ester</kwd><kwd>GFP, green florescent protein</kwd><kwd>hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin</kwd><kwd>CCD camera, charge-coupled-device camera</kwd><kwd>IVF, <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization</kwd><kwd>ICCD camera, intensified CCD camera</kwd><kwd>PKC, protein kinase C</kwd><kwd>(m)PLC, (mouse) phospholipase C</kwd><kwd>PM/C ratio, plasma membrane/cytosol ratio</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During fertilization in mammalian eggs, the sperm stimulates a series of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations that is responsible for activating the egg (Stricker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1999</xref>; Miyazaki and Ito, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2006</xref>). These Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations stimulate calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which can trigger meiotic resumption and early development in mouse eggs (Madgwick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2005</xref>; Ducibella et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2006</xref>; Knott et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations at fertilization are triggered by the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which causes release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores (Miyazaki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">1993</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2006</xref>). The sperm appears to trigger the increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production at fertilization by introducing a sperm-specific PLC (phospholipase C) (PLC&#x003b6;) into the egg cytoplasm following sperm&#x02013;egg fusion (Saunders et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>; Knott et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2005</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2006</xref>; Miyazaki and Ito, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2006</xref>; Swann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2006</xref>). Since PLC&#x003b6; hydrolyses [PIP<sub>2</sub> (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate)], it generates both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG (diacylglycerol) in eggs (Kouchi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2004</xref>; Nomikos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2005</xref>). While many studies have reported Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in PLC&#x003b6;-injected eggs, there have been no investigations of PLC&#x003b6;-stimulated generation of DAG.</p><p>The main signalling target for DAG in cells is PKC (protein kinase C) (Nishizuka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">1992</xref>). It has been shown that PKC activity increases at fertilization in mouse eggs (Gallicano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1997</xref>; Tatone et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2003</xref>). Furthermore, mouse and rat eggs have been shown to express a number of different isoforms of PKC including the conventional &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; isoforms that are activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DAG, the novel isoform &#x003b4;, which is stimulated by DAG, and the atypical isoforms &#x003b6; and &#x003bb;, which are not stimulated by either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or DAG (Jones, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1998</xref>; Pauken and Capco, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2000</xref>; Baluch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2004</xref>; Halet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2004</xref>). The translocation of &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; isoforms to the egg cortex has been demonstrated after sperm&#x02013;egg interaction or after Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore-induced egg activation (Luria et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2000</xref>; Halet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2004</xref>). PKC&#x003b4; and PKC&#x003b6; are localized to the meiotic spindle and may play a role in spindle stability and progression through meiosis (Tatone et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2003</xref>; Viveiros et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2003</xref>; Baluch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2004</xref>). A role for PKC at fertilization is suggested by the finding that the potent PKC activator, PMA, can stimulate the initial stages of second polar body emission and trigger a degree of cortical granule exocytosis in mouse eggs (Gallicano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1997</xref>; Eliyahu and Shalgi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2002</xref>). PKC may also regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in eggs since some studies have shown that PMA causes small Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (Cuthbertson and Cobbold, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1985</xref>) and, more recently, it was shown that PMA can stimulate store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Halet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2004</xref>). However, the role of PKC activation at fertilization is unclear because while some inhibitors of PKC block events such as meiotic resumption, cortical granule exocytosis and transcription at the one-cell stage (Gallicano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1997</xref>; Yu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2007</xref>), other inhibitors are without any effect (Ducibella and Lefevre, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1997</xref>).</p><p>The dynamic translocation of PKCs to the plasma membrane of fertilizing mouse eggs was previously measured using GFP (green florescent protein)-tagged PKC&#x003b1; or PKC&#x003b3; (Halet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2004</xref>). It was shown that these PKC isoforms translocate to the plasma membrane with similar kinetics to the sperm-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases (Halet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2004</xref>). The translocation is transient and largely dependent on the amplitude of the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase, and was mainly driven by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent C2 domain of these conventional PKC isoforms. Here, we investigate DAG production and PKC activation in fertilizing, and PLC&#x003b6;-injected, mouse eggs using a fluorescent probe for DAG based on the tandem C1 domain of PKC&#x003b4; (C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP; Codazzi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2001</xref>; Dries et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2007</xref>). We find that minimal DAG production occurs in the plasma membrane at fertilization, or after physiological levels of PLC&#x003b6; injection, in mouse eggs. However, overproduction of DAG by high levels of PLC&#x003b6; can lead to excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and an unusual pattern of high-frequency Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP detects plasma-membrane DAG in mouse eggs</title><p>In a previous study, the C1 domain of conventional PKC&#x003b1; was used as a DAG biosensor in mouse eggs, but it failed to detect any DAG in the plasma membrane of fertilized eggs (Halet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2004</xref>). We re-investigated DAG synthesis in fertilized eggs using tandem C1 domain of PKC&#x003b4; (C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP), which is reported to have an affinity for DAG binding two orders of magnitude higher than the binding affinity of the C1 domain from PKC&#x003b1; (Dries et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>(A) shows that ionomycin treatment of unfertilized mouse eggs caused a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase and a delayed translocation of C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP to the plasma membrane, indicating DAG production. In contrast, the addition of 100&#x000a0;ng/ml PMA to eggs caused an immediate increase in C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP plasma-membrane translocation without any increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). These results show that C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP can effectively report DAG production at the plasma membrane in mouse egg, which is presumably due to the activity of endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive PLCs (Halet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2004</xref>). When we examined eggs at fertilization, we found that translocation of C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP to the plasma membrane was only just detectable in two eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), whereas in most of the eggs at fertilization (12/14) there was no evidence for translocation to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). In the two eggs that showed evidence of C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP translocation, this was restricted only to the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase at fertilization and tended to be evident in a restricted portion of the cortex. C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP did not show any clear localization in the meiotic spindle either before or after fertilization. These results suggest that there is very little DAG production in the plasma membrane of fertilizing mouse eggs in comparison with that seen with ionomycin.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>GFP-tagged PKC&#x003b4; C1 domain (C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP) translocation in mouse eggs</title><p>The translocation of C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP, indicating DAG accumulation, was measured as the plasma-membrane fluorescence divided by the bulk cytoplasmic fluorescence (PM/C ratio) (dotted line, labelled &#x02018;DAG&#x02019;). The fluorescence of Fura Red was monitored to indicate changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> (solid line, labelled &#x02018;Ca<sup>2+</sup>&#x02019;). Fura Red fluorescence decreases on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, so we inverted the fluorescence signal of Fura Red (at 488&#x000a0;nm excitation) to represent Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. The slight drift up in the trace with time was due to some loss of dye from the egg. The insets show example images of eggs taken at the time indicated by the arrows.

Increasing levels of mouse PLC&#x003b6; expression led to an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation frequency. However, when expression was higher than 10 cps (counts per seconds), Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations ceased prematurely, and the highest expression levels (20&#x02013;40 cps) were associated with an unexpected secondary series of high-frequency Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations that occurred with a delay of 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

Previous studies have suggested that pronuclear formation can regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by sequestering PLC&#x003b6; (Larman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2004</xref>). However, pronuclear formation or dissolution did not play any role in the pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in eggs overexpressing PLC&#x003b6;, because the basic phenomena of premature cessation and secondary oscillations were still seen in eggs that had been enucleated (results not shown). The cessation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations could occur because of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor down-regulation, since this can be induced by injection of agents such as the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor agonist, adenophostin, which causes a single series of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (Brind et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2000</xref>; Jellerette et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2000</xref>). The occurrence of secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, however, is not obviously explained by this down-regulation mechanism.</p><p>We then considered the possibility that DAG production and hence PKC stimulation could play a role in causing the secondary oscillations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows eggs that had been injected either with adenophostin, or with PLC&#x003b6; (corresponding to low levels of expression), or else fertilized <italic>in vitro</italic> by sperm.

However, when PMA was applied after the cessation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we found that most of the eggs underwent an extra series of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A&#x02013;4C</xref>).

The PKC inhibitor, CHE (chelerythrine chloride), has previously been shown to be an effective inhibitor of PKC activity in mouse eggs (Ducibella and Lefevre, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1997</xref>; Gallicano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> shows the effects of adding CHE to mouse eggs that were injected with PLC&#x003b6;. We found that the occurrence of PLC&#x003b6;-induced secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations was virtually abolished by treatment with CHE (0.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M). The results collected from almost 300 eggs showed that incubation with CHE reduced the occurrence of secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations from 37.8% (8/23) to 10.6% (5/47), and 85.7% (12/14) to 16.7% (3/18) in the PLC&#x003b6; expression ranges of 15&#x02013;30 and 30&#x02013;45 cps respectively.

The Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced quenching of fura 2 fluorescence has previously been used as a surrogate for monitoring the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into mouse eggs (McGuiness et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1996</xref>; Mohri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2001</xref>). To establish whether PKC activity stimulates bivalent cation influx, eggs were treated with 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml PMA for 1&#x000a0;h before the addition of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. The trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>(A) shows the quenching of fura 2 and indicates that PMA significantly stimulated the Mn<sup>2+</sup> influx rate (4.93&#x000b1;0.54 relative fluorescence units/s decrease, <italic>n</italic>=25 compared with the control eggs; 1.5&#x000b1;0.1 fluorescence units, <italic>n</italic>=19, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). In order to investigate whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was related to the occurrence of secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we used the same Mn<sup>2+</sup> quenching protocol at different time points in eggs injected with either adenophostin or high PLC&#x003b6; concentrations. We compared overexpression of PLC&#x003b6; with the effects of adenophostin injected, since adenophostin only causes a single set of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and it is not expected to cause significant DAG production since it generates moderate Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase compared with ionomycin (Brind et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2000</xref>; Jellerette et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2000</xref>). Eggs at 2 and 4&#x000a0;h after mPLC&#x003b6; (mouse PLC&#x003b6;) or adenophostin injection were loaded with fura 2 and then exposed to Mn<sup>2+</sup> for inducing fura 2 quenching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C). We chose the 2&#x000a0;h time point because all of the eggs should be completing the primary oscillations phase, whereas at 4&#x000a0;h the PLC&#x003b6;&#x02013;luc-injected eggs should be commencing the secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. At 2&#x000a0;h post-injection, the quenching rate (measured over 150&#x000a0;s) in both mPLC&#x003b6; (2.7&#x000b1;0.30, <italic>n</italic>=9) and adenophostin A (2.7&#x000b1;0.15, <italic>n</italic>=21) injected eggs were similar, but higher than that in control eggs (1.8&#x000b1;0.12, <italic>n</italic>=23). However, at 4&#x000a0;h after injection, the quenching rate became higher (3.54&#x000b1;0.39, <italic>n</italic>=11) in mPLC&#x003b6;&#x02013;luc-injected eggs, while it returned to control levels in adenophostin-injected eggs (2.1&#x000b1;0.2, <italic>n</italic>=15). These data support previous data on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in fertilizing mouse eggs (Halet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2004</xref>) and suggest that high PLC&#x003b6; expression differs from adenophostin in that there is a prolonged phase of increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Bivalent cation influx in mouse eggs in response to adenophostin, PLC&#x003b6; and PMA</title><p>Bivalent cation influx was measured by the quenching of fura 2 fluorescence by Mn<sup>2+</sup> (0.1&#x000a0;mM) that was added at the arrows for each sample trace.

However, the involvement of PLC&#x003b6; or any other PLCs will inevitably generate DAG and this has been less extensively studied for technical reasons. Here, we have used a GFP-linked probe with a high sensitivity and specificity for DAG. At fertilization, DAG synthesis in the plasma membrane was not consistently observed, and the signal detected was very small compared with the DAG increase elicited by ionomycin. Moreover, the transient increase in plasma-membrane DAG occurred solely during the first Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, which is consistent with a previous report showing that conventional PKC translocation to the plasma membrane of fertilized eggs is driven essentially by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding C2 domain (Halet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2004</xref>). Our results suggest that DAG accumulation in the plasma membrane of fertilized eggs is both relatively modest and short-lived. Since a very large Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase itself can be a stimulus for DAG production, some egg-derived plasma-membrane PLCs may be stimulated in eggs and this could be the PLC&#x003b2; isoforms (Igirashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2007</xref>).</p><p>As with fertilization, the expression of physiological levels of PLC&#x003b6; did not lead to any measurable increase in DAG in the plasma membrane. However, overexpression of PLC&#x003b6; resulted in the appearance of a delayed, second series of high-frequency Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations that was consistently associated with plasma-membrane DAG production. Since a gap of several hours separates the two series of oscillations, the eggs would have expressed a significant level of PLC&#x003b6; by that time, which may contribute to the increased DAG synthesis as a result of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced PLC&#x003b6; stimulation since PLC&#x003b6; is highly sensitive to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Kouchi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2004</xref>; Nomikos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2005</xref>). This may resemble the situation where inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was monitored in mouse eggs using a fluorescence indicator that could only detect inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate after a period that allowed for increased PLC&#x003b6; expression (Shirakawa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2006</xref>).</p><p>The secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations we describe in the present study have not been previously reported, because earlier studies injected PLC&#x003b6; RNA corresponding approximately to the amount contained in a single sperm (Saunders et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>; Miayzaki and Ito, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2006</xref>). The overexpression of PLC&#x003b6; is likely to lead to the down-regulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, which could then explain the early cessation of oscillations (Brind et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2000</xref>; Jellerette et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2000</xref>). However, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor down-regulation does not preclude further Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, because it has been shown that some sufficiently strong stimuli can still generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations after 70&#x02013;80% down-regulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (Malcuit et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2005</xref>). Our results suggest that PKC is important in providing the extra stimulus that re-stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, since PMA triggers a series of secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in eggs that would otherwise only generate a single series of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Furthermore, the PKC inhibitor, CHE, significantly inhibits the occurrence of secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in eggs injected with high concentrations of PLC&#x003b6;. This shows that PKC-stimulation is both necessary and sufficient to trigger the secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> release that occurs with high levels of PLC&#x003b6;.</p><p>It is remarkable that these dramatic effects of PKC can be inferred in the absence of any detectable DAG production in the plasma membrane of eggs during the time between the first and secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. It should be noted that in astrocytes the same C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP domain that we used in mouse eggs is very effective at reporting plasma-membrane DAG generation in response to metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated stimulation that activates PLC&#x003b2; (Codazzi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2001</xref>). Our inability to observe translocation of the C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP domain at fertilization, or during the period leading up to the secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations caused by excessive PLC&#x003b6; expression, is therefore unlikely to represent any deficiency in the affinity of the DAG probe. It is possible that any DAG increase is too gradual to be readily detected with a translocation-based indicator, or else DAG is localized differently in eggs compared with astrocytes.</p><p>Our results suggest that the mechanism by which PKC causes secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations appears to involve Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. We also found evidence for enhanced filling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores after PKC stimulation or overexpression of PLC&#x003b6;. It is possible that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the subsequent overloading of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores could trigger the secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, since the overloading of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores can lead to a &#x02018;spontaneous&#x02019; release in sea-urchin egg homogenates (Galione et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1993</xref>). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that PKC increases could also alter the sensitivity of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate such that Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is enhanced (Vermassen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2004</xref>). Whatever the mechanisms, our current findings imply that PKC overstimulation can have major negative effects on eggs when it causes an abnormal series of secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Similar to studies with human PLC&#x003b6;, we found that none of the eggs that expressed high levels of mouse PLC&#x003b6; developed to blastocyst stages even though they formed pronuclei (Yu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2008</xref>). This suggests that the stimulation of PKC in the plasma membrane has to be minimal at fertilization. Given the evidence that calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II can trigger meiotic resumption and early development, the role of PKC in egg activation has to be questioned (Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1998</xref>; Madgwick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2005</xref>; Knott et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>). It is possible that most of the increase in PKC activity that has been reported at fertilization is due to non-conventional and novel isoforms such as PKC&#x003b6; and PKC&#x003b4;, which are localized to the meiotic spindle in mature mouse eggs where they may play a permissive role in meiotic resumption (Tatone et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2003</xref>; Viveiros et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Gamete collection, RNA preparation and microinjection</title><p>MF1 female mice were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 7.5 i.u. of PMSG (pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin; Folligon) followed 48&#x000a0;h later by 10 i.u. of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin; Folligon) (Saunders et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>; Larman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2004</xref>).

The amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise elicited by thapsigargin, or the area under a line traced out by the elevated phase of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient were taken as measures of relative thapsigargin-releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content. Data were collected from at least three different replicates. Values cited are the means and S.E.M. A Student's <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the integral of Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises between injected eggs and control eggs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Tobias Meyer (Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, U.S.A.) for providing the plasmid encoding C1<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;&#x02013;GFP.
