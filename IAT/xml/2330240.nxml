In particular, the translation of maternal mRNAs is tightly controlled during oocyte maturation and early mitotic cycles in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. The Embryonic Deadenylation ElemeNt (EDEN) and its associated protein EDEN-BP are known to trigger deadenylation and translational silencing to several mRNAs bearing an EDEN. This <italic>Xenopus</italic> RNA-binding protein is an ortholog of the human protein CUG-BP1/CELF1. Five mRNAs, encoding cell cycle regulators and a protein involved in the notch pathway, have been identified as being deadenylated by EDEN/EDEN-BP. To identify new EDEN-BP targets, we immunoprecipitated EDEN-BP/mRNA complexes from <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> egg extracts. We identified 153 mRNAs as new binding targets for EDEN-BP using microarrays. Sequence analyses of the 3&#x02032; untranslated regions of the newly identified EDEN-BP targets reveal an enrichment in putative EDEN sequences. EDEN-BP binding to a subset of the targets was confirmed both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Among the newly identified targets, Cdk1, a key player of oocyte maturation and cell cycle progression, is specifically targeted by its 3&#x02032; UTR for an EDEN-BP-dependent deadenylation after fertilization.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression relies on specific interactions between mRNAs and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that could be either proteins or microRNA. Known binding sites for regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RNA-BPs) are usually short and degenerated sequences those provide insufficient information to allow a systematic bioinformatics screen to identify the target mRNAs. However, the definition of the RNA targets of a given RNA-BP is crucial for the global understanding of the posttranscriptional processes in which the protein is involved. In amphibians, oocyte growth enables a single cell to contain the information required for the first 12 mitotic cycles and it is even sufficient to allow parthenogenetic development if centrosomes are provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Notably, after an initial accumulation of the so-called maternal mRNAs in the growing oocyte, transcription ceases and the oocyte is blocked in prophase of the first meiotic division (stage VI oocyte). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, upon hormonal treatment, meiosis resumes and a matured oocyte blocked in metaphase of the second meiotic division is laid that can be fertilized to allow zygotic mitosis. Transcription only resumes after the 12th cell cycle. This emphasizes the requirement for posttranscriptional regulation in the period from a stage VI oocyte to the 12th cell cycle.</p><p>From the hormonal activation of stage VI oocytes to the onset of transcription in the 4000 cell embryo, a cascade of translational regulatory mechanisms takes place that allows meiosis and early zygotic mitosis to occur in a coordinated manner [for a review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>)]. Posttranscriptional mechanisms involve both global translational inhibition mechanisms as well as mechanisms targeting specific mRNAs for translation or translational silencing at specific time during oogenesis or development. Among the mechanisms involved, the deadenylation targeted by the Embryonic Deadenylation ElemeNt Binding Protein (EDEN-BP) ensures the silencing of c-Mos and Aurora A translation after fertilization by binding to the EDEN motif in their 3&#x02032; UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition to its role in very early development, EDEN-BP is required for the metamerization of the somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) by regulating the accumulation of <italic>Xenopus</italic> suppressor of hairless mRNA. CUG-BP1/CELF1, the mammalian ortholog of EDEN-BP can regulate both alternative splicing and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Recently, analysis of CUG-BP1/CELF1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice indicated that CUG-BP1/CELF1 is globally required for the viability of the animals and, more specifically for spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, no known CUG-BP1/CELF1 or EDEN-BP target can explain these observed phenotypes.</p><p>So far the various analyses of potential substrates for the EDEN/EDEN-BP-dependent deadenylation pathway have identified five mRNAs as EDEN-BP target: Aurora A/(Eg2), c-Mos, the kinesin-like Eg5, Cdk2/(Eg1) and Xsu(H); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) the former four having been selected on their deadenylation behavior and the latter by its ability to bind EDEN-BP in UV-induced crosslinking experiments. The proteins encoded by three of these mRNAs (Aurora A, c-Mos and Cdk2) are known cell cycle regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). Recently, an <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of artificial CUG-BP1/CELF1 RNA ligand was performed and indicated that CUG-BP1/CELF1 binding sites could be represented as the occurrence of five UGU trinucleotides in a 35 nt window. However, such a motif is commonly represented in the genome and is of little predictive value. In the present work we used a combination of RNA&#x02013;protein complex immunopurification (IP) and hybridization of copurified mRNA onto microarrays, to identify new EDEN-BP targets solely on the base of EDEN-BP binding.</p><p>To our knowledge this is the first identification on a large scale of mRNA targets of a RNA-BP involved in the early <italic>Xenopus</italic> development. Among the 158 EDEN-BP targeted mRNAs, we identified an overrepresented cluster of unfertilized egg (UFE) maternal mRNAs involved in the meiotic process of oocyte maturation. As EDEN-BP activity is turned on at, or just after, fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), the presence of this cluster suggests that EDEN-BP may be part of a mechanistic switch from &#x02018;meiosis to mitosis&#x02019; or from &#x02018;oogenesis to early development&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Microarray design</title><p>A set of 3000 50mer oligonucleotides was designed from 2898 <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> gene sequences and spotted in duplicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).

We could unambiguously match 1954 JGI predicted transcripts to at least one of our 3000 oligos. By comparing the predicted ORF and transcripts we extracted 7474 3&#x02032; UTR (UTR_xt); 1236 of the transcripts represented on the microarray contained identified 3&#x02032; UTR (UTR_array). The 158 EDEN-BP target mRNA identified in our work are represented by 108 predicted transcripts and 95 3&#x02032; UTRs (UTR_target). Two control dataset were derived from the UTR_target dataset. UTR_Target_Rev is the reverse complement of the UTR_target dataset (revseq, EMBOSS suite), this dataset does not retain the nucleotide composition. The UTR_Target_Shuffle dataset is derived from UTR_Target by shuffling (shuffleseq, EMBOSS suite) the sequences retain the nucleotide composition of each sequence.

A dye swap was performed for the second experiment (second female). For each sample, hybridization was performed in duplicate. Data were analyzed by SAM algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) to detect mRNAs selectively enriched in each IP experiments compared with the control IgG experiment. SAM for experiment 1 identified 307 mRNAs specifically overrepresented in the antiEDEN-BP eluates. SAM for experiment 2 identified 336 mRNAs specifically overrepresented in the antiEDEN-BP eluates. Comparing the two dye swap experiments, 162 oligo hits corresponding to 158 different mRNAs were found to be selectively associated with the endogenous EDEN-BP in all four IP experiments (Supplementary Data S4 for the SAM scores and S5 for the annotations of the oligonucleotides).

To ensure the relevance of the EDEN15 motif, we searched for EDEN15 motif in the UTR_target dataset after shuffling it (UTR_Target_shuffle) or using the reverse complement strands (UTR_Target_Rev). We found that no overrepresentation of EDEN15 motif was detected in these datasets when compared with Utr_array. These analyses showed that the EDEN15 motif is clearly overrepresented in the 3&#x02032; UTR of the target mRNAs identified with &#x0223c;90% of the 3&#x02032; UTR harboring an EDEN15 motif with a score above 70%.</p><p>As an additional control, we generated a random 15 nt motif with the same base composition as the EDEN15 motif but devoid of any UGU in its consensus.

No specific EDEN15 motif enrichment could be observed in these two 3&#x02032; UTR populations when compared with the control dataset (Supplementary Data S6). This indicates that the population of RNA purified during one experiment certainly consists of a population directly bound to the EDEN-BP protein and another population probably representative of background signals.

We picked eight new EDEN-BP targets for which the 3&#x02032; UTR sequences could be determined that were representatives of the range of enrichment observed in our experiments and with various predicted adenylation profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). We also analyzed the previously identified target Eg1/Cdk2. Using the EDEN15 motif we localized the potential EDEN-BP binding site in these mRNAs 3&#x02032; UTRs; the match score for the identified motif ranged from 67 to 90% of the maximum match score. Selected portions of candidates 3&#x02032; UTRs centered on the EDEN15 motifs were amplified by RT-PCR with the incorporation of a T7 promoter. Radiolabeled RNAs (&#x0003c;200-nt long) from these templates were incubated with recombinant EDEN-BP and complex formation was analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B (left panel) two complexes (denoted C1 and C2) were sequentially formed when increasing concentrations of EDEN-BP were added to the incubation mix. The two complexes are compatible with the multimerization of EDEN-BP on its target that has already been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). When the same experiment is conducted with 3&#x02032; Eg5C6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, right panel), a mutated EDEN where a 6 nt substitution in the UGU motifs makes it unable to bind EDEN-BP in UV-crosslinking assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), complex C1 is formed but only at higher concentration of recombinant protein and complex C2 is only detectable at the maximum concentration of recombinant protein used (1.25 &#x000b5;M). For all the EDEN-BP target tested, the affinity of EDEN-BP for the RNAs was estimated from the concentration of protein that bound 50% of the RNA probe. Because more than one complex could form on the RNAs this value represents a good indication of the binding affinity for EDEN-BP and is termed here apparent <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>.

These experiments confirmed, therefore, that the identified mRNAs contain a motif able to specifically bind EDEN-BP. Interestingly, when cold-specific competitor is added one can observe the enhancement of a radioactive signal migrating slightly above EDENBP for some RNA (Lmo4, Cdk2, CPEB and ZMPste 24). This suggests that competitive binding between EDEN-BP and another RNA-BP may occur on these RNA.</p><p>These results show that the tested RNAs bind both recombinant and endogenous EDEN-BP.

As can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, 2 h after injection, both the reporter with the Cdk1 3&#x02032; UTR (ORF-Cdk1) and the reporter with the Aurora A 3&#x02032; UTR region (ORF-AurA) have accumulated as deadenylated mRNAs. It is clear that Cdk1 3&#x02032; UTR targets a reporter RNA for rapid deadenylation with kinetics similar to those observed for Aurora A, a known target of EDEN-BP-dependent deadenylation. It was previously showed that coinjection of &#x003b1;E2 antibodies specifically inhibited EDEN-BP-dependent deadenylation on a reporter RNA containing an EDEN sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Therefore, to verify that the 3&#x02032; UTR of Cdk1 was targeting the mRNA for EDEN-BP-dependent deadenylation, we coinjected the ORF-Cdk1 reporter RNA with either purified antiEDEN-BP antibodies (&#x003b1;E2) or control IgG. While ORF-Cdk1 is deadenylated by 2 h postinjection in presence of control IgG, the immunoneutralization of EDEN-BP led to a complete inhibition of deadenylation with no accumulation of poly(A)<sup>&#x02212;</sup> reporter RNA by 4 h postinjection. These experiments clearly demonstrate that Cdk1 mRNA, that is among the newly identified binding target for EDEN-BP, is specifically deadenylated by an EDEN-BP-dependent mechanism. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Cdk1 3&#x02032; UTR target a reporter mRNA for EDEN-BP-dependent deadenylation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos.

Among the newly identified target, xLMO4, a maternally expressed member of the LIM-domain-only protein family was independently shown to bind CUG-BP1/EDEN-BP in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Interestingly, when we analyzed the <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> LMO4 3&#x02032; UTR that is highly conserved with the human LMO4 3&#x02032; UTR, the EDEN15 motif could be detected with a best match score of 90%. This suggests that the binding of CUG-BP1/EDENBP to LMO4 3&#x02032; UTR is conserved from <italic>Xenopus</italic> to human. Furthermore, we showed that a small region of xtLMO4 was bound to CUG-BP1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). This region corresponds to the region independently identified as binding CUG-BP1/EDEN-BP in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>Among the mRNAs copurified with EDEN-BP, those encoding proteins involved in cell cycle control or oocyte maturation are common when compared with the functional categories of the gene products represented on the array; in particular, Aurora A(Eg2), Aurora B, CPEB, c-Mos, Cdk1, Cdk2(Eg1), casein Kinase 2 beta, Bub 3, Wee1, MELK(Eg3), Eg5/KLP and NEK2B are among the mRNAs recovered in our screen. Interestingly, an analysis of the expression profiles of these mRNAs, based on EST representation, indicated that the majority of these mRNAs (Aurora A(Eg2), Aurora B, CPEB, c-Mos, Cdk2(Eg1), Bub 3, Wee1A, MELK(Eg3), Eg5/KLP and NEK2B) are mainly restricted to the germline and expression levels are usually low throughout development. This could indicate that binding of EDEN-BP to these mRNAs contribute to their low expression levels after fertilization. For example, CPEB protein is degraded during oocyte maturation with only 25% of the protein present in stage VI oocytes remaining after maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Destruction of CPEB is required for meiotic progression and expression of a stable form of CPEB in embryos blocks cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Another intriguing observation comes from the simultaneous presence of EDEN motifs in both Cdk1 and Cdk2. The amount of the proteins encoded by these mRNAs increases during oocyte maturation and then remain constant after fertilization and until the MBT while their mRNAs are not translated as observed by S35 labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). During the cleavage stage, Cdk2 is apparently in limiting amount compared with cyclin E levels until the MBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Hence, the presence of the EDEN motif in the Cdk2 3&#x02032; UTR would reduce the translation of this mRNA and, therefore, assist or even cause the maintenance of the balance between Cdk2 and cyclin E. Here, we demonstrated that Cdk1 3&#x02032; UTR is a new binding target for EDEN-BP and that EDEN-BP activity is required for the rapid deadenylation driven by the Cdk1 3&#x02032; UTR. It is therefore likely that EDEN-BP acts as a translational repressor on both Cdk1 and Cdk2. As Ueno and Sagata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) presented evidence that, in the case of c-Mos, the ability of EDEN to trigger translational silencing and deadenylation was potentiated by AUUUA tetranucleotides, it must be noted that the Cdk1 3&#x02032; UTR is devoid of any AUUUA but contain some AU element located 3&#x02032; of the EDEN. These observations reinforce the hypothesis that the presence of an EDEN motif may be part of a mechanism to ensure a limited expression of some important cell cycle regulators in the cleavage stage embryos. EDEN-BP protein is maternally expressed but is activated only after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). This particularity may ensure that mRNAs containing EDEN motifs are translationally repressed either to inhibit the overaccumulation of stable protein encoded by maternal mRNAs and required for early development, or to ensure reduced expression of proteins that are unstable and mainly required during oocyte maturation (such as c-Mos or CPEB).</p><p>This does not mean that all the mRNAs identified are rapidly deadenylated after fertilization. Posttranscriptional processes are the results of a complex interplay between RNA-BP with different affinity and different activity. Notably some of the newly identified binding targets, such as xFRL1, are actually polyadenylated after fertilization and their encoded protein accumulates only after fertilization [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and data not shown]. Whether EDEN-BP is implicated in this polyadenylation possibly by associating with different partners or other sequences specify the postfertilization polyadenylation of xFRL1 requires further study.</p><p>The SELEX information used to build a model for the EDEN motif is coroborated by the enrichment of this motif in the population of mRNA coimmunoprecipitated with antiEDEN-BP antibodies. Furthermore, earlier experiments [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and data not shown] indicated that while a synthetic (UGUA)<sub>4</sub> RNA was able to efficiently crosslink EDEN-BP in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts, an (UAUG)<sub>4</sub> motif was not. As defined by the scoring matrix, the best score for the (UGUA)<sub>4</sub> motif is 84% (420/495) while it is only 63% (313/495) for the (UAUG)<sub>4</sub>. Interestingly, it was recently reported that Maskin and Cyclin B1 3&#x02032; UTR bind EDEN-BP in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). We found that the EDEN15 motif was present in the 3&#x02032; UTR of these mRNAs (Cyclin B1 (NM_001088495), Maskin (NM_001088495) with a match score of 74 and 83%, respectively.</p><p>The EDEN15 motif with a score of at least 70% is found in the 3&#x02032; UTR of &#x0003e;90% the coimmunoprecipitated RNA. When a subset of the newly identified targets was analyzed for <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding to EDEN-BP, the localization of the EDEN motif was realized solely on the base of the best EDEN15 motif in the 3&#x02032; UTR and all the tested RNA were effectively associated to EDEN-BP in our assays. Alternatively, and as has been shown for CUG-BP1, binding sites may be located not only in the 3&#x02032; UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) but also in the introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), or the 5&#x02032; UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). It is therefore possible that some mRNAs are actually associated to EDEN-BP by intronic sites. However, this is very unlikely in the context of this study as there is no ongoing transcription at the stages studied and therefore no pre-mRNA should be present. It is also possible that EDEN-BP is associated to mRNA by sites located in the 5&#x02032; UTR, but this region being poorly annotated, the analysis of the 5&#x02032; UTR is restricted to a very small number of sequences.</p><p>Some mRNAs may be enriched in the immunoprecipitated pool due to their association in a RNP complex containing EDEN-BP and other RNA-BPs that specifically bind to the RNA so that the contribution of EDEN binding motif is only weak or even absent. Such a situation has already been described for the mRNAs that bind both Pumilio-2 (Pum-2) and deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). However, as the tested RNAs bind EDEN-BP both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we think that this will be a minor contribution to the pool of 158 maternal mRNAs selected with both antibodies.</p><p>We have identified 158 mRNAs as binding targets for the endogenous EDEN-BP protein.

EMSA experiments with recombinant EDEN-BP and UV-crosslinking experiments with egg extract indicates that all the tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) potential EDEN containing RNAs can bind endogenous EDEN-BP. We have therefore identified on a large-scale targets for a RNA-BP known for its role in controlling specifically mRNA translation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Cdk1 3&#x02032; UTR, one of the newly identified target is rapidly and specifically deadenylated by and EDEN-BP-dependent mechanism. It would be of interest to determine to what extent the binding of EDEN-BP controls the translation of the newly identified targets by comparing large-scale polysomal analyses in native conditions and when EDEN-BP is knocked down.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by the Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer (ARC 4791), Ligue Contre le Cancer (comit&#x000e9; d&#x02019;Ille et Vilaine), the French Minist&#x000e8;re de la Recherche (ACI BCMS 369) and the R&#x000e9;gion Bretagne (PRIR&#x02013;560&#x02013;412).
