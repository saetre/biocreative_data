Receptor-mediated uptake of these particles is dependent upon prior association with apolipoprotein E (apoE-VLDL) and is brought about by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) in some cell types and by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) in others. Although LRP's role in apoE-VLDL uptake has been well studied, the identity of the HSPG family member that mediates apoE-VLDL uptake has not been established. We investigated if syndecan-1 (Syn-1), a transmembrane cell surface HSPG, is able to mediate the internalization of apoE-VLDL and examined the relationship between Syn-1 and LRP toward apoE-VLDL uptake. For this study, we used a human fibroblast cell line (GM00701) that expresses large amounts of LRP, but possesses no LDL receptor activity to eliminate its contributions toward apoE-VLDL uptake.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Although LRP in these cells is fully active as established by substantial &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>macroglobulin binding and internalization, uptake of apoE-VLDL is absent. Expression of human Syn-1 cDNA restored apoE-VLDL binding and uptake by these cells. Competition for this uptake with an LRP ligand-binding antagonist had little or no effect, whereas co-incubation with heparin abolished apoE-VLDL internalization. Depleting Syn-1 expressing cells of K<sup>+</sup>, to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis, showed no inhibition of Syn-1 internalization of apoE-VLDL. By contrast, treatment of cells with nystatin to inhibit lipid raft function, prevented the uptake of apoE-VLDL by Syn-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data demonstrate that Syn-1 is able to mediate apoE-VLDL uptake in human fibroblasts with little or no contribution from LRP and that the endocytic path taken by Syn-1 is clathrin-independent and relies upon lipid raft function. These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating Syn-1 association with lipid raft domains.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Fatty acids, triacylglycerols, and cholesterol in plasma originate primarily from two sources; dietary intake and that which is synthesized and secreted by hepatocytes. Dietary lipids circulate in the form of chylomicrons which are synthesized by intestinal epithelial cells. They are relatively short lived particles during the postprandial period as they are rapidly metabolized to remnant lipoproteins and cleared from the circulation primarily by hepatocytes. By contrast, the liver synthesizes triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins in the form of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles which are much longer-lived fatty acid carriers than remnant lipoproteins. Because of this, VLDL particles provide the largest single source of fatty acids for peripheral tissues found in the circulation. These fatty acids are a rich energy source for cells with high metabolic rates and are also stored by adipose tissue for mobilization during periods of fasting. Previous studies have also shown that VLDL is highly atherogenic since excessive uptake of these lipoproteins by macrophages causes massive cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Moreover, elevated levels of VLDL are found in the plasma of patients with type III hyperlipoproteinemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It follows from these observations that cardiovascular health requires controlled levels of VLDL particles in the circulation, whether by decreased synthesis or increased uptake.</p><p>Considerable evidence has been presented suggesting that the mechanism for VLDL particle clearance involves cell surface binding and endocytic activities of either heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] or the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], or both receptors acting in a synergistic manner at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Receptor-mediated association of VLDL with the cell surface also requires enrichment of the particle with apolipoprotein E (apoE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Evidence supporting a role for LRP in apoE-VLDL uptake has been gathered by blocking LRP's endocytic function with a ligand binding antagonist or by tissue-specific gene ablation, both of which result in increased circulating levels of VLDL particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. HSPG-mediated internalization of apoE-VLDL has been reported in several independent cell culture systems including fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], HepG2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In each of these cell types, a significant reduction in apoE-VLDL internalization was demonstrated following the inhibition of HSPG activity either through a coincubation with heparin or heparinase treatment prior to ligand binding. Moreover, intravenous administration of heparinase into the portal circulation reduced hepatocyte-mediated VLDL uptake by 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Notably, in contrast to the studies examining LRP's role in apoE-VLDL clearance, studies on HSPG report that a coincubation of labeled apoE-VLDL with an LRP ligand binding antagonist showed minimal effects on lipoprotein uptake indicating little or no participation by this receptor. These results have created controversy as to the identity of the receptor used by VLDL particles for endocytic clearance. To distinguish which path, HSPG or LRP, serves as the primary uptake mechanism for apoE-VLDL, we have recently re-examined apoE-VLDL endocytosis following the inhibition of HSPG maturation using reagents that prevent glycosaminoglycan chain addition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this study, we showed that apoE-VLDL uptake occurs primarily through an HSPG-mediated process with little or no contributions from LRP.</p><p>Identifying the HSPG that mediates apoE-VLDL clearance has been elusive. Specific HSPG, like those of the syndecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], glypican [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and perlecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] families, have primarily been studied in the context of their abilities to modulate growth factor responses. Although, syndecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and perlecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] have been shown to internalize modified LDL, little information is available identifying the HSPG responsible for apoE-VLDL uptake. Syndecan-1 (Syn-1) was recently shown to colocalize with chylomicron remnants at the surface of hepatocytes suggesting that it may participate in the endocytic clearance of dietary lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the present study, we investigated if Syn-1 is capable of mediating apoE-VLDL uptake and examined its functional relationship with LRP in lipoprotein handling at the cell surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To determine if Syn-1 is capable of endocytic uptake of apoE-VLDL and to examine the relationship between Syn-1 and LRP toward apoE-VLDL clearance, we searched for a cell line that 1) expresses no detectable Syn-1 to permit transfection studies with human Syn-1, 2) expresses high levels of LRP to permit accurate and reliable measurements of its endocytic properties, and 3) expresses no LDL receptor activity to remove its contribution toward apoE-VLDL binding and clearance that might complicate our measurements of Syn-1 and LRP activities. Our search led us to the GM00701 human cell line which was obtained from a patient diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia and expresses LDL receptors with &#x0003c; 1% of normal activity. We compared LRP expression in this cell line to other cell lines known to express this receptor, including human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], mouse pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and human HT1080 fibrosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. By semi-quantitative immunoblot analysis, we found that the GM00701 cells express more LRP than other cultured cells previously used to study LRP's cellular activities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Interestingly, the relative molecular mass of LRP's light chain (~95 kDa) is slightly smaller in the cultured cell lines as compared to liver tissue, which is the <italic>in vivo </italic>location for the highest level of LRP expression. This is likely due to post-translational processing since no alternatively spliced transcripts for LRP have been reported.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of LRP expression in various cell lines</bold>.

To test this assumption, GM00701 cells were incubated at 4&#x000b0;C with <sup>125</sup>I-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>M in the absence or presence of unlabeled &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>M or the LRP ligand binding antagonist, receptor associated protein (RAP).

To accomplish this, we isolated VLDL particles from plasma obtained from New Zealand White rabbits maintained on a high fat, high cholesterol diet. Prior to radiolabeling, the VLDL preparation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining to confirm that these particles contain the expected apolipoproteins, B100 and E. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> (inset), the purified VLDL particles do indeed contain apoB100 (Mr, 512 kD) and apoE (Mr, 34 kD) indicating that they have the proper associated proteins necessary for efficient receptor binding and internalization. When GM00701 cells were incubated at 4&#x000b0;C with <sup>125</sup>I-apoE-VLDL, we found little or no specific binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) indicating that these cells are incapable of binding apoE-VLDL in spite of the presence of endocytically active LRP. Cell surface binding activity of our <sup>125</sup>I-apoE-VLDL preparation was confirmed by high level specific binding to mouse pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The inability of GM00701 fibroblasts to bind <sup>125</sup>I-apoE-VLDL and the lack of Syn-1 expression as determined by immunoblot and RT-PCR analysis (data not shown), established these cells as a viable model for us to investigate the functional relationship between Syn-1 and LRP toward apoE-VLDL binding and clearance. Toward this end, we constructed a mammalian expression vector containing the full length human Syn-1 cDNA (pMH/Syn-1-HA) and carried out transient transfection studies with GM00701 cells. Immunoblot analysis of cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 1) showed no endogenous expression of Syn-1. By contrast, cells transfected with pMH/Syn-1-HA (lane 2) demonstrated efficient Syn-1 expression (Mr ~77kDa). The 77 kDa protein identified by immunoblotting represents the core protein of Syn-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Mature Syn-1 demonstrates a relative molecular mass of &#x0003e; 250 kD as a result of its multiple glycosaminoglycan additions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of syndecan-1 in GM00701 cells</bold>. (A) GM00701 cells were transfected with pMH alone (lane 1) or pMH/Syn-1-HA (lane 2). Forty eight hours after transfection, total protein was extracted from cells with 1% Triton X-100 and equal amounts of protein (20 &#x003bc;g/lane) were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane and immunoblotted with anti-Syn-1 polyclonal antisera (1:1000) that was raised against a recombinant his-tagged fusion protein representing full length human Syn-1. Chemiluminescence detection was used to visualize bound antibodies. (B) GM00701 cells were transfected with pMH/Syn-1-HA and cells were selected that stably express Syn-1 (GM00701/Syn-1-HA). Cells were incubated with either TBS (lane 1), 8 M urea (lane 2), or 1% Triton X-100 (lane 3).

Asterisks indicate the 77 kD, non-glycosylated Syn-1 core protein [36, 37].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-511X-5-23-3"/></fig><p>In order to confirm proper maturation of Syn-1 in transfected cells as defined by heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan addition, we transfected GM00701 cells with pMH/Syn-1-HA vector and enriched for those cells stably expressing Syn-1 using antibiotic selection. We then immunoblotted protein extracts from GM00701/Syn-1-HA cells prepared with 8 M urea. Urea extraction is often necessary to release mature Syn-1 from cytoskeletal interactions that are resistant to mild detergents such as Triton X-100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, a high molecular mass protein (Mr, &#x0003e; 250 kD) was identified by anti-Syn-1 antibodies following urea extraction (lane 2), but not after extraction with Triton X-100 (lane 3). As expected, treatment with Tris-buffered saline was unable to extract Syn-1 from cells (lane 1) since Syn-1 is an integral membrane protein.</p><p>To verify that the large molecular mass change in Syn-1 as seen by immunoblotting is due to heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan addition, we investigated the effect of heparinase treatment on the electrophoretic mobility of Syn-1 from GM00701/Syn-1-HA cells. Without heparinase treatment, mature Syn-1 migrated to its expected relative molecular mass of &#x0003e; 250 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lane 1). With heparinase treatment, a significant increase in Syn-1 core protein (Mr, 77 kDa) was observed that directly corresponded to a decrease in mature Syn-1 (Mr, &#x0003e; 250 kDa) (lane 2). We interpret these data to indicate that mature Syn-1 expressed by GM00701/Syn-1-HA cells contains heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains and undergoes normal post-translational modifications.</p><p>Since GM00701 cells are unable to bind apoE-VLDL even with high expression levels of LRP, we next asked if introducing Syn-1 expression is able to rescue apoE-VLDL uptake by these cells. To address this, GM00701 and GM00701/Syn-1-HA cells were incubated with DiI-labeled apoE-VLDL at 37&#x000b0;C and examined by fluorescence microscopy for uptake of the labeled ligand. Consistent with the results we obtained in 4&#x000b0;C binding studies with <sup>125</sup>I-apoE-VLDL, GM00701 cells were unable to bind or internalize DiI-apoE-VLDL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel C). However, GM00701/Syn-1-HA cells were able to readily take up DiI-apoE-VLDL as evidenced by labeled apoE-VLDL within intracellular vesicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel D). These data clearly show that expression of Syn-1 rescues apoE-VLDL internalization by these cells. To measure the increase in apoE-VLDL binding resulting from Syn-1 expression, we incubated GM00701 and GM00701/Syn-1-HA cells with <sup>125</sup>I-apoE-VLDL at 4&#x000b0;C in the absence or presence of unlabeled apoE-VLDL and quantitated specific ligand binding.

To address this question, we incubated GM00701/Syn-1-HA cells with DiI-apoE-VLDL in the absence or presence of either RAP-GST (to block LRP function) or heparin (to block Syn-1 function) and visualized ligand uptake by fluorescence microscopy following a 37&#x000b0;C incubation. RAP is known to prevent the binding of all ligands to LRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], including VLDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and has proven invaluable as a pharmacological antagonist for characterizing LRP's ligand binding and uptake properties.

These data now raise important questions as to the endocytic pathway used for internalization. LRP, like other members of the LDL receptor family, contains the clathrin-mediated internalization signal, NPXY amino acid sequence in their cytoplasmic tails. However, transmembrane HSPG such as Syn-1 do not contain this sequence and are likely internalized by cells through a non-clathrin mediated pathway. Previous studies have shown that antibody induced clustering of cell surface Syn-1 promotes its association with detergent-insoluble lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, cholesterol depletion of cells prevented Syn-1 from associating with these lipid rafts. Together, these observations suggest a role for non-clathrin-mediated pathways for Syn-1 internalization. To examine the pathway taken by Syn-1 for the internalization of apoE-VLDL, we measured uptake of <sup>125</sup>I-apoE-VLDL and <sup>125</sup>I-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>M by GM00701/Syn-1-HA cells under conditions of K<sup>+ </sup>depletion.

In the present study, we now explore if Syn-1 represents a class of HSPG that is able to provide a path for apoE-VLDL binding and internalization, and investigate its relationship with LRP in this function. Using GM00701 cells, a human fibroblast cell line that expresses abundant amounts of LRP and no detectable Syn-1, we show that these cells are unable to bind or internalize apoE-VLDL even with active LRP receptor function, which was confirmed by &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>M binding and degradation. However, apoE-VLDL binding and internalization by these cells was rescued following the introduction of stable Syn-1 expression indicating that this HSPG is fully capable of mediating lipoprotein binding and uptake. We also show that apoE-VLDL internalization by the transfected cells is blocked by heparin co-incubation, but unaffected by a LRP ligand binding antagonist demonstrating that Syn-1 mediates uptake in an LRP-independent manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a member of the syndecan family of HSPG serving as a clearance receptor for apoE-VLDL particles.</p><p>A previous study by Fuki, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], demonstrated that Syn-1 internalizes lipoprotein lipase-enriched LDL through a pathway that is distinct from clathrin coated pits and that internalization proceeds after clustering Syn-1 with a multivalent ligand. Since LRP apparently plays little role in the uptake of apoE-VLDL in GM00701 cells, we examined if internalization of apoE-VLDL by Syn-1 occurs through a clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent pathway. We found that K<sup>+ </sup>depletion significantly inhibited &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>M uptake, which internalizes via LRP through a clathrin-mediated pathway, but uptake of apoE-VLDL was unaffected by this treatment. By contrast, treatment of cells with nystatin, which disrupts lipid raft function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], prevented apoE-VLDL uptake by Syn-1 indicating that Syn-1-mediated clearance of apoE-VLDL proceeds through a non-clathrin pathway. This conclusion is also consistent with the fact that the cytoplasmic tail of Syn-1 does not contain the clathrin-mediated internalization signal sequence (NPXY). Additional evidence for non-clathrin-mediated internalization for Syn-1 was obtained through studies using a chimeric receptor consisting of the ectodomain of the Fc receptor Ia linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of Syn-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Upon clustering this chimera with IgG, it was found to redistribute into detergent insoluble lipid rafts. Pretreatment of cells with cholesterol depleting reagents prevented detergent insolubility of the Fc-Syn-1 chimera upon clustering and inhibited its internalization. From these data it appears that the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail sequences of Syn-1 are sufficient for partitioning the receptor into lipid raft domains. Recently, it was shown that Syn-4 also redistributes into lipid rafts upon clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], suggesting that this may be a conserved feature among all members of the syndecan family.</p><p>The mechanism of endocytosis by means of lipid raft domains remains a topic of ongoing study; however, information is becoming available as to the initial partitioning of proteins into lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Possible mechanisms to segregate plasma membrane proteins include hydrophobic modifications, such as lipidation, protein-protein interactions with lipid-raft resident proteins, or targeting signals that are encoded within the polypeptide domain of the membrane protein. Although Syn-1 has not been reported to undergo lipid modification or directly interact with lipid raft residents, such as caveolin, annexin, or flotillin, it may utilize intrinsic targeting information within its transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic tail in a similar fashion as the epidermal growth factor receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Once receptors internalize with their bound ligand through non-clathrin mediated pathways, they can deliver their cargo to classic endocytic compartments, such as recycling endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. As a result of this crosstalk between non-clathrin pathways and classical endocytic pathways, Syn-1 would be able to deliver apoE-VLDL to lysosomal acid lipases for release of fatty acids for cellular utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Whether Syn-1 recycles to the cell surface after delivering its cargo to endosomes remains to be determined.</p><p>LRP was originally identified as a lipoprotein clearance receptor by virtue of its structural homology with the LDL receptor, its high level expression in liver and its function in hepatic remnant metabolism elegantly demonstrated using genetically modified mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the question remains as to why in certain cell types, HSPG, and as we show here, Syn-1, serves as the primary clearance receptor for apoE-VLDL and LRP plays little or no role in the uptake of this ligand. Answers to this question may come from more recent studies investigating alternative functions for LRP (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]). LRP is now known to carry out dual roles; serving as an endocytic receptor for many diverse, structurally different ligands and as a signaling receptor that is able to modulate activities of other cell surface proteins. Whether LRP functions as a cargo receptor or signaling receptor may be determined by the state of receptor phosphorylation, post-translational processing, or complement of cytosolic messengers/adaptors that might dictate the preference between these dual functions. Thus, studies on hepatocytes have demonstrated that LRP functions as a key element in lipoprotein handling <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] or cells of neuronal lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], LRP may be acting primarily as a co-receptor modulating signal transduction events that control cell behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Human &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>M), heparin, and heparinase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
