To what extent nucleosomes and activators occupy these sites together or exclusively has not been extensively studied <italic>in vivo</italic>. We analyzed the chromatin structure of human &#x003b2;-globin locus control region hypersensitive sites in erythroid cells expressing embryonic and fetal globin genes. Nucleosomes were variably depleted at hypersensitive sites HS1-HS4 and at HS5 which flanks the 5&#x02032; of the locus. In lieu of nucleosomes, activators were differentially associated with these sites. Erythroid&#x02013;specific GATA-1 resided at HS1, HS2 and HS4 but the NF-E2 hetero-dimer was limited to HS2 where nucleosomes were most severely depleted. Histones H3 and H4 were hyperacetylated and H3 was di-methylated at K4 across the LCR, however, the H3 K4 MLL methyltransferase component Ash2L and histone acetyltransferases CBP and p300 occupied essentially only HS2 and the NF-E2 motif in HS2 was required for Ash2L recruitment. Our results indicate that each hypersensitive site in the human &#x003b2;-globin LCR has distinct structural features and suggest that HS2 plays a pivotal role in LCR organization at embryonic and fetal stages of globin gene expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Many gene families in mammals are expressed in a developmental stage and/or tissue-specific pattern under the influence of a locus control region (LCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). LCRs are complex transcriptional enhancer elements located at a distance from target genes. Typically, LCRs comprise clustered DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs) in a region of chromatin enriched for acetylation of H3 and H4 and di-methylation of H3 K4, histone modifications associated with active chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The sequences within DNase I HSs contain binding motifs for transcriptional activators which are important for establishment of the distinct chromatin structure of the LCR and for LCR enhancer function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>). Specific LCR-binding activators may mediate chromatin modifying activity directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) or they may recruit or increase chromatin modifying complexes at an LCR, including SWI/SNF type complexes and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">9&#x02013;14</xref>).</p><p>It has long been observed that DNase I HSs denote regulatory elements in chromatin such as enhancers and promoters but the nature of these sites has been difficult to ascertain. The current view is that these sites may be nucleosome-free regions of DNA or they may contain &#x02018;altered&#x02019; nucleosomes that do not strongly protect DNA from nuclease attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). One approach to distinguish these possibilities is to determine nucleosome occupancy by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with antibodies to total histone H3. H3 occupancy data can be used to correct histone modification profiles and was used on a genome-wide scale to show that active gene promoters are depleted of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). It is likely that nucleosome-free regions are also associated with enhancers/LCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Although it is a prediction that transcription activators will occupy these DNase I HSs in lieu of nucleosomes, this relationship has not been probed at high resolution.</p><p>The human &#x003b2;-globin locus contains an LCR that confers erythroid-specific enhancer activity to the globin genes which are expressed sequentially during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The LCR consists of four HSs (HS1&#x02013;HS4) that are located far upstream of the globin genes. The sites contain similar binding motifs for erythroid-specific and ubiquitous transcription activators and are generally considered to contribute to LCR enhancer activity collectively and to come into close physical contact in a &#x02018;chromatin hub&#x02019; in erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). HS5, which flanks the 5&#x02032; end of the locus, is also part of the hub and displays certain characteristics of a chromatin insulator including binding of the insulator protein CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25">22&#x02013;25</xref>).</p><p>NF-E2 and GATA-1 are among the erythroid activators interacting at the &#x003b2;-globin LCR HSs that play critical roles in transcription activation of the globin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). These factors interact differentially at the LCR HSs of the murine globin locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Chromatin hub interactions bringing the LCR and actively transcribed globin genes into physical proximity in murine erythroid cells require GATA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). GATA-1 also participates in recruitment of CBP to murine LCR HS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and increases LCR recruitment of BRG1, a component of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In human erythroid K562 cells that express the embryonic &#x003b5; and fetal &#x003b3;-globin genes but not the adult &#x003b2;-globin gene NF-E2 and GATA-1 play distinct roles in the enhancer activity of HS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and influence recruitment of CBP, p300 and SWI/SNF components to HS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>We previously observed varying levels of DNase I hypersensitivity among the &#x003b2;-globin LCR HSs in human K562 cells using a quantitative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Here we probed the relationship between nucleosome occupancy, activator and co-activator binding and histone modifications at the LCR HSs in a representative population of native mono and di-nucleosomes prepared from K562 cell nuclei. Sequences corresponding to HS1, HS2 and HS4 were highly depleted of nucleosomes. HS5 was less depleted and at HS3 nucleosomes were not lost. Histones remaining at HSs were hyperacetylated on H3 and H4 to varying degrees that did not always correlate with the extent of nucleosome loss. GATA-1 occupied HS1, HS2 and HS4, while NF-E2 was strongly detected only at HS2. The co-activators CBP/p300 and Ash2L occupied HS2 and NF-E2 interaction there was required for Ash2L recruitment. Interestingly, even though HS5 contains motifs for GATA-1 and NF-E2, these factors were not present at HS5 which was otherwise occupied by factors associated with insulator activity. These studies show that different HSs of the &#x003b2;-globin LCR in K562 cells have distinct chromatin structural attributes and factor occupancy which may reflect the organization of the complete LCR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and harvested at confluence of 4&#x02013;6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> per ml for all experiments.

At the lowest concentrations, MNase will attack linker regions between nucleosomes and sequences not protected by a nucleosome such as sites of extensive factor occupancy. At successively higher concentrations, DNA associated with nucleosomes of varying stability will eventually be digested. Nuclei from K562 cells expressing the embryonic &#x003b5; and fetal &#x003b3;-globin genes and from non-erythroid HeLa cells that do not express these genes, were digested with different concentrations of MNase, the digests combined, and mono and di-nucleosomes purified by sucrose gradient fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (see Methods section).

However, the magnitude of nucleosome loss was variable at different HSs. Notably, the core regions of HS1, HS2 and HS4 were highly depleted of nucleosomes, whereas DNA corresponding to HS5 was less depleted although all these sites were equally DNase I sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). MNase sensitivity was not notable at HS3. The lack of nucleosome remodeling at HS3 in K562 cells is consistent with a very weak DNase I sensitive site there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). We note that the relative intensity of nucleosome loss indicated by MNase sensitivity at the LCR core HSs is in good agreement with results obtained from ChIP assays of formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin using an antibody against total histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) (see Supplementary Figure 1) as would be predicted if a fully representative pool of nucleosomes had been obtained by graded MNase digestion.

The patterns of the modifications were quite similar and variable across the locus, and we found that peak modification sometimes occurred outside the HSs cores (i.e. HS3 5&#x02032;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) consistent with data on histone modification in the murine LCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Compared to other sites, HS1, HS3 and HS4 were highly modified and HS2 and HS5 were less so. Thus, there was an imperfect correlation between histone modifications and histone depletion. For example, HS1, HS2 and HS4 were the most highly depleted sites but only HS1 and HS4 appeared as peaks of histone modifications. In addition, HS3 was as highly modified as HS1 and HS4 but was not depleted of nucleosomes. HS5 significantly retained nucleosomes and was only weakly marked by histone acetylation and H3 K4 di-methylation. Weak acetylation of HS5 nucleosomes compared to the other LCR HSs contrasts with findings that the homologous chicken 5&#x02032;HS4 insulator site and an ectopic chicken 5&#x02032;HS4 in human cells are very strongly marked by acetylated H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).

Nucleosome loss in LCR HSs might be a prerequisite for or occur concomitantly with the binding there of transcriptional activators or activator binding might preclude re-deposition of nucleosomes following cell division. To investigate whether the nucleosome-depleted sequences were occupied instead by transcription activators, ChIP was carried out with nuclei cross-linked by formaldehyde to stabilize protein&#x02013;DNA interactions.

Association of GATA-1 was observed at HS1, HS2 and HS4: the GATA-1 signal at HS3 was very low, which might be related to the retention of nucleosomes at that site. At HS5, there was no significant signal for these activators even though GATA-1 and NF-E2 motifs are present in HS5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

For example, although strength of DNase I hypersensitivity correlated well with nucleosome loss at HS1, HS2 and HS4, there was a poor correlation at HS5. Nucleosome depletion at HS1 and HS4 correlated with histone hyperacetylation at remaining nucleosomes, consistent with acetylation preceding histone eviction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). However, HS2 and HS5 did not fit this model. Transcription activators GATA-1 and NF-E2 occupied the HSs that were depleted of nucleosomes but to different extents, and did not occupy HS5 at all, even though motifs for these activators are present at all the sites. Co-activators CBP and p300 HATs and the Ash2L HMT component were recruited essentially only to HS2 despite the presence of at least GATA-1 at HS1 and HS4. Thus, we observed a surprising diversity among the &#x003b2;-globin LCR HSs. We suggest that HS2 rather than other LCR HSs may play a pivotal role in LCR organization and/or activity, at least at stages when the embryonic and fetal globin genes are expressed as reflected in K562 cells.</p><sec><title>DNase I sensitivity and nucleosome loss</title><p>LCRs contain clusters of DNase I HSs as revealed by Southern blotting but it is highly problematic to quantify and compare these sensitivities. The application of quantitative, real-time PCR to this problem revealed that HS1-4 in the mouse globin LCR in fetal liver cells had very similar kinetics and end points of digestion by DNase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In human K562 cells, qPCR analysis showed that HS1, HS2, HS4 and HS5 were equally highly sensitive to DNase I but that HS3 was significantly less sensitive and retained histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>); it remains to be determined whether or not weak DNase I sensitivity is a feature of HS3 in normal human erythroid tissue at the embryonic stage.</p><p>We used quantitative methods to measure nucleosome loss at the HSs of the human &#x003b2;-globin LCR and found that HS1, HS2 and HS4 were significantly and similarly depleted of nucleosomes in agreement with their similar DNase I sensitivities. HS3 was not depleted of nucleosomes, also in accord with the DNase results and the retention of nucleosomes at HS3 is consistent with H3 retention there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Interestingly, HS5 was only modestly depleted of nucleosomes, even though its DNase hypersensitivity was similar to HS1, HS2 and HS4. We suggest that nucleosomes remain at HS5 but may exist in an &#x02018;altered&#x02019; state such that they are quite sensitive to DNase I digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleosome loss and histone acetylation and K4 di-methylation</title><p>Studies in complex loci, such as the human growth hormone locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), the human MHC class II HLA-DRA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), the mouse Th2 cytokine locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and the human and mouse &#x003b2;-globin loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46 B47 B48">46&#x02013;48</xref>), show that histone hyperacetylation and H3 K4 di-methylation are continuous through the LCRs but that the DNase I HSs have varying histone acetylation levels. Our studies provide some insight into the relationship between histone modifications and histone loss at the HSs of an LCR but reveal a complex picture.</p><p>HS1 and HS4 were depleted of nucleosomes but those remaining were highly acetylated consistent with kinetic analysis in yeast that show histones are first acetylated and then lost from a DNase I HS at the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). However, other sites including HS3 were also highly acetylated but not depleted of nucleosomes, indicating that acetylation alone is insufficient for nucleosome loss. Furthermore, HS2, which is the most nucleosome depleted site, was not hyperacetylated. Thus, the order of nucleosome remodeling and histone modification events at these HSs is unclear and might be variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). In addition, HS5, which was moderately depleted of nucleosomes, was not a peak of histone acetylation. This contrasts with data for the homologous 5&#x02032;HS4 insulator site that flanks the chicken &#x003b2;-globin locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). It was proposed that chicken 5&#x02032;HS4 hyperacetylation and K4 di-methylation function to block encroachment of repressive histone modifications from a heterochromatic region 5&#x02032; of the chicken globin locus. This heterochromatic region is not present 5&#x02032; of the human or mouse globin loci and, possibly, this function may not have been maintained by HS5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleosome loss and activator and co-activator interaction</title><p>We found that HS2 is occupied by NF-E2 and GATA-1 as well as the co-activators CPB/p300 and Ash2L. At HS1 and HS4, nucleosomes are similarly depleted as at HS2 but only GATA-1 was detected at these sites; we cannot rule out the possibility that other factors that we did not assay co-occupy these sites with GATA-1 to the exclusion of nucleosomes. In any case, co-activators were not substantially recruited to HS1 or HS4 despite the presence of GATA-1. At HS2, NF-E2 interaction is required for recruitment of Ash2L, consistent with a physical interaction between these two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). The relatively higher level of histone acetylation and H3 K4 di-methylation both up- and downstream of HS2 suggests these modifications spread from HS2 where co-activator complexes are recruited.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> depicts the nucleosome landscape through the &#x003b2;-globin LCR and the sites of activator and co-activator detection. The data suggest that HS2 is particularly important to LCR functions at least when the embryonic and fetal globin genes are active. HS2 is the only LCR HS that fulfills the classical definition of an enhancer. Despite this apparent importance of HS2, its activities within the murine LCR can at least be partially compensated by the other HSs when it is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). It would be informative to investigate histone and factor/co-factor interactions in what remains of the LCR under these circumstances. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Nucleosome and factor binding landscape in the &#x003b2;-globin LCR.

The first is that these profiles represent an average over all the templates analyzed. Thus, retention of nucleosomes and weak detection of activators such as seen at HS3 could indicate that stable nucleosomes occupy the majority of templates while a minority is occupied by factors. Alternatively, there may be a dynamic interchange of nucleosomes and factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) but that most often nucleosomes prevail. We favor the latter explanation. According to this interpretation, at other sites such as HS1, HS2 and HS4, the dynamic interchange results in relatively greater occupancy (possibly cooperatively) by factors and exclusion of nucleosomes. Chromatin disruption resulting in nucleosome loss provides the opportunity for non-replication coupled replacement of H3 by the variant H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). It would be interesting to determine to what extent H3.3 replacement of H3 is observed across the LCR HSs. These proteins are so closely related that such experiments require stable expression of a tagged version of H3.3 to which an antibody can be directed. Quite recently, it has been shown that GAGA factor induces DNase I hypersensitivity, H3 K4 di-methylation and a high H3.3 to H3 ratio at a site that is important for maintenance of <italic>white</italic> gene expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>).</p><p>Second, the close interactions among the HSs in the chromatin hub need to be taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). While the weak association of non-DNA binding co-activators CBP/p300 and Ash2L with HS1, HS3 and HS4 may be indicative of low level independent association at those sites, it may instead be attributable to fortuitous cross-linking due to close proximity with HS2 where the most extensive activator and co-activator occupancy was observed. While dynamic and spatial considerations deserve further attention, our &#x02018;snapshot&#x02019; of nucleosome and activator/co-activator occupancy at the &#x003b2;-globin LCR DNase I HSs nevertheless indicates a remarkable level of diversity among the sites and a prominent role for HS2 in LCR organization and function when embryonic and fetal genes are being expressed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm620_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="nar_gkm620_suppl_Figure_1.eps"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="nar_gkm620_suppl_Figure_2.eps"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank members of the Dean lab for discussions and Dr Cecelia Trainor for critical comments on the manuscript.
