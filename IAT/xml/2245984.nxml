Recent research in angiogenesis has furthered the understanding of choroidal neovascularization, which occurs in the &#x0201c;wet&#x0201d; form of AMD. In contrast, very little is known about the mechanisms of the predominant, &#x0201c;dry&#x0201d; form of AMD, which is characterized by retinal atrophy and choroidal involution.

The macula is the central region of the retina, the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and converts it into electrical messages that are sent to the brain. In the commonest form of AMD&#x02014;&#x0201c;dry&#x0201d; AMD&#x02014;the light-sensitive cells in the retina (the photoreceptors) gradually die. This degeneration might occur because of damage to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This layer of dark cells lies between the photoreceptors and the choroid, the layer of the eye that contains blood vessels and brings oxygen to the retina. The RPE keeps the retina healthy by transferring the right amount of oxygen and nutrients from the choroid to the retina and by removing worn-out photoreceptor outer segments (the part of the photoreceptor that actually absorbs light) in a process called phagocytosis (engulfment and digestion). In addition to photoreceptor degeneration and RPE shrinkage, a layer of the choroid rich in small blood vessels (the choriocapillaris) also shrinks in dry AMD. For affected individuals, all these changes (which experts describe as retinal atrophy and choroidal involution) mean that the sharp central vision that is needed for reading and driving is destroyed, leaving only dim, burred images or a black hole at the center of the vision.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie dry AMD and, consequently, there is no cure for it. In this study, the researchers have tested whether a molecule called CD36, which is expressed on the surface of RPE cells, is involved in dry AMD. CD36 is a scavenger receptor&#x02014;which means it binds many potentially harmful molecules including oxidized fats (which are present in the photoreceptor outer segments) and is involved in their phagocytosis. Phagocytosis itself induces the expression of several proteins in the RPE cells, including COX2, a &#x0201c;proangiogenic&#x0201d; protein that stimulates the growth of blood vessels. Putting this information together, the researchers hypothesized that a defect in CD36 might cause the characteristic retinal atrophy (by preventing the phagocytosis of worn-out photoreceptor outer segments) and choroidal involution (by preventing the induction of COX2 expression and consequently the maintenance of the blood vessels in the choroid) of dry AMD.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers first show that retinal degeneration occurs in rats and mice that express no CD36. This degeneration (which included a reduction in the thickness of the retina, the presence of irregularly shaped photoreceptor outer segments, and the detachment of these structures from the RPE) was seen in old but not young animals. Choroidal involution was also seen in these CD36-deficient animals. This change was present in young mice and rats but increased with age so that by one year old, the choriocapillaris looked moth-eaten. Next, the researchers show that although RPE cells taken from normal animals and grown in dishes were able to make COX2 in response to exposure to purified photoreceptor outer segments, RPE cells from CD36-deficient animals did not. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; a protein that is needed for normal choroidal development and whose expression is controlled by COX2) showed a similar pattern. Finally, the researchers report that COX2 deficiency in mice caused similar age-dependent choroidal involution and similar effects on VEGF expression in RPE cells as CD36 deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that CD36 deficiency leads to progressive, age-related degeneration of photoreceptors and choroidal involution in rats and mice. They also show that CD36 deficiency causes this choroidal involution, the key feature of dry AMD, because it leads to down-regulation of COX2 expression (and subsequently reduced VEGF expression) in the RPE. Researchers now need to find out whether this mechanism for the development of dry AMD holds in people&#x02014;what happens in animals does not necessarily happen in people. If it does, pharmacological activation of CD36 or restoration of CD36 expression in the RPE might eventually provide a way to treat dry AMD.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050039">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050039</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>MedlinePlus provides links to information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/maculardegeneration.html">macular degeneration</ext-link> and an <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001000.htm">encyclopedia page on macular degeneration</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pages on the US National Institutes of Health <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nihseniorhealth.gov/agerelatedmaculardegeneration/toc.html">NIH SeniorHealth</ext-link> site provides text and spoken information about AMD</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts.asp">US National Eye Institute</ext-link> and the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_rnib003635.hcsp">UK Royal National Institute of Blind People</ext-link> also provide information about AMD</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina">the retina</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell">photoreceptor cells</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium">retinal</ext-link> pigment epithelium, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid">choroid</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Houssier M, Raoul W, Lavalette S, Keller N, Guillonneau X, et al.

The molecular mechanisms that lead to these atrophic changes are not well known. In this study we show that CD36 deficiency causes photoreceptor/OS degeneration and choroidal involution in rats and mice. We show that CD36 expression is necessary for OS induced prosurvival/proangiogenic COX2 expression in RPE in vitro and that COX2 ablation causes similar choroidal involution in vivo. We propose a molecular mechanism that links photoreceptor degeneration and choroidal involution, the main features of dry AMD.</p><p>CD36 was expressed in mice in the basal aspect of the RPE and in choroidal vessels, as described in rat and human &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast to data reported from in vitro experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, CD36 does not seem to be essential for basal RPE phagocytosis in vivo, since an absolute defect in RPE phagocytosis would lead to a more rapid and complete retinal degeneration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas CD36 deficiency is associated with late-onset retinal degeneration. It has been suggested that CD36 plays a predominant role in OS phagocytosis mainly under oxidative conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, the relatively late morphological alterations observed in CD36-deficient animals seem to coincide with an increase in oxidative stress, as antioxidant defenses diminish with age &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. This inference is reinforced by the accrued OS degeneration observed in oxidative stress-prone albino SHRs compared to pigmented CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050039-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Choroidal involution was reported in SHRs several decades ago &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, prior to knowledge of their CD36 status. Our findings confirm the choroidal vascular rarefaction described in SHRs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, experiments using normotensive CD36-deficient animals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; suggest that this rarefaction occurs independently of hypertension but seems secondary to CD36 deficiency. The deficient antiangiogenic signaling in the vascular endothelium due to the suppression of CD36 as the main receptor of TSP-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; does not seem to significantly counterbalance this effect.</p><p>The normal appearance of capillary beds distant from the RPE, suggests a predominant role of local paracrine factors in CD36 dependent choroidal involution. In vivo, these CD36-dependent paracrine factors likely originate from the CD36-expressing RPE cells adjacent to the choriocapillaries. RPE cells express prosurvival/proangiogenic factors such as COX2 in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; that may be necessary for choriocapillary integrity. COX2 expression in the RPE is significantly augmented by retinal OS phagocytosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. We hereby show that CD36 expression in RPE is necessary for the OS-induced expression of COX2 in RPE primary cultures, as CD36 deficiency blunted the OS response in vitro and diminished COX2 expression in vivo.</p><p>CD36 activation sufficed to induce COX2, suggesting that OS-induced COX2 expression in RPE cells is directly mediated by CD36 as recently described for oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) in COX2 expression in macrophages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. In macrophages, CD36 stimulation has been shown to activate the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, which controls COX2 expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050039-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, and a similar mechanism might be involved in the RPE. Taken together, these results suggest that CD36 exerts an important permissive role in evoking the expression of prosurvival/proangiogenic factor COX2 in the RPE. We propose that choroidal involution is at least in part due to the observed COX2 down-regulation in RPE, since in our study COX2 deletion led to a similar choroidal involution. This inference is further substantiated by the interplay between COX2 and another major prosurvival/proangiogenic factor, VEGF, such that a COX2 activity deficiency (genetic and pharmacological) depressed VEGF immunoreactivity in RPE in vitro and in vivo, as seen in mice deficient in CD36, which itself also regulates both COX2 and VEGF expression. Together these findings suggest that diminished expression of CD36-dependent COX2 and VEGF in RPE might contribute to the rarefaction of the adjacent choriocapillaris.</p><p>All in all, our results show a novel molecular mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration and choroidal rarefaction, key cardinal features of dry AMD. Furthermore, our results suggest that pharmacological activation of CD36 or restoration of CD36 expression in the RPE of patients with dry AMD could be used therapeutically to prevent photoreceptor cell death by boosting SE renewal and to maintain a healthy choroid and retinal oxygenation by enhanced COX2 expression. These findings reveal a pathogenic process, to our knowledge previously unknown, with important implications for the development of new therapies for dry AMD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Febbraio and Dr. Ballou for sharing CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and COX2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AMD</term><def><p>age-related macular degeneration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ONL</term><def><p>outer nuclear layer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p>outer segment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p>retinal pigment epithelium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p>room temperature</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-PCR</term><def><p>real-time PCR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SHR</term><def><p>spontaneous hypertensive rat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VEGF</term><def><p>vascular endothelial growth factor</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pmed-0050039-b001"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Colmain</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Munoz</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomany</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>McCarty</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2004</year><article-title>Prevalence of age-related macular degeneration in the United States</article-title><source>Arch Ophthalmol</source><volume>122</volume><fpage>564</fpage><lpage>572</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15078675</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pmed-0050039-b002"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sarks</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name></person-group><year>1976</year><article-title>Ageing and degeneration in the macular region: a clinico-pathological study</article-title><source>Br J Ophthalmol</source><volume>60</volume><fpage>324</fpage><lpage>341</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">952802</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pmed-0050039-b003"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name><name><surname>Enger</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><year>1993</year><article-title>Age-related macular degeneration histopathologic studies.
