There is evidence that NO acts both in the central nervous system via a cyclic GMP pathway and in the periphery on sensory neurons through unknown mechanisms. It has recently been suggested that TRPV1 and TRPA1, two polymodal ion channels that sense noxious stimuli impinging on peripheral nociceptors, are activated by NO in heterologous systems. Here, we investigate the relevance of this activation. We demonstrate that NO donors directly activate TRPV1 and TRPA1 in isolated inside-out patch recordings. Cultured primary sensory neurons display both TRPV1- and TRPA1-dependent responses to NO donors. BH4, an essential co-factor for NO production, causes activation of a subset of DRG neurons as assayed by calcium imaging, and this activation is at least partly dependent on nitric oxide synthase activity. We show that BH4-induced calcium influx is ablated in DRG neurons from TRPA1/TRPV1 double knockout mice, suggesting that production of endogenous levels of NO can activate these ion channels. In behavioral assays, peripheral NO-induced nociception is compromised when TRPV1 and TRPA1 are both ablated. These results provide genetic evidence that the peripheral nociceptive action of NO is mediated by both TRPV1 and TRPA1.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signaling molecule generated from arginine and oxygen by nitric oxide synthases (NOS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Stamler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

We thus sought to determine if NO activates cultured DRG neurons using compounds that spontaneously release NO. To assay large numbers of neurons simultaneously, we used ratiometric calcium imaging which detects global changes in cytoplasmic calcium levels and assesses both direct (e.g., modulation of a putative calcium-permeable NO receptor) and indirect (e.g., release of calcium from intracellular stores and/or downstream activation of calcium-permeable ion channels) processes. Interestingly, we observed intracellular calcium increase in approximately &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of total neurons upon application of the NO donor SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; 3 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007596-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007596-t001">Table 1</xref>).

A congener of SNAP lacking the releasable NO group (NAP: N-acetylpenicillamine; 3 mM) did not activate DRG neurons, consistent with NO-dependent activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007596-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). SNAP had little effect in the absence of extracellular calcium ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007596-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), suggesting that the signal was largely due to influx of calcium through calcium-permeable ion channels. Based on the kinetics of SNAP-evoked activation, we defined two apparently distinct populations of neurons activated by SNAP by setting arbitrary thresholds: those revealing a significant increase in intracellular calcium within one minute after SNAP application (&#x0201c;fast-SNAP&#x0002b;&#x0201d; neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007596-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> left, 1B blue), and those exhibiting a significant increase after one minute (&#x0201c;slow-SNAP&#x0002b;&#x0201d; neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007596-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> right, 1B red).

We next tested whether TRP channels might mediate the NO donor-induced calcium response in DRG neurons by determining the sensitivity of the response to the non-selective TRP channel antagonist, ruthenium red (RR). RR almost completely blocked the NO donor-induced increase in calcium levels when applied before application of SNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007596-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007596-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Consistent with this, we observe that C665, one of three TRPA1 cytoplasmic cysteines involved in responding to a variety of reactive chemicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Hinman1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, is also required for normal responsiveness to NO but not to the non-reactive agonist menthol implying that overall channel function of this mutation is not compromised. Although unlikely, we cannot rule out an indirect activation mechanism of TRPA1 via NO-induced formation of a membrane-delimited chemical or via other NO-activated redox-sensitive proteins (presumably present in detached patches of HEK293T, CHO, DRG cells). Furthermore, incomplete ablation of NO or iodoacetamide responses in single or triple TRPA1 cysteine mutations suggests that other mechanisms (residues) are also involved in sensing cysteine-reactive chemicals. Indeed, other amino acid residues (cysteines as well as histidines) of TRPA1 in addition to these three cysteines have recently been reported to be required for channel activation by zinc and intracellular base <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Hu1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Dhaka1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Fujita1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the behavioral consequences of direct peripheral application of NO donors have not been investigated in the mouse. Our studies reveal that NO donor injection in hindpaws causes TRPV1-dependent thermal hyperalgesia without causing significant acute pain behavior. These data suggest that direct comparison of human and rodent pain behavior is untenable and may point to a difficulty in assessing moderate pain in rodents. Note that due to solubility issues of NO donors, we were limited to using relatively low levels of NO donors for behavioral experiments (&#x0003c; ten fold the <italic>in vitro</italic> EC<sub>50</sub>). For capsaicin, injections of capsaicin at &#x0003e;1000 times the <italic>in vitro</italic> EC<sub>50</sub> are typically used to observe acute pain behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that significant acute nocifensive behavior was not observed, but only hyperalgesia. Regardless, we show that after PLC and PKA pathway activation (which sensitizes nociceptors, including TRPV1 and TRPA1 &#x02013; see below), injections of two chemically distinct NO donors in the paw cause nociceptive behavior. Importantly, the NO donor-dependent nocifensive behavior required both TRPV1 and TRPA1, as we observed a decrease in nociception in mice lacking both TRPV1 and TRPA1, but not in individual knockout animals. This is consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> results showing that NO donors can activate both ion channels, and our DRG culture experiments, where we observe both TRPA1- and TRPV1-mediated responses. The most parsimonious explanation of these results is that NO's behavioral consequences is due to direct activation of these thermoTRPs; however, it cannot be ruled out that NO also targets TRPV1 and TRPA1 <italic>in vivo</italic> through indirect mechanisms.

Previous studies have shown that robust activation of TRPV1 can desensitize TRPA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Jeske1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, but also that TRPV1 is required for proper TRPA1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Akopian1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. These results point to elaborate communications between these two nocisensors.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Potential Physiological Roles of NO-Induced TRPV1/TRPA1 Activation</title><p>Behavioral assays involving NO performed in this study are linked to peripheral sensitization: in one, NO donor causes thermal sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007596-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>); in the other, sensitization reveals a nociceptive role for NO donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007596-g006">Fig. 6B, C</xref>). Hence, the behavioral results highlight a physiological role of peripheral NO preferentially in the sensitized or hyperalgesic state. Indeed, NOS genes are known to be expressed in DRG neurons and are upregulated during inflammation and injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Majewski1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Vizzard1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, macrophages, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells are known to release NO during inflammation, and are in close proximity to sensory nerve endings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Lowenstein1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-CalsGrierson1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Relevant to this, nitrooleic acid, an endogenous nitrated fatty acid which is generated during excessive NO production, was recently reported to covalently activate TRPA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-TaylorClark2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that NO and NO-derived compounds from many cell types act together on TRPV1 and TRPA1 during inflammation. Regardless, BH4-induced intracellular calcium increase in primary cultured DRG neurons is partly dependent on NOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007596-Tegeder1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and essentially dependent on TRPV1 and TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007596-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). It should be noted that we cannot exclude the possibility that BH4 acts on other pathways to regulate neuronal activity. Nevertheless, our results suggest that endogenous levels of NO are capable of activating thermoTRPs, and that TRPV1 and TRPA1 are involved in NO-dependent peripheral sensitization to pain. NO's action on TRPV1 and TRPA1 could potentially be relevant in other biological systems where NO and TRPV1/A1 have been implicated to be involved.
