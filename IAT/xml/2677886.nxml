Here, we show that RECQ5 is constitutively associated with the MRE11&#x02013;RAD50&#x02013;NBS1 (MRN) complex, a primary sensor of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that promotes DSB repair and regulates DNA damage signaling via activation of the ATM kinase. Experiments with purified proteins indicated that RECQ5 interacts with the MRN complex through both MRE11 and NBS1. Functional assays revealed that RECQ5 specifically inhibited the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of MRE11, while MRN had no effect on the helicase activity of RECQ5. At the cellular level, we observed that the MRN complex was required for the recruitment of RECQ5 to sites of DNA damage. Accumulation of RECQ5 at DSBs was neither dependent on MDC1 that mediates binding of MRN to DSB-flanking chromatin nor on CtIP that acts in conjunction with MRN to promote resection of DSBs for repair by HR. Collectively, these data suggest that the MRN complex recruits RECQ5 to sites of DNA damage to regulate DNA repair.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Proteins belonging to the RecQ DNA helicase family are highly conserved from bacteria to mammals. In human cells, five RecQ homologs have been identified and named RECQ1, BLM, WRN, RECQ4 and RECQ5. Inherited defects in the genes encoding for BLM, WRN and RECQ4 have been found to cause distinct autosomal recessive disorders associated with various forms of genomic instability, premature aging and predisposition to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Numerous biochemical and cellular studies have shown that the RecQ homologs in human cells have nonredundant roles in the maintenance of genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that BLM suppresses crossovers during homologous recombination (HR) by acting in concert with DNA topoisomerase III&#x003b1; to catalyze dissolution of double Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). WRN acts specifically at telomeres to promote lagging-strand replication of G-rich telomeric regions, preventing telomere erosion and subsequent recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). RECQ4 accumulates on chromatin during initiation of DNA replication to promote loading of replication factors at unwound origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>The role of human RECQ5 protein in the maintenance of genomic stability is not well understood. RECQ5 exists in at least three different isoforms resulting from alternative RNA splicing, but only the largest splice variant, RECQ5&#x003b2;, localizes to the nucleus and possesses DNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). Like other RecQ helicases, RECQ5&#x003b2; promotes branch migration of Holliday junctions and exhibits strand-annealing and strand-exchange activities <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). It can also disrupt RAD51 presynaptic filaments in a reaction dependent on its ATPase activity and the presence of replication protein A (RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In proliferating cells, RECQ5&#x003b2; associates with the replication machinery and accumulates at sites of stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Hereafter RECQ5&#x003b2; will be referred to as RECQ5.</p><p>Mice lacking the Recql5 gene are viable, but are highly prone to various types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Recql5-deficient cells accumulate Rad51 and &#x003b3;-H2AX foci and are prone to gross chromosomal rearrangements in response to replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Moreover, Recql5 deficiency is associated with a significant increase in the frequency of both spontaneous and DNA-damage-induced HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These findings establish Recql5/RECQ5 as a tumor suppressor that plays a role in the control of HR, possibly through disruption of inappropriately formed Rad51 filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>The MRE11&#x02013;NBS1&#x02013;RAD50 (MRN) complex exhibits 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity on double-stranded (ds) DNA and endonuclease activity on single-stranded (ss) DNA and hairpin DNA structures in a reaction stimulated by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The nuclease active site resides in MRE11, while RAD50 contains a bipartite ATP binding domain split by a long repeat region that fold into an anti-parallel coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The coiled-coil domain of RAD50 can dimerize via a hook structure located on the tip of this domain, which gives the MRN complex the capacity to tether DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). NBS1 does not possess any enzymatic function, but it enhances the endonuclease activity of the MRE11&#x02013;RAD50 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>The MRN complex is required for the maintenance of the integrity of DNA replication forks, double-strand break (DSB) repair, G2/M checkpoint activation, telomere length maintenance and meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that it functions as a DSB sensor activating the ATM-dependent signaling pathway, which coordinates cell cycle arrest with DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, null mutations in all components of the MRN complex are lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), while hypomorphic mutations in the human MRE11 and NBS1 genes can give rise to Ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), respectively, which are characterized by neurological abnormalities, radiosensitivity, genomic instability and cancer predisposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that RECQ5 and the MRN complex constitutively associate <italic>in vivo</italic> and colocalize at nuclear foci in response to replication arrest and chromosomal breakage. The interaction between RECQ5 and MRN is direct and can be mediated through both MRE11 and NBS1. We further show that the recruitment of RECQ5 to sites of DNA damage is dependent on MRN. Moreover, biochemical experiments reveal that RECQ5 inhibits the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity associated with the MRE11 protein. Together, these data suggest a functional relationship between RECQ5 and the MRN complex in the cellular response to DNA damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>The RECQ5 protein was produced in bacteria as fusion with self-cleaving chitin-binding domain (CBD) and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ was purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Baculoviruses expressing (His)<sub>6</sub>-MRE11, (His)<sub>6</sub>-NBS1 and RAD50, respectively, were a kind gift from Dr Vilhelm Bohr. The MRN and MR complexes as well as the individual MRN subunits were produced in Sf9 cells infected with appropriate baculoviruses. Cells harvested at 72 h after infection were suspended in buffer A [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.3 M NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol] supplemented with 20 mM imidazole and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) and disrupted by sonication. Cell extract was clarified by centrifugation at 100 000<italic>g</italic> for 1 h and loaded on a 5-ml HiTrap Ni<sup>2+</sup>-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear concentration gradient of imidazole (50 ml; 50&#x02013;350 mM) in buffer A. Fractions containing MRN proteins were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B [20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mM DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT)] and loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap Q Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear concentration gradient of NaCl (12 ml; 50&#x02013;500 mM) in buffer B. The RAD50 protein was purified only via HiTrap Q Sepharose FF column as it was expressed without a histidine tag. Purified proteins were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. The concentration of purified proteins was determined by Bradford assay. The values obtained in Bradford assay were divided by predicted molecular mass of appropriate protein to calculate molar concentration.

Growth medium of complemented NBS cells was supplemented with hygromycin B (100 &#x003bc;g/ml). MDC1<sup>+/+</sup> and MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured under the same conditions as U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Where indicated, cells were treated with 2 mM hydroxyurea (HU) for 16 h or with 20 &#x003bc;M cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP) for 8 h. Laser microirradiation to generate DNA DSBs in defined nuclear volumes was performed using a MMI CELLCUT system containing a UVA laser of 355 nm (Molecular Machines &#x00026; Industries). Prior to irradiation, cells were grown for 24 h in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Ionizing radiation (IR) was generated using a Faxitron X-ray system. UV irradiation (at a dose of 40 J/m<sup>2</sup>) was performed in a UV-Stratalinker 1800 equipped with a 254 nm UV lamp (Stratagene). Immediately after exposure to radiation, cells were placed back to incubator and incubated for various periods of time as indicated. For cell cycle analyses, ethanol-fixed cells were stained with propidium iodide (20 &#x003bc;g/ml; Molecular Probes) and subjected to flow cytometry in a Becton Dickinson cell sorter.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA interference</title><p>To knock down MRE11 expression in human cells, we employed short-hairpin (sh) RNA technology.

These oligonucleotides were designed by scrambling of the shRNA-MRE11 sequence within the MRE11 homology region. The resulting plasmid constructs were further modified by introducing a puromycin resistance marker. To do so, the 1.4 kb BamHI/PvuI fragment of pPUR (Clontech) was ligated into the BamHI and SmaI sites of the pSUPER derivatives. The shRNA plasmids were introduced into U2OS cells by liposomal transfection with Metafectene (Biontex) that was carried out essentially according to the manufacturer instructions. At 24 h posttransfection, cell cultures were supplemented with puromycin (2 &#x003bc;g/ml) to enhance the fraction of shRNA-expressing clones. Cells were usually harvested 3 days after addition of puromycin and analyzed as described below.</p><p>The nucleotide sequences of CtIP and control (Ctrl) siRNAs and siRNA transfection method were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence staining and analyses</title><p>Cells grown on cover slips were fixed in methanol for 30 min at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C, which was followed by incubation in acetone for 30 s. After blocking in PBS supplemented with 2% FCS (blocking solution), cover slips were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with appropriate primary antibodies [rabbit polyclonal anti-RECQ5 (1:1000) in combination with either mouse monoclonal anti-RAD50 (1:200) or mouse monoclonal anti-&#x003b3;-H2AX (1:200); all antibodies were diluted in blocking solution]. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit (Sigma; dilution of 1:700) and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Abcam; dilution of 1:200) secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The cover slips were then mounted with Vectashield (Vector Labs) and sealed.

After a 30-min incubation on ice, the lysate was treated with 50 U of RNase-free DNase I (Roche) at 25&#x000b0;C for 30 min, and clarified by centrifugation. Cell extracts (1 mg) were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with purified rabbit anti-RECQ5 IgGs (1 &#x003bc;g) or with IgGs purified from pre-immune serum (1 &#x003bc;g).

To do so, U2OS cells were synchronized at G1/S transition by HU treatment and then released into drug-free medium. Cells were collected at different time points after the removal of HU and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RECQ5 antibody. In a parallel experiment, cell populations from the individual time points were subjected to FACS analysis to determine the stage of the cell cycle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp147/DC1">Figure S2C</ext-link>).

Interestingly, we found that both MRE11 and NBS1, but not RAD50, were bound to RECQ5, suggesting that the interaction between RECQ5 and the MRN complex is mediated not only by MRE11 but also by NBS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). To substantiate these findings, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with total cell extracts from NBS and ATLD1 cells carrying hypomorphic mutations in the <italic>NBS1</italic> and <italic>MRE11</italic> genes, respectively. We found that the RECQ5 immunoprecipitate from NBS cells contained both MRE11 and RAD50 proteins in similar concentrations as the RECQ5 immunoprecipitate from NBS cells complemented with the wild-type NBS1 cDNA, confirming that RECQ5 binds to the MR complex in a manner independent of NBS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lanes 1, 2, 5 and 6). In ATLD1 cells, the levels of NBS1 and RAD50 proteins were dramatically reduced as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). However, a small amount of NBS1 could still be detected in the RECQ5 immunoprecipitate from these cells, indicating that NBS1 can interact with RECQ5 in absence of MRE11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lane 7). In MRE11-complemented ATLD1 cells, expression of all three subunits of the MRN complex could again be readily detected by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lane 4).

First, we tested the effect of MRN on the helicase activity of RECQ5. Previous studies demonstrated that RECQ5 displays a poor 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; helicase activity on oligonucleotide-based partial duplexes due to a strong strand-annealing activity residing in the C-terminal half of RECQ5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, RECQ5 could efficiently displace the lagging-strand oligonucleotide from synthetic forked structures with homologous arms where reannealing of this oligonucleotide is prevented by annealing of the parental strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Thus, we evaluated the effect of the MRN complex on this strand-exchange reaction. We found that the rate of RECQ5-mediated strand-exchange was not altered upon addition of the MRN complex, suggesting that the MRN complex does not modulate the helicase activity of RECQ5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp147/DC1">Figure S4</ext-link>).</p><p>Since the MRN complex has been shown to possess 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), we tested the effect of RECQ5 on MRN-mediated exonucleolytic processing of a 30-bp duplex with a 5&#x02032;-ssDNA tail containing 30 nt. Our initial experiments showed that the MRN complex required manganese and ATP as cofactors to exhibit efficient 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity on this DNA substrate (data not shown), which is consistent with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).

After individual DNA-damaging treatments, cell were fixed with methanol, co-immunostained with anti-RECQ5 and anti-RAD50 antibodies and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. As expected, in majority of unperturbed cells, both RECQ5 and RAD50 were uniformly distributed in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, top row). After HU treatment, which results in replication arrest due to depletion of deoxyribonucleotides, both RECQ5 and RAD50 formed bright nuclear foci that extensively colocalized in &#x0003e;70% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, middle row).

As expected, in 70% of MRE11-proficient cells treated with HU, RECQ5 extensively colocalized with &#x003b3;-H2AX at bright nuclear foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C, bottom panels, bottom rows). MRE11-deficient cells also displayed &#x003b3;-H2AX foci in response to HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C, top panels, bottom rows). However, RECQ5 foci were not seen in these cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The MRN complex is required for the recruitment of RECQ5 to DSBs</title><p>To evaluate whether MRE11 is required for the recruitment of RECQ5 to DSBs, we microirradiated ATLD1 cells with UVA laser and stained them for RECQ5 and &#x003b3;-H2AX at 30 min after irradiation.

In contrast, accumulation of RECQ5 at irradiated areas was seen in ATLD1-McRE11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, top panel).

For U2OS cell cultures, BrdU was added 2 days after transfection of <italic>CtIP</italic> or control (<italic>Ctrl</italic>) siRNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp147f6"/></fig></p><p>The MRN complex has multiple functions in the cellular response to DSBs. Following activation of the ATM kinase by MRN bound to DNA ends, more MRN accumulates in large chromatin domains flanking DSBs, which is likely to enhance the DSB-induced signal by means of a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Recruitment of MRN to DSB-flanking chromatin is critically dependent on MDC1 that forms a complex with MRN in a manner dependent on CK2 phosphorylation and directly interacts with &#x003b3;-H2AX in the damaged chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37 B38">35&#x02013;38</xref>). To address whether MDC1 is required for the recruitment of RECQ5 to sites of DSBs, we compared DSB-induced nuclear trafficking of RECQ5 in MDC1<sup>+/+</sup> and MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs. We found that MDC1 deficiency had no effect on the recruitment of RECQ5 to laser-induced DSB tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, middle panel). Although this finding does not exclude the possibility that a fraction of the RECQ5 protein associate with DSB-flanking chromatin as a part of the MRN&#x02013;MDC1 complex, it argues that MRN recruits RECQ5 to broken DNA ends. In both MDC1-proficient and MDC1-deficient MEFs, &#x0003e;97% of irradiated nuclei (out of at least 100 nuclei) contained RECQ5-positive tracks, further supporting the notion that RECQ5 associates with DSBs in a cell-cycle independent manner (data not shown).</p><p>MRN, in conjunction with CtIP, promotes resection of DSBs that arise during S/G2 phases of the cell cycle, generating 3&#x02032;-ssDNA tails for HR repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). To address the question whether the recruitment of RECQ5 to DSBs occurs as a consequence of DSB resection, we depleted CtIP from U2OS cell by means of RNA interference (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp147/DC1">Figure S5A</ext-link>). Cells were fixed at 30 min after laser microirradiation and stained with anti-RECQ5 in combination with either anti-&#x003b3;-H2AX or anti-RPA antibodies. We found that CtIP depletion had no effect on accumulation of RECQ5 at DSB tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, bottom panel). In contrast, accumulation of RPA at microirradiated areas was completely abolished upon CtIP depletion (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp147/DC1">Figure S5B</ext-link>) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). These data indicate that the observed MRE11-dependent accumulation of RECQ5 at DSB sites is not dependent on DSB resection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>HR provides the most accurate mechanism for the repair of DSBs and ssDNA gaps which frequently occur in the cell as a result of collision of the DNA replication machinery with DNA lesions and other obstacles or as a result of processing of DNA lesions by DNA repair enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In mitotic cells, most recombination intermediates are processed through pathways such as synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) or double-Holliday junction (dHJ) dissolution that do not result in crossovers. These mechanisms are important for avoidance of potentially deleterious chromosomal rearrangements that can arise if the homologous sequence used for HR-mediated repair is located at different chromosomal locus. A key step in HR is the formation of a RAD51-ssDNA filament that mediates the search for sequence homology and associates with the donor sequence forming the so-called D-loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Recent studies indicated that the RECQ5 DNA helicase counteracts the formation of crossovers during HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that RECQ5 has the ability to disrupt RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, the importance of this activity in the regulation of HR <italic>in vivo</italic> still remains to be explored. Furthermore, it is not clear by now how RECQ5 is recruited to the sites of HR.</p><p>Here we show that RECQ5 interacts with the MRN complex, a key player in the repair of DNA damage by HR. Our results suggest that this interaction is mediated through MRE11 and NBS1. At the biochemical level, RECQ5 specifically inhibited the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of the MRN and MR complexes, suggesting that RECQ5 interacts with the nuclease or DNA-binding domains of MRE11 thereby impairing the access of MRE11 to the DNA substrate. At the cellular level, MRE11 was required for the accumulation of RECQ5 at sites of arrested replication forks and sites of DSBs. Interestingly, recruitment of RECQ5 to DSBs was not dependent on MDC1, which mediates chromatin retention of MRN at sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Moreover, RECQ5 accumulation at DSBs was not affected upon depletion of CtIP, indicating that it is not dependent on the DNA-end resection of DSBs in S/G2 generating 3&#x02032;-ssDNA tails to initiate repair by HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Instead, our data argue that RECQ5 migrates to and acts at broken DNA ends as a part of the MRN complex.</p><p>In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the formation of crossovers during HR is counteracted mainly by the Srs2 DNA helicase, which has no obvious sequence homologs in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Like RECQ5, Srs2 has the capacity to disrupt Rad51 filaments formed on ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Srs2 also shows preference for unwinding of D-loop structures, and its helicase activity is stimulated by Rad51 filaments on dsDNA, supporting the proposed role for Srs2 in promoting SDSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Strikingly, Srs2 has been shown to physically interact with the DNA-binding domain of Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). This, together with our finding of a physical interaction between RECQ5 and the MRN complex in human cells, lends further support to the hypothesis that RECQ5 is a functional ortholog of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Moreover, our data might explain how these anti-recombinases are delivered to sites of DNA repair. However, the precise role of the MRN complex in the function of these proteins during HR still remains to be addressed.</p><p>Interestingly, we have found that RECQ5 accumulates at DSBs throughout the interphase. A recent study demonstrated that RAD51 accumulates at laser-induced damage sites not only in S/G2 phase, where DSBs are repaired by HR, but also in G1 phase where HR repair is suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Thus, it is possible that one function of RECQ5 is to prevent RAD51-mediated HR events in G1 cells that could lead to detrimental chromosomal rearrangements because of the lack of an undamaged sister chromatid.</p><p>We found that MRE11 was required for the RECQ5 focus formation in response to replication arrest by HU. Given the role for MRN as a DSB sensor, one can assume that these foci represent broken replication forks undergoing HR repair. However, HU-induced DNA DSBs become apparent only after 24 h of continuous HU treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). In contrast, RECQ5 foci could readily be observed at 16 h following addition of HU, suggesting that they rather represent sites of stalled replication forks. Previous studies indicated that the MRN complex is associated with replication forks throughout S-phase via phosphorylation-dependent interaction with RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51">49&#x02013;51</xref>). It was also shown that the MRN complex colocalizes with RPA in response to replication arrest by HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the MRN complex tethers RECQ5 to ssDNA regions generated at stalled replication forks to prevent formation of RAD51 filaments and subsequent DNA recombination. Such a &#x02018;fork clearing&#x02019; function was proposed for the <italic>E. coli</italic> UvrD DNA helicase, a bacterial ortholog of Srs2, based on finding that the lethality conferred by <italic>uvr</italic>D deletion to certain replication mutants is suppressed by inactivation of the genes involved in the RecFOR pathway of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). There is also evidence suggesting that Srs2 prevents recombination events at stalled replication forks favoring lesion bypass by translesion polymerases or through template-switching mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>).</p><p>The BLM helicase also suppresses crossover events during HR as evidenced by elevated rate of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and increased incidence of loss of heterozygocity in BLM-deficient cells relative to normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Recent studies demonstrated that, out of human RecQ helicases, only BLM could promote dHJ dissolution, suggesting that BLM is the human counterpart of the yeast Sgs1 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Although there is also some evidence suggesting that BLM functions in the SDSA pathway of HR, genetic studies using mutant mouse cells clearly indicated that BLM and RECQ5 have nonredundant roles in suppression of crossovers, which is similar to the situation of Srs2 and Sgs1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>).</p><p>A recent study suggested that the human F-box helicase 1 (FBH1), which is conserved in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, but not in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, is a functional ortholog of Srs2. It was shown that FBH1 shares homology with Srs2 within the helicase domain and suppresses specific recombination defects of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> srs2 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Although it remains to be determined whether FBH1 possesses the ability to displace RAD51 from ssDNA, the existence of both Fbh1 and Srs2 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> rather suggests that these two helicases use different mechanisms to suppress recombination. This is further supported by the synthetic lethality of mutations in these genes, which is suppressed by deletion of the recombination gene rhp57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Fbh1 is also essential for viability in absence of Rqh1, the sole RecQ homolog of <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Simultaneous inactivation of the FBH1 and BLM homologs in chicken DT40 cells is not lethal, but it results in much higher frequency of SCE relative to SCE levels in the respective single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Thus, it seems that BLM, RECQ5 and FBH1 act rather in a complementary fashion during processing of HR intermediates. Since FBH1 helicase can function as the substrate specificity subunit of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex one can speculate that it regulates recombination by triggering proteolytic degradation of recombination factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>).</p><p>RECQ5 is not the sole human RecQ helicase that interacts with the MRN complex. There is evidence for a functional link between MRN and BLM. Similar to Sgs1, BLM was found to coexist with MRN in a large complex containing proteins involved in the recognition and repair of aberrant DNA structures, although no evidence for a direct BLM&#x02013;MRN interaction was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). It was also shown that BLM and MRN colocalize at nuclear foci in response to replication stress and that BLM is required for the relocalization of MRN to sites of replication arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). Previous studies also demonstrated that the MRN complex physically interacts with WRN, which is required for the resolution of HR intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63 B64 B65">63&#x02013;65</xref>). Moreover, these studies revealed that the relocalization of WRN to sites of DNA damage is dependent on a functional MRN complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). However, WRN and RECQ5 differ in the mode of their interaction with MRN. The formation of WRN&#x02013;MRN complex <italic>in vivo</italic> is dependent on DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>), whereas, based on our data, RECQ5 appears to constitutively interact with MRN <italic>in vivo</italic>. The interaction between WRN and the MRN complex is solely mediated by NBS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), while we show that RECQ5 can bind to both MRE11 and NBS1 and that the absence of NBS1 does not affect the association of RECQ5 with the MR complex. At the functional level, MRN dramatically stimulates the helicase activity of WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), whereas it has no effect on the helicase activity of RECQ5. Further studies will definitely be needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the cooperation between RecQ DNA helicases and the MRN complex in the biological processes that enforce genomic stability.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp147/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Swiss National Science Foundation (3100A0-102198, 3100A0-116008); UBS AG, Cancer League of the Canton of Zurich and Czech Science Foundation (GA204/09/0565).
