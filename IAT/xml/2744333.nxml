Although ATRX loss in the cartilage of mice was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western blot analyses, we show that long bones from <italic>Atrx<sup>Col2Cre</sup></italic> mice do not differ from controls in length or growth-plate morphology, and that these mice achieve the same adult length and weight as control littermates. Furthermore, mutant mice are viable and breed normally, with no defects seen in second-generation knockouts.</p><p>Whole skeletal stains for ossified bone and cartilage were used to characterize the entire skeleton of <italic>Atrx<sup>Col2Cre</sup></italic> mice. Qualitative and quantitative study of the control and <italic>Atrx<sup>Col2Cre</sup></italic> skeletons showed no overall changes in cartilage proportions and lengths of individual elements.</p><p>The minor defects observed in our mouse model suggest a mild effect from ATRX deficiency that may manifest only occasionally. This is not unexpected, as the limb and digit phenotypes observed in ATR-X syndrome patients are also highly variable. In a study of sixty-five unrelated patients, one case of bifid thumb was observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Badens1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The varied hand and foot deformities in some ATR-X patients suggest that the effect on limb development may differ between individuals, even those with identical mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Badens1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Thorough radiologic investigations of ATR-X patients have shown that the most common phenotypic abnormalities were delayed bone age and coxa valga <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Gibbons5">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The delay in hip ossification seen in our mice may be due to a similar delay in bone age.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that loss of ATRX in other tissues in the mouse causes severe and fatal defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Garrick1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Brub1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Medina1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of ATRX in the mouse forebrain has been shown to result in widespread hypocellularity in the hippocampus and neocortex, as well as an overall reduction in forebrain size. These mice exhibit reduced weight and perinatal lethality, demonstrating the importance of ATRX in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Brub1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, loss of ATRX in the 16-cell morula stage has revealed a specific and essential role for ATRX in the formation of the extraembryonic trophoblast in mice. Mutant mice showed a dramatic reduction in mitotic cells and early embryonic death at E9.5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Garrick1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. A third model examining the role of ATRX in the developing retina showed that ATRX loss-of-function leads to loss of interneurons, specifically, amacrine and horizontal cells. These mice demonstrated a defect in interneuron differentiation and survival, which is associated with functional deficits that may be similar to the subset of ATR-X patients with visual anomalies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Medina1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This is the first study examining the specific loss of ATRX in the skeletal system, and surprisingly we observed only minor abnormalities. Since these effects are much less severe than in all other cell types examined, despite marked expression of ATRX in wild type chondrocytes, our data suggest cell type-specific requirement for ATRX function in cell survival and differentiation.</p><p>One assumption in our model is that destabilization and subsequent breakdown of the <italic>Atrx</italic> mRNA is an accurate model of the hypomorphic gene expression seen in ATRX patients. While our model deletes only the long isoform of ATRX and retains the short isoform (ATRXt), it is unlikely that ATRXt has equivalent functions to the full length protein, as it lacks the functional SWI/SNF domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Garrick2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the same floxed <italic>Atrx</italic> mouse line has been used by us and others to successfully conduct loss of function studies in other organs, such as the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Brub1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Seah1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> or eye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Medina1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Since loss of ATRX does not affect cartilage development in mice, it seems likely that the skeletal defects in ATR-X patients are not due to direct effects of the mutant proteins in chondrocytes.</p><p>We have used the cartilage-specific collagen II promoter, which is activated around embryonic day 9, for inactivation of the <italic>Atrx</italic> gene. However, there remains a possibility that some of the limb phenotypes seen in ATR-X patients (e.g. patterning defects affecting the digits) are due to an earlier effect, such as a function in formation or outgrowth of the limb bud or in formation of the initial mesenchymal cell template. Since loss of ATRX occurs later in development in our model, we cannot rule out such an earlier function for the protein. Use of an early limb bud-specific promoter, such as the Prx1 limb enhancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Logan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, to direct <italic>Atrx</italic> inactivation could answer this outstanding question. Additionally, a later deficiency may also contribute to the observed patient skeletal abnormalities. For example, defects in osteoblasts could contribute to delayed bone age seen in patients or reduced overall growth. <italic>Atrx</italic> deletion specifically in osteoblasts could be induced by using the a1(I)-collagen promoter to drive cre expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Dacquin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. These experiments have been initiated in our laboratory.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the surprising lack of skeletal defects in our mice is that the skeletal defects observed in patients might be secondary to abnormalities in other organs, such as neuroendocrine defects stemming from ATRX dysfunction in the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Ballock1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. There is much new evidence demonstrating that bone growth can be regulated centrally via cytokines, hormones and transcription factors, including the hormone leptin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Takeda1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Experiments using leptin directly on bone cells have shown no effect on bone remodeling, however intracerebroventricular leptin infusion into leptin-deficient mice leads to an effect on bone mass via the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Takeda1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, hematopoietic systems within the bone marrow have been shown to be influenced by the neurohormone melanin and catecholamines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Maestroni1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Both factors also have hematopoietic roles, and are present in substantial amounts in the bone marrow, supporting the idea that neural and neuroendocrine factors have a direct effect on the bone microenvironment. Together, these studies suggest that cell defects in the hypothalamus (in the case of leptin) or the pineal gland (in the case of melatonin) may have a central influence on the development and homeostasis of the skeleton.</p><p>Importantly, it appears likely that the large variety of skeletal and growth abnormalities in ATRX patients does not have one common cellular origin; instead it appears that some defects (e.g. digit malformations) could be due to alterations in the early patterning of the limb, others (such as delayed bone age) could be caused by defects in osteoblasts (or possibly osteoclasts) and a third group (such as growth retardation) could be caused by abnormal neuroendocrine signaling. These possibilities will require examination as alternative mechanisms for the pathogenesis of ATR-X syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Histology and immunohistochemistry procedures were performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007106-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> with minor modifications.
