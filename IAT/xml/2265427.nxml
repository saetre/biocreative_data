Individuals with HLA-B&#x0002a;57 or B&#x0002a;5801 alleles, for example, target functionally important parts of the Gag protein. Mutants that escape these CTL responses may have lower fitness than the wild-type and can be associated with slower disease progression. Transmission of the escape variant to individuals without these HLA alleles is associated with rapid reversion to wild-type. However, the question of whether infection with an escape mutant offers an advantage to newly infected hosts has not been addressed. Here we investigate the relationship between the genotypes of transmitted viruses and prognostic markers of disease progression and show that infection with HLA-B&#x0002a;57/B&#x0002a;5801 escape mutants is associated with lower viral load and higher CD4&#x0002b; counts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Following infection with HIV, it is well established that a person's genetic makeup is a major determinant of how quickly they will progress to AIDS. Particularly important is the class I Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene that is responsible for alerting the immune system to HIV's presence. One of the reasons our immune systems are unable to beat HIV is that the virus can mutate to forms that our HLA genes no longer recognise. However, some people have versions of the HLA gene (for example HLA-B&#x0002a;57 and HLA-B&#x0002a;5801) that are known to force HIV to tolerate mutations that damage its ability to reproduce. Slower HIV reproduction is thought to be one reason that HLA-B&#x0002a;57 and HLA-B&#x0002a;5801 positive people progress to AIDS more slowly than most other HIV infected persons. We report here on a study of HLA-B&#x0002a;57 and HLA-B&#x0002a;5801 negative women in which better control of disease tended to be associated with their being infected with viruses carrying mutations that have been previously shown to reduce replication. These mutations characterise viruses found infecting HLA-B&#x0002a;57 and HLA-B&#x0002a;5801 positive people. This indicates for the first time that HLA-B&#x0002a;57 or HLA-B&#x0002a;5801 negative people that are infected by such reproductively compromised viruses may also experience better survival prospects.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Avoidance of host anti-viral responses is a major factor influencing the evolution of HIV genomes. Of particular importance for virus survival, and a major contributor to ongoing HIV-1 diversification worldwide, is continual escape from anti-HIV host cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. CTLs can potentially detect many small polypeptide epitope sequences encoded throughout HIV genomes. Evasion of CTL responses involves mutations within and around targeted epitopes that result in the peptide no longer binding to the Class I MHC grove, or non-recognition by the CTL T cell receptor, or interference with peptide processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Phillips1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Smith1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, mutations associated with CTL evasion can also incur significant viral replicative fitness costs and some escape mutations have therefore been associated with decreased viral loads. In the macaque model, for example, <italic>in vitro</italic> replication of SIVmac239 variants carrying certain CTL escape mutations is impaired relative to SIVmac239 without the mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Friedrich1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Peyerl1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Fitness costs associated with CTL escape have also been demonstrated in HIV-1 infected humans carrying either the B&#x0002a;57 or B&#x0002a;5801 HLA alleles. CTL escape mutations that frequently arise in these individuals, such as the T242N mutation in the Gag TW10 epitope and the A163X (X&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;G, N, D or S) mutation in the KF11 epitope, have been found to compromise viral replicative capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-MartinezPicado1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Crawford1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Because of the fitness costs associated with CTL escape mutations, specific HLA alleles backgrounds of HIV infected individuals have an influence on rates of disease progression.

We propose that these &#x0201c;attenuating&#x0201d; polymorphisms probably arose during virus passage through HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801-positive individuals and provide evidence that they have enabled better control of viral replication for up to at least a year following transmission to their current hosts. This is the first demonstration that transmission of HIV variants carrying HLA-associated escape mutations may also afford improved control of virus replication in HLA-mismatched recipients.

In CAP225 at 14.2 months, the escape mutation was detected in 8/14 clones (57&#x00025;), the reversion intermediate, S242 was identified in 4/14 clones (29&#x00025;), and T242 occurred in 2/14 clones (14&#x00025;).

Initial identification of these sites was based on a naive scan of all Gag amino acid polymorphisms to identify those associated with high CD4&#x0002b; counts and low viremia. The proposed mechanism whereby HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801 individuals achieve good control of HIV replication is unclear, although targeting of the Gag TW10, ISW9 and KF11 epitopes is thought to contribute to this control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Kiepiela1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Leslie1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Kiepiela2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Improved control of viral replication in such individuals is due, at least in part, to the fitness costs incurred by the T242N escape mutation in the TW10 epitope. We were therefore interested in determining the specific association of these escape mutations with viremia and CD4&#x0002b; counts following their transmission to HLA-B&#x0002a;57/B&#x0002a;5801 negative recipients.</p><p>Clinical data was available from all individuals at 62 days post infection and we compared viral load and CD4&#x0002b; dynamics up to 15 months post infection in the nine individuals infected with T242N/A146X mutants to those of the rest of the cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000033-g005">Figure 5a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000033.s002">Figure S2a and b</xref>). At all time points the mean log viral load and CD4&#x0002b; count was lower in the individuals infected with the T242N/A146X mutants. We found that, relative to the rest of the study participants, individuals infected with the T242N/A146X mutants had significantly lower viral loads and higher CD4&#x0002b; counts at three months post-infection (median log VL 4.53 vs. 5.09, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0077 and median CD4&#x0002b; count 652.0 vs. 460.0, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0129), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000033-g006">Figure 6a and b</xref>). At 12 months post infection, these individuals also had significantly lower viral loads and higher CD4&#x0002b; counts (median log VL 4.26 vs. 4.92, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0275 and median CD4&#x0002b; count 499.0 vs. 322.5, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0172), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000033-g006">Figure 6c and d</xref>). This suggests that, in HLA-B&#x0002a;57/B&#x0002a;5801 negative individuals, HIV-1 variants carrying the Gag T242N and A146X mutations tend to be less pathogenic than those which do not carry the mutations.

As both polymorphisms have been previously identified as HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801 immune evasion mutations we propose that they are probably genetic footprints of prior virus passage through HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801 positive individuals. While HLA imprinting of circulating HIV sequences is an established phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Moore1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-McMichael1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, our demonstration that such imprinting might enable better control of virus replication following transmission to HLA mismatched recipients is entirely novel.</p><p>While we do not provide definitive evidence that any of the studied viruses has been directly transmitted from HLA-B&#x0002a;57/B&#x0002a;5801 positive individuals, we have detected a strong signal of selection in the Gag HLA-B&#x0002a;57/B&#x0002a;5801 restricted epitope sequences of viruses carrying the A146X and T242N polymorphisms. This is suggestive of at least some of the viruses having been passaged through HLA-B&#x0002a;57/B&#x0002a;5801 positive individuals at some time in the past. Our speculation that the A146X/T242N mutants have been transmitted from either HLA-B&#x0002a;57 or HLA-B&#x0002a;5801 positive individuals is also consistent with previous reports dealing with the persistence of HLA-B&#x0002a;57/B&#x0002a;5801 associated immune evasion mutations. Two Gag mutations, H219X (X&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;Q, P or R) and the A146X polymorphism dealt with here, have been previously identified as relatively stable HLA-B&#x0002a;57/B&#x0002a;5801 genetic imprints on Gag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Leslie1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. These mutations appear to be epistatically associated with the T242N mutation but unlike the T242N mutation which reverts following transmission to HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801-negative hosts, the H219X and A146X mutations are often maintained even in the absence of the selective forces exerted by these alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Crawford1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Leslie1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Whereas the H219X mutation partially alleviates the fitness deficit incurred by the T242N mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-MartinezPicado1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, the A146X mutation has not been associated with any significant fitness loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Draenert1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, we detected the H219X mutation in two participants, one associated with a T242N mutation and the other was associated with the A146X mutation. In the latter case the presence of the H219X mutation suggests that this virus may have descended from a T242N mutant.</p><p>The possibility that most, if not all, of the six women infected with viruses carrying the T242N mutation were directly infected by HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801-positive individuals is additionally supported by our observation that the mutation reverted in five of the individuals during the study period. It is, however, more uncertain whether viruses carrying the A146X mutation but not the T242N mutation were transmitted directly from HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801-positive individuals. It cannot be discounted that the A146X mutation in these viruses might be a persistent imprint of a more distant passage through an HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801 positive individual. While we have detected reversions of this mutation, it has persisted in the viruses infecting seven of the nine individuals studied here for more than two years and is clearly more stable than the T242N mutation. If the mutation had a reversion half-life of four or more years (as is suggested by our data) it would not be surprising if some of the A146X mutants we have studied had been serially transmitted two or more times since they first arose. Our detection of significant phylogenetic clustering of <italic>gag</italic> sequences carrying HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801 associated escape mutations supports the notion that many of these mutations may persist for epidemiologically significant time periods in HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801 negative individuals.</p><p>Reversion of the T242N escape mutation did not result in a concomitant increase in viral load. There is a relationship between viral load during primary infection and viral load set-point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Kelley1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and it is possible that these escape mutations provided a long term benefit by reducing viremia during acute infection. It is also possible that, amongst the viruses studied, reversion mutations in <italic>gag</italic> were not sufficient on their own to fully restore fitness and that there may have been other HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801 associated escape and compensatory mutations elsewhere in their genomes that impacted on their fitness. Although there was only a marginal correlation between viral load and infection with variants harbouring both T242N and A146X mutations (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0733), this relationship was much stronger when individuals infected with only the A146X mutation were included in the analysis (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0275). This supports the existence of a network of B&#x0002a;57/5801 associated mutations that could contribute to viral control. Brockman <italic>et. al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Brockman1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> recently reported several novel compensatory mutations, associated with the T242N escape mutation, which correlated with higher viral loads. It might have been expected that the two individuals (CAP045 and CAP061) whose viruses had compensatory mutations would have higher viral loads as compared to those infected with the T242N/A146X-carrying viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-MartinezPicado1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000033-Brockman1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Viral loads in these individuals were, in fact, lower. While our data suggests that, within the first year of infection, B&#x0002a;57/5801-negative individuals infected with viruses carrying these escape mutations have lower viral loads, the long-term impact on disease progression is unknown.</p><p>The T-cell responses determined in this study could not explain the differences in viral loads observed for the individuals infected with the escape mutants compared to those infected with the wild-type variants. The number of individuals that responded to Gag did not differ between the two groups and there were no significant differences in the magnitude or breadth of Gag IFN-gamma ELIspot responses between the two groups. However, it is likely that we are underestimating the T-cell responses due to the use of consensus based subtype C reagents compared to autologous peptides. In addition, experimental limitations could also be a contributing factor as the IFN-gamma ELIspot assay does not detect all T-cell responses.</p><p>We have therefore demonstrated that, during the acute phase of infection at least, individuals who are infected with viruses carrying markers indicative of previous selection in HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801 positive individuals experience both significantly lower viral loads and higher CD4&#x0002b; counts than individuals infected with viruses without these markers. These lower initial viral loads and higher CD4&#x0002b; counts at the onset of infection may slow disease progression in these individuals. The possibility that an interacting network of attenuating mutations may be responsible for the lower viral loads experienced by people infected with viruses passaged through HLA-B&#x0002a;57/5801 positive individuals should be investigated further as the existence of such networks could profoundly influence our understanding of HIV pathogenesis. Current opinion is that first generation CTL based vaccines are likely to be only partially effective. Our study suggests that such vaccines should contain epitopes where escape is associated with a fitness cost to the virus as this might drive the attenuation of viruses in individuals who become infected despite vaccination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study Participants</title><p>Participants in this study are part of the CAPRISA 002 cohort investigating the role of viral and immunological factors in acute and early HIV-1 infections.
