Tax increases p27<sup>KIP1 </sup>protein stability by activating the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) precociously, causing degradation of Skp2 and inactivation of SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>, the E3 ligase that targets p27<sup>KIP1</sup>. The rate of p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1 </sup>protein turnover, however, is unaffected by Tax. Rather, the mRNA of p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1 </sup>is greatly up-regulated. Here we show that Tax increases p21 mRNA expression by transcriptional activation and mRNA stabilization. Transcriptional activation of p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1 </sup>by Tax occurs in a p53-independent manner and requires two tumor growth factor-&#x003b2;-inducible Sp1 binding sites in the -84 to -60 region of the p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1 </sup>promoter. Tax binds Sp1 directly, and the CBP/p300-binding activity of Tax is required for p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1 </sup>trans-activation. Tax also increases the stability of p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1 </sup>transcript. Several Tax mutants trans-activated the p21 promoter, but were attenuated in stabilizing p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1 </sup>mRNA, and were less proficient in increasing p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1 </sup>expression. The possible involvement of Tax-mediated APC/C activation in p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1 </sup>mRNA stabilization is discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-associated myelopathy. HTLV-1 encodes a 40 kDa trans-activator, Tax, which plays a crucial role in viral replication and cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Tax activates the expression of viral and cellular genes by interacting with a variety of host cell factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] including transcription factors CREB/ATF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and the regulatory subunit of the I-&#x003ba;B kinase, IKK&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that Tax causes many eukaryotic cells to develop mitotic abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We have found recently that Tax can commit eukaryotic cells into a senescence-like state with dramatically up-regulated expression of p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1 </sup>(p21) and p27<sup>KIP1 </sup>(p27) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. More recently, we have found that both transduction of the <italic>tax </italic>gene and infection with HTLV-1 can cause HeLa cells and SupT1 cells to become senescent or cell cycle arrested with greatly elevated levels of p21 and p27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The sharp rise in p27 induced by Tax is due to the aberrant activation of a critical E3 ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which controls mitotic progression and exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The prematurely activated APC/C causes Skp2, the substrate-targeting subunit of another E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>, to be degraded during S phase. The loss of Skp2 leads to the inactivation of SCF<sup>Skp2 </sup>and the dramatic stabilization of p27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], a key substrate of SCF<sup>Skp2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>P21 was initially characterized as an important inhibitor of cyclin/Cdk2 complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It becomes induced by the tumor suppressor p53 in response to DNA damage and arrests the cell cycle at the G<sub>1</sub>/S checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Subsequent studies have revealed that p21 can bind the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and further inhibits DNA synthesis during S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. As a potent inhibitor of G1/S Cdks and DNA replication, p21 plays an important role in terminal differentiation and senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It can confer protection from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Paradoxically, p21 also serves as a platform for the interaction between cyclin D and Cdk4/6, and promotes the assembly of active G1 Cdk complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>A wide variety of mechanisms including transcriptional regulation, mRNA degradation, ubiquitin-dependent or ubiquitin-independent proteolysis, and subcellular localization are known to regulate the level and activity of p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. At the transcriptional level, even though tumor suppressor p53 is a major trans-activator of p21, other transcription factors such as Sp1/Sp3, E2F, Smads, AP2, CAAT/enhancer-binding proteins, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and BRCA1 also regulate p21 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It has been shown previously that Tax functionally inactivates p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Since p53 plays a major role in the expression of p21, the dramatic up-regulation of p21 by Tax would appear to be affected by a p53-independent mechanism. Indeed, earlier studies have indicated that to be the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Here we show that the Tax-responsive element in the p21 promoter resides in two Sp1-binding sites (in the -84 to -60 region) previously shown to mediate the induction of p21 expression by tumor growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Trans-activation of these regulatory elements by Tax and by Sp1 are additive. Our data suggest that Tax directly tethers Sp1 and the ability of Tax to interact with CBP/p300 is important for p21 promoter trans-activation.</p><p>Transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter alone, however, cannot fully explain the dramatic increase in p21 brought about by Tax. We provide evidence to show that p21 mRNA stability is greatly increased in the presence of Tax. Analyses of newly isolated Tax mutants suggest that the ability of Tax to activate APC/C also correlates with p21 mRNA stabilization. These results reveal a hitherto unknown property of Tax in regulating p21 mRNA turnover.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of the Tax-responsive element in the p21 promoter</title><p>Previous studies have shown that HTLV-1 Tax can trans-activate the p21 promoter independently of the tumor suppressor, p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The <italic>cis </italic>elements in the p21 promoter responsible for Tax trans-activation have not been well defined, however. To this end, we obtained a full-length p21 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (p21) and a derivative (p21&#x00394;1) that contains a truncated p21 promoter, which begins at 298 nucleotides upstream (-298) and ends at 16 nucleotides downstream (+16) of the p21 mRNA start site. We also constructed two p21 promoter deletions with progressively shortened DNA sequences (100 and 60 bps) upstream of the p21 transcriptional start site. These deletions were inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase gene to produce p21&#x00394;2, and p21&#x00394;3 respectively. Each of these reporter plasmids was transfected into HeLa/18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP cells together with a Tax expression plasmid, pBC12-Tax. The luciferase reporter activities were then measured 48 h after transfection.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Tax trans-activated the reporter containing the full-length p21 promoter approximately five-fold. Mutants p21&#x00394;1 and p21&#x00394;2, which contained 298 and 100 bp upstream of the p21 transcriptional start site respectively, were activated by Tax to similar extent as the full-length promoter. Since the p53-response elements are localized in the -2285 and -2255 region of p21 promoter, our results are consistent with previous reports that activation of p21 promoter by Tax is p53-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Importantly, the deletion containing only the -60 sequence of the p21 promoter completely lost Tax responsiveness, indicating that the <italic>cis </italic>element responsible for the transcriptional induction by Tax resides between the -100 to -60 region. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that two binding sites for the Sp1 family of transcriptional factors reside within the sequence between -83 and -64, and this region mediates up-regulation of p21 transcription in response to tumor growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) and arsenic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of the Tax-responsive elements in the p21 promoter</bold>. <italic>A</italic>, The DNA sequence of the region covering 130 nucleotides upstream and 8 nucleotides downstream of the p21 mRNA start site (is shown (Top). The p21-Luc reporter plasmid contains a 2342 bp DNA fragment that spans 2326 bp upstream and 16 bp downstream of the p21 transcriptional start site fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene. The p21 promoter truncation p21&#x00394;1, p21&#x00394;2, and p21&#x00394;3 have their 5' termini ending at 298, 100, and 60 upstream of the p21 transcriptional start site (see METHODS). HeLa/18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP cells were transfected in triplicate with the respective luciferase reporter constructs with or without a Tax expression plasmid, BC12-Tax. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection for luciferase assays as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. All firefly luciferase reporter assays were normalized against HSV thymidine kinase (TK) promoter-driven renilla luciferase reporter activities.

The constructs p21P93-Smut-1, 2, and 3 contain base substitutions in the Sp1 binding sites localized in -93 to -84, -83 to -74, and -73 to -64 regions of the p21 promoter respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-6-35-1"/></fig><p>To further define the <italic>cis </italic>element responsible for Tax induction, we analyzed three mutants: p21P93-S-mut-1, mut-2 and mut-3, each containing ten consecutive base substitutions in the -93 to -84, -83 to -74, and -73 to -64 sequences, with the latter two mutations spanning the Sp1-binding sites Sp1&#x02013;3 and Sp1&#x02013;4 respectively. As indicated by reporter assays, base substitutions in the sequence between -93 and -84 had no effect on Tax induction. By contrast, p21P93-S-mut-2 completely lost Tax responsiveness, while p21P93-S-mut-3 was partially impaired (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These results indicate that Sp1&#x02013;3, and to a lesser extent, Sp1&#x02013;4, is critical for Tax-mediated activation of the p21 promoter. Interestingly, the Tax-responsive element coincided exactly with the TGF-&#x003b2; responsive element previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Trans-activation of the p21 promoter by Tax and Sp1 are additive</title><p>Because Sp1 had been shown earlier to mediate TGF-&#x003b2; induction of p21 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], we examined if Sp1 is also involved in Tax-mediated trans-activation of the p21 promoter. In agreement with published literature, transfection of an expression construct for Sp1, Flag-Sp1, activated the p21 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Co-transfection of the p21&#x00394;1-Luc reporter with a fixed amount of Tax-expression construct, pBC12-Tax, and increasing amounts of Flag-Sp1 indicated that Tax functions additively with Sp1 to augment luciferase gene expression driven by the p21 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Similar results were obtained when a constant amount of Flag-Sp1 DNA and increasing amounts of pBC12-Tax were used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These results suggest that Tax and TGF-&#x003b2; possibly act through distinct mechanisms to activate p21 expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Trans-activation of the p21 promoter by Tax and Sp1 is additive</bold>. <italic>A</italic>, HeLa/18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP cells were transfected with 1 &#x003bc;g of p21&#x00394;1-Luc either alone or in combination with increasing amounts (1, 2, or 3 &#x003bc;g) of an Sp1 expression plasmid, Flag-Sp1.

To this end, a HeLa cell line containing a Tax-responsive reporter cassette, 18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP, was transfected with the pBC12-Tax plamid. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that greater than 80% of HeLa cells had been transfected and became EGFP-positive (not shown).

This, together with the fact that Tax causes a 40 fold increase in p21 mRNA level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], but only activated p21 promoter 5 fold, suggest that post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in Tax-mediated increase of p21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The reporter activities, the proficiency in causing G1 arrest, and the extent p21 of induction of the various Tax alleles are summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Tax stabilizes p27 but does not affect p21 protein turn-over</title><p>We have shown recently that the premature activation of the mitotic E3 ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase promoting complex, by Tax leads to the polyubiqutination and degradation of Skp2, and consequently, inactivation of the G1/S E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>. As a result, p27, a key substrates of SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>, becomes greatly stabilized when Tax is expressed, causing HeLa cells to enter into a state of irreversible G1 arrest termed Tax-induced rapid senescence (Tax-IRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Based on a previous report that suggested that p21 might be a substrate of SCF<sup>Skp2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], we initially attributed the concurrent and even more dramatic surge in p21 induced by Tax to the inactivation of SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>. To determine the rate of p21 and p27 protein turnover, HeLa/18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP cells transduced with LV-Tax or a control lentivirus vector, LV-puro, were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit <italic>de novo </italic>protein synthesis. The abundance of p21 and p27 in transduced cells was then measured after the cessation of protein translation. As indicated and reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the half-life of p27 in cells transduced by LV-Tax is considerably longer than that in cells transduced with LV-puro (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). A different result was obtained when the half-life of p21 was measured. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, the stability of p21 is not significantly altered by Tax (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These results confirm the notion that p27 is a substrate of SCF<sup>Skp2 </sup>and becomes stabilized as a consequence of premature activation of APC/C and inactivation of SCF<sup>Skp2 </sup>by Tax. By contrast, even though the Tax-induced increase in p21 and p27 correlated with APC/C activation, the up-regulation of p21 by Tax is achieved by a mechanism independent of SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>- and ubiquitin-mediated protein turnover.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Tax stabilizes p27 but not p21</bold>. <italic>A</italic>, Tax increases the half-life of p27 protein.

To this end, the HeLa/18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP cells were cultured in a six-well plate and transduced with LV-Tax for 48 h. Expression of the EGFP gene in HeLa/18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP is driven by 18 copies of the Tax-responsive 21-bp-repeat. Therefore, the efficiency of <italic>tax </italic>gene transfer into HeLa/18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP could be assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Care was taken to ensure that greater than 90% and comparable numbers of reporter cells were transduced with the respective lentivirus vectors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, EGFP-positive cells, left panels). For the Tax mutant M47, which is impaired in activating the 18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP cassette, in addition to the weaker EGFP signal detected, immunoblot of the transduced cells was also carried out to confirm that the level of M47 expression was equivalent to that of other Tax alleles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> right panels).

Reverse transcription followed by quantitative real-time PCR was then used to measure the abundance of p21 mRNA at each time point.

As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, the half-life of p21 mRNA increased from 2.5 h to 4.5 h in the presence of Tax. Based on the length of the HeLa cell cycle of approximately 16&#x02013;18 h, the amplification of p21 mRNA through this mechanism is likely to be in range of more than 10 fold within one cell cycle. This, coupled with the 5-fold induction of p21 promoter, could explain the increase in p21 mRNA transcript induced by Tax[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Tax increases the half-life of p21 mRNA</bold>. <italic>A</italic>, HeLa/18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP cells were transduced with LV-puro, LV-Tax, LV-M22, and LV-M47 as described in METHODS.

HeLa/18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP cells were transduced with the respective lentivirus vectors for 48 hours as in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>. Immunoblot of L235F, M22, and M47 suggests that their levels of expression were comparable, with the level of M47 moderately higher (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> left panels). As mentioned above, despite their wild-type-like competency in trans-activating p21 promoter, L235F and M22 were attenuated in up-regulating p21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Indeed, a direct measurement of the rate of p21 mRNA decay indicated that both L235F and M22 failed to stabilize p21 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>), with the p21 mRNA half-life of the respective transduced cells similar to that of the LV-puro-transduced control in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>. Remarkably, the M47 mutant dramatically delayed the turnover of p21 mRNA (T<sub>1/2 </sub>&#x02248; 9 h) and up-regulated p21 mRNA and protein expression to a much greater extent than the wild-type Tax (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> right panel). Together, these results indicate that both promoter activation and mRNA stabilization are crucial for the sharp increase in p21 expression activated by Tax. Since L235F is attenuated in APC/C activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], this deficiency is likely responsible for the failure of L235F in increasing the stability of p21 mRNA transcript.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that two independent mechanisms: trans-activation and mRNA stabilization are responsible for the dramatic up-regulation of p21 by Tax. Our data are in agreement with other studies showing that Tax up-regulates p21 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. We have mapped the <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the p21 promoter that mediate Tax trans-activation to two Sp1-binding sites (-83 to -64) near the p21 mRNA start site. This region has been shown previously to be critical for TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated trans-activation of p21. Tax does not alter the intracellular level of Sp1. Rather it binds Sp1 directly. Analyses of Tax mutants further suggest that the interaction between Tax and CBP/p300 is important for p21 promoter trans-activation. Our results are consistent with a model in which Tax may serve as a tether between Sp1 and CBP/p300, and possibly help recruit the latter to the p21 promoter to activate transcription. These results are in agreement with a previous report that Tax can interact with Sp1 to activate c-sis/platelet-derived growth factor-B promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Importantly, the 5-fold trans-activation of the p21 promoter cannot account fully for the dramatic 40-fold up-regulation of p21 by Tax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our data further indicate that Tax also induces post-transcriptional stabilization of p21 mRNA.</p><p>The level of p21, like that of p27, is cell cycle-regulated. It increases transiently after cellular exit from mitosis and entry into G1, and declines during G1/S transition. The increase in p21 and p27 after mitotic exit serves to maintain cells in G1 until such time when a new round of DNA replication is warranted. P21 also functions as a scaffold/chaperone for Cdk4-Cdk6/cyclin D assembly, thus helps set the stage for a new round of cell cycle. Since APC/C is intimately involved in regulating mitotic progression and mitotic exit, it is not surprising that the transient increase of p21 and p27 during early G1 is linked to the APC/C activity.</p><p>P27 is a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCF<sup>Skp2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which targets p27 for degradation. Recent evidence has indicated that Skp2 and another component of the SCF complex, Cks1, are both substrates of APC/C. During mitotic exit, APC<sup>Cdh1 </sup>targets the degradation of Skp2 and Cks1, thereby rendering SCF<sup>Skp2 </sup>inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This in turn leads to the transient stabilization of p27 during G1. We have found that APC/C becomes activated by Tax in an unscheduled manner during S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], thus causing premature degradation of a number of mitotic and cell cycle regulators including cyclin B1 and Skp2. The loss of Skp2 (and possibly Cks1) in turn causes Tax-expressing cells to accumulate p27 throughout S, G2, and M, leading to rapid senescence. Indeed, the half-life of p27 protein becomes greatly increased by Tax (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]).</p><p>Based on earlier reports that p21 may be a substrate of SCF<sup>Skp2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], we originally thought that the dramatic increase in p21 induced by Tax is also mediated by the same mechanism as that for p27, i.e. through the inactivation of SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>. Contrary to earlier reports, our present data suggest that p21 is not a substrate of SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>, and the protein stability of p21, unlike that of p27, is not affected by Tax (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Rather, in addition to the aforementioned p21 promoter trans-activation, Tax also causes p21 mRNA half-life to increase significantly. Our data further suggest that APC/C activation by Tax is responsible for the dramatic stabilization of p21 mRNA.</p><p>We have previously isolated several Tax mutants whose expression did not cause <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>to undergo cell cycle arrest. Most of these mutants, including L235F and A108T, are attenuated in up-regulating p21 and p27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Importantly, they were found to be impaired in activating the APC/C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the inability of APC/C-deficient L235F and A108T mutants to fully up-regulate p21 is not due to a deficit in p21 promoter trans-activation. An in-depth analysis of L235F indicates that it is attenuated in stabilizing p21 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Based on these results, we suggest that the stabilization of p21 mRNA during normal cell cycle progression or by Tax may be causally linked to the activity of the APC/C E3 ligase. Alternatively, since IKK-NF-&#x003ba;B activation and APC/C activation by Tax appear correlated [27], the stabilization of p21 may be a result of IKK or NF-&#x003ba;B activation. How APC/C activity or IKK/NF-&#x003ba;B activation leads to p21 mRNA stabilization mechanistically remains to be determined.</p><p>It has been reported previously that the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the p21 transcript contains AU-rich elements (AREs) that destabilizes p21 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. RNA-binding proteins of the HuR family including HuR and its homologues HuB, HuC, and HuD, on the other hand, bind AREs and prevent ARE-containing mRNAs such as that of p21 from degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. HuR proteins reside in the nucleus and their interaction with mRNA is facilitated by increased cytoplasmic localization of HuR or through post-translational modifications of HuR that increases its RNA binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Whether Tax-APC/C-mediated and HuR-related mechanisms of p21 mRNA stabilization are connected is currently under investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The HeLa/18 &#x000d7; 21-EGFP cell line was generated previously by transducing the parental HeLa cell line with a reporter cassette containing the EGFP gene under the control of 18 copies of the Tax-responsive 21-bp repeat element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].
