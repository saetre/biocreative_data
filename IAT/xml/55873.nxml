The yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> maintains several repair systems that are each responsible for specific types of damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c2">2</xref>). The <italic>RAD3</italic> group mediates nucleotide excision repair of pyrimidine dimers and other bulky lesions, the <italic>RAD52</italic> group encodes the factors for double-strand break repair via homologous recombination and the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway of post-replication repair (PRR) is believed to act upon single-stranded gaps that arise during DNA replication on damaged templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c3">3</xref>). While nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination are mechanistically quite well understood, little is known about the molecular details of PRR. Extensive genetic analysis, however, has revealed an intricate system of several independent sub-branches. Notably, two fundamentally different modes of repair can be distinguished within the <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent repair system: while error-prone repair involves translesion synthesis across a damaged site, error-free repair has been proposed to use information from the undamaged sister chromatid for correct reversal of the damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c3">3</xref>).</p><p><italic> RAD6</italic>, which is epistatic to all other members of this pathway, encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) whose catalytic activity is essential for function in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c5">5</xref>). Mutations in this gene confer a pleiotropic phenotype, involving a high degree of sensitivity towards DNA-damaging agents, a defect in damage-induced mutagenesis as well as an increased rate of spontaneous mutagenesis, but also defects apparently unrelated to DNA repair, including a reduced growth rate, temperature sensitivity and the inability to sporulate (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c6">6</xref>). Other members of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway exhibit different subsets of the repair phenotypes, with varying degrees of UV sensitivity and variable effects on mutagenesis and recombination. Rad18p, a DNA-binding RING finger protein that forms a stable complex with Rad6p and is believed to target the UBC to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c7">7</xref>), is apparently involved in all <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent sub-pathways of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c9">9</xref>). The error-prone system is characterized by a specific damage-tolerant polymerase, Pol&#x003b6;, encoded by <italic>REV3</italic> and <italic>REV7</italic>, which is capable of translesion synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c11">11</xref>). Another <italic>RAD6</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>RAD18</italic>-dependent translesion polymerase is Pol&#x003b7;, encoded by <italic>RAD30</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c14">14</xref>). The <italic>RAD5</italic> gene acts independently of both sub-pathways, but again depends on <italic>RAD6</italic> and <italic>RAD18</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c17">17</xref>). Mutants of <italic>RAD5</italic> exhibit a reduced rate of damage-induced mutagenesis in some assays, but since this&#x000a0;effect is limited to specific types of mutations, <italic>RAD5</italic>-dependent repair has also been classified as error free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c18">18</xref>). <italic>RAD5</italic> encodes a DNA-dependent ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c19">19</xref>) with homology to the <italic>SNF2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>SWI2</italic> family of helicases and chromatin remodeling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c20">20</xref>). Recently, it was shown that there appears to be a second error-free pathway in addition to that mediated by <italic>RAD5</italic>: a mutation in the <italic>POL30</italic> gene encoding the polymerase processivity factor PCNA, <italic>pol30-46</italic>, which&#x000a0;&#x000a0;had&#x000a0;&#x000a0;previously been assigned to the error-free <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent sub-system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c21">21</xref>), was found to act additively or even synergistically with respect to a <italic>rad5</italic> mutation, suggesting their involvement in alternative pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c22">22</xref>).</p><p> A second ubiquitin-conjugating activity has been found associated with the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway: <italic>MMS2</italic>, encoding a UBC-like protein, was cloned by complementation of a mutant sensitive to the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and was assigned to an error-free sub-branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c23">23</xref>). The Mms2p protein was later shown to form a heterodimer with Ubc13p, a genuine UBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c24">24</xref>). This complex assembles multi-ubiquitin chains that are linked in a non-standard way, via Lys63 (K63) of ubiquitin instead of the prevalent Lys48 linkage. In fact, mutants of ubiquitin in which K63 is replaced by arginine (<italic>ubiK63R</italic>) display a UV sensitivity identical to that of <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>ubc13</italic> mutants, indicating that these non-standard multi-ubiquitin chains are relevant to PRR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c25">25</xref>). A dependence of <italic>UBC13</italic> and <italic>MMS2</italic> on <italic>RAD5</italic> has been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c26">26</xref>), which is supported by the observation that Rad5p protein physically interacts with Ubc13p and recruits the Ubc13p&#x0002f;Mms2p dimer to chromatin, in a manner similar to the recruitment of Rad6p by Rad18p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c26">26</xref>).</p><p> The <italic>SRS2</italic> gene &#x0005b;independently identified as <italic>HPR5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c27">27</xref>) and <italic>RADH</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c28">28</xref>)&#x0005d; represents an unusual member of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway: mutation or deletion of this gene was found to partially suppress the UV sensitivities of <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c30">30</xref>). Suppression depends on a functional recombination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c31">31</xref>). <italic>SRS2</italic> encodes a helicase with 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c32">32</xref>) and is involved in a variety of processes associated with DNA metabolism, such as recombination and gene conversion, as well as double-strand break repair by single-strand annealing and non-homologous end-joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c37">37</xref>). It remains to be elucidated how <italic>SRS2</italic> acts in PRR. In order to define the relation of <italic>SRS2</italic> to the various sub-systems of PRR I have analyzed the effect of an <italic>srs2</italic> deletion on the UV sensitivities of a series of <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway mutants. I present evidence that the suppression effect of <italic>srs2</italic> is specific for the branch mediated by <italic>RAD5</italic>, <italic>UBC13</italic> and <italic>MMS2</italic>. Further support for a concerted action of these factors within the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway is given by genetic analyses that place <italic>MMS2</italic> and <italic>UBC13</italic> in the <italic>RAD5</italic>-dependent repair system under several different experimental conditions. Finally, I present evidence that <italic>MMS2</italic>, like <italic>UBC13</italic> and most other members of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway, is a damage-inducible gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Standard protocols were followed for the preparation of yeast media, transformation, sporulation and tetrad dissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c39">39</xref>).

The <italic>pol30-46</italic> mutation was introduced into the DF5 background by deletion of one <italic>POL30</italic> allele in diploid cells, introduction of pBL230-46, a centromeric plasmid bearing the <italic>pol30-46</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c21">21</xref>), and sporulation of the transformants.

In contrast, an independent study found additivity between the UV sensitivities of the <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>rad5</italic> mutations, while no data were shown for <italic>ubc13 </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c22">22</xref>). In order to shed light on this issue the relationship between <italic>RAD5</italic> and <italic>MMS2</italic> as well as <italic>UBC13</italic> was re-examined under a number of different experimental conditions. A possible dependence on the cell cycle was examined by irradiation of cells arrested in different stages of the cell cycle and subsequent determination of survival. Two different methods were applied for optimal detection of slight differences in UV sensitivities: overall sensitivities were compared qualitatively by applying a gradient of UV dosage to cells streaked in parallel lines across a Petri dish; in addition, exact survival rates were determined by irradiation with specified dosages and colony counting (see Materials and Methods). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f1">1</xref>A shows the survival of <italic>rad5 ubc13</italic> and <italic>rad5 mms2</italic> in comparison to the <italic>wt</italic> and single mutants after irradiation of stationary (G<sub>0</sub>), exponential, hydroxyurea-arrested (S) and nocodazole-treated (G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M) cells. The <italic>wt</italic> cells are significantly more sensitive when irradiated in G<sub>0</sub> than in S or G<sub>2</sub> phase. This situation is reversed in <italic>rad5</italic> mutants, confirming recent observations by Friedl <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c33">33</xref>). Since cells arrested in G<sub>1</sub> with &#x003b1; factor show the same sensitivity as stationary cells (data not shown), this variation must be due to cell cycle stage and not to metabolic differences. Nevertheless, within each stage of the cell cycle the sensitivities of <italic>rad5</italic>, <italic>rad5 ubc13</italic> and <italic>rad5 mms2</italic> cells were indistinguishable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f1">1</xref>A and B). As it is conceivable that inactivation of other repair pathways might exacerbate any additional defects of the <italic>rad5 ubc13</italic> and <italic>rad5 mms2</italic> double mutants, UV sensitivities were also re-examined in <italic>rad2</italic> and <italic>rad52</italic> backgrounds, defective in nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination, respectively. Again, identical sensitivities were found for <italic>rad5</italic>, <italic>rad5 ubc13</italic> and <italic>rad5 mms2</italic> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f1">1</xref>C and D). These experiments confirm that in the strain background used for this study the function of <italic>UBC13</italic> and <italic>MMS2</italic> is fully dependent on the presence of <italic>RAD5</italic> and thus support our previous assignment of <italic>UBC13</italic> and <italic>MMS2</italic> to the <italic>RAD5</italic>-dependent branch of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c26">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>srs2</italic> acts as a suppressor specific for the <italic>RAD5</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>UBC13</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>MMS2</italic>-dependent branch of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway</title><p>In order to define the position of <italic>SRS2</italic> with respect to the different sub-branches of the PRR system, the effect of an <italic>srs2</italic> deletion on the UV sensitivities of other <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway mutants, <italic>rad5</italic>, <italic>ubc13</italic>, <italic>mms2</italic>, <italic>rad30</italic>, <italic>pol30-46</italic> and <italic>rev3</italic>, was examined. Since many of the single mutants are only slightly more UV-sensitive than <italic>srs2</italic> itself, again the qualitative gradient assay and the colony assay were both applied for optimal detection of a possible suppression effect. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f2">2</xref>A shows that the UV sensitivities of <italic>rad5</italic>, <italic>ubc13</italic> and <italic>mms2</italic> are all suppressed by the <italic>srs2</italic> deletion. Consequently, all three double mutants, <italic>rad5 srs2</italic>, <italic>ubc13 srs2</italic> and <italic>mms2 srs2</italic>, display low UV sensitivities very similar to the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant. In contrast, the <italic>rad30 srs2</italic> and <italic>pol30-46 srs2</italic> double mutants are significantly more UV-sensitive than each of the corresponding single mutants. In the case of <italic>rev3</italic>, the effect of <italic>srs2</italic> is less clear, since the UV sensitivity of the <italic>rev3</italic> deletion is even weaker than that of <italic>srs2</italic>, precluding the identification of a visible suppression effect.</p><p> Quantitative survival curves for the individual strains are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f2">2</xref>B&#x02013;H. Again, the <italic>srs2</italic> suppression effect on <italic>rad5</italic>, <italic>ubc13</italic> and <italic>mms2</italic> is evident (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f2">2</xref>B&#x02013;D), while additive effects are observed with the <italic>rad30</italic> and <italic>pol30-46</italic> mutants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f2">2</xref>F and G). Suppression of the <italic>rad5</italic> mutation is in good agreement with recent data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c33">33</xref>). Moreover, those double mutants in which suppression is active also display the characteristic curve shape of the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant itself. This S-shaped curve has been observed previously with exponential <italic>srs2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c28">28</xref>) and is due to a sub-population of highly UV-sensitive cells within the culture that likely corresponds to G<sub>1</sub> cells, which are much more sensitive to UV irradiation than G<sub>2</sub> cells. Thus, the <italic>srs2</italic> mutation behaves epistatic to <italic>rad5</italic>, <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>ubc13</italic> in this respect. Again, the effect of <italic>srs2</italic> on the <italic>rev3</italic> mutant is not easily interpretable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f2">2</xref>H), but the absence of additivity suggests an epistatic relation, which is also supported by the <italic>srs2</italic>-like shape of the survival curve of the <italic>rev3 srs2</italic> double mutant. In conclusion, the <italic>srs2</italic> suppressor acts in a manner specific for the <italic>RAD5</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>UBC13</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>MMS2</italic>-dependent branch of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>srs2</italic> acts a suppressor of the <italic>ubiK63R</italic> mutation</title><p>Due to the modest UV sensitivities of <italic>ubc13</italic> and <italic>mms2</italic> mutants the extent of suppression by <italic>srs2</italic> is relatively weak compared to the effect on <italic>rad5</italic>. In order to confirm that the observed phenomenon is specific for the error-free repair branch, the consequences of an <italic>srs2</italic> deletion were examined in the <italic>ubiK63R</italic> strain, in which all the repair proteins are present and the only modification is a point mutation in the ubiquitin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c25">25</xref>). As K63 of ubiquitin serves as a substrate for ubiquitin chain polymerization by the Ubc13p&#x02013;Mms2p dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c24">24</xref>), the corresponding mutant should display a phenotype identical to the <italic>mms2</italic> or <italic>ubc13</italic> deletion strains. When compared to the isogenic <italic>wt</italic> strain, suppression of UV sensitivity by <italic>srs2</italic> was indeed observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f2">2</xref>A and E).</p></sec><sec><title>Suppression by <italic>srs2</italic> depends on a functional recombination system</title><p>The suppression effect of <italic>srs2</italic> is dependent on functional homologous recombination, presumably because of a channeling of lesions into recombinational repair in the absence of <italic>SRS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c31">31</xref>). Thus, if the <italic>srs2</italic> effects on <italic>ubc13</italic>, <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>rad5</italic> are functionally related, suppression should be abolished in a <italic>rad52</italic> background. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f3">3</xref> shows that this is the case: deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> in the <italic>rad52 ubc13</italic>, <italic>rad52 mms2</italic> and <italic>rad52 rad5</italic> double mutants did not result in any change in UV sensitivities. The same situation was observed with the <italic>rad52 rad18</italic> double mutant. Likewise, no suppression of <italic>ubc13</italic> or <italic>mms2</italic> by <italic>srs2</italic> was observed in stationary phase cells, which predominantly exist with an unreplicated genome (in G<sub>0</sub>) and should thus be incapable of repair by recombination between sister chromatids (data not shown). In conclusion, the relationship between <italic>SRS2</italic> and the members of the <italic>RAD5</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>UBC13</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>MMS2</italic>-dependent branch of PRR is comparable to that between <italic>SRS2</italic> and <italic>RAD18</italic> or <italic>RAD6</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>MMS2</italic> is a damage-inducible gene like <italic>UBC13</italic></title><p>Most of the genes involved in post-replication DNA repair have been shown to be inducible by DNA damage, such as <italic>RAD6</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c44">44</xref>), <italic>RAD18</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c45">45</xref>), <italic>RAD30</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c12">12</xref>), <italic>RAD5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c46">46</xref>) and <italic>UBC13</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c48">48</xref>). Considering the close cooperation between Mms2p and the other members of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway in DNA repair, the <italic>MMS2</italic> gene should be expected to be regulated in a similar fashion. I therefore investigated the effect of UV irradiation as well as MMS treatment on transcription of the <italic>MMS2</italic> gene by northern analysis. Probes specific for the <italic>ACT1</italic> and <italic>UBC13</italic> transcripts served as controls for a constitutively expressed and a damage-inducible gene, respectively. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f4">4</xref>A shows that the <italic>MMS2</italic> mRNA levels increased by a factor of 3 after UV irradiation, while treatment with 0.1&#x00025; MMS afforded a 6-fold induction. These values are comparable to the roughly 5-fold induction of the <italic>UBC13</italic> transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f4">4</xref>A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c48">48</xref>). Interestingly, however, the induction of <italic>MMS2</italic> by MMS followed significantly slower kinetics than that of <italic>UBC13</italic>, with maximal induction after 2 h compared to &#x0003c;1 h for <italic>UBC13</italic>. This observation may explain why <italic>MMS2</italic> had not been identified as MMS-inducible in two previous studies, in which analysis was limited to 60 or 30 min after treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c48">48</xref>). In order to confirm the damage-inducibility of the <italic>MMS2</italic> gene by an alternative method, its promoter region was fused to the coding sequence of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene and the resulting construct was integrated into the <italic>ura3</italic> locus. For comparison, the corresponding fusion with the <italic>RAD6</italic> promoter was constructed likewise. Assays for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity show that both promoters are functional and inducible by UV irradiation as well as MMS treatment in this context, and the relative induction of the <italic>MMS2</italic> promoter as measured by &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity corresponds well to the values obtained by northern analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f4">4</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>The relationship between <italic>RAD5</italic> and <italic>UBC13</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>MMS2</italic></title><p>Rad5p protein physically interacts with Ubc13p via its RING finger domain and in this manner recruits the Ubc13p&#x02013;Mms2p dimer to chromatin for DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c26">26</xref>). While at this time it is unknown whether Rad5p acts solely as a recruitment factor for the UBC, as a substrate for ubiquitinylation or even as a ubiquitin ligase in cooperation with Ubc13p&#x02013;Mms2p, the biochemical data are consistent with the observation that the activity of <italic>UBC13</italic> and <italic>MMS2</italic> within the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway is fully dependent on the presence of the <italic>RAD5</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c26">26</xref>). Since this relationship has important consequences for the organization of the PRR system, its genetic analysis has been expanded here to account for variations in repair capacities during different stages of the cell cycle. While duplication of the genome confers additional UV resistance to <italic>wt</italic> cells, presumably due to their ability to repair DNA damage by homologous recombination, <italic>rad5</italic> mutants are further sensitized during S and G<sub>2</sub> phase compared to G<sub>1</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f1">1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c33">33</xref>). Mutants of <italic>ubc13</italic> and <italic>mms2</italic> exhibit less dependence on the cell cycle, although as with <italic>rad5</italic> the difference from the <italic>wt</italic> is more pronounced in S and G<sub>2</sub> than in G<sub>1</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f1">1</xref>A). Nevertheless, the presence or absence of <italic>UBC13</italic> and <italic>MMS2</italic> was found to have no influence on UV sensitivity in a <italic>rad5</italic> background in any stage of the cell cycle, thus further demonstrating their dependence on <italic>RAD5</italic> for activity in DNA repair. Similarly, inactivation of other repair systems that might otherwise obscure the importance of the PRR pathway for survival had no effect on the epistatic relationship of <italic>RAD5</italic> to <italic>UBC13</italic> and <italic>MMS2</italic> either (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f1">1</xref>C and D). In summary, the available data all support an assignment of <italic>UBC13</italic> and <italic>MMS2</italic> to the <italic>RAD5</italic>-dependent sub-branch of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of <italic>SRS2</italic> in post-replication DNA repair</title><p>While deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> alone leads to relatively mild defects in haploid cells, combination of <italic>srs2</italic> with mutations in the helicase gene <italic>SGS1</italic> or one of several recombination factors results in extremely poor growth or even synthetic lethality, which is, however, suppressible by mutations in other recombination or checkpoint factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c52">52</xref>). Based on these observations it has been proposed that the absence of <italic>SRS2</italic> and <italic>SGS1</italic> leads to unrestrained recombination and ultimately cell death due to chromosome loss or permanent checkpoint activation, which can only be avoided by preventing the initiation of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c54">54</xref>).</p><p> In PRR <italic>SRS2</italic> has been suggested to act upstream of the <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent repair machinery. According to this model <italic>SRS2</italic> would exert an anti-recombinogenic effect and suppression by <italic>srs2</italic> would result from a channeling of lesions into recombinational repair in the absence of PRR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c46">46</xref>). Here I have shown that various members of the <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent repair system are affected differentially by deletion of the <italic>srs2</italic> gene. While the UV sensitivities of <italic>rad5</italic>, <italic>ubc13</italic> and <italic>mms2</italic> mutants are fully suppressed down to the level of the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant itself and suppression depends on functional homologous recombination, additive effects are observed in the case of <italic>rad30</italic> and <italic>pol30-46</italic> and an epistatic relationship is suggested with <italic>rev3</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke479f2">2</xref>). These results imply that the action of <italic>SRS2</italic> is directed specifically towards the subset of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway that comprises the branch described above, mediated by <italic>RAD5</italic>, <italic>UBC13</italic> and <italic>MMS2</italic>. Consistent with this notion is the observation that in contrast to <italic>rad5</italic>, the UV sensitivities of <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> cells are not fully suppressed by the <italic>srs2</italic> mutation, but the double mutants are still significantly more sensitive than the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c31">31</xref>; unpublished results). Hence, the <italic>RAD30</italic>- and <italic>POL30</italic>-dependent branches of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway, which would be crippled by deletion of <italic>RAD6</italic> or <italic>RAD18</italic>, but are not subject to suppression by <italic>srs2</italic>, are likely responsible for this enhanced sensitivity of <italic>rad6 srs2</italic> and <italic>rad18 srs2</italic>. Based upon the biochemical data that suggest a heteromeric complex in which the Ubc13p&#x02013;Mms2p UBC is recruited to the Rad6p&#x02013;Rad18p dimer by means of Rad5p, it is attractive to hypothesize that this complex may actually be the target of Srs2p action in error-free PRR.</p><p> The interaction of <italic>SRS2</italic> with the <italic>REV3</italic>-dependent, error-prone branch of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway is less readily interpretable. Sensitivity of the <italic>rev3</italic> mutant is neither suppressed nor significantly enhanced by deletion of <italic>srs2</italic>. A similar relationship was recently observed between <italic>srs2</italic> and a mutant of <italic>POL32</italic>, which encodes a subunit of polymerase &#x003b4; and was classified as another member of the error-prone system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c55">55</xref>). Likewise, <italic>srs2</italic> does not suppress the deficiency of <italic>rev3</italic> with respect to induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c29">29</xref>). In fact, the <italic>srs2</italic> mutation alone was found to exhibit a significant depression of UV-induced forward mutagenesis, implying that the presence of Srs2p is required for mutagenic translesion synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c28">28</xref>). Moreover, a physical interaction between Srs2p and Pol32p was detected in the two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c55">55</xref>). Thus, an influence of <italic>SRS2</italic> on error-prone repair is apparent.</p><p> Based on the strong synergistic effect between <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>rev3</italic> with respect to UV-induced killing it has been proposed that Mms2p and Rev3p compete for a common DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke479c56">56</xref>). According to the model of <italic>SRS2</italic> action in PRR outlined above, the Srs2p helicase would thus be involved in creating these substrates, thereby preventing repair by homologous recombination and allowing either mutagenic translesion synthesis or <italic>MMS2</italic>-mediated error-free repair. Srs2p may thus be an important factor contributing to the decision between error-free and error-prone PRR. How this decision is reached, however, remains to be determined. Elucidating the events at the sites of damage on molecular terms, particularly establishing the order in which the individual repair factors are recruited there, will undoubtedly provide valuable insight into the complicated mechanism of the <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent repair system.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke479f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Comparison of the UV sensitivities of <italic>rad5</italic>, <italic>rad5 ubc13</italic> and <italic>rad5 mms2</italic> in different stages of the cell cycle.
