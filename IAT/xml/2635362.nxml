In addition, Bach2 possesses a BTB domain. Both of these domains are involved in forming heterologous protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In mice abundant Bach2 expression is described in neuronal cells, monocytes, and in the B-cell compartment only before the plasma cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The sub-cellular localization of the Bach2 protein is controlled by the cytoplasmic localization signal present in the bZip domain and a C-terminal nuclear-export signal. Bach2 is localized in the cytoplasm through its C-terminal nuclear export signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In B-cells, phosphorylation of Bach2 by the PI3/S6 kinase pathway results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of Bach2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Nuclear accumulation of Bach2 is induced by anticancer drugs with oxidative stress activities and is regulated by small ubiquitin like modifier-1 or by SUMOylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Bach2 nuclear foci are observed to be associated with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Bach2 proteins function as transcriptional repressors and form heterodimers with small Maf oncoproteins (MafF, MafG, MafK). Such heterodimers bind to the Maf recognition elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As an example, Bach2 negatively regulates the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene by binding to the Maf recognition element in the 3'-enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Besides, Bach2 is crucial for the programming of antibody class switching and somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Several lines of evidence show that Bach2 is a B-cell specific tumor suppressor. For example, in non Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a relatively high frequency of loss of heterozygosity was detected for Bach2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, the Bach2 expression level has proven to be a useful marker to predict disease-free and overall survival of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where a favorable prognosis is correlated with a high expression level of Bach2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In consistence with its role as a putative tumor suppressor, Bach2 was found to induce apoptosis in response to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Over-expression of Bach2 increased cellular toxicity of anticancer drugs that generate reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji, loss of Bach2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels was attributed to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome integration into the host Bach2 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The enforced expression of Bach2 in the Raji cell line led to a marked reduction of clonogenity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, Bach2 was seen down-regulated in proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines, which were <italic>in vitro </italic>transformed by EBV from resting B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These findings suggest that loss or down-regulation of Bach2 expression may contribute to B-cell lymphomagenesis.</p><p>Proviral insertional mutagenesis plays an important role in lymphomagenesis by non-acutely transforming murine leukemia viruses (MLVs). By insertion of proviral DNA into the host genome, the retrovirus may activate cellular proto-oncogenes, or more rarely repress tumour suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, loci or genes repeatedly found to be targeted in retrovirus-induced tumors most likely play important roles in the disease process. The specific genes that are tagged by a provirus in a given retrovirus-induced tumor depend on virus type as well as on mouse genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we have examined tumors induced by wild-type and mutants of Akv MLV in inbred NMRI mice. In these models the tumors are of B-cell lineage with frequent occurrence of plasmacytomas/plasma cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Recently, we proposed that polyclonal immune stimulation and insertional mutagenesis exert dual effects in the process of disease induction in this Akv/inbred-NMRI model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We here describe the <italic>Bach2 </italic>locus as a prominent target in MLV induced B-cell lymphogenesis. A cluster of integrations was detected in intron 2 of the <italic>Bach2 </italic>gene. Interestingly, in the same intron we have identified an alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter. We also identified alternatively used <italic>Bach2 </italic>terminal exons located within intron 4. Utilization of alternative promoter sequences and terminal exons resulted in new <italic>Bach2 </italic>mRNA subtypes, of which several have coding potential for Bach2 protein isoforms containing a partial BTB protein-protein interaction domain but lacking the bZIP DNA binding domain. Altogether, the presented data show a novel regulatory complexity resulting in the generation of different Bach2 proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse tumors and tissues</title><p>Tumors used in this study were induced in NMRI inbred mice by Akv MLV variants from previous and unpublished work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In brief, infectious viral particles of Akv MLV and derivatives hereof were inoculated into newborn inbred NMRI mice. Upon diagnosis of lymphomas, the animals were sacrificed and lymphomas were dissected and frozen (criteria for diagnosis were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). Tissues from mock-injected or untreated mice served as controls. All animal studies were in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Act. They were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Helmholtz Center Munich and by the ethical committee of the Government of Upper Bavaria, Germany (211-2531-48/98 and 55.2-1-54-2531-98-03).</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic DNA and total RNA Isolation and Quantification</title><p>Genomic DNA and total RNA were isolated from frozen tumors and tissues using DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and TRIzol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Reagent (Invitrogen&#x02122;), respectively.

To confirm provirus integrations into the <italic>Bach2 </italic>gene, PCR were done on genomic DNA from tumors with a gene specific primer and a viral primer. The gene specific primers at different proviral integration sites were designed according to integration site data. Viral primers 2620 or 6197 were both described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The PCR was run in a 25-&#x003bc;l volume containing 0.625 U of <italic>Taq </italic>DNA polymerase (5 U/&#x003bc;l; Invitrogen), 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(Invitrogen), 2.5 &#x003bc;l of 10&#x000d7; <italic>Taq </italic>buffer (Invitrogen), 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Invitrogen), and 10 pmol of each primer. The fragments were amplified in a 2720 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) with a touch-down program as follows: 1 cycle of denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min and then 10 cycles of denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, annealing at 64&#x02013;55&#x000b0;C for 30 s with 1 cycle decreasing 1&#x000b0;C, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, annealing at 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 3 min, and finally 1 cycle of extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Southern blot analyses</title><p>Twenty micrograms of genomic DNA from each sample was digested with <italic>Hin</italic>dIII or <italic>Nco</italic>I, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad), and hybridized with <sup>32</sup>P labelled Bach2 specific DNA probes or an ecotropic MLV-specific envelope probe (Eco-<italic>env</italic>). The Bach2 gene-specific DNA probes were PCR products of 892 bp or 743 bp, amplified with the following primer pairs: probe1; 5'-TCTAGGGTTCAGGTGGGATG-3' and 5'-GCACAAGTGCTGGCTAACAA-3'; probe2; 5'-ACTTCAGGCTACTGCCCAGA-3' and 5'-CACATGGAGACGGTTGTGAC-3'.

RT-PCR reactions were performed with the following program: 1 cycle of denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min and then 40 cycles of denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, annealing at 60&#x000b0;C for 30 s and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 3 min, and finally 1 cycle of extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified with GFX columns before subjected to sequence determination by ABI 7300 Biosystems. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Q-PCR) was performed on a MX4000&#x02122; Multiplex Quantitative PCR system (Stratagene) or on a lightcycler (Roche). For each reaction, first-strand cDNA from 20 ng of total RNA was used. All reactions were done in triplicates. The amplification efficiencies of <italic>Bach2 </italic>amplicons were calculated by the use of standard curve analysis where the Q-PCR templates were serial dilutions of purified <italic>Bach2 </italic>cDNA derived from spleen and tumor tissue. <italic>Bach2 </italic>mRNA expression levels were normalized to the expression level for tbp (TATA-box binding protein).

As controls, tumors with no <italic>Bach2 </italic>locus integration were included together with normal spleen tissue. Using a primer combination spanning <italic>Bach2 </italic>exons 2 to 3 we observed no significant difference in the <italic>Bach2 </italic>expression level between the two types of tumor cohorts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We notice a lower level of <italic>Bach2 </italic>mRNA expression in all tumor samples compared to the normal spleen control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Using a primer pair covering exons 7 to 8, we noticed the same tendency, except for tumor 1206, which displayed a marked increase in <italic>Bach2 </italic>mRNA expression, compared to that of the other tumor samples and normal spleen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The discrepancy between the results obtained for the different primer combinations for this particular tumor sample led us to proceed with other primer combinations. Also for primer combinations spanning <italic>Bach2 </italic>exons 4 to 5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) and exons 3 to 4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) an up-regulation of Bach2 expression in tumor 1206 was evident as compared to the other tumor samples. Thus, in tumor 1206, a preferential up-regulation of <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcripts including exon sequences spanning exon 3 to exon 8 was observed. Western blot analyses were carried out with a polyclonal antibody identifying the N-terminus of the Bach2 protein encoded by exon 4. We detected an even expression level of a 110-KDa protein, corresponding to the expected size of Bach2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], in tumors from mouse 1206 and other tumors (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression analysis screened out a <italic>Bach2 </italic>integration site with high mRNA expression level</bold>.

Such promoter sequences would result in the generation of a novel first exon if appropriate splice donor sequences were present or alternatively in a continuous 5'-extension to exon 3. It should be noted that the transcriptional orientation of the provirus in tumor 1206 was opposite to that of <italic>Bach2</italic>, thus minimizing the possibility that the virus directly contributed such an alternative promoter.</p><p>In a first attempt to address the nature of a possible alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter we searched for indicative ESTs. One spliced EST sequence, AK042574, was identified which could have origin in the usage of a <italic>Bach2 </italic>intron 2 located promoter. By RT-PCR analysis we verified the existence of the RNA corresponding to the EST (data not shown). The first exon of the EST was denoted exon 2A. By usage of different primer combinations in various RT-PCR analyses, splicing from exon 2A to exon 3 was identified. However, no up-regulation of this transcript was observed in material from tumor 1206 compared to other tumors and normal spleen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Thus, the promoter sequence in front of exon 2A seems not to be the target for the observed <italic>Bach2 </italic>deregulation in tumor 1206.</p><p>In a further search for alternative promoter sequences within intron 2, the possibility of a continuous 5'-extension of exon 3 was examined. By RT-PCR analysis using mesenteric lymphoma RNA from mouse 1206 we could by the use of a reverse primer located within exon 4 and a forward primer located immediately upstream of exon 3 (primer 2F) (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> for primer localizations) detect a band corresponding to a transcript including <italic>Bach2 </italic>intron2 sequences as a novel exon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, left). This was further substantiated by using a forward primer, 10F, located 667 bp upstream of exon 3 which also resulted in a PCR product corresponding to a <italic>Bach2 </italic>mRNA species including intron 2 sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, right).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Identification and characterization of an alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter</bold>.

Two distinct 5' ends of mRNAs were identified, located 1185 bp and 1163 bp upstream of exon 3, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). We have found no evidence of the existence of splice donor sequences in the region between the alternative promoter sequences and exon 3, suggesting that the resulting transcripts indeed included a continuous 5'-extension to exon 3. The corresponding novel alternative first <italic>Bach2 </italic>exon was denoted E3L. No consensus TATA-box was present within the proximal promoter sequence. As translation of <italic>Bach2 </italic>initiates in exon 4, inclusion of E3L does not affect the <italic>Bach2 </italic>coding region. Moreover, no additional open reading frames were detected within the E3L sequences.</p><p>To examine if the alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter was active only in tumor 1206 material, we screened RNA from several tumors for the presence of such an alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcript. By RT-PCR using forward primer 10F in combination with primer 2R we identified a 852 bp band in all examined tumors and in normal spleen corresponding to the Bach2 transcript including exon E3L (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Thus, the alternative promoter appears active both in tumor tissue and in normal spleen. Albeit semi-quantitative, the assay also pointed at an up-regulation of alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter in tumor 1206 as compared to the other examined tissue samples.</p><p>To further analyze the expression level from the alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter, Q-PCR assay was done using primers 2F and 2R (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). This assay showed a 134-fold higher expression level of the <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcript resulting from the alternative promoter within mesenteric lymphoma from mouse 1206, when compared to the average expression level in the other examined tumors and in normal spleen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Thus, the alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter was highly activated in tumor 1206. The amount of <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcripts derived from the alternative promoter was similar in all types of tumor tissues examined from mouse 1206 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Activity comparison between the alternative and normal Bach2 promoters</title><p>To examine the relative amount of <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcripts derived from the alternative promoter compared to the normal promoter we used a Q-PCR based assay. cDNA representing the <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcript derived from the normal promoter was amplified using primer pairs in exon 1 (primer P1F) and exon 3 (primer Q3R) and cDNA representing the <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcript from the alternative promoter was amplified using a primer located in exon 3L immediately upstream of the beginning of exon 3 (primer 2F) and an exon 4 primer (primer 2R). The amplification efficiency for the two <italic>Bach2 </italic>amplicons was determined to be equivalent (~95%) as estimated from Q-PCR reactions performed on serial dilutions on purified cDNA representing the two <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcripts (data not shown).

To address this further we by <italic>in silico </italic>analysis searched for EST sequences representing other alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>exons. Several such putative exons were identified and illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. The ESTs BC099420 and AK162095 are indicative of the presence of two novel alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>exons spliced to the exon 4. These two exons are denoted exon 5A and exon 5B. Exon 5A (second exon in BC099420, the first being exon 4) contains a consensus poly-A signal, and the corresponding EST sequence includes a poly-A tail. Thus, the inclusion of exon 5A in the <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcript appears to generate a transcript in which exon 5 to exon 8 are skipped. The existence of <italic>Bach2 </italic>mRNAs containing exon 5A was verified by RT-PCR and sequencing of tumor material from mouse 1206 (data not shown). Also the existence of a spliced transcript including exon 3, exon 4, and exon 5A was identified in tumor 1206 material (data not shown). We have not been able to detect <italic>Bach2 </italic>mRNA containing exon 5A in any tumor samples except 1206, or in normal spleen tissue (data not shown). A stop codon is present in exon 5A in frame with the <italic>Bach2 </italic>start codon located in exon 4.</p><p>The existence of <italic>Bach2 </italic>mRNAs including exon 5B (the second exon of EST AK162095) was verified by RT-PCR and sequencing of tumor material from mouse 1206 (data not shown). Again, we were not able to detect mRNA containing exon 5B in other tumor samples than tumor 1206, or in normal spleen tissue (data not shown). The 3'-end of the exon 5B sequence derived from EST AK162095 includes no poly-A signal, and therefore might be protruded to the polyadenylation signal located for exon 4A. We note a distance of 15 kb between the poly-A site of exon 5A and the 3'-end of the EST sequence of exon 5B, and accordingly we have not been able to determine if exon 5B indeed is extended to the same polyadenylation signal as exon 5A (data not shown). We also note that we have been unable to detect splicing between exon 5B and downstream <italic>Bach2 </italic>exons by RT-PCR. A stop codon is present in exon 5B in frame with the <italic>Bach2 </italic>start codon located in exon 4. According to the rules of non-sense mediated decay splicing of exon 5B to exon 5 will generate a substrate for degradation supporting that exon 5B in itself contains a polyadenylation signal.</p><p>From the RT-PCR analyses, it was evident that still another alternative exon sequence exists. This exon, denoted exon 4 L, results from the absence of splicing between exon 4 and exon 5B and accordingly have a termination similar to exon 5B (data not shown). <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcripts including this exon 4 L was detected in tumor 1206 material as well as in other tumor samples, and also in normal mouse spleen (data not shown). Splicing between exons 3 L and 4 L, as well as between exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 L was detected by RT-PCR, and thus both the normal and the here identified alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter may generate <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcripts including exon 4 L.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion of alternative Bach2 terminal exons results in generation of novel Bach2 protein isoforms</title><p>The inclusion of exon 5A, 5B, or 4 L in the Bach2 transcript results in the generation of C-terminally truncated <italic>Bach2 </italic>ORFs, which lack the b-ZIP DNA binding domain.

Immunofluorescence analysis showed that both proteins were nuclear-excluded (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Instead a peri-nuclear localization was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). No difference in the localization of the 132 amino acid and 83 amino acid Bach2 protein isoforms was evident. Thus, the addition of the C-terminal extension in the 132 aa Bach2 isoform had no clear consequence on localization. The integrity of the expressed Bach2 proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).

Proviral integration was identified and confirmed by PCR analysis and sequencing. All cases of proviral insertion were located in intron sequences upstream of the translational start codon of the canonical <italic>Bach2 </italic>mRNA or within the <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter region and most of the integrations were in the opposite transcriptional orientation to that of the <italic>Bach2 </italic>gene. Thus, our analyses support previous findings of <italic>Bach2 </italic>locus being a common integration site (CIS). Fourteen <italic>Bach2 </italic>integrations are reported in the Retrovirus Tagged Cancer Gene Database (RTCGD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], thirteen of which originate from Akv induced malignancies in mouse strains of AKxD and NFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The distribution pattern of these 13 integrations shows remarkable similarity to what we have demonstrated in the present study: they all are B-cell-related, located in non-coding sequences from the promoter region to intron 3, and predominantly having an inverse orientation. The frequency of targeting specific genes depends on both the mouse host strain and the type of retrovirus. In one mouse strain different types of malignancy can be induced by different retroviruses. For example, in NMRI mice Akv and SL3-3 MLVs induce B- and T-cell lymphomas, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The same retrovirus may also behave diversely in various host strains. For example, the <italic>Icsbp </italic>gene is an Akv-related target in NMRI mice, but not in other mouse strains such as AKR, AKxD, and NFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. <italic>Bach2 </italic>seems to be a target gene in a variety of host genetic backgrounds for Akv induced B-cell malignancies. Besides the thirteen Akv MLV integration sites, RTCGD contains one Moloney MLV integration site within in the <italic>Bach2 </italic>gene, which is derived from a brain tumor in the mutated C57BL/6 (Ink4a/Arf (-/-)) strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This integration site is located at intron 4, and accordingly disrupting the coding sequences. Notably, in humans, BACH2 was also identified to be recurrently integrated by HIV in human CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. These integrations were all in intron 5 and had all same transcriptional orientation as the BACH2 gene.</p><p>By Southern blot analysis using an ecotropic envelope probe and <italic>Bach2 </italic>gene specific probes, we analyzed clonality of the B-lymphomagenic tumors induced by Akv and Akv derived MLV in inbred NMRI mice. By this approach we have not been able to detect the virus integration within the tumor in accordance with only a small fraction of the tumor cells having the actual integration. Such a Southern blot pattern resembles what we have described in a previous report for Akv MLV derivates in the NMRI mouse strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. A model for this observation could be that B-cell lymphoma induction by Akv MLV in the inbred NMRI mouse strain may involve immune stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Such stimulation may cause an initial polyclonal stimulation followed by multiple events of mutagenesis by proviral insertion. Given that only a minor fraction of the tumor cells harbours the proviral integration, it may not be surprising that in most cases we were unable to detect <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcriptional deregulation. Still, in tumors from mouse 1206 transcriptional upregulation of <italic>Bach2 </italic>was detected. This upregulation was however only observed for exon 3 to exon 8 sequences, and accordingly pointed to activation of an alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter located in intron 2. Indeed, we were able to identify such a novel Bach2 promoter and in accordance with the expression data we observed increased expression within tumor material from mouse 1206. Moreover, we found that in tumor 1206 material the expression level of the <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcript derived from the alternative promoter was similar to the expression level the <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcript driven from the normal promoter.</p><p>Interestingly, the alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter was also identified to be active in normal mouse tissues and accordingly could play a role in the normal regulation of <italic>Bach2 </italic>expression. The tissue specificity of the two <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoters was overlapping, but we note that the alternative promoter in some non-hematopoietic tissues had an increased relative expression indicating that the contribution to the overall <italic>Bach2 </italic>mRNA level could be of physiological importance in such tissues. We did not observe normal tissues in which the alternative promoter derived <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcript was expressed at a higher level than the normal <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcript, but the results point out that transcription directed from this alternative <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter is important to include in future expression analysis addressing <italic>Bach2</italic>. Usage of the intron 2 promoter will if the transcript is spliced from exon 3 L to exons 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 result in generation of the normal Bach2 protein, as the start codon is located in exon 4. The identification of proviral integrations also in the normal promoter region of <italic>Bach2 </italic>and in intron 1 supports that upregulation of the canonical Bach2 protein is involved in MLV-induced tumorgenesis.</p><p>Our RT-PCR analysis showed that besides the usage of alternative promoter sequences <italic>Bach2 </italic>gene regulation also involves alternative usage of terminal exons. Such terminal exons were identified in intron 4 of the <italic>Bach2 </italic>gene. The inclusion of alternative terminal exons resulted in the skipping of exons 5 to 8 from the <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcript. Transcripts arising from both the normal <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter and from the novel <italic>Bach2 </italic>promoter were identified to include such alternative terminal exons and the resulting transcripts have coding potential for novel subtypes of Bach2 protein having C-terminal truncations and inclusion of new amino acid compositions. The canonical Bach2 protein consists of both a BTB domain at the N-terminus and a bZip domain near the C-terminus. All of the deduced proteins for these isoforms possess a fragment of the BTB domain but lack the bZip domain. The BTB domain, also known as the POZ (poxvirus zinc finger) domain, was originally identified as a conserved motif in the Drosophila proteins <underline>b</underline>ric &#x000e0; brac, <underline>t</underline>ramtrack and <underline>B</underline>road-Complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The BTB domain is involved in a variety of cellular functions, including transcription repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], cytoskeleton regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and targeting protein for ubiquitination/degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The BTB domains from the BTB-bZip proteins (Bach1 and Bach2) are of an elongated form (around 120 residues in total), containing an additional amino-terminal region to the highly conserved BTB core region which consists of 95 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. As protein-protein interaction domains, the BTB domains are involved in forming homo- and hetero-dimerization, as well as protein oligomerization, with a specificity depending on their amino-acid sequences and structure (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Note the BTB domain was shown not to be required for the interaction between Bach2 and B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) proteins <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Although the BTB sequences included in the hereby identified novel short Bach2 protein isoforms are truncated compared to the BTB domain in normal Bach2, they share the amino-terminal region which was predicted to confer stable dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. We propose that these alternative proteins may play roles distinct to normal Bach2 either independently or by forming competitive protein interactions in for example the B-cell compartment with normal Bach2 protein. The involvement of such small Bach2 proteins in tumorgenesis is also an interesting possibility as they could have a dominant negative effect on normal Bach2 functions through formation of protein-protein interactions but generating protein complexes that lack the DNA binding domain normally contributed by Bach2. In light of the fact that Bach2 is not expressed in the plasma cell stage, Bach2 proteins most probably play their part in upstream steps of the tumorgenesis. Functional analyses of alternative Bach2 transcripts and proteins are in progress to further elucidate this issue and clarify the importance for normal cellular regulation as well as B-cell lymphomagenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The common insertion of proviruses at the Bach2 locus in a murine model of B-lymphomagenesis provides strong evidence that mutation at this locus plays a role in the disease. In this work we have identified an alternative promoter and new protein isoforms of Bach2 and our data imply that activation of an alternative promoter by proviral integration serves as a possible mechanism of up-regulation of the <italic>Bach2 </italic>gene with a potential role in B-cell lymphomagenesis. Such differential expression of protein isoforms with distinct functions may explain why the <italic>Bach2 </italic>gene, previously suggested to be a tumor suppressor may be up-regulated in B-cell lymphomas. The finding of novel <italic>Bach2 </italic>transcripts and protein isoforms will facilitate a better insight into the normal and pathophysiological regulation of the <italic>Bach2 </italic>gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JL carried out all experimental work except large scale screening for proviral insertion sites and the data presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and wrote the first manuscript draft.
