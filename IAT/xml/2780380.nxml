We have reported novel biological functions for Annexin A1, an effector of endogenous anti-inflammation, to produce positive actions on the adaptive immune system by reducing the threshold of T cell activation.

Like many other autoimmune diseases, it is initiated by an uncontrolled T cell response to autoantigens presented in the context of MHC molecules of antigen presenting cells. Several factors have been described as involved in the pathogenesis of MS including environmental, genetic and viral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, one feature is common to all these cases: the hyperesponsivity of T cells. In MS it is thought that myelin peptides presented by glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) induce proliferation and activation of Th effector cells. These cells are in turn responsible for the development of the inflammatory reaction and consequent demyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Recent views on differentiation of na&#x000ef;ve CD4+ T cells in effector Th cells have shown that there are at least 3 different categories (Th1, Th2 and Th17) of effectors cell, a classification mainly based on the type of infection or immune reaction and the cytokine signature produced. Classically, Th1 cells are involved in the cellular-mediated immune reaction and their differentiation is induced upon infection by intracellular bacteria. On the other hand Th2 cells develop during infections with extracellular bacteria and they play a major role in humoral-mediated immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Th17 are emerging as the major pathogenic cell lineage responsible for the development of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Annexin A1 (AnxA1), previously known as lipocortin-1, was originally identified as a phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-inhibitory protein and second messenger of glucocorticoid pharmacological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Subsequent studies have shown that this protein is also an effector of endogenous inflammatory resolution, where it acts to downregulate neutrophil trafficking and activation, promoting the removal of apoptotic cells by tissue macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, we have recently demonstrated a novel function for AnxA1 on T cell activation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Addition of human recombinant (hr)AnxA1 to T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 increases their activation and favours differentiation into Th1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; conversely, AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells display a decreased response to TCR stimulation associated with a marked Th2 phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Analysis of AnxA1 expression in T cells from patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis showed higher levels of this protein compared to healthy control volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], providing clinical relevance to the role that AnxA1 might play in autoimmune diseases. Together these findings suggest that AnxA1 acts as a positive modulator of T cells and might facilitate the development of autoimmune diseases contributing to aberrant T cell activation.</p><p>On these bases, we have investigated here the development of EAE in AnxA1 null mice monitoring macroscopic signs of disease in a temporal fashion, together with histological analysis of spinal cord and <italic>ex-vivo </italic>T cell reactivity upon restimulation with the specific antigen. The results obtained corroborate the hypothesis that blocking AnxA1 function or expression during autoimmune diseases might open new avenues for the therapeutic control of these pathologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein peptide (MOG)<sub>33-55 </sub>(MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) was synthesized and purified by Cambridge Research Biochemicals (Billingham, UK).

In the innate immune system, endogenous AnxA1 plays a homeostatic anti-inflammatory role that controls events occurring at the very early stage of the inflammatory process. For instance, studies in AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>mice have shown that neutrophils exhibit enhanced transmigration <italic>in vivo </italic>in the inflamed cremaster microcirculation and increased responsiveness <italic>in vitro </italic>upon challenge with PAF, fMLP or PMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>macrophages produce higher levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 when challenged with LPS either <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Investigation on the role of AnxA1 in the adaptive immune system provided us with an opposite scenario. AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells showed an impaired capacity to proliferate upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation and a skewed Th2 phenotype when differentiated <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Consistent with this, when we investigated the immune response of AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>mice in a model of allergic peritonitis, we observed an increased recruitment of eosinophils in the cavity upon challenge with the ovalbumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Most interestingly, we also found that AnxA1 plays an unpredicted proinflammatory role in chronic autoimmune diseases. Administration of human recombinant AnxA1 during the immunization phase of the collagen-induced arthritis model exacerbates signs and symptoms of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>These results, together with the investigations on the innate immune system, suggest different effects of AnxA1 in inflammatory diseases depending on the relative contribution of the innate and adaptive arms of the immune systems. With this idea in mind, we approached this study knowing that the phenotype of EAE in AnxA1<sup>+/+ </sup>mice could not readily be predicted.</p><p>MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-induced EAE is a model for autoimmune demyelination of the central nervous system and it has been widely used to investigate pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the development of MS. Myelin-reactive T cells are considered an immunological hallmark of both EAE and MS and thought to be the driving force for the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the CNS. These recruited cells include mainly macrophages especially in the C57BL/6 mouse strains.</p><p>Our results on the development of EAE in the AnxA1<sup>+/+ </sup>mice show a decreased capacity to fully develop signs of disease. This was particularly significant at the later stage i.e. when the mice start to show signs of full paralysis. Hystological analysis of the spinal cord supported these results and showed a reduced level of T cell and macrophage infiltration in the AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>mice compared to wild type controls.</p><p>We hypothesized that the reduction of clinical signs of EAE in AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>mice might be due to defect in the activation and expansion of encephalitogenic T cells. The results confirmed our expectation and showed a reduced number of cells in lymph nodes of AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>mice as well as a reduced <italic>in vitro </italic>recall proliferative response to MOG<sub>35-55</sub>. In agreement with these data, when we measured the total number of infiltrated T cells in the spinal cord of AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>mice, a significant decrease in the number of CD3<sup>+ </sup>cells was observed. Collectively these data indicate important support properties of endogenous of AnxA1 in modulating T cell activation in this model.</p><p>Several explanations can be provided for the AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>mice phenotype. Studies from our lab have shown that AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells acquire a marked Th2 - but reduced Th1 and Th17 -phenotype when differentiated <italic>in vitro </italic>under optimal Th1, Th2 or Th17 skewing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Here we confirm these results and show that <italic>in vitro </italic>stimulation of lymph node cells from MOG<sub>35-55</sub>immunized mice with the same antigen produced reduced amounts of Th1 (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3;) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines. Analysis of Th2 cytokine IL-4 and IL-5 showed almost double basal production in AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>lymph node cells compared to AnxA1<sup>+/+ </sup>but no further increase upon MOG<sub>35-55 </sub>stimulation (data not shown). This might be due to the fact that fully differentiated Th2 cells appear during the late remission stage of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], while our analyses have been carried out soon after the onset of the disease.</p><p>Studies on Th cell differentiation during the development of EAE have shown the involvement of Th1 and Th17 cells during the first phase. However, controversial results present in the literature on this aspect do not provide a conclusive answer on what would be the exact role(s) of Th1 or Th17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Indeed, administration of IFN-&#x003b3; exacerbates signs of disease in MS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and adoptive transfer of Th1 cells effectively induces EAE in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. On the other hand, mice deficient for IL-12 (p35) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] showed no overt impairment in the development of EAE. Similarly, multiple sclerosis lesions contain high levels of IL-17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and, in animal models, adoptive transfer of Th17 cells induce a more severe EAE compared to the lesions produced by the transfer of Th1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This conclusion, again, is in contrast with investigations where overexpression or ablation of IL-17A, specifically in T cells, had no effect on the development of EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Our results showing an impaired production of both Th1 and Th17 cytokines in AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>deficient T cells suggest that the downstream events elicited by this protein might be shared by both the Th1 and Th17 pathways. However, further studies are needed to verify this hypothesis. One possibility might be that the decreased strength of TCR signalling observed in AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells contributes to the inhibition of Th1 and Th17 development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Most interestingly, an elegant study by Juedes et al. has shown that in the MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-induced EAE in C57/BL6 mice the early infiltration of Th1 cells is the key to sequential cascade of events i.e. activation of microglia, induction of VCAM and ICAM and finally traffic of mononuclear cells across the endothelium. Our phenotypic characterization of the cellular infiltrates of the MOG<sub>35-55 </sub>immunized AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>confirmed these results and showed a reduced number of macrophages compared to wild type mice reinforcing the hypothesis that the reduced development of Th1 cells in the AnxA1<sup>-/- </sup>mice might be responsible for this effect.</p><p>Previous studies on the effects of a truncated version of human recombinant AnxA1 (amino acid 1-188) on the development of EAE in Lewis rat have shown a significant inhibitory effects on mild but not severe EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These apparently contrasting results can be explained by the fact that in this study the authors tested the well-known antinflammatory action of exogenously administered AnxA1 by administering the recombinat protein intracerebroventricularly at the onset and throughout the peak of the disease. Interestingly, the same study showed that intracerebroventricular administration of a neutralizing antibody against AnxA1 did not modify the development of EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Together these results support our findings showing a prominent role of endogenous AnxA1 in influencing the activation of the immune system that precedes the development of EAE.</p><p>Previous studies on role of AnxA1 in the development of EAE demonstrated that the cerebellum and spinal cord content of AnxA1 correlated with appearance of infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We confirmed these results also in this model of MOG<sub>35-55 </sub>induced EAE. Immunohystochemistry for AnxA1 in spinal cord of wild type mice showed a faint staining during the induction phase of the disease. However, with the onset of clinical signs and the appearance of inflammatory infiltrates in the CNS, a marked increase in AnxA1 immunostaining was observed. This was maximal at the peak of the symptoms and suggested that the infiltration of inflammatory cells expressing high levels of AnxA1 might be correlated with the severity of the disease and the consequent tissue damage. In agreement with this hypothesis, previous studies have shown an increase in AnxA1 content in post-mortem CNS tissue samples from MS patients, in particular in the diseased white matter as well as in multiple sclerosis plaque tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study presents novel evidences of pivotal roles for AnxA1 in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Based on the data produced, we propose that AnxA1 deficient T cells might be responsible for the failure to recruit significant number of inflammatory cells into CNS. More analysis is needed to characterize the phenotype of the T cells infiltrating into the CNS in order to further understand the molecular mechanisms by which AnxA1 influences the development of EAE. Nevertheless, our results clearly suggest that the level of expression of this protein in T cells may have a causal function. Future studies on the identification and generation of neutralizing antibodies against AnxA1, currently under development, will provide us the opportunity to validate novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that target AnxA1 expression or function.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Design of studies NP, FDA.
