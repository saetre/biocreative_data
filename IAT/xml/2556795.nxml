However, their role in natural killer (NK) cell development and functions is not well understood. Using mice expressing p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A</sup>, a catalytically inactive p110&#x003b4;, we show that these mice had reduced NK cellularity, defective Ly49C and Ly49I NK subset maturation, and decreased CD27<sup>High</sup> NK numbers. p110&#x003b4; inactivation marginally impaired NK-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. However, NKG2D, Ly49D, and NK1.1 receptor&#x02013;mediated cytokine and chemokine generation by NK cells was severely affected in these mice. Further, p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cell&#x02013;mediated antiviral responses through natural cytotoxicity receptor 1 were reduced. Analysis of signaling events demonstrates that p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells had a reduced c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 phosphorylation in response to NKG2D-mediated activation.

Effector functions of NK cells are regulated by the coordinated interaction of activating and inhibitory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Determining precise signaling events downstream of these receptors is paramount for successful clinical utilization of NK cells. One of the activating receptors, NKG2D, is a lectin type II transmembrane protein expressed on all human and mouse NK cells, and it recognizes MIC-A/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) and ULBP-1/2/3 (in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), and H60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), Rae-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;/&#x003b4;/&#x003b5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), and Mult-1 (in mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Upon activation, NKG2D employs Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) to initiate two distinct signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), leading to effector functions. In the first pathway, activated PTK phosphorylates Tyr-Ile-Asn-Met (YINM) motif-bearing DAP10, which in turn recruits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In the second pathway, PTK phosphorylates the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)&#x02013;containing KARAP/DAP12, which subsequently triggers Syk and ZAP70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Another major activating receptor, Ly49D, which associates with both DAP10 and DAP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), is also a mouse lectin type II transmembrane protein, which interacts with classical MHC class I, H2-D<sup>d</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p><p>Natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) are immunoglobulin-like transmembrane glycoproteins that recognize unknown ligands on several tumor cells. The NCR family contains three human (NKp46/NCR1, NKp44/NCR2, and NKp30/NCR3) and one mouse (NKp46/NCR1) members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). NKp46 and NKp30 associate with ITAM-bearing CD3&#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and FCR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), respectively, whereas NKp44 recruits DAP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Although cellular ligands for NCRs have not been found, NCR1 is known to interact with hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza and HA-neuraminidase of Sendai virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). NK1.1 (Nkrp1c) is a unique cell marker expressed on NK and NKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Although the activating ligands for Nkrp1c have yet to be determined, the inhibitory ligands for its related family members Nkrp1d and Nkrp1f have been defined as the Clr family of C-type lectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). NK1.1 physically associates with FcR&#x003b3; to mediate its signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Several NK inhibitory receptors have been identified, such as KIR, Ly49A, Ly49C, Ly49G2, and Ly49I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). These inhibitory receptors recognize classical MHC class I molecules. Upon interaction, they recruit phosphatases to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in the cytoplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Thus, NK cells use a complex set of receptors and signaling pathways to achieve their intended effector functions. Despite recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) that have provided deeper insights regarding the activation pathways, multiple knowledge gaps exist, hindering comprehensive clinical applications of NK cells.</p><p>Class I PI3Ks generate secondary lipid messengers that regulate a wide array of intracellular signaling pathways in numerous cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Several isoforms of regulatory p85 (p85&#x003b1;, p55&#x003b1;, p50&#x003b1;, p85&#x003b2;, and p55&#x003b3;) and catalytic p110 (p110&#x003b1;, p110&#x003b2;, p110&#x003b3;, and p110&#x003b4;) subunits have been described to play distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). For example, mice lacking the p85&#x003b1; regulatory or p110&#x003b4; catalytic subunit show severely impaired B and T cell development and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Deletion of individual catalytic or regulatory subunits results in altered expression of other subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Thus, use of gene KO mice precludes proper evaluation of the PI3K isoform-selective functions in lymphocytes. To avoid these inherent complications in using KO mice, we generated mice with a point mutation that completely inactivated the catalytic function of p110&#x003b4; subunit (further referred to as p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). This point mutation, Asp<sup>910</sup>&#x02192;Ala (D910A), resulted in a complete loss-of-function locus but retained the normal expression levels of p110&#x003b4; protein. More importantly, this strategy did not result in any compensatory increase of p110&#x003b1;, p110&#x003b2;, and total p85 subunits in thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).</p><p>In this study, using the p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice, we demonstrate that PI3K-p110&#x003b4; plays a pivotal role in the development and effector functions of NK cells. p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice had reduced NK cellularity and a selective impairment in the maturation of Ly49C and Ly49I NK subsets. Further, mature NK cell populations, as defined by CD27 and CD11b, were markedly altered in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice. p110&#x003b4; inactivation marginally impaired NK cell&#x02013;mediated cytotoxicity against tumor and virally infected cells. However, NKG2D, Ly49D, and NK1.1 receptor&#x02013;mediated cytokine and chemokine generation were severely impaired in NK cells from p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice. In addition, cytokine generation by p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells in response to virally infected cells was markedly reduced. Biochemical analysis indicates that defects in the activation and phosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway could be responsible for the impaired cytokine generation in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells. Our results demonstrate that the PI3K-p110&#x003b4; subunit plays a crucial role in NK cellularity, terminal maturation, and cytokine/chemokine generation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Unaltered expression of PI3K subunits in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice</title><p>The class I PI3K complex is primarily made up of p85 regulatory and p110 catalytic subunits. Altering expression of one subunit severely affects the expression of the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). p110&#x003b1; deletion resulted in significant overexpression of the p85&#x003b1; subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Similarly, deletion of p85&#x003b1; leads to an increased expression of p85&#x003b2; and a dramatic decrease of p110&#x003b1;, p110&#x003b2;, and p110&#x003b4; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Therefore, we first analyzed the expression of distinct PI3K subunits in IL-2&#x02013;activated NK cells from p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice that were backcrossed with the C57BL/6 strain for N12 generations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). All p110 isoforms were detectable in NK cells derived from both spleen and BM, with the level of the inactive p110&#x003b4; being similar to that in NK cells from C57BL/6 (WT/WT) mice. No compensatory expressions of p110&#x003b1;, p110&#x003b2;, and p110&#x003b3; in NK cells from spleen and BM of p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice were found. We also analyzed the presence of total p85 and p85&#x003b1; subunits with pan&#x02013;anti-p85 and anti-p85&#x003b1; antibodies, respectively. Our results showed no alteration in the quantity of total p85 or p85&#x003b1; subunit in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup>-derived splenic or BM NK cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). These observations are consistent with our earlier studies, which demonstrated that thymocytes from p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice contain similar expression levels of p110&#x003b1;, p110&#x003b2;, and total p85 subunits compared with those of WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Collectively, we conclude that the D910A mutation did not alter the protein expression levels of p110&#x003b4; itself. Also, there were no alterations in the protein levels of p110&#x003b1;, p110&#x003b2;, and p110&#x003b3; subunits in the NK cells from p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice. Further, there were no changes in the levels of total p85 or p85&#x003b1; subunits because of the D910A mutation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotypic characterization of p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice.</bold> (a) Expression levels of PI3K subunits were unaltered after the catalytic inactivation of p110&#x003b4;.

Total cellularity of both spleen and BM was significantly reduced in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). Concurrently, the absolute numbers of the CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>NK1.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cell population were also reduced in the spleen of p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>). The numbers of BM-derived CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>NK1.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells were slightly reduced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that the process of NK cell development can be defined into five distinct stages based on the expression pattern of cell-surface markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Expression of CD122, which is the &#x003b2; chain of IL-2 and IL-15 receptors, marks the commitment of progenitor cells into the NK lineage in the BM. NKG2D and NK1.1 are the earliest known NK markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Integrins such as CD11b (Mac-1) and CD43 (leukosialin), which can regulate lymphocyte migration and homing, are up-regulated, whereas CD51 (&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>) expression declines during the final maturation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). To determine whether functional inactivation of p110&#x003b4; could affect the maturation of NK cells, we analyzed the expression of developmental markers on fresh NK cells derived from BM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>) and spleen (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072327/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072327/DC1</ext-link>).

Expression of these MHCs are not altered because of the inactivation of p110&#x003b4;, arguing against one possible extrinsic effect during NK maturation (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072327/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072327/DC1</ext-link>).

In particular, proliferation of Ly49C/I subsets were more severely impaired (P &#x0003d; 0.0096) than other Ly49 subsets. To determine the role of apoptosis in the reduction of Ly49C/I subsets, NK cells were cultured with IL-2 for 6 d, and individual subsets were analyzed with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) and Annexin V staining.

RMA cells, which are not cleared by either WT/WT or p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice, acted as an internal control. Our results show that both WT/WT and p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice did not clear RMA cells. Compared with WT/WT, the ability of the p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice to clear the RMA/S cells was marginally impaired (Fig. S6, a and b, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072327/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072327/DC1</ext-link>).

Freshly purified CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>NK1.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells from WT/WT spleens generated an optimal amount of cytokines and chemokines when activated by plate-bound anti-NKG2D, anti-Ly49D, and anti-NK1.1 mAbs. However, NK cells from p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice were significantly impaired in generating these cytokines and chemokines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 a</xref>). Thus, the ex vivo&#x02013;purified NK cells that use NKG2D&#x02013;DAP10 complexes for signaling depend on p110&#x003b4; to generate cytokine response.

However, p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells were severely impaired to produce these cytokines. Further, generation of the chemokines MIP1-&#x003b1;, MIP1-&#x003b2;, and RANTES from p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells was also significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 b</xref>). Similar reductions in the cytokines and chemokines were observed in the BM-derived p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072327/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072327/DC1</ext-link>). This substantial reduction could be caused by the inability of the p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells to produce cytokines or simply by a defect in cytokine secretion. To distinguish between these two possibilities, IFN-&#x003b3; production in response to anti-NKG2D mAb was measured by intracellular staining.

Therefore, to determine the cytokine defects in individual Ly49 subsets, we analyzed the levels of intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; in each one of them. All of the subsets from p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice generated a significantly less amount of intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; (P &#x0003c; 0.007; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 b</xref>), and we did not see any preferential reduction in Ly49C/I subsets. This indicates that although p110&#x003b4; regulates both of the effector functions, it is critically required for cytokine generation. To further investigate whether the defect is at the transcriptional level, we quantified the amounts of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;encoding mRNA before and after plate-bound anti-NKG2D mAb activation. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 a</xref> demonstrates a significantly lower copy number of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;encoding mRNA in both BM- and spleen-derived p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells, indicating a defect at the transcriptional level. To determine whether this is generalized hyporesponsiveness or an exclusive defect associated with YINM- and ITAM-containing activation receptors, we stimulated the NK cells with IL-12, IL-18, or both in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of anti-NKG2D mAb (A10).

Earlier studies have shown that activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are required for cytotoxic granule release and cytokine generation in mouse and human NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Also, the proposed involvement of p38 and JNK1/2 in regulating NK cell effector functions is contentious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). To identify the target molecules downstream of p110&#x003b4;, NK cells were activated with plate-bound NKG2D mAb, and their lysates were analyzed for the activation status of multiple MAPKs. Phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 were comparable between the activated WT/WT and p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells. p38 phosphorylation is slightly but consistently reduced in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 a</xref>). However, the level of JNK1/2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 a</xref>). These results indicate that JNK1/2 are major target molecules downstream of p110&#x003b4; in NK cells. We confirmed the role of JNK1/2 using a specific pharmacological inhibitor of JNK activation, SP600125. Use of this inhibitor significantly reduced NKG2D-mediated lysis of EL4<sup>H60</sup> target cells by both WT/WT and p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, the inhibition on p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells was significantly less than that on WT/WT NK cells (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 b</xref>). Blocking the function of p38 with its inhibitor, SB202190, had no significant effect on NKG2D-mediated lysis of the same target cells (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 b</xref>). To determine their role in cytokine generation, we blocked JNK1/2 and p38 and assayed the ability of NK cells to respond to anti-NKG2D mAb&#x02013;mediated stimulation. <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 c</xref> shows that inhibiting JNK function abolished the ability of both WT/WT and p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells to generate cytokines and chemokines in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, p38 inhibitor only weakly blocked the cytokine generation, further confirming the crucial role of JNK1/2 in cytokine gene transcription. To avoid the nonspecific inhibition on other kinases, we tested, selected, and used two optimal concentrations of JNK1/2 and p38 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Further, cells treated under these concentrations were tested for their viability using Annexin V and 7-AAD staining, which excluded cell death as the reason for our observations (unpublished data). Based on these results, we conclude that impairment in the JNK1/2 activation is a probable cause for the defect in cytotoxicity and cytokine generation in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>JNK1/2 regulates cytotoxicity and cytokine generation downstream of p110&#x003b4;.</bold> (a) IL-2&#x02013;cultured NK cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-NKG2D mAb for the indicated times.

The important role of PI3K in T and B cell development and function has been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Using p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice, we demonstrate that p110&#x003b4; plays a crucial role in NK cell terminal maturation and cytokine/chemokine generation.</p><p>In recent years, multiple <italic>p85</italic> and <italic>p110</italic> gene KO mice have been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Interestingly, in these KO mice, altering the expression of one PI3K subunit has affected the expression of others. Cells from p85&#x003b1; KO mice contained increased levels of p85&#x003b2; and decreased expression of p110&#x003b1;, p110&#x003b2;, and p110&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). In contrast, the levels of p85&#x003b1; expression were augmented in p110&#x003b1; KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Some of these mice have been recently used to characterize the development and functions of NK cells. Tassi et al. shows a significant reduction of p85&#x003b1; subunit in NK cells derived from p110&#x003b4; KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). Also, NK cells from these mice have increased expression of p110&#x003b2; and p110&#x003b3; subunits, although the p110&#x003b1; expression level was not changed. Recently, another independently generated p110&#x003b4; KO mice were used by Kim et al. in a NK cell study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>), and an earlier characterization of these mice showed decreased expression of p85&#x003b1;, p55&#x003b1;, and p50&#x003b1; subunits in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we used mice with a point mutation that completely inactivated the catalytic function of p110&#x003b4; subunit without altering the normal expression levels of p110&#x003b4; protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). More importantly, this strategy did not result in any compensatory change in the expression levels of total p85, p110&#x003b1;, and p110&#x003b2; subunits in thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). In the present study, we show that both BM- and spleen-derived NK cells from p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice did not have any alteration in the levels of either p110&#x003b4; or other p110 subunits. Further, there were no changes in the levels of total p85 or p85&#x003b1; subunits. These results are in line with our earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). However, one of the major concerns in introducing a single amino acid change in p110&#x003b4; protein is its possible dominant negative effect. Our earlier findings demonstrated a differential sensitivity of distinct receptor systems after p110&#x003b4; inactivation in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). For example, PI3K signaling via c-kit and Fc&#x003b5;RI receptors was almost fully abolished in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mast cells; this is in contrast to PI3K (Akt/protein kinase B) signaling induced by IL-3, which was only partially blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). The remaining PI3K signaling downstream of the IL-3 receptor could be fully blocked by broad-spectrum PI3K inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>), indicating that kinase-dead p110&#x003b4; does not exert a dominant-negative function. Thus, a knock-in mouse with a point mutation in p110&#x003b4; that abolishes its kinase function but not its protein expression provides an exclusive system to delineate the precise functions of PI3K in NK cells.</p><p>Using p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice, we first determined the development and maturation of NK cells. Common lymphoid progenitors that give rise to T, B, and NK cells have been found in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). Committed NK precursors (NKPs), which exclusively mature into NK cells, have been identified in the fetal thymus and in adult BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). This earliest developmental stage of NKPs is defined by the expression of CD122. Thus, the expression of CD122 uniquely marks the committed NKPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). The expression of CD122 in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells is comparable to that of WT, indicating that the catalytic activity of p110&#x003b4; is dispensable for the early NK cell development. In addition, earlier studies from us and others showed that a lack of phospholipase C &#x003b3;2 did not alter the numbers of CD122<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). Thus, it appears that neither p110&#x003b4; nor phospholipase C &#x003b3;2 are needed for the commitment of early progenitors into NK lineage. In the second developmental stage, NKPs acquire NK1.1, NKG2D, and CD94/NKG2A/C/E in a sequential developmental process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). The start of the expression of integrins such as CD49b and CD51 is also part of this second stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). Normal expressions of these markers by p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells in the BM and spleen demonstrate that NK maturation is not hindered at this stage.</p><p>Mature mouse NK cells are defined by the expression of one or more Ly49 receptors. Terminal maturation of NK cells is initiated by a decrease in the expression of CD51, active proliferation, and a concomitant increase in the levels of both CD11b and CD43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). At this stage, the &#x0201c;immature&#x0201d; NKPs start acquiring different Ly49s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). Analyses of Ly49 expression on p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells indicated an exclusive reduction in Ly49C and Ly49I subsets. Other NK subsets, such as Ly49A, Ly49G2, and Ly49D were normal. Recently, Tassi et al. has used p110&#x003b3;, p110&#x003b4;, or p110&#x003b3;/&#x003b4; double KO mice to determine the NK cell development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). These studies showed reductions in Ly49A and Ly49C/I subsets in p110&#x003b3; and p110&#x003b3;/p110&#x003b4; double KO mice; however, no changes were observed in Ly49C/I NK subsets in p110&#x003b4; KO mice. Conversely, Kim et al., using independently generated KO mice, demonstrated small reductions in the Ly49C/I in p110&#x003b3; KO mice and Ly49G2 in p110&#x003b4; KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). The p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice used in the present study and one of the two p110&#x003b4; KO mice are of the C57BL/6 background. This suggests that strain differences in mice did not account for the observed variations in the results. Recent studies indicated that the mature CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells can be further subdivided into CD27<sup>High</sup> and CD27<sup>Low</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). This study demonstrated that CD27<sup>High</sup> NK cells were superior in their ability to lyse target cells and generated considerably higher amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; compared with those of CD27<sup>Low</sup> cells.</p><p>Reduction in the Ly49C and Ly49I NK subsets in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice needs further evaluation. Gene deletion of another lipid phosphatase, <italic>PTEN</italic>, whose major substrate is phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, leads to an increased Ly49C and Ly49I expression in NKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>). Interestingly, this abnormal increase of Ly49C or Ly49I in NKT cells from <italic>PTEN</italic> KO mice was reversed by backcrossing the <italic>PTEN</italic>-deficient mice with p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>). Collectively, our findings in the reduction of Ly49C and Ly49I expression predict a key role for p110&#x003b4; in the dynamic interaction between PI3K, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, lipid phosphatases, and inhibitory Ly49 receptors.</p><p>NK cells can kill tumor cells without prior sensitization. To study the role of p110&#x003b4; in lytic signaling, we used different tumor cells representing self, induced-self, and missing-self. Lack of p110&#x003b4; moderately affected the antitumor responses against these target cells. This marginal impairment in cytotoxicity could be caused by the reduction in the CD27<sup>High</sup> NK subsets in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice, because this subset has been demonstrated to play a dominant role in cytotoxic granule release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). NK cells generate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as part of innate immunity. Previous studies demonstrated a lack of DAP12 or Syk/ZAP70 but not DAP10, severely impairing NKG2D-mediated cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). In contrast, a significant reduction in cytokine generation mediated via NKG2D and Ly49D was observed in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells. Further, similar reductions were also observed when p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells were activated via the NK1.1 receptor that uses FcR&#x003b3; to mediate its signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). These results suggest that p110&#x003b4; plays a pivotal role in the cytokine generation by NK cells. Earlier studies have demonstrated that CD27<sup>High</sup>CD11b<sup>High</sup> NK cells generated IFN-&#x003b3; in response to NKG2D-mediated stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Thus, a significant decline in the CD27<sup>High</sup> NK cells in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice provides additional cellular explanations for the reduction in cytokine generation. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-18, derived from monocytes, can induce IFN-&#x003b3; generation in NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>). In combinations, IL-12 and IL-18 can mediate signaling events that are distinct from those of YINM- or ITAM-containing receptor-mediated activations. Stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18, along with a suboptimal concentration of anti-NKG2D mAb, resulted in comparable levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, GM-CSF, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2;, and RANTES between WT/WT and p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells. Compared with p110&#x003b4; KO NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>), we did not observe any increased production of IFN-&#x003b3; upon IL-12 and IL-18 stimulation. We conclude that ITAM-independent pathways are fully operational in p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells. An explanation for this observation comes from the comparable levels of p38 phosphorylation between WT/WT and p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells, which is crucial for the generation of cytokines downstream of IL-12/IL-18 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>).</p><p>MAPKs are potential downstream targets for multiple activation receptors, including NKG2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>). MAPKs are serine-threonine kinases with a T-X-Y motif in their cytoplasmic domain, and they regulate multiple immune cell effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref>). The MAPK family includes ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38. The regulatory roles of these MAPKs in NK functions are emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref>). ERK1/2 can be activated by multiple mitogenic stimuli; however, JNK1/2 and p38 are activated by stress-inducing agents or proinflammatory cytokines. Earlier studies using T cells have provided evidence for the role of PI3K in JNK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref>). In T cells, full activation of the MAPKs that phosphorylate the Jun activation domain of JNK1 and JNK2 needs combined stimulation through TCR and CD28 together; alone, each stimulus resulted in little or no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref>). Our data indicate that JNK1/2 are critical downstream effectors of P110&#x003b4;, and that they could regulate cytokine gene transcription and cytotoxic granule release. These findings are in line with the recent observations in an NKG2D-expressing human NKL cell line, where inhibition of JNK activity resulted in the impaired movement of microtubule organizing center, granzyme B, and paxillin to the immune synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Several transcription factors as substrates have been described for JNK1/2, including activator protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref>). Evidence for this is provided by the activator protein 1&#x02013;dependent cytokine gene transcription in Fc&#x003b3;RIIIA-stimulated human NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>). In conclusion, our current observations establish a strong basis to further explore PI3K-mediated novel NK cell cytokine generation pathways.</p><p>NK cells can clear an intracellular infection either by direct killing of the infected cells or through the release of cytokines, e.g., IFN-&#x003b3;. It has been demonstrated that NK cells can recognize and kill influenza virus&#x02013;infected cells through the interaction of NCR1 with viral HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Further, functional loss of NCR1 caused lethal influenza virus infection in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref>). However, the signaling pathway governing NCR1-mediated activation has not been investigated. Influenza virus primarily target respiratory cells. Mouse lung epithelial cells (LA4) can be infected with PR8 and express viral HA. p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells showed reduced lysis against PR8-infected cells, which indicates the involvement of p110&#x003b4; in NCR1-mediated cytotoxicity. Most significantly, the p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> NK cells were impaired in their ability to produce IFN-&#x003b3; and GM-CSF upon recognition of PR8-infected LA4, confirming the importance of p110&#x003b4; in antiviral immunity. Replication of high pathogenic influenza infection usually peaks within 5 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref>). Controlling flu infection during this short time window currently relies on antiflu drugs and vaccines, which usually are not effective for virulent influenza virus. Our results suggest an alternative approach to control emerging pandemic influenza infection by boosting the NK cell effector functions through potential drugs specifically targeted to signaling molecules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice and cell lines.</title><p>Generation of PI3K-p110&#x003b4;<sup>D910A/D910A</sup> mice was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).
