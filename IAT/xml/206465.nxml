Here we show that murine Rad17 is phosphorylated at two sites that were previously shown to be modified in response to DNA damage, independent of DNA damage and ATM, in proliferating tissue. In contrast to studies with <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> extracts but similar to observations in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, the level of chromatin-bound hRad17 remains relatively constant during the cell cycle and does not change significantly in response to DNA damage or replication block. However, phosphorylated hRad17 preferentially associates with the sites of ongoing DNA replication and interacts with the DNA replication protein, DNA polymerase &#x003b5;. These results provide a link between the DNA damage checkpoint machinery and the replication apparatus and suggest that hRad17 may play a role in monitoring the progress of DNA replication via its interaction with DNA polymerase &#x003b5;.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Damage to the genome, arising from replication errors and environmental factors, pose a grave threat to genomic stability and can ultimately lead to cancer formation. Cell cycle checkpoints prevent this damaged DNA from being replicated and passed on to future daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c2">2</xref>). A group of six proteins called the checkpoint Rad proteins, first identified in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, mediate checkpoint activation, including the intra-S checkpoint and the S&#x0002f;M checkpoint, in response to DNA damage during DNA replication or incomplete replication, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c4">4</xref>). Human homologs of these checkpoint Rad proteins (hRad17, hRad9, hRad1, hHus1, ATRIP, and ATR) are required to activate cell cycle checkpoints through a signaling cascade to the downstream checkpoint effector Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c11">11</xref>). Upon activation, Chk1 phosphorylates and thereby negatively regulates the phosphatase Cdc25 and activates the kinase Wee1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c16">16</xref>). Activation of Chk1 also results in the inactivation of Cdc2, which is required for the cell to progress through the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c18">18</xref>). In mice, this checkpoint-signaling cascade appears to be required for embryogenesis. Cells derived from early embryos of Atr<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup>-, Hus1<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup>- and Chk1<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup>-deficient mice are sensitive to DNA damage, have an aberrant G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M checkpoint and exhibit spontaneous genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c23">23</xref>).</p><p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts have been used to elucidate the role of checkpoint Rad proteins in the regulation of DNA replication and checkpoint activation during DNA synthesis. Initiation of DNA replication by the primase activity of DNA polymerase &#x003b1; is required for the chromatin association of <italic>X.laevis</italic> (Xl)ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c24">24</xref>). Immunodepletion of XlATR, even in untreated extracts, abrogates the phosphorylation of Chk1 and the subsequent S&#x0002f;M replication checkpoint, resulting in a shortened cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c26">26</xref>). Additionally, XlHus1 and XlRad17 are required for the S&#x0002f;M replication checkpoint and checkpoints activated in response to DNA damage or replication inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c29">29</xref>). Unlike the replication- dependent loading of XlRad17, a significant portion of fission yeast <italic>S.pombe</italic> (Sp)Rad17 is bound to the chromatin throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c30">30</xref>); however, there is a dynamic change in the amount of chromatin-bound SpRad17 in response to different genotoxic agents. Exposure to replication inhibitors results in the release of SpRad17 from the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c31">31</xref>), whereas treatment with DNA-damaging agents causes an increase in chromatin-associated SpRad17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c30">30</xref>). Although these data suggest that the checkpoint Rad proteins function during S phase to monitor the progression of DNA replication and&#x0002f;or replication forks, it is not known how the checkpoint Rad proteins perform this monitoring function.</p><p>Rad17 is closely related to the five replication factor C (RFC) subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c35">35</xref>). The pentameric RFC complex loads proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto the DNA during replication. hRad17 replaces the large subunit of RFC, p140, in an alternative form of the clamp-loading complex that interacts with the PCNA-like heterotrimeric Rad9&#x02013;Rad1&#x02013;Hus1 (9-1-1) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c36">36</xref>). Recent biochemical studies with the homologous complexes isolated from budding yeast have demonstrated that the alternative RFC-like complex linked with checkpoint activation has clamp-loading activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c37">37</xref>). In agreement with the functional interaction between the hRad17 clamp-loading complex and the 9-1-1 complex <italic>in vitro</italic>, DNA damage-dependent chromatin association of hRad9 requires hRad17 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c7">7</xref>). Furthermore, phosphorylation of hRad17 by ATR on Ser635 and Ser645 in response to DNA damage and replication block stimulates the interaction between hRad17 and the 9-1-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c38">38</xref>). Interestingly, hRad17 is also phosphorylated on these same two serine residues during unperturbed S phase, suggesting a role for hRad17 during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c6">6</xref>). In support of this idea, human cells engineered for conditional deletion of hRad17 alleles undergo endoreduplication after loss of hRad17 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c39">39</xref>). Recent reports have demonstrated that the checkpoint Rad protein hRad9 interacts with TopBP1, a DNA polymerase &#x003b5; subunit, even in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c40">40</xref>). Additionally, hRad9 was shown to interact with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c42">42</xref>). These observations suggest that the checkpoint Rad proteins may monitor DNA replication by interacting with the DNA replication machinery.</p><p>As noted above, there are differences in the regulation of Rad17 subnuclear localization among different eukaryotes. Therefore, we have examined the behavior of mammalian Rad17 during S phase. Here we show that mammalian Rad17 is phosphorylated during unperturbed S phase in replicating tissue in a DNA damage-independent and ATM-independent manner. We demonstrate that the level of chromatin-associated hRad17 remains constant throughout the cell cycle, in response to genotoxic agents, and regardless of phosphorylation status. Finally, we show that phosphorylated hRad17 localizes to sites of DNA replication and interacts with the DNA replication machinery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Collection of murine tissues samples</title><p>One-month-old wild-type (<italic>Atm</italic><sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup>) and ATM-deficient (<italic>Atm</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup>) mice were treated with 10 Gy ionizing radiation (IR) and then killed 1 h post-treatment.

To demonstrate that these phosphorylation events were not caused by the synchronization protocol, we examined the phosphorylation status of murine Rad17 in replicating and non-replicating tissues. Phosphorylation on both Ser647 and Ser657 residues of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (Mm)Rad17, corresponding to hRad17 Ser635 and Ser645, was observed in extracts from both undamaged and IR-treated testes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f1">1</xref>A). In contrast to replicating tissue, the same two residues were phosphorylated only after DNA damage in quiescent lung tissue. Since the kinase activity of ATR increases in response to S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c25">25</xref>), and ATM and ATR are both involved in the activation of S phase-dependent checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c48">48</xref>), we asked whether ATM influences the phosphorylation of mammalian Rad17 in replicating tissues after IR. The absence of ATM had little effect on the phosphorylation of MmRad17 in the presence or absence of DNA damage in testes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f1">1</xref>B). These results, coupled with our previous data demonstrating that ATM is not required for the ionizing irradiation-dependent phosphorylation of Rad17 in quiescent and cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c6">6</xref>), indicates that mammalian Rad17 is normally phosphorylated during replication in an ATM-independent manner and suggests that hRad17 monitors the progression of DNA replication in unperturbed cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin-associated levels of hRad17 remain constant throughout the cell cycle and in response to DNA damage</title><p>Using a fractionation procedure first described in the Stillman laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c45">45</xref>), we have examined whether the distribution of hRad17 between the nucleoplasmic and chromatin fractions changes either as a function of cell cycle progression or in response to DNA damage. In asynchronous cells, the majority of hRad17 is in the nucleoplasmic fraction, but an appreciable amount was present in the chromatin fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f2">2</xref>A). In agreement with data from the Elledge laboratory, the level of chromatin-associated hRad17 was not significantly altered by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c7">7</xref>).</p><p>To directly address whether hRad17 is shuttled on and off chromatin during the cell cycle, we density arrested, released and harvested human T24 cells at different phases of the cell cycle. The cell cycle distributions of these synchronized cells were determined by FACS analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f2">2</xref>B). As expected, the replication protein PCNA associates with chromatin at the start of S phase. In contrast to the S phase-dependent chromatin association of PCNA, we observed that &#x0223c;35&#x02013;45&#x00025; of hRad17 is associated with chromatin throughout the cell cycle, as determined by densitometry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f2">2</xref>C and D). Thus, the behavior of hRad17 is different from that of XlRad17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c28">28</xref>), which associates with chromatin at the start of DNA replication, but similar to that of <italic>S.pombe</italic>, in which a fraction of Rad17 remains bound throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c30">30</xref>). Furthermore, DNA damage did not affect the amount of hRad17 localized to the chromatin in specific cell cycle phases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f2">2</xref>C and data not shown). In contrast to the steady-state levels of chromatin-bound hRad17, there were significant changes in the phosphorylation of chromatin-bound hRad17 during cell cycle progression and in response to DNA damage. hRad17 Ser635 and Ser645 became phosphorylated at the start of S phase in undamaged cells and in IR-treated G<sub>1</sub> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f2">2</xref>C). These results demonstrate that a pool of hRad17 remains bound to the chromatin at all phases of the cell cycle and that the association of hRad17 with the chromatin is not regulated by DNA damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Replication inhibitors and phosphorylation status does not effect the chromatin association of hRad17</title><p>Next we wanted to determine if hRad17 disassociates from chromatin after treatment with replication inhibitors and, if so, whether phosphorylation of hRad17 is required for this release. To address these questions, we created a stable cell line expressing HA-tagged versions of the wild-type and a phosphorylation site mutant hRad17 from a tetracycline-regulated promoter. Unlike fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c31">31</xref>), the replication inhibitors hydroxyurea, aphidicolin and actinomycin D did not disrupt the chromatin association of hRad17 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f3">3</xref>A and B). Furthermore, the identical behavior of the phosphorylation site mutant form of hRad17 indicates that phosphorylation of hRad17 is not required for either the initial association with chromatin or in maintaining the interaction between hRad17 and chromatin after DNA damage or replication block (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f3">3</xref>A and B).</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin-associated and phosphorylated hRad17 co-localizes to sites of DNA replication</title><p>Since hRad17 is phosphorylated at the beginning of S phase, we examined whether phosphorylated hRad17 associates with the replication machinery or sites of DNA replication by immunocytochemistry. Prior to fixation, we used a protein extraction method first described in Aboussekhra <italic>et al</italic>. to remove cytoplasmic and soluble nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c46">46</xref>). Immunostaining of the fixed T24 cells revealed that phosphorylated hRad17 is extraction resistant and co-localizes with sites of active DNA replication as determined by co-localization with &#x003b1;-BrdU and &#x003b1;-PCNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f4">4</xref>A and B). Thus, phosphorylated hRad17 is localized at the sites of ongoing DNA replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Human Rad17 interacts with the replication protein DNA polymerase &#x003b5;</title><p>Since phosphorylated hRad17 co-localizes with sites of DNA replication, we examined whether the phosphorylated hRad17 associates with replication proteins. Using lysates from untreated and IR-treated cells, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase &#x003b5; was co-immunoprecipitated by the hRad17 phospho-specific antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f5">5</xref>A). These antibodies have been extensively characterized and shown to exclusively recognize phosphorylated Rad17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c6">6</xref>). In reciprocal experiments, phosphorylated hRad17 was immunoprecipitated by the &#x003b1;-DNA polymerase &#x003b5; antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f5">5</xref>A). This appears to reflect a specific association between hRad17 and DNA polymerase &#x003b5; because &#x003b1;-Flag antibodies were unable to immunoprecipitate either DNA polymerase &#x003b5; or hRad17 and another replication protein, PCNA, was not co-immunoprecipitated by the hRad17 phospho-specific antibody (data not shown).</p><p>Next, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays to determine if there is an interaction between these proteins. Full-length <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed&#x0002f;translated DNA polymerase &#x003b5; interacted with GST&#x02013;hRad17 but not GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f5">5</xref>B). To determine which region of hRad17 interacts with DNA polymerase &#x003b5;, we generated a GST&#x02013;N-terminal fragment of hRad17 containing amino acids 1&#x02013;320 and two GST&#x02013;C-terminal fragments of hRad17 containing amino acids 319&#x02013;670 and 419&#x02013;670, respectively. Similar to the full-length GST&#x02013;hRad17, both the N-terminal fragment of hRad17<sup>1&#x02013;320</sup> and the large C-terminal fragment of hRad17<sup>319&#x02013;670</sup> specifically interact with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed&#x0002f;translated DNA polymerase &#x003b5; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f5">5</xref>B). In contrast, the small C-terminal fragment, encoding amino acids 419&#x02013;670 of hRad17, did not interact with DNA polymerase &#x003b5; <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f5">5</xref>B). Together these results demonstrate that hRad17 associates with DNA polymerase &#x003b5; in cell extracts and suggests that this association is mediated by a direct interaction between DNA polymerase &#x003b5; and the N- and C-terminal regions of hRad17.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Although phosphorylation of hRad17 is required for DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c38">38</xref>), the same residues are also phosphorylated in unperturbed S phase proliferating cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c6">6</xref>). This phosphorylation pattern is similar to the S phase-dependent checkpoint-signaling pathway observed in both human and <italic>X.laevis</italic>, in which Chk1 is also phosphorylated by ATR in the absence of exogenous DNA damage during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c49">49</xref>). The simplest explanation for these signaling events is that low levels of DNA damage occur during DNA replication and activate the cell cycle checkpoint-signaling cascade. However, DNA damage-dependent checkpoint activation appears unlikely, as hRad9 does not exhibit the characteristic DNA damage-induced mobility shift caused by phosphorylation in the absence of exogenous DNA-damaging agents during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c50">50</xref>). Thus, it appears that hRad17 phosphorylation occurs as a normal consequence of DNA replication and may reflect the participation of hRad17 in a function associated with DNA replication, in addition to the DNA damage-induced checkpoint pathway.</p><p>Here we have shown that &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of hRad17 is constitutively chromatin-associated independent of cell cycle phase or the start of DNA replication. This behavior is similar to that observed in <italic>S.pombe</italic> but differs from the observations in <italic>X.laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c30">30</xref>). Several lines of evidence indicate that phosphorylation of hRad17 does not affect its chromatin association. First, the amount of chromatin-associated hRad17 remains relatively unchanged throughout the cell cycle or in response to genotoxic stress. Second, both the wild-type and phosphorylation site mutant forms of hRad17 associate with chromatin before and after treatment with genotoxic agents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f3">3</xref>). This further demonstrates that ATR-dependent phosphorylation is not required for Rad17 association with chromatin and is consistent with the observation that the lack of DNA damage- and replication block-induced phosphorylation of hRad17 in Hus1<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> cells does not affect the chromatin association of hRad17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c7">7</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we observed that phosphorylated hRad17 co-localizes to sites of ongoing DNA replication as determined by co-immunostaining with &#x003b1;-BrdU and &#x003b1;-PCNA antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f4">4</xref>A and B). These data, coupled with the recent finding of endoreduplication in the absence of hRad17, strongly support the notion that hRad17 has a key role in the regulation of DNA replication and suggest that chromatin-associated, phosphorylated hRad17 may serve as a sensor of DNA replication progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c39">39</xref>). In support of this replication surveillance model, we found that the phosphorylated form of hRad17 associates with DNA polymerase &#x003b5;, a DNA replication enzyme that has also been implicated in cell cycle checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c52">52</xref>). Although it is not known whether hRad17 phosphorylation regulates its interaction with DNA polymerase &#x003b5;, this interaction provides a physical link between checkpoint and DNA replication proteins. In addition to our results linking DNA polymerase &#x003b5; with the hRad17 clamp-loading complex, there is a conserved and direct interaction between TopBP1 in humans (Dpb11 in budding yeast), a subunit of DNA polymerase &#x003b5; and hRad9 (Ddc1 in budding yeast) that occurs in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg765c53">53</xref>). Thus, DNA polymerase &#x003b5; interacts with both the checkpoint clamp-loader and the checkpoint clamp complex, providing a possible molecular mechanism for the proposed checkpoint activities of DNA polymerase &#x003b5; and the participation of hRad17 in the regulation of DNA replication.</p><p>Even though phosphorylated hRad17 interacts with the replication machinery and localizes to sites of DNA replication during unperturbed S phase, the possibility remains that hRad17 may only localize to sites of stalled forks or where DNA damage is sensed during S phase, because not all &#x003b1;-phospho-hRad17 and &#x003b1;-BrdU or &#x003b1;-PCNA foci overlap (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg765f4">4</xref>A and B). A possible role for phosphorylated hRad17 is that it may monitor replication fork stability and sense replication blocks during unperturbed replication. Alternatively, it may inhibit DNA reduplication, likely through its interactions with components of the replication machinery. Although the effect of hRad17 phosphorylation on DNA replication remains to be elucidated, our research provides evidence that phosphorylated hRad17 links the checkpoint Rad proteins and the replication machinery.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg765f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Phosphorylation of MmRad17 in replicating and quiescent mouse tissues.
