Two E3 ligases, MARCH I and MARCH VIII, have been shown to polyubiquitinate lysine residue 225 in the cytoplasmic tail of I-A&#x003b2; and HLA-DR&#x003b2;. We show that lysine residue 219 in the cytoplasmic tail of DR&#x003b1; is also subject to polyubiquitination. Each chain of the HLA-DR heterodimer is independently recognized and ubiquitinated, but DR&#x003b2; is more extensively modified. In the cytoplasmic tail of DR&#x003b2; lysine, residue 225 is the only residue that is absolutely required for ubiquitination; all other residues can be deleted or substituted without loss of function. In contrast, although lysine 219 is absolutely required for modification of DR&#x003b1;, other features of the DR&#x003b1; tail act to limit the extent of ubiquitination.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the <grant-sponsor>Wellcome Trust</grant-sponsor> and the <grant-sponsor>Medical Research Council</grant-sponsor>.

MHC class II molecules are subject to complex post-translational control. During biosynthesis, the class II &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chains assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the chaperone protein invariant chain (Ii). This prevents association with ER-derived peptides, facilitates folding of the class II molecule, and targets the complex to endocytic compartments, called MHC class II-containing compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). Within the endocytic pathway, Ii is sequentially cleaved, leaving a short peptide fragment, CLIP, in the peptide binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). With guidance from the class II-related chaperone HLA-DM, CLIP is removed, and the class II molecules are loaded with an array of peptides derived from proteins that have accessed the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). There is considerable debate concerning the route of trafficking of class II to peptide loading compartments. Both direct targeting from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network and indirect targeting from the cell surface have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). The precise nature of the peptide-loading compartment has been subject to extensive investigation. Both early and late endocytic compartments have been proposed as sites of class II peptide acquisition. However, it is generally concluded that the peptide loading compartment should contain the chaperone HLA-DM, MHC class II that is devoid of intact Ii, antigenic peptide, and appropriate proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Detailed localization of class II molecules within MHC class II-containing compartment-loading compartments has also been investigated, and although class II and DM are present on both limiting and internal membranes, their interaction and hence peptide loading is restricted to the internal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Once loaded with antigenic peptide, class II must access the cell surface for presentation to T cells, and again the mechanisms governing this are poorly understood.</p><p>MHC class II expression is a defining feature of professional antigen-presenting cells, and post-translational targeting is under stringent control, particularly in dendritic cells. When pattern recognition receptors on antigen-presenting cells encounter ligands such as lipopolysaccharide, subsequent signaling results in redistribution of the intracellular pool of class II to the cell surface. This is controlled through regulated ubiquitination of the class II &#x003b2; chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). In immature dendritic cells, class II is subject to constitutive ubiquitination by MARCH I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), leading to reduced cell surface expression and predominant intracellular accumulation. Upon maturation, ubiquitination is reduced, and class II molecules accumulate at the cell surface. In B cells, MARCH I is also implicated in regulating surface class II expression, again through ubiquitination of the &#x003b2; chain. This suggests that ubiquitination may be a general mechanism for post-translational regulation of class II antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Ubiquitination is a reversible post-translational modification that has varied consequences for the tagged protein. Diverse modifications are possible: single ubiquitin (Ub) molecules may be attached to a single lysine residue, monoubiquitination; or to multiple lysine residues within the same protein, multiubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Additionally, ubiquitin itself contains seven internal lysine residues that may provide substrates for further Ub attachment, generating functionally distinct polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>).</p><p>We investigated ubiquitination of the MHC class II molecule HLA-DR and showed that both chains of the heterodimer are modified by polyubiquitination. MARCH I and the related E3 ligase MARCH VIII (c-MIR), preferentially target lysine 225 in the DR&#x003b2; chain but also ubiquitinate lysine 219 in the DR&#x003b1; tail. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains from each chain are sufficient for independent modification by the two MARCH proteins, but the relative levels of ubiquitination are determined by the cytoplasmic tails.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cell Culture and Transfection</italic>&#x02014;Mel JuSo, 293T, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 10 m<sc>m</sc> sodium pyruvate, 10 m<sc>m</sc> nonessential amino acids, 2 m<sc>m</sc> glutamine, 100 units penicillin, and 100 units of streptomycin.

Lines expressing similar levels of the tagged molecules were transiently transfected with cDNA vectors encoding the E3 ligases MARCH I, MARCH VIII, c-MIRwt, and c-MIRmt. Expression of HLA-DR was then examined by FACS. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, expression of the active E3 ligases resulted in substantial down-regulation of wild-type HLA-DR, whereas expression of the catalytically inactive c-MIRmt had no effect. Interestingly, cells expressing HA-DRB-K225R showed substantial loss of surface class II, implying that residues in addition to DRB-Lys<sup>225</sup> were subject to ubiquitination. This was unexpected, given that previous studies found ubiquitination of MHC class II to be entirely dependent upon a single lysine residue present in the cytoplasmic tail of the &#x003b2; chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Down-regulation was not influenced by the DR&#x003b2;-encoded COOH-terminal dileucine endocytosis signal or residues carboxyl-terminal of Lys<sup>225</sup>, since levels of HA-DRB-L235A,L236A and HA-DRB-&#x00394;<sub>233</sub> were indistinguishable from those of HA-DRB-K225R. Several explanations could account for our observations. If HLA-DR formed dimers or multimers, association with native DR could enable indirect down-regulation of the HA-tagged molecule. Alternatively, residues in the cytoplasmic tail of DR&#x003b1; could be ubiquitinated, possible targets being two lysine residues located at positions 215 and 219.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of the amino acid composition of constructs used in this study</bold>.

As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, similar levels of surface HLA-DR expression were observed for all combinations of wild-type and mutated DR&#x003b1; and DR&#x003b2; expressed in 293T cells. Co-expression of MARCH I, or c-MIR, induced down-regulation of all combinations, except for the pair comprising DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R, which remained unaffected. This is most clearly seen by comparison of c-MIRwt and its catalytically inactive counterpart, c-MIRmt. As expected, MARCH VIII behaved the same as c-MIRwt (data not shown). These results show that the down-regulation induced by MARCH I/c-MIR, previously seen with the tagged HA-DRB-K225R construct, was dependent upon lysine 219 of the DR&#x003b1; chain. We noted that the degree of surface down-regulation was greater in the presence of the wild-type &#x003b2; chain and was less when DRA/DRB-K225R were co-expressed, suggesting that ubiquitination of DR&#x003b1; was less efficient than ubiquitination of DR&#x003b2;. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of lysates from these transfected cells were used to demonstrate ubiquitination directly. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>, a ladder of bands in the 36&#x02013;70 kDa size range was observed in lysates from cells transfected with DRA/DRB (<italic>lanes 1</italic> and <italic>5</italic>). A similar ladder was associated with cells transfected with DRA-K219R/DRB (<italic>lanes 3</italic> and <italic>7</italic>), suggesting that ubiquitination was predominantly associated with the &#x003b2; chain of the DR dimer. In cells transfected with DRA/DRB-K225R, a weaker ladder of ubiquitinated products was observed, which partially overlapped with that described previously (<italic>lanes 2</italic> and <italic>6</italic>). Importantly, no ubiquitinated products were observed in cells expressing DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R (<italic>lanes 4</italic> and <italic>8</italic>). Therefore, down-regulation of surface class II correlated with polyubiquitination of both DR&#x003b1; and DR&#x003b2; by MARCH I (<italic>lanes 1&#x02013;4</italic>) and MARCH VIII (<italic>lanes 5&#x02013;8</italic>). These results also show that the additional lysine at position 215 of DR&#x003b1; is not subject to ubiquitination. We were unable to explain previous studies that failed to detect Ub of DR&#x003b1; and questioned if this could be due to the presence of a valine to leucine polymorphism at position 217 in the DR&#x003b1; cytoplasmic tail. However, both alleles of DR&#x003b1; (DRA<sup>*</sup>0101(valine) and DRA<sup>*</sup>0102(leucine)) were equally susceptible to MARCH-induced down-regulation (data not shown). We were unable to directly visualize ubiquitinated DR&#x003b1; with the DR&#x003b1;-specific antibody TAL1B5, although unmodified DR&#x003b1; was readily visualized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>lower panels</italic>). This antibody recognizes the cytoplasmic tail of DR&#x003b1;, and although binding does not appear to be influenced by the K219R substitution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>), it is possible that steric hindrance, due to covalent attachment of Ub, could influence the detection of modified products. Alternatively, the proportion of DR&#x003b1; modified may be below the level of detection. The latter explanation is unlikely, since, even after extensive overexposure, there was no hint of a ubiquitinated product. The conclusion of these studies is that lysine residues in both DR&#x003b1; and DR&#x003b2; are polyubiquitinated by both MARCH I and MARCH VIII but that DR&#x003b2; is the predominant substrate. We found no evidence of ubiquitination of nonlysine residues on either the &#x003b1; or &#x003b2; chain.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>MARCH-induced down-regulation of HA-DRB-K225R.</bold> Mel JuSo cells, stably expressing various HA-tagged DR&#x003b1; and DR&#x003b2; constructs, were transiently transfected with MARCH I, MARCH VIII, c-MIRwt, and c-MIRmt, and surface HA expression was assessed by FACS. <italic>Dot plots</italic> show GFP (FL1) on the <italic>x</italic> axis and PE-HA (FL2) on the <italic>y</italic> axis.

As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, constructs containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tails of DR&#x003b1; or DR&#x003b2; (CD8-DRA and CD8-DRB) showed reduced surface expression in the presence of either E3 ligase, whereas control cells transfected with c-MIRmt (inactive MARCH VIII) were unaffected. Substitution of lysines for arginine confirmed that down-regulation was dependent upon lysines 219 and 225 of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chains, respectively. We repeatedly observed that down-regulation was more pronounced for CD8-DRB compared with CD8-DRA, again implying that the &#x003b2; chain was more efficiently ubiquitinated. This was not due to the presence of the DR&#x003b2;-encoded dileucine endocytosis signal, since CD8-DRB-L235A,L236A behaved like the wild-type. To explore the differential ubiquitination of DR&#x003b1; and DR&#x003b2;, we first extended the CD8-DRA construct to incorporate five residues from the stalk region of DR&#x003b1; (CD8-DRA<sub>extra</sub>), since the corresponding region was present in CD8-DRB (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Previous studies, using murine and human MHC class I chimeras, suggest that the juxtamembrane region of class I is critical for recognition by MIR2, a herpesvirus-encoded E3 ligase that is related to MARCH I and MARCH VIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). MARCH-induced down-regulation of CD8-DRA<sub>extra</sub> was slightly more than observed for CD8-DRA but did not reach the levels observed for CD8-DRB (data not shown). The juxtamembrane region of DR&#x003b1; is therefore not required for recognition by MARCH I or MARCH VIII, unlike the viral homologue, MIR2.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Lysine residues Lys<sup>219</sup> and Lys<sup>225</sup> on HLA-DR&#x003b1; and HLA-DR&#x003b2;, respectively, are subject to polyubiquitination.</bold><italic>A</italic>, 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with wild-type or mutated forms of HLA-DR&#x003b1; and HLA-DR&#x003b2;, together with either MARCH I, c-MIRwt, or c-MIRmt.

In a reciprocal exchange, CD8-DRBA behaved like CD8-DRA. Ubiquitination of these reporter molecules was readily visualized after immunoprecipitation and Western blot, and all constructs showed a ladder of bands in the 30&#x02013;60 kDa range, consistent with polyubiquitination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). In agreement with their different degree of down-regulation from the cell surface, constructs containing the cytoplasmic tail of DR&#x003b2; (CD8-DRB and CD8-DRAB) were more extensively ubiquitinated than those bearing the corresponding region of DR&#x003b1; (CD8-DRA and CD8-DRBA). These results show that both DR&#x003b1; and DR&#x003b2; can be independently recognized by the MARCH I and MARCH VIII E3 ligases and demonstrate that the extent of ubiquitination correlates with the presence of the DR&#x003b1; or DR&#x003b2; cytoplasmic tails. An explanation of these results is that the extensive ubiquitination of DR&#x003b2; is due to features associated with the cytoplasmic tail of DR&#x003b2; that enhance ubiquitination. Alternatively, features associated with the tail of DR&#x003b1; could act to limit its ubiquitination.</p><p><italic>A Minimal DR</italic>&#x003b2; <italic>Cytoplasmic Tail, <sup>222</sup>RAAK<sup>225</sup>, Is a More Efficient Substrate for MARCH I- and MARCH VIII-induced Ubiquitination than the DR</italic>&#x003b1; <italic>Tail</italic>&#x02014;We investigated the minimal requirements for ubiquitination of DR&#x003b2; by sequential truncation and alanine substitution of CD8-DRB.

Therefore, lysine 225 appeared to be the key single residue in the cytoplasmic tail of DR&#x003b2;. Other residues could be either removed or substituted with negligible effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>).

All construct combinations showed a comparable intracellular distribution. Similar results were also obtained for localization of class II and MARCH VIII (data not shown). The localization of class II and MARCH I, in Lamp1-positive compartments, did not correlate with the extent of ubiquitination, since both DRA/DRB and DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R showed a similar degree of colocalization with the MARCH proteins, but the latter is not ubiquitinated.</p><p>We also investigated how the distribution of class II was influenced by the presence of Ii.

Cells transfected with Ii/DRA-K219R/DRB showed a similar reduction. Cells transfected with Ii/DRA/DRB-K225R showed a less marked reduction in surface expression, as we have previously observed in the absence of Ii. In cells transfected with Ii/DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R, surface class II remained high in the presence of either MARCH I or MARCH VIII. We investigated ubiquitination of class II in these transfectants and observed that the pattern of polyubiquitinated products was similar to that observed in the absence of Ii (Figs. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3<italic>B</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8<italic>C</italic></xref>). Therefore, although the overall level of class II increased in the presence of Ii, consistent with its role as a class II chaperone, the pattern of ubiquitination remained unchanged.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Regulation of MHC class II antigen presentation is a complex, tightly controlled process. Transcriptionally, it is achieved through a master regulator, CIITA; however, post-transcriptional regulation is also important. In murine dendritic cells, for example, surface localization is controlled through ubiquitination of a single lysine residue present in the cytoplasmic tail of IA-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). The E3 ligase responsible for the maturation-dependent stabilization of HLA-DR, in human dendritic cells, has been identified as a member of the MARCH family of E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Here we show that, unlike the murine IA molecule, HLA-DR is subject to MARCH-induced polyubiquitination on both the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chains. Ubiquitination of the &#x003b1; chain alone is sufficient for efficient MARCH I- and MARCH VIII-induced down-regulation of HLA-DR from the cell surface. The &#x003b2; chain-encoded lysine is conserved in HLA-DP, -DQ, and -DR and is also conserved across species, between humans and mice. In contrast, the &#x003b1; chain lysine is not present in HLA-DP, -DQ, or IA but is conserved across species, between DR&#x003b1; and IE-&#x003b1;, implying that it may have an isotype-specific function. Although polyubiquitination is mainly associated with proteasomal degradation, it also functions as an endocytosis signal. Ubiquitination can control internalization, either directly from the cell surface, or at later stages of the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). We removed the dileucine motif from HLA-DR&#x003b2; and observed that MARCH driven down-regulation of HA-DRB and HA-DRB-L235A,L236A was indistinguishable. Therefore, down-regulation was not dependent upon prior internalization driven by the dileucine endocytosis signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). This is consistent with localization of MARCH I to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) and implicates this as a possible location where ubiquitination occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>A minimal CD8-DRB cytoplasmic tail, RAAK, is an efficient target for ubiquitination.</bold> 293T cells were transfected with CD8-DRB or CD8-DRA reporter molecules containing deletions and substitutions in the DR&#x003b2; cytoplasmic tail, coupled with either c-MIRwt or c-MIRmt.

Intracellular colocalization with MARCH I did not appear to be influenced by ubiquitination, since wild-type DR and DRA-K219R/DRB-K225R remained predominantly in Lamp1-positive compartments and showed a similar degree of colocalization with MARCH I.</p><p>Ub contains seven internal lysine residues that can themselves be attached to additional Ub monomers to generate Ub chains. The nature of the polyubiquitin linkage is important. Ub<sup>Lys-48</sup> polyubiquitination is mainly associated with proteasomal degradation, and Ub<sup>Lys-63</sup> polyubiquitination is linked to numerous functions, including cell surface internalization and late endosomal/lysosomal targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). We attempted to determine the nature of the linkage using Ub<sup>K48R</sup> and Ub<sup>K63R</sup> expression constructs, as has been shown for MHC class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Analogous to that study, we generated stable MARCH I transfectants in Mel JuSo cells that expressed reduced levels of surface MHC class II. We were unable to rescue surface class II expression through expression of Ub<sup>K48R</sup> and Ub<sup>K63R</sup>, probably due to insufficient levels of expression of the mutant Ub constructs (data not shown). Receptor Ub may determine the internalization pathway used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>), since it may allow Ub<sup>Lys-63</sup>-tagged receptors access to the interior of the multivesicular body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Given the importance of localization of MHC class II molecules to antigen-processing compartments, it will be of interest to confirm the nature of the Ub linkage on DR&#x003b1; and DR&#x003b2; and its role in MVB localization. We are attempting to do this using a lentivirus expression system. Ubiquitin chains are proposed to contain only one type of linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Ubiquitination of DR&#x003b1; would allow the DR heterodimer to be modified by distinct linkage types affording differential regulation.</p><p>We investigated ubiquitination of the individual HLA-DR &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chains by the MARCH proteins using CD8 as a reporter molecule. Constructs comprising the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of DR&#x003b1; and DR&#x003b2; were independently recognized by both E3 ligases, and down-regulation was lysine-dependent. However, similar to the situation with the DR dimer, CD8-DRB was more extensively ubiquitinated than CD8-DRA. This difference correlated with the cytoplasmic tail domains. When expressed with the DR&#x003b1; transmembrane domain, the DR&#x003b2; tail was extensively ubiquitinated, and when expressed with the DR&#x003b2; transmembrane domain, the DR&#x003b1; tail was less extensively ubiquitinated. We considered whether this disparity was due to the DR&#x003b2; tail facilitating ubiquitination or the DR&#x003b1; tail antagonizing ubiquitination. Since sequential truncations, up to lysine 225, and substitution of adjacent residues for alanine had a minimal effect on MARCH-induced down-regulation of CD8-DRB, we concluded that sequence elements in the DR&#x003b2; tail were unlikely to facilitate ubiquitination. Although lysine 225 is clearly required, it may not be part of a recognition motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Consistent with the view that features associated with the DR&#x003b1; tail led to reduced Ub, we found that substitution of the tail of DR&#x003b1; for a synthetic tail <sup>215</sup>AAAAKAAA<sup>222</sup> actually enhanced surface down-regulation in a CD8-DRA reporter assay. It is clear that ubiquitination can occur on lysine residues present in synthetic tails, implying that the sequence context of the lysine is of minor importance. However, even short tails can contain important additional information, as is seen with the 7-amino acid peptide of carboxypeptidase, which, when attached to the cytoplasmic tail of a reporter molecule, allowed sorting of a then ubiquitinated protein into multivesicular body vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). It will be of interest to identify which elements in the DR&#x003b1; tail are involved in regulating ubiquitination and how this is achieved. The consequence of ubiquitination of DR&#x003b1; also remains to be determined; in particular, it will be important to determine if it confers isotype-specific regulation of HLA-DR compared with HLA-DP and -DQ.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Intracellular distribution of MHC class II and MARCH I.</bold> HeLa cells were transiently transfected with wild-type and mutated DR&#x003b1; and DR&#x003b2; constructs, together with MARCH I, in the presence or absence of Ii.
