In normal rat chondrocytes, we observed relatively high levels of Cav-3 and a very low level of COX-2 mRNA and protein. Upon treating the chondrocytes with 5 &#x000b5;M of CdCl<sub>2</sub> (Cd) for 6 hr, the expressions of COX-2 mRNA and protein were increased with the decreased Cav-3 mRNA and protein expressions. The detergent insoluble caveolae-rich membranous fractions that were isolated from the rat chondrocytes and treated with Cd contained the both proteins of both COX-2 and Cav-3 in a same fraction. The immuno-precipitation experiments showed complex formation between the COX-2 and Cav-3 in the rat chondrocytes. Purified COX-2 with glutathione S-transferase-fused COX-2 also showed complex formation with Cav-3. Confocal and electron microscopy also demonstrated the co-localization of COX-2 and Cav-3 in the plasma membrane. The results from our current study show that COX-2 and Cav-3 are co-localized in the caveolae of the plasma membrane, and they form a protein-protein complex. The co-localization of COX-2 with Cav-3 in the caveolae suggests that the caveolins might play an important role for regulating the function of COX-2.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chondrocytes</kwd><kwd>Cyclooxygenase 2</kwd><kwd>Caveolins</kwd><kwd>Microscopy, Confocal</kwd><kwd>Microscopy, Electron</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cyclooxygenase (also be known as prostaglandin endoperoxidase or prostaglandin G/H synthase) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes from free arachidonic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), which is liberated from the membrane-bound phospholipids when the cell is injured or there is receptor activation. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX) have been identified, COX-1 and COX-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). COX-1 is believed to be responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins during homeostasis and it is constitutively expressed at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In contrast, the COX-2 gene is an immediate-early response gene that is inducible by many stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Caveolins (Cav) are integral membrane proteins present in the caveola, the small flask-shaped and detergent insoluble invaginations in the plasma membrane, and they have been implicated to function in the vesicular transport processes and for the transduction of receptor generated signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Recent studies have shown that many signal proteins, enzymes and receptors are localized in the caveolae by being anchored there through the caveolins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In 2001, Liou and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) have reported that COX-2 was co-localized with Cav-1 in human fibroblasts. In addition, we have reported COX-1 was also co-localized with Cav-1 and Cav-2 in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Many investigators have reported that Cav-1 and Cav-2 bind to some proteins and regulate their functions. With respect to Cav-3, there is a little information on the protein-protein interaction of Cav-3. Cav-3 was shown to be specifically expressed in muscle and it was also detected in brain astroglial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In 1999, Schwab and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) reported that rat chondrocytes cultured from the femoral and tibial articular surfaces of knee joints of newborn rat also expressed Cav-3. COX-2 has been related with inflammation that was induced by many causes. COX-2 inhibitors have used to decrease the pain of arthritis patients. In this connection, we hypothesize that Cav-3 may also be related with the function of COX-2.</p><p>The purpose of this study, was to investigate the cellular localization of the inducible form of COX-2 and Cav-3 in cultured rat chondrocytes as a first step to demonstrating the relationship between COX-2 and Cav-3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and identification of rat chondrocytes</title><p>Cartilage of normal appearance was aseptically prepared from the femoral and tibial articular surfaces of knee joints of newborn rats.

Aliquots were heated at 100&#x02103; for 10 min in sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This was blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk and incubated with polyclonal goat anti-human COX-2 antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechn, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.) or monoclonal mouse anti-rat Cav-3 antibody (1:200, Transduction Lab., Lexington, MS, U.S.A.), polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse aggrecan (1:1,000, CHEMICON, Temecula, CA, U.S.A.) or monoclonal mouse anti-human collagen type 2 (1:1,000, CHEMICON) for 1 hr at room temperature followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1: 3,000, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, U.S.A.) for 1 hr at room temperature.

Subsequently, the precipitates were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and the separated proteins were transferred to a membrane. The formation of a complex between the COX-2 and Cav-3 was analyzed by performing Western blot analysis with using the designated antibodies. The COX-2 or Cav-3 proteins did not precipitate with the control IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>, designated none). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, the presence of the COX-2 and Cav-3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) was detected upon precipitation with COX-2 antibody.

The purified GST fusion proteins also formed complexes with each other without forming a complex with the immunoprecipitates of the control IgG (data not shown).

The confocal microscopic results showed that the immuno-reactivity of COX-2 was detected in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-b</xref>), and the immuno-reactivity of Cav-3 was detected at the plasma membrane of the cultured chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-a</xref>). The merged image (orange color) showed that at least some portion of COX-2 and Cav-3 were co-localized in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-c</xref>). No single effects of secondary antibodies were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-d, e</xref>). The 15-nm gold particles for COX-2 were observed in all portions of the cells containing the caveolae structures. In contrast, the 10-nm gold particles for Cav-3 were observed only on the surface- or intracellular-caveolae structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results obtained in the present study demonstrate for the first time that some portion of the COX-2 protein is bound to Cav-3 protein and the bound complex is co-localized in the caveolae-enriched plasma membrane fractions of the primarily cultured rat chondrocytes. Several lines of evidences that were provided in the current study support this conclusion: 1) Western blot analysis of COX-2 indicated that it is present in the caveolae-enriched membrane fraction along with Cav-3, 2) the cross-over immuno-precipitation results show that the COX-2 protein formed a bound complex with the Cav-3 protein, and 3) with using confocal and electron microscopes, the immunocytochemistry images show that at least some portion of the COX-2 is co-localized with Cav-3 in the plasma membrane.</p><p>Articular joint degradation is a common feature of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Prostaglandins (PG) are important regulatory factors in normal cartilage metabolism and in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and inflammatory disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The cyclooxygenase-2 dependent PGE<sub>2</sub> was found to be the most abundant PG in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis and OA patients, and it has been demonstrated to mediate joint inflammation and the degradation of the cartilage matrix components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). It is interesting that an alternative set of PGs, namely PGD<sub>2</sub> and its metabolites, was recently proposed to have anti-inflammatory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and to act as a negative feedback loop for joint inflammation and cartilage catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These observations increased the scientific interest in the possible differential effects of PGs on chondrogenesis with its potential implications for the treatment of cartilage pathologies. Chondrocytes are differentiated from mesenchymal cells during the embryo's development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The phenotypes of differentiated chondrocytes in articular cartilage are characterized by the synthesis and maintenance of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix molecules, including type II collagen and the proteoglycans such as aggrecan. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, the chondrocytes used in the current study well expressed type II collagen and aggrecan at the mRNA and protein levels.</p><p>Caveolae were originally described in the endothelial cells as flask-shaped vesicular invaginations in the plasma membrane, and they are rich in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin, and then are not solubilized by detergents. The membrane receptor associated signaling molecules (like the G-protein and the Src family kinases) or the membranous enzymes (such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase, heme oxygenase and cyclooxygenases) are anchored to the caveolae via the caveolins and the caveolae are implicated to function as the portals of signal transduction and the vesicular transport processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). These membrane-associated signaling molecules are known to contain a common amino acid sequence motif (i.e., &#x003c8;X&#x003c8;XXXX&#x003c8; or &#x003c8;XXXX&#x003c8;XX&#x003c8;, in which &#x003c8; designates aromatic amino acids like Trp (W), Phe (F) or Tyr (Y) and X can be any amino acids) that recognizes the scaffolding domains that are present in the caveolins. Our Western blot analysis results for the caveolae-rich membrane fraction and the formation of immuno-precipitates by the respective antibodies strongly suggest that there might be protein-protein interaction between COX-2 and Cav-3.</p><p>COX-2 is a membrane-bound hemoglycoprotein that is mainly found in the endoplasmic reticulum. As the confocal and electron microscopy results have shown, most of the COX-2 is distributed in the intracellular portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). However, some portion of the COX-2 is located in the plasma membrane in association with the caveolins. Caveolins are a family of integral membrane proteins that are contained in the caveolae. The caveolin family consists of Cav-1, Cav-2 and Cav-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Normally, Cav-1 and Cav-2 are co-expressed and they form a hetero-oligomeric complex in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), but Cav-3 is known to be specific for muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). With respect to the tissue distribution of Cav-3, there have been two current investigations that have demonstrated the expression of Cav-3 in other tissues. One of these is the brain astroglial cells and the other is the chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). An unexpected interesting result from the current study was the expressional change of Cav-3. Except for very rare cases, the caveolin expression was not changed. Further study on the changes of Cav-3, according to Cd treatment, will be necessary.</p><p>For the molecular aspect of the protein-protein interaction between COX and the caveolins, Liou and co-workers have reported that COX-2 was co-localized and interacted with caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Our unpublished data showed that some portion of COX-2 was also co-localized in the plasma membrane to form a complex with Cav-2. In addition to COX-2, we have reported that COX-1 was also co-localized and interacted with Cav-1 and/or Cav-2. This suggests that caveolins have some regulatory effect on the functions of COX.</p><p>The COX system is known to be a microsomal enzyme system that is mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum. The reasons for this un-expected co-localization of COX-2 in the caveolae by its binding to Cav-3 are not clear. One possibility is the regulation of COX-2 retention in the endoplasmic reticulum by a post-translational mechanism, and this idea needs further study. Further investigations on the regulatory characteristics of the caveolins in cells, such as the sorting mechanism of COX-2 to the caveolae, and on the difference between the microsomal and plasma membranous COX activity, as well as the changes of microsomal COX activity upon binding to exogenously added caveolins, may provide us with some important clues to the physiology and pathology of COX-2. In addition, it is necessary to clarify the mechanism of the regulatory effect of Cav-3 on COX-2.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by a grant of the Korea Health 21 R&#x00026;D Project. <funding-source>Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare.
