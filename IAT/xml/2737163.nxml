In this study, we found that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) negatively regulates inflammatory responses mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in macrophages. Ahr was induced in macrophages stimulated by LPS, but not by transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; plus interleukin (IL)-6, which can induce Ahr in naive T cells. The production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; by LPS was significantly elevated in Ahr-deficient macrophages compared with that in wild-type (WT) cells. Ahr-deficient mice were more highly sensitive to LPS-induced lethal shock than WT mice. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) deficiency, as well as Ahr deficiency, augmented LPS-induced IL-6 production. We found that Ahr forms a complex with Stat1 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) in macrophages stimulated by LPS, which leads to inhibition of the promoter activity of IL-6. Ahr thus plays an essential role in the negative regulation of the LPS signaling pathway through interaction with Stat1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>APCs such as macrophages are important for innate immune defense and for the generation and regulation of adaptive immunity against various pathogens. Activated macrophages produce proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-&#x003b1;, which activate T cells and induce their differentiation. It has been demonstrated that IL-6 combined with TGF-&#x003b2; participates in the differentiation of naive T cells into IL-17&#x02013;producing T helper (Th17) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bettelli et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, our group and others demonstrated that Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), also known as dioxin receptor, is induced by TGF-&#x003b2; plus IL-6 in naive T cells and participates in the differentiation of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Quintana et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Veldhoen et al., 2008</xref>). We proved that Ahr participates in Th17 cell development through regulating activation of signal-transducer-and-activator-of-transcription 1 (Stat1), which suppresses Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stumhofer et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Ahr is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the basic-helix-loop-helix-PER-ARNT-SIM family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burbach et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ema et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujii-Kuriyama et al., 1994</xref>). Upon binding with a ligand, Ahr undergoes a conformation change, translocates to the nucleus, and dimerizes with the Ahr nuclear translocator (Arnt). Within the nucleus, the Ahr/Arnt heterodimer binds to a specific sequence, designated a xenobiotic responsive element, which causes a variety of toxicological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dragan and Schrenk, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ohtake et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Puga et al., 2005</xref>). In immune responses, Ahr activated by ligands such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin regulates the generation of regulatory T cells and modulates Th1/Th2 balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Funatake et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Negishi et al., 2005</xref>). Although it has been established that Ahr performs an important role in immune regulation as well as in toxic responses, it remains unclear how Ahr modulates immune responses in individual immune cell populations. Ahr-deficient (KO) mice all die within 5 wk of birth under conventional conditions where environmental pathogens are common, in contrast to their survival in a specific pathogen&#x02013;free state, which led us to hypothesize that Ahr also may play an essential role in innate immune signaling in macrophages.</p><p>The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family is a diverse group of transmembrane receptors that recognize microbial components. TLRs are expressed mainly on APCs such as macrophages and DCs and recognition of microbial products by TLRs leads to generation of a variety of signal transduction pathways that elicit rapid inflammatory reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>). LPS is the principal active agent in the pathogenesis of endotoxin shock, which is triggered by the interaction of LPS with TLR4 and leads to the production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-12 and IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beutler and Rietschel, 2003</xref>). TLR4 signaling can occur via two independent pathways. One depends on myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), which results in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. This MyD88-dependent pathway is critical for the production of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;. The other pathway is a TIR domain&#x02013;containing adaptor that induces an IFN-&#x003b2; (TRIF)&#x02013;dependent pathway, which in turn induces IFN-&#x003b2; via IFN regulatory factor-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fitzgerald et al., 2003</xref>). A splice variant of MyD88 (MyD88s) inhibits TLR pathways by its failure to recruit IRAK4, while TGF-&#x003b2; also inhibits the MyD88-dependent pathway for LPS&#x02013;TLR4 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Naiki et al., 2005</xref>). We also reported that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) negatively regulates the LPS signal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nakagawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimura et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, while it has been demonstrated that various regulatory systems are involved in TLR signaling, the mechanisms underlying the negative regulation in TLRs signaling have not been fully elucidated.</p><p>This study deals with a novel regulatory system for TLR signaling in which Ahr negatively regulates the inflammatory responses by LPS. We demonstrate that LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines are augmented in Ahr-deficient macrophages compared with those in WT cells, and that Ahr-deficient mice are more susceptible to endotoxin shock induced by LPS. We also provide evidence that Ahr interacts with Stat1 and NF-&#x003ba;B and that the Ahr&#x02013;Stat1 complex controls NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent proinflammatory responses by LPS.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Increased LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in Ahr deficient macrophages</title><p>Our group and others previously reported that Ahr is induced in naive T cells stimulated by TGF-&#x003b2; plus IL-6, which participates in the induction of Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Quintana et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Veldhoen et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we used Western blot analysis to investigate Ahr expression in peritoneal macrophages stimulated by LPS, CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), and TGF-&#x003b2; plus IL-6. Ahr was expressed in peritoneal macrophages stimulated by LPS and CpG-ODN, but not by TGF-&#x003b2; plus IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), indicating that Ahr is induced by TLR signaling in those cells and that its expression pattern in macrophages and T cells is different. We next used Ahr KO peritoneal macrophages to examine whether Ahr affects LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine production. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, the levels of IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-12p40 were significantly elevated by LPS in Ahr KO peritoneal macrophages compared with those in WT cells. Next, we used a retroviral system to investigate whether Ahr reconstitution could reverse the phenotype in Ahr KO peritoneal macrophages and found that infection with Ahr in Ahr-deficient cells restored the overproduction of IL-6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090560/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). We also examined TLR4 expression in WT and Ahr KO peritoneal macrophages, which showed the same pattern (unpublished data), indicating that the LPS signal is normally transmitted from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm between WT and Ahr KO cells. To examine the effect of Ahr on LPS signaling, we established a mouse macrophage-like cell line (RAW cells) that constitutively expressed Ahr (RAW/Ahr). With RAW/Neo cells functioning as control, RAW/Ahr cells were treated with LPS, and LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines was examined by means of ELISA. It was found that IL-6 and IL-12p40 production by LPS was inhibited in Ahr-overexpressing RAW cells compared with that in RAW/Neo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Ahr deficiency augments LPS-induced proinflammatory responses in macrophages.</bold> (A) Peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with LPS, CpG-ODN, and TGF-&#x003b2; plus IL-6 for 24 h.

We therefore tested whether IMDM affects increased LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in WT- and Ahr-deficient macrophages. Although IMDM suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 production in WT peritoneal macrophages when compared with RPMI medium, its production was inhibited at the same rate as in Ahr KO cells (Fig. S1 B). These results indicate that natural ligands for Ahr in this culture medium do not affect the regulation of LPS signaling by Ahr.</p><p>Because it is known that macrophages produce an antiinflammatory cytokine, IL-10, to control the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moore et al., 2001</xref>), we compared LPS-induced IL-10 production in WT and Ahr KO peritoneal macrophages. In contrast to proinflammatory cytokine production, LPS-induced IL-10 production was inhibited in Ahr KO peritoneal macrophages compared with that in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). These results demonstrate that Ahr has an antiinflammatory function in macrophages under the LPS&#x02013;TLR4 signaling pathway. Because hypoproduction of IL-10 may cause hyperproduction of proinflammatory cytokines in Ahr KO peritoneal macrophages under LPS stimulation, we tested whether the addition of IL-10 to Ahr KO cells stimulated by LPS normalizes the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokine. Although IL-10 inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 production in Ahr KO cells by &#x0223c;40% compared with that by LPS stimulation only, its production was higher than that in WT cells stimulated by LPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090560/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). Additionally, we found that RAW cells were not able to produce IL-10 under LPS stimulation (unpublished data), which suggests that the inhibition of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in RAW/Ahr cells is unrelated to IL-10. These results indicate that Ahr regulates the production of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines independently of IL-10.</p></sec><sec><title>Ahr-deficient mice are hyperresponsive to LPS</title><p>Because Ahr KO peritoneal macrophages showed a higher level of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine production than WT cells, we asked whether Ahr KO mice were more susceptible to LPS-induced toxicity. 6-wk-old WT and Ahr KO mice were injected intraperitoneally with 7.5 mg/kg of LPS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, all Ahr KO mice died within 60 h of being injected, but their WT littermates did not. We next measured serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; in WT and Ahr KO mice after the LPS challenge. The serum IL-6 level in WT mice peaked 2 h after LPS administration, and then returned to the baseline level by 24 h, which is consistent with previously reported findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu et al., 1997</xref>). In contrast, although serum IL-6 levels in Ahr KO mice increased similarly to those in WT mice until 2 h after LPS challenge, serum IL-6 in Ahr KO mice maintained the same level for 2&#x02013;12 h and then increased again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). On the other hand, serum TNF-&#x003b1; levels in Ahr KO mice were significantly higher than in WT mice 2 h after LPS administration, but the kinetics were similar in the two groups of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

We found no changes in IFN-&#x003b2; production or SOCSs expression in WT and Ahr KO cells after LPS stimulation (Fig. S3, B and C), indicating that the suppression of Stat1 activation by LPS in Ahr KO macrophages occurs independently of IFN-&#x003b2; and SOCSs.

LPS-induced activation of the IL-6 promoter was significantly suppressed in RAW cells overexpressing Ahr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), which suggests that Ahr inhibits the NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity on LPS-induced IL-6 production.

Cytosolic I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; is reportedly degraded upon activation of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 1993</xref>), and we also found no difference in I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; degradation in macrophages stimulated by LPS with or without Ahr (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090560/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). These findings demonstrate that Ahr suppresses the NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity of the IL-6 promoter, but not its DNA-binding capacity. It has further been reported that IL-6 production is required to induce I&#x003ba;B&#x003b6; via the Myd88-dependent NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in LPS signaling, followed by the association of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b6; with p50 and recruitment of the resultant complex to the IL-6 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore examined whether Ahr affects I&#x003ba;B&#x003b6; induction by LPS and found no difference in its induction by LPS in RAW/Ahr and RAW/Neo cells (Fig. S5). This result is consistent with that illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>, which shows that Ahr does not affect the NF-&#x003ba;B DNA-binding activity. These findings indicate that Ahr selectively inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity in the LPS signaling pathway.</p><p>We further examined whether upon LPS stimulation the Ahr&#x02013;Stat1 complex can interact with NF-&#x003ba;B on the promoter region of proinflammatory cytokines and then suppress LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activation and inflammatory cytokine production. We performed the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to determine whether Ahr and Stat1 are recruited to the IL-6 promoter in response to LPS in combination with NF-&#x003ba;B. Peritoneal macrophages from WT and Ahr KO mice were stimulated with LPS for 4 h, and the ChIP assay was performed using antibodies for detection of Ahr, Stat1, p50, and p65, and it was found that although p50 and p65 were recruited to the IL-6 promoter in response to LPS in both cells, Ahr and Stat1 bound to the IL-6 promoter region in WT, but not in Ahr KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). These results indicate that Ahr, in combination with Stat1, regulates LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages through inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity in their promoter region.</p></sec><sec><title>Ahr does not participate in CpG-ODN signaling</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, Ahr was induced in peritoneal macrophages stimulated by CpG-ODN and LPS. We therefore asked whether Ahr regulates the CpG-ODN&#x02013;TLR9 pathway. WT and Ahr KO peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with CpG-ODN, and the protein levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were measured by means of ELISA. Surprisingly, we found that Ahr deficiency had no effect on their production by CpG-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>) and that CpG-ODN&#x02013;induced activation of the IL-6 promoter was similar in RAW cells with or without Ahr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Thus, Ahr is not capable of regulating the CpG-ODN signaling pathway despite its expression in peritoneal macrophages stimulated with CpG-ODN.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Ahr has no influence in CpG-ODN signaling pathway.</bold> (A) WT and Ahr KO peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with CpG-ODN for 24 h.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, although Ahr interacted with Stat1 under LPS stimulation, hardly any binding of Ahr with Stat1 could be detected in CpG-ODN&#x02013;treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). However, CpG-ODN activated Stat1 to the same degree as did LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>), indicating that the complex formation of Ahr with Stat1 is independent of Stat1 activation. These results suggest that it may be required for some natural ligand for Ahr to form the complex with Stat1 and that LPS may be able to induce some natural ligand for Ahr, but not CpG-ODN.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Ahr is a ligand-inducible transcription factor, which has been shown to regulate the expression of a variety of genes, including those encoding for cytochrome P450 enzymes. In addition, Ahr activation by ligands such as dioxin has been linked to alterations in cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumor promotion, development, and reproductive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Puga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shimizu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnesen et al., 2001</xref>). A growing number of studies have recently detailed the various effects of Ahr on the immune system, especially the development of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Quintana et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Veldhoen et al., 2008</xref>). Because we found that Ahr-KO mice all die under conventional conditions, it was expected that Ahr might also participate in the innate immune system, which is capable of recognizing a wide variety of pathogens and rapidly inducing various antimicrobial and inflammatory responses. In this study, we identified an important role of Ahr in TLR signaling, that is, Ahr combined with Stat1 controls LPS&#x02013;TLR4&#x02013;mediated pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine production.</p><p>Initially, we demonstrated that TLR ligands such as LPS, but not IL-6 in combination with TGF-&#x003b2;, induced Ahr expression in macrophages and that, whereas the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-12p40 was drastically increased upon LPS stimulation, production of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was inhibited in the absence of Ahr. In addition, we found that Ahr-deficient mice were highly susceptible to LPS-induced toxicity. The levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; in Ahr KO mice were higher than those in WT mice after LPS challenge. These findings indicate that Ahr contributes to the negative regulation of the LPS signal pathway both in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>We also found that Ahr forms a complex with Stat1 and NF-&#x003ba;B, which is consistent with previous findings that Ahr interacts with several transcriptional factors, such as Stat1 and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tian et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vogel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). An important finding of our current study is that Stat1 deficiency, like Ahr deficiency, led to an increase in LPS-induced IL-6 production, but suppressed production of the LPS-induced antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10. However, it was previously reported that Stat1-deficient mice are resistant to LPS-induced shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karaghiosoff et al., 2003</xref>), which seems to conflict with our finding that Stat1-deficient macrophages produce more IL-6 and less IL-10 compared with those produced in WT cells. Stat1 contributes to the development of endotoxin shock through its central role in IFN responses, which are secondarily induced by LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karaghiosoff et al., 2003</xref>). Stat1 deficiency therefore shows resistance to LPS-induced shock in vivo through blocking LPS-induced secondary cytokine (IFN) signaling. We speculate that Stat1 takes part in not only LPS-induced secondary responses (IFN responses) in vivo but also in direct signaling of LPS in vitro through interacting with NF-&#x003ba;B and Ahr; in the latter function Stat1 has the property to suppress LPS-NF-&#x003ba;B signaling.</p><p>The findings that Ahr inhibits LPS-induced activation of the IL-6 promoter and interacts in combination with both NF-&#x003ba;B and Stat1 on the same region of the IL-6 promoter suggest that the Ahr&#x02013;Stat1 complex may control LPS-induced proinflammatory responses by inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity. In fact, NF-&#x003ba;B DNA-binding activity was not inhibited by Ahr, which is consistent with the finding that Ahr did not affect the expression of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b6; via the LPS-MyD88-dependent pathway. At present, however, the detailed mechanism of Ahr in suppressing NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity remains poorly understood. Nuclear receptors in combination with coactivators and corepressors can switch the transcriptional activity of several transcriptional factors on and off, respectively. It was recently reported that Ahr repressor (Ahrr), known as an Ahr negative regulator, represses estrogen receptor &#x003b1;&#x02013;mediated transcriptional activation through interacting directly with ER&#x003b1; on the promoter sequences of estrogen receptor&#x02013;target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kanno et al., 2008</xref>). This seems to imply that the Ahr&#x02013;Stat1 complex may inhibit LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity via a corepressor such as Ahrr.</p><p>Two groups in addition to ours recently reported that Ahr participates in Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Quintana et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Veldhoen et al., 2008</xref>). In our study, we provided evidence that Ahr is involved in the differentiation of Th17 cells by inhibiting Stat1 activation, which suppresses Th17 cell differentiation, under Th17-polarizing conditions (TGF-&#x003b2; plus IL-6). Stat1 activation was eliminated 24 h after stimulation with TGF-&#x003b2; plus IL-6 in WT naive T cells, whereas its activation was maintained in Ahr-deficient naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, Stat1 activation by LPS was inhibited in Ahr-deficient macrophages, compared with that in normal macrophages. These findings indicate that Stat1 activation is differentially regulated by Ahr in T cells and macrophages. Ahr is known to perform a dual function in controlling intracellular protein levels, serving both as a transcriptional factor and as a ligand-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ohtake et al., 2007</xref>). It is also possible that, although Ahr regulates the activation of Stat1 through the degradation of activated Stat1 by functioning as a ligand-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase in the generation of Th17 cells, it acts like a transcriptional factor and cooperates with Stat1 to regulate NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activation in LPS-activated macrophages. Thus, the Ahr&#x02013;Stat1 combination controls immune responses in different ways depending on the immune cell population.</p><p>The CpG-ODN&#x02013;TLR9 signaling pathway and the LPS&#x02013;TLR4 signaling pathway induce proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 via MyD88-NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>). However, our findings demonstrate that Ahr is incapable of regulating the production of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines by CpG-ODN, although it is induced in peritoneal macrophages stimulated with CpG-ODN. Interestingly, Ahr interacted with Stat1 in the peritoneal macrophages under stimulation with LPS, but not with CpG-ODN, even though the level of Stat1 activation was the same for these two stimulations, which may account for the difference between the LPS and CpG-ODN signaling pathways in the regulation by Ahr of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine production. Given that Ahr forms the complex together with Stat1 and p50 on the IL-6 promoter region and regulates NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity, Stat1 may be required for the inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity by Ahr. Some natural ligand may be required when Ahr forms the complex with Stat1, followed by the regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>Our preliminary data show that IL-6 suppresses LPS-induced Ahr expression in macrophages (unpublished data). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, the expression of Ahr in macrophages was inhibited by IL-6 in combination with TGF-&#x003b2;. In this study, we demonstrated that Ahr performs an antiinflammatory function in macrophages. It can thus be speculated that IL-6 may amplify proinflammatory responses in macrophages through inhibiting the expression of Ahr, which suppresses LPS-induced proinflammatory responses. In T cells, on the other hand, IL-6 combined with TGF-&#x003b2; induces the expression of Ahr, which participates in Th17 cell differentiation. IL-6 thus promotes proinflammatory responses through the differential regulation of Ahr expression in macrophages and T cells.</p><p>To summarize, we have identified and characterized a novel regulatory mechanism of the TLR signaling pathway in which Ahr in combination with Stat1 concurrently controls LPS-induced pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine production. We have also provided evidence that Ahr differentially regulates Stat1 activation and NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity in T cells and macrophages, respectively. This suggests that Ahr may control several immune responses through the regulation of transcriptional factors, such as the Stat and NF-&#x003ba;B families, and be involved in several autoimmune diseases. It is necessary to gain an understanding of how Ahr regulates the immune system in various immune cells such as T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Further studies using each immune cell&#x02013;specific Ahr conditional KO mice will define the functions of Ahr in immunity and several autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6 WT mice were obtained from CLEA Japan, Inc.
