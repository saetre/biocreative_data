Baseline PPAR&#x003b1; expression was similar in human and mouse hepatocytes. Depending on species and time of exposure, Wy14643 significantly induced the expression of 362&#x02013;672 genes. Surprisingly minor overlap was observed between the Wy14643-regulated genes from mouse and human, although more substantial overlap was observed at the pathway level. Xenobiotics metabolism and apolipoprotein synthesis were specifically regulated by PPAR&#x003b1; in human hepatocytes, whereas glycolysis-gluconeogenesis was regulated specifically in mouse hepatocytes. Most of the genes commonly regulated in mouse and human were involved in lipid metabolism and many represented known PPAR&#x003b1; targets, including CPT1A, HMGCS2, FABP1, ACSL1, and ADFP. Several genes were identified that were specifically induced by PPAR&#x003b1; in human (MBL2, ALAS1, CYP1A1, TSKU) or mouse (Fbp2, lgals4, Cd36, Ucp2, Pxmp4).

It actively metabolizes fatty acids as fuel and is responsible for triglyceride export via synthesis of very low density lipoproteins. An imbalance between these pathways may lead to triglyceride accumulation and thus hepatic steatosis. Studies in mice have indicated that many aspects of hepatic lipid metabolism are under transcriptional control of the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor &#x003b1; (PPAR&#x003b1;), a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. It is well established that impaired PPAR&#x003b1; function is associated with hepatic lipid accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Costet1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Reddy1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, synthetic agonists for PPAR&#x003b1; are explored for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-FernandezMiranda1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Besides PPAR&#x003b1;, two other PPARs isotypes are known to exist: PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; and PPAR&#x003b3;. The PPARs share a common mode of action that involves heterodimerization with the nuclear receptor RXR, followed by binding to PPAR response elements (PPREs) in target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Desvergne1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Activation of transcription is induced by binding of ligand, leading to recruitment of specific coactivator proteins and dissociation of corepressors. Expression of PPAR&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; is relatively ubiquitous, whereas PPAR&#x003b3; is mainly expressed in adipose tissue, macrophages and colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Braissant1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Escher1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>PPAR&#x003b1; can be ligand-activated by endogenous agonists, which include fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives such as eicosanoids and oxidized fatty acids, as well as by various synthetic compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Desvergne1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Schoonjans1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Khan1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The latter group induces proliferation of peroxisomes in rodents and are thus referred to as peroxisome proliferators. Peroxisome proliferators encompass a diverse group of chemicals ranging from herbicides and insecticides to industrial plasticisers, halogenated hydrocarbons, and fibrate drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Corton1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Gonzalez1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Most of the research concerning PPAR&#x003b1; has focused on its role in the liver. A wealth of studies performed almost exclusively in mice has revealed that PPAR&#x003b1; serves as a key regulator of hepatic fatty acid catabolism (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Mandard1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>). Using PPAR&#x003b1; null mice, it has been shown that PPAR&#x003b1; is especially important for the adaptive response to fasting by stimulating hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Kersten1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Hashimoto1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Leone1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, PPAR&#x003b1; has been shown to govern liver inflammation, lipoprotein metabolism, glucose metabolism, and hepatocyte proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Mandard1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Delerive1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Stienstra1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The latter response is known to be specific for rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Klaunig1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The species-specific effects of PPAR&#x003b1; agonists on hepatocyte proliferation and associated hepatocarcinogenesis were ascribed to a number of factors including properties intrinsic to the PPAR&#x003b1; protein, conservation and functionality of PPREs in the promoter of target genes, and presence or absence of co-regulators depending on the cellular environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Ammerschlaeger1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>However, apart from the differential effect on hepatocyte and peroxisome proliferation, it is not very clear whether PPAR&#x003b1; has a similar role in mice and humans and to what extent target genes are shared between the two species. Based on the lower expression level of PPAR&#x003b1; in human liver compared to mouse liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Palmer1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the functionality of PPAR&#x003b1; in human liver has been questioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Holden1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This notion has been further reinforced by the limited impact of PPAR&#x003b1; agonists on lipid metabolism genes in HepG2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-VandenHeuvel1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, which represent the most widely used liver cell culture model.</p><p>However, a careful and comprehensive comparative analysis of gene regulation by PPAR&#x003b1; between mouse and human hepatocytes has yet to be performed. To fill this gap we systematically compared the effect of activation of the transcription factor PPAR&#x003b1; in primary mouse and human hepatocytes using a whole genome transcriptomics approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PPARa plays an important role in primary human hepatocytes</title><p>We first determined PPAR&#x003b1; expression in mouse and human liver by quantitative real-time PCR.

In order to study the effect of PPAR&#x003b1; activation on gene expression in human and mouse liver, primary human and mouse hepatocytes were incubated with the PPAR&#x003b1; agonist Wy14643 for 6 or 24 h. To minimize potential statistical bias, the diversity of the six human donors was mimicked by performing the equivalent mouse experiment in primary hepatocytes from six different mice varying in age, sex and genetic background. The choice of using Wy14643 as PPAR&#x003b1; agonist was based on a pilot experiment in which primary human hepatocytes were treated with equal concentrations of either Wy14643 or fenofibrate (50 &#x000b5;M). In general, we found that established PPAR&#x003b1; target genes were more strongly induced by Wy14643 compared to fenofibrate (data not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0006796-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006796.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Activation of PPAR&#x003b1; in mouse and human hepatocytes.</title><p>(A) PPAR&#x003b1; mRNA expression levels in human versus mouse liver as expressed relative to universal 18S.

While in mouse hepatocytes PPAR&#x003b1; mRNA decreased during the course of the incubation, the opposite was the case in human hepatocytes. Treatment with Wy14643 consistently increased the expression of the established PPAR&#x003b1; targets Cpt1a and Pdk4 in mouse and human hepatocytes, indicating activation of PPAR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006796-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To study the effect of PPAR&#x003b1; activation on global gene expression, microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChips. We first performed principal component analysis (PCA) to sort out the major sources of variation in our microarray data. The PCA plot for 6 h Wy14643 treatment clearly shows that the principal source of variation is between the species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006796.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Additionally, the results indicate that: 1) there is large variation between the various mice at basal level (untreated cells), whereas the variation between the human donors is small; 2) the effect of PPAR&#x003b1; activation is more pronounced in mice than in humans; 3) the effect of PPAR&#x003b1; activation is consistent between the various mice.</p><p>We found that in human hepatocytes Wy14643 treatment for 6 h significantly altered the expression of 705 genes. A considerably larger number of genes were regulated by Wy14643 in mouse hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006796-g002">Figure 2</xref>). More stringent selection dramatically reduced the number of significantly regulated genes in human hepatocytes, while it had much less of an effect in mouse hepatocytes (data not shown). Surprisingly, more prolonged Wy14643 treatment augmented the number of significantly regulated genes in human hepatocytes, but not in mouse hepatocytes. The latter result may be related to the lower expression of PPAR&#x003b1; in mouse hepatocytes after prolonged incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006796-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

The GO classes specific for the mouse hepatocytes also mostly corresponded to lipid metabolic pathways, suggesting that regulation of lipid metabolism is the dominant function of PPAR&#x003b1; in mouse hepatocytes. In contrast, the GO classes specific for human hepatocytes included alternative metabolic processes including bile acid metabolic process, and various aspects of amino acid metabolism.</p><p>A similar type of analysis focusing on upregulated genes was carried out using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).

A similar plot was created for 24 h PPAR&#x003b1; activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006796-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). A number of genes could be identified that were induced by Wy14643 specifically in human (MBL2, CYP1A1, HMOX1 and TSKU) or mouse (Fbp2, Lgals4, Pxmp4 and Ucp2) . To directly compare the effect of Wy14643 on specific genes between mouse and human, genes that were upregulated by 6 h or 24 h Wy14643 in human hepatocytes were ranked according to their mean fold-change and the changes in expression compared between the individual donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006796-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006796.s002">Figure S2</xref>, respectively).

The specific induction of TSKU was confirmed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006796.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Interestingly, the top 50 of most highly induced genes contain a remarkably high number of established PPAR&#x003b1; targets, regulation of which was conserved in mouse hepatocytes. This includes genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis (HMGCS2, CPT1A, CPT2, SLC25A20), peroxisomal/microsomal fatty acid oxidation (ECH1, CYP4A11), fatty acid binding and activation (FABP1, ACSL1, ACSL3), and lipid droplet associated proteins (ADFP). Wy14643 also stimulated expression of a number of secreted PPAR&#x003b1; targets including FGF21 and ANGPTL4.

The picture reveals that in human hepatocytes PPAR&#x003b1; activation induces the expression of many genes involved in different aspects of lipid metabolism, including fat oxidation, fat synthesis, intracellular TG storage and hydrolysis, membrane transport, intracellular activation and trafficking of fatty acids and lipoprotein metabolism. Comparison with the corresponding picture for mouse reveals a remarkable conservation at the pathway level, indicating that the role of PPAR&#x003b1; in hepatic lipid metabolism is highly similar between mice and human. The sole exception is lipoprotein metabolism, represented by APOA2 and APOA5, which was exclusively regulated in human hepatocytes. It is also evident that fewer peroxisomal genes are induced by Wy14643 in human vs. mouse hepatocytes. Interestingly, within a particular metabolic pathway the specific genes upregulated by Wy14643 to some extent differ between mouse and human. Taken together, the results suggest that in human and mouse hepatocytes PPAR&#x003b1; has an equally important role in governing lipid metabolism with the exception of lipoprotein metabolism and to a lesser extent peroxisomal metabolism.

In general, these studies indicate that unlike many other nuclear receptors, PPAR&#x003b1; governs the expression of a large set of genes, many of which are involved in fatty acid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Guo1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Zandbergen1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there has been no systematic comparison of the whole genome effects of PPAR&#x003b1; activation in human versus mouse hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Bunger1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, in the present paper we systematically compared the effect of PPAR&#x003b1; activation in primary mouse and human hepatocytes using a whole genome transcriptomics approach. A number of important general conclusions can be drawn from our work. First, perhaps contrary to common conception, our data support a major role for PPAR&#x003b1; in human liver, as evidenced by the large number of genes altered upon PPAR&#x003b1; activation in primary human hepatocytes. Second, even though the human and mouse hepatocytes were not cultured under identical conditions, we feel comfortable to conclude that PPAR&#x003b1; regulates a mostly divergent set of genes in mouse and human liver. For example, we found that metabolism of xenobiotics is specifically regulated by PPAR&#x003b1; in human liver. Third, the role of PPAR&#x003b1; as a master regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism is well conserved between mouse and human. However, within each lipid metabolic pathway the specific genes under control of PPAR&#x003b1; in mouse and human differ to some extent.</p><p>In recent years, the role of PPAR&#x003b1; in human liver has been questioned based on RNase protection data showing 10-fold lower levels of PPAR&#x003b1; mRNA in human liver compared with mouse liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Palmer1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, human hepatoma HepG2 cells were shown to respond poorly to PPAR&#x003b1; activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-VandenHeuvel1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we show by quantitative realtime PCR that in liver tissue and primary hepatocytes PPAR&#x003b1; expression levels are similar between mouse and human. It is inherently difficult to compare hepatic PPAR&#x003b1; expression between species as PPAR&#x003b1; mRNA fluctuations throughout the day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Patel1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, is increased by fasting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Kersten2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and is reduced under conditions of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Beigneux1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Changes in PPAR&#x003b1; expression will likely influence the transcriptional response to PPAR&#x003b1; activation. Our comparative analysis of hepatic gene regulation by human PPAR&#x003b1; vs. mouse PPAR&#x003b1; should thus be considered an approximation. Despite the limitations, our analysis represents a major advancement in our understanding of PPAR&#x003b1; function in human liver.</p><p>Consistent with a major role of PPAR&#x003b1; in human hepatocytes, the number of genes significantly regulated by Wy14643 was very high and was similar to the number in mouse hepatocytes. Although induction of gene expression by Wy14643 was generally less robust in human hepatocytes, these cells likely lost some sensitivity due to the extended time between isolation and harvesting. We were able to exclude differences in cultured medium as an explanation for the lower fold-inductions in human hepatocytes (data not shown).</p><p>While the number of genes commonly regulated by PPAR&#x003b1; in mouse and human hepatocytes may seem relatively small, which would suggest minor overlap in PPAR&#x003b1; function between the two species, the overlap is more impressive when studied at the level of gene ontology. Many of the overlapping gene ontology classes represent pathways of lipid metabolism. Supporting these data, many of the 125 genes co-regulated by PPAR&#x003b1; in mouse and human are involved in various aspects of hepatic lipid handling, including peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (ACOX1, ECH1), ketogenesis (HMGCS2), fatty acid binding and activation (FABP1, ACSL3), and fatty acid uptake (SLC27A2). Our analysis demonstrates that in human liver, analogous to the situation in mouse liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Rakhshandehroo1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, PPAR&#x003b1; serves as a global transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism.</p><p>In addition to numerous established PPAR&#x003b1; target genes, several genes were found to be co-regulated by Wy14643 in mouse and human that have not yet been linked to PPAR&#x003b1;, including the liver specific transcription factor CREB3L3. CREB3L3 was recently shown to be involved in the hepatic acute phase response, suggesting that it may partially mediate the effects of PPAR&#x003b1; on acute phase response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Zhang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Other conserved novel putative targets include MAP3K8, SGK2, and the transcription factor KLF10 and KLF11.

Using humanized PPAR&#x003b1; mice, it has been shown that the human PPAR&#x003b1; receptor has the ability to induce peroxisome proliferation and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in the context of a mouse liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Cheung1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Yu1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in a previous study using HepG2 cells engineered to express PPAR&#x003b1; at levels similar to mouse liver, ACOX1 and other peroxisomal genes were not induced by PPAR&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Lawrence1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar results were obtained in primary human hepatocytes treated with fenofibrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Hsu1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we find that a number of genes involved in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, including the prototypical PPAR&#x003b1; targets ACOX1, ECH1, PEX11A, and ACAA1, is commonly induced by PPAR&#x003b1; in mouse and human. Simultaneously, we find that induction by PPAR&#x003b1; of numerous other peroxisomal genes, including Ehhadh, Pxmp4, Acot4, and Peci, is specific for mouse. Our data argue against a general mechanism and suggest that any lack of conservation of PPAR&#x003b1;-dependent gene regulation between mouse and human must be determined at the level of individual target genes.</p><p>Previously, it was shown that APOA1, APOA2 and APOA5 are upregulated by PPAR&#x003b1; agonists, which was found to be specific for humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Berthou1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-VuDac2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. While we confirm the human-specific upregulation of APO2 and APOA5 by Wy14643, we could not confirm the upregulation of APOA1 by Wy14643. Rather, we found a minor but statistically significant decrease in APOA1 expression after 6 h of Wy14643 treatment. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but may be related to the type of PPAR&#x003b1; agonist used. Overall, our data indicate that regulation of apolipoproteins A by PPAR&#x003b1; is specific for humans, which very likely accounts for the human specific induction of plasma HDL levels by fibrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006796-Kersten3">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several individual genes were identified that were also specifically regulated by Wy14643 in human hepatocytes.

Most notable examples were Fbp2 (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 2), Lgals4 (lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 4), and several Acots (Acyl-CoA thioesterases).</p><p>Studies in mice have yielded considerable evidence for a direct role of PPAR&#x003b1; in hepatic glucose metabolism.

To compare PPAR&#x003b1; expression in mouse and human hepatocytes, primers were used that yielded amplicons of equal length. A standard curve was included to confirm amplification efficiency of 100&#x00025;&#x000b1;2 for PPAR&#x003b1; and for the 18S control gene. PPAR&#x003b1; expression was calculated as 1/(&#x00032;&#x00302;(CtPPAR&#x003b1; a-Ct18S)), allowing for direct comparison between the two species.</p><p>Human liver RNA was obtained via Ambion and represented a mixture of RNA from 3 individuals without liver disease.
