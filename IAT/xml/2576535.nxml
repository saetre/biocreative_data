Much is known about hypoxic inhibition of mTOR activity; however, the cellular processes activating PERK remain unclear. Since hypoxia is known to increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), we hypothesized that hypoxic ROS regulate mTOR and PERK to control mRNA translation and cell survival. Our data indicate that although exogenous ROS inhibit mTOR, eIF2&#x003b1;, and eEF2, mTOR and eEF2 were largely refractory to ROS generated under moderate hypoxia (0.5% O<sub>2</sub>). In direct contrast, the PERK/eIF2&#x003b1;/ATF4 integrated stress response (ISR) was activated by hypoxic ROS and contributed to global protein synthesis inhibition and adaptive ATF4-mediated gene expression. The ISR as well as exogenous growth factors were critical for cell viability during extended hypoxia, since ISR inhibition decreased the viability of cells deprived of O<sub>2</sub> and growth factors. Collectively, our data support an important role for ROS in hypoxic cell survival. Under conditions of moderate hypoxia, ROS induce the ISR, thereby promoting energy and redox homeostasis and enhancing cellular survival.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>PO1 CA 104838</grant-num>.

Numerous studies indicate that O<sub>2</sub> availability regulates interdependent cell metabolism, growth, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). For example, cellular metabolism shifts from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis under low O<sub>2</sub>, partially mediated by stabilization of the &#x003b1; subunits of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">2</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). HIF promotes glycolysis by inducing glucose transporters and glycolytic genes, such as phosphoglycerate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase A, and suppresses the tricarboxylic acid cycle via pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Additionally, hypoxia enhances O<sub>2</sub> delivery by activating genes involved in erythropoiesis and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). These adaptations contribute to O<sub>2</sub> and energy homeostasis. Nevertheless, chronic hypoxia markedly reduces intracellular ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). As an adaptive response, mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis, and cell growth rates decrease during O<sub>2</sub> deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).</p><p>Hypoxia suppresses protein synthesis by inhibiting mRNA translation initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Moderate hypoxia (0.5-1.5% O<sub>2</sub>) inhibits m<sup>7</sup>-GTP cap-dependent mRNA translation by rapid 4EBP1 hypophosphorylation. 4EBP1 is regulated in O<sub>2</sub>-starved cells by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key kinase promoting cell growth, metabolism, and proliferation. Hypoxia inhibits mTOR by 1) AMPK/TSC2 pathway activation upon energy depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), 2) TSC2 stimulation by HIF-inducible REDD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), and 3) promyelocytic leukemia-mediated mTOR nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). O<sub>2</sub> deprivation also causes eIF2&#x003b1; hyperphosphorylation by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident pancreatic eIF2&#x003b1; kinase (PERK) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). These processes lead to a reduction in global protein synthesis. Finally, hypoxia increases eEF2 phosphorylation by eEF2 kinase, resulting in decreased translation elongation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to global protein synthesis inhibition during hypoxia, translation of ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) is enhanced upon PERK activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). ATF4 subsequently induces genes such as those encoding CHOP (DNA damage-inducible transcript 3), GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 34), and factors promoting glutathione biosynthesis and protein folding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Hypoxic PERK activation, eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation, and ATF4-mediated stress gene induction constitute a process known as the integrated stress response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>), which is also activated by increased unfolded protein load in the ER, or by disrupting ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). GADD34, via complex formation with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1C, dephosphorylates eIF2&#x003b1;, forming a negative feedback loop to relieve hypoxic translational inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). The ISR is an important protective response against anoxia; PERK<sup>-/-</sup> and eIF2&#x003b1; S51A mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit increased cell death when exposed to &#x02264;0.02% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Furthermore, Ras-transformed PERK<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs form tumors more slowly and exhibit less angiogenesis than PERK<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>).</p><p>Hypoxic mTOR regulation has attracted considerable attention, leading to the elucidation of multiple underlying mechanisms. In contrast, molecular events resulting in an ISR within hypoxic cells have not been fully delineated. Additionally, mechanism(s) responsible for the rapid HIF- and AMPK-independent mTOR inhibition observed within 30 min of hypoxia remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). We hypothesized that enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during hypoxia could mediate PERK and mTOR regulation. Several reports indicate that ROS can inhibit pathways regulating mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). For example, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> causes 4EBP1 hypophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>), and oxidative stress stimulated by arsenate and TNF&#x003b1; leads to eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). In mammalian cells, ROS are formed in response to toxic reagents or as by-products of O<sub>2</sub>-utilizing cellular processes, such as mitochondrial electron transport, cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, or NADH/NADPH oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). ROS have been shown to act as signaling molecules, activating ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1) and oxidizing reactive cysteine residues in protein-tyrosine phosphatases and protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Hypoxia inhibits multiple pathways regulating mRNA translation.</bold><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, schematic diagram of signaling pathways regulating mRNA translation during hypoxia.

Mitochondria appear to be the primary source for ROS during hypoxia, and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) are sufficient to stimulate multiple biological responses during O<sub>2</sub> deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Enzymatic antioxidants, such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase, suppress HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation during O<sub>2</sub> deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>), suggesting that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is a key biologically active form of ROS during hypoxia. We investigated the role of increased oxidative stress in regulating the ISR and mTOR and consequent effects on mRNA translation during O<sub>2</sub> deprivation. We also examined signaling pathways activated by exogenous ROS that exert translational regulation and compared these with hypoxia. We demonstrate that exogenous ROS regulate mTOR by a TSC2-independent mechanism and induce eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation by multiple kinases, including PERK and interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). More importantly, we report that although endogenous ROS do not regulate mTOR and eEF2, increased mtROS are critical for ISR activation during hypoxia. This ROS-induced ISR promotes energy and redox homeostasis by modulating protein synthesis and the induction of ATF4 target genes and constitutes an important early adaptive response to enhance cell survival and hypoxia tolerance.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials</italic>&#x02014;Antibodies for eIF2&#x003b1; and 4EBP1 proteins, phospho-eIF2&#x003b1;, rpS6, and AMPK were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.

Since modest hypoxia (&#x0003e;0.2% O<sub>2</sub>) and anoxia (&#x02264;0.02% O<sub>2</sub>) exhibit different kinetics of 4EBP1 and eIF2&#x003b1; regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>), we examined the effects of PERK on eIF2&#x003b1; during moderate hypoxia (0.5% O<sub>2</sub>). Phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; on Ser<sup>51</sup> increased 4-fold in PERK<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs after 2 h and was maintained over 20 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>).

We therefore investigated whether PERK plays a role in eIF2&#x003b1; regulation during oxidative stress. PERK<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs were exposed to 0-100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 h, and eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation and PERK protein mobility (an assay typically used to study PERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>)) were examined by Western blots. As little as 0.5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> elevated eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation, which was enhanced as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration increased to 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>), demonstrating that eIF2&#x003b1; is readily inhibited by oxidative stress. A time course study using 20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed significantly increased eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation after a 20-min exposure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), demonstrating rapid kinetics for eIF2 inhibition by oxidative stress. Importantly, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (20 and 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) also caused a moderate but reproducibly detectable shift in PERK protein mobility (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>), suggesting a dose-dependent post-translational modification of PERK proteins caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. High H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels resulted in increased PERK protein modification, resolved from unmodified PERK by a slight mobility shift. However, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PERK mobility change was significantly less pronounced than that resulting from thapsigargin, an ionophore disrupting ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. The reason(s) for this distinction are unclear at this time.</p><p>The multifactorial involvement of eIF2&#x003b1; kinases in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> responses was supported by examining protein synthesis using mutant MEFs.

PKR deletion in addition to PERK and GCN2 in TKO cells further alleviated the inhibition to 25% of vehicle control. Thus, we concluded that ROS activate multiple eIF2&#x003b1; kinases, including PERK and PKR. However, GCN2 does not appear to play a major role in this pathway.</p><p><italic>Hypoxia Enhances ROS Release</italic>&#x02014;We evaluated the impact of endogenous cellular ROS generated at 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> on pathways regulating mRNA translation. Given difficulties with typical 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorofluorescein diacetate assays of O<sub>2</sub>-deprived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>), we tested protein carbonylation as an indicator of oxidative stress. In this assay, whole cell lysates are probed to reveal multiple polypeptides exhibiting carbonyl modifications. Here, HEK293 cells were treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, hypoxia, or TNF&#x003b1; for varying lengths of time. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, 1 h) resulted in modest protein carbonylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>), whereas 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (1 h) generated significant protein carbonylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). As shown in supplemental Fig. 2, treatment of cells with 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is roughly comparable with growth in 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> based on 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence (although this assay is imperfect). Hypoxia for 2 h caused modest but reproducibly detectable increases in protein carbonylation, which was enhanced by extending treatment to 20 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Of note, TNF&#x003b1;, a cytokine augmenting intracellular ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), and 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> (20 h) resulted in similar levels of protein carbonylation. Therefore, oxidative damage accumulates during hypoxia. Furthermore, O<sub>2</sub> deprivation results in intracellular ROS levels comparable with or slightly less than TNF&#x003b1; treatment and 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Effects of hypoxic ROS on PERK activation were examined by measuring PERK protein mobility. Hypoxia (8-24 h) reproducibly induced subtle reductions in PERK mobility. Importantly, hypoxic alteration of PERK mobility was comparable with that of peroxide (20-100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). High doses (100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) caused enhanced PERK modification and increased resolution from unmodified PERK protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref> and supplemental Fig. 1<italic>B</italic>). Mobility changes induced by hypoxia and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were significantly less than that caused by thapsigargin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). As stated above, the reasons for these distinct effects on PERK mobility are currently unknown.</p><p><italic>Hypoxic mTOR Regulation Does Not Involve ROS</italic>&#x02014;To examine whether hypoxic mTOR inactivation is mediated by ROS, MEFs were infected with adenoviral catalase or GFP (negative control) and exposed to 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

Of note, hypoxic p70S6K and 4EBP1 hypophosphorylation was not affected by catalase expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>), implying that hypoxic mTOR regulation is independent of redox change.</p><p>To further evaluate ROS involvement in hypoxic mTOR and eEF2 regulation, HEK293 cells were transfected with empty vector or plasmid encoding catalase. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>, expression of catalase effectively alleviated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced rpS6 hypophosphorylation but not rpS6 hypophosphorylation caused by 20-h hypoxia, confirming that ROS do not affect mTOR activity during hypoxia. Similar to rpS6, catalase had an insignificant effect on eEF2 phosphorylation during hypoxia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that although ROS suppress mTOR and eEF2 activities <italic>in vitro</italic>, hypoxic mTOR and eEF2 inhibition does not involve ROS.</p><p><italic>ROS Activate the ISR during Hypoxia</italic>&#x02014;Given the similarity of hypoxia and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in causing subtle PERK mobility changes, we studied the effects of oxidative stress on PERK activation during hypoxia. Of note, eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation caused by hypoxia (20 h) and peroxide (20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) was reduced by catalase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>), implying that increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during hypoxia activates the PERK/eIF2&#x003b1; pathway. To extend these data, we tested hypoxic induction of ATF4 target genes in HEK293 cells using quantitative real time PCR. Hypoxia treatment induced GADD34, BiP, and CHOP as well as the HIF target phosphoglycerate kinase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>). Although catalase only partially reduced phosphoglycerate kinase induction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>), it effectively blocked the induction of all three ER stress genes during hypoxia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>), supporting the conclusion that enhanced ROS induce the ISR. Similarly, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, 6 h) dramatically increased GADD34, BiP, and CHOP expression in HEK293 cells, which was repressed by catalase (supplemental Fig. 3<italic>A</italic>). Interestingly, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> moderately enhanced phosphoglycerate kinase expression, and phosphoglycerate kinase induction was also suppressed by catalase (supplemental Fig. 3<italic>B</italic>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced phosphoglycerate kinase probably results from ROS-mediated HIF-1&#x003b1; protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). Overall, our data demonstrate that ROS and hypoxia activate the ISR, and these responses are abrogated by ROS scavengers.</p><p>We next determined whether catalase blockade of eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation affects actual protein synthesis during O<sub>2</sub> deprivation. This was accomplished using MEFs infected with adenoviral GFP or catalase. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>F</italic></xref>, catalase attenuated hypoxia-induced decreases in metabolic labeling from 45 to 25%, verifying that ROS play a partial role in regulating mRNA translation during hypoxia. The remaining 25% reduction in protein synthesis probably results from ROS-independent 4EBP1, eIF4E, and eEF2 modulation. In summary, we concluded that oxidative stress during hypoxia induces the ISR, resulting in decreased protein synthesis and activation of ATF4-regulated stress genes. Importantly, peroxide scavengers effectively suppress these stress responses.</p><p><italic>Mitochondrial ROS Modulate eIF2 Activity during Hypoxia</italic>&#x02014;Because ROS are important for activating the ISR during hypoxia, we investigated the source(s) of ROS causing this effect.

Altogether, our data suggest that ROS, especially mtROS, play an important role in hypoxic activation of the ISR.</p><p><italic>ISR Activation Protects Cells against O<sub>2</sub> and Growth Factor Withdrawal</italic>&#x02014;Previous studies by Bi <italic>et al.</italic> have shown that &#x02264;0.02% O<sub>2</sub> induces apoptosis within 12 h, and the PERK/eIF2&#x003b1; pathway is an important protective mechanism for cells experiencing anoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Since moderate hypoxia (&#x02265;0.2% O<sub>2</sub>) has been shown to affect cell survival differently from anoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>), we evaluated the effects of the ISR on cell survival at 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> using MEFs carrying knock-in alleles of eIF2&#x003b1; S51S (control cells) or S51A. Notably, the S51A mutation abolishes eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation caused by hypoxia, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and thapsigargin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). As a consequence, downstream ISR responses, including eIF-2&#x003b1;-mediated global translation inhibition, selective ATF4 translation, and induction of ATF4 target genes, are abrogated by the S51A mutation.</p><p>We exposed S51S and S51A MEFs cultured in regular medium (10% FBS, 4.5 g/liter glucose) to 21 or 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> for 48 h. Cell viability was assessed by colony formation. Consistent with a recent report that modest hypoxia alone is not cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>), S51S and S51A MEFs formed comparable numbers of colonies under normoxia and hypoxia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>), indicating that hypoxia resulted in only insignificant amounts of cell death (&#x0003c;10%) for both cell types. We then added secondary stresses by reducing glucose or serum concentrations in the culture medium to mimic cells residing in solid tumors, ischemic tissue, and stroke, where they are probably starved for growth factors and/or nutrients in addition to O<sub>2</sub>. Glucose reduction from 4.5 g/liter to 0.2 g/liter (10% FBS) did not result in any significant cell death following 48 h of normoxia or hypoxia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, growth factor withdrawal significantly attenuated cell survival under 0.5% O<sub>2</sub>. Approximately 90 and 98% cell death was detected for S51S and S51A MEFs, respectively, under low O<sub>2</sub> when serum was decreased from 10 to 0.5%, despite high glucose concentrations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). Neither 2-day glucose nor serum deprivation altered eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation in S51S MEFs during normoxia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). Therefore, in direct contrast to anoxia, hypoxia alone does not cause appreciable cell death. We concluded that growth factor availability is critical for maintaining cell viability during chronic hypoxia.</p><p>Since 48 h O<sub>2</sub> and serum starvation resulted in &#x02265;90% death for both S51S and S51A MEFs, we examined the effect of the ISR on cellular resistance to hypoxia by limiting treatment to 24 h. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>, cell survival was enhanced by less pronounced stress (0.5% O<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% FBS, and 4.5 g/liter glucose) for a shorter period of time. S51S cells exhibited 60% survival, as assessed by colony formation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). However, the eIF2&#x003b1; S51A mutation greatly compromised cell survival to 25% of normoxia under these combined stresses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>), demonstrating that the ISR protects cells from low O<sub>2</sub> and growth factor withdrawal. Moreover, ISR activation helps to maintain cellular energy balance under low O<sub>2</sub>. Intracellular ATP levels were lowered to &#x0223c;55% of normoxic levels in S51S cells, and S51A mutation resulted in significantly lower ATP levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>F</italic></xref>). Together, our data demonstrate that cells with a compromised ISR pathway exhibit elevated sensitivity to O<sub>2</sub> and growth factor deprivation. Therefore, an intact PERK/eIF2&#x003b1; pathway facilitates energy maintenance and cell survival during metabolic stress. However, prolonged O<sub>2</sub> deprivation (48 h) coupled with growth factor withdrawal results in cell death even if the ISR is intact.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>The PERK/eIF2</bold>&#x003b1; <bold>pathway is critical for adaptation to low O<sub>2</sub> and growth factor conditions.</bold><italic>A</italic>, eIF2&#x003b1; S51S and S51A MEFs were exposed to 20 h of 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> (<italic>H</italic>), 1 h 20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<italic>R</italic>), or 4 h of 0.8 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> thapsigargin (<italic>T</italic>). eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation in total lysates was determined. <italic>B</italic>, eIF2&#x003b1; S51S or S51A MEFs were exposed to 21 or 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> for 48 h in medium containing full (10%) or reduced (0.5%) FBS and full (4.5 g/liter) or reduced glucose (<italic>Gluc</italic>) (0.2 g/liter).

Cells exposed to significant levels of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> trigger eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation by multiple kinases and also inhibit mTOR in a dose-dependent manner through TSC2-independent mechanisms. In addition, intracellular ROS produced under hypoxic conditions play an important role in activating the PERK/eIF2&#x003b1;/ATF4 pathway. This response is quite specific, since hypoxic ROS do not affect mTOR and eEF2 activities. Finally, the ISR induced by PERK/eIF2&#x003b1;/ATF4 is adaptive and promotes cell survival during O<sub>2</sub> deprivation.</p><p>The mechanisms by which oxidative stress regulate the eIF2&#x003b1; kinases are complex and are not completely understood. Xue <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>) reported that ROS generated by TNF&#x003b1; signaling can activate PERK, whereas eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation induced by arsenate does not involve PERK. Here, we demonstrate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> promotes PERK-mediated eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Direct activation of PERK by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia was reflected in the modest but reproducible change in PERK protein mobility, which is similar to that reported for cells treated with TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Our data also indicate that multiple eIF2&#x003b1; kinases, including PERK and PKR, regulate eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation in response to exogenous ROS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). GCN2 plays a minor role at most, since H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment elicited comparable changes in protein synthesis in PERK<sup>-/-</sup> and PERK<sup>-/-</sup>/GCN2<sup>-/-</sup> DKO MEFs.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that the ISR is induced in hypoxic cells through activation of the PERK/eIF2&#x003b1;/ATF4 pathway. Interestingly, other regulatory pathways known to inhibit mRNA translation (mTOR and eEF2) were not affected by hypoxic ROS. These seemingly disparate effects of ROS suggest that their concentration in hypoxic cells may be insufficient to activate mTOR and eEF2 responses. This notion is supported by the observation that relatively high doses of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are required to exert effects on mTOR and eEF2 activity. Either the PERK/eIF2&#x003b1;/ATF4 pathway has a particularly low threshold for activation by ROS, or PERK is exposed to high localized ROS concentrations in the ER of hypoxic cells.</p><p>Many studies have demonstrated that hypoxic ROS are generated from the mitochondrial electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). It is also possible that ROS produced directly in the ER by ERO1 contribute to PERK activation. Oxidative protein folding occurs in the ER, which has a relatively low ratio of GSH/GSSG (1:1 to 3:1) compared with a greater than the 50:1 ratio in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>). Therefore, the ER may be particularly sensitive to changes in intracellular redox status. In addition, most ER ROS are produced by ERO1 through reoxidation of protein-disulfide isomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>), and hypoxia is known to induce the expression of ERO1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>). Interestingly, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> null cells (exhibiting decreased mtROS production) partially reduce PERK/eIF2&#x003b1; activation, suggesting that other ROS sources are involved. However, it should be noted that a physical association between the ER and mitochondria has been demonstrated, suggesting that mtROS are readily available to ER kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>). In contrast, mTOR and eEF2 may not be accessible to mtROS, although the 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorofluorescein diacetate assays provided in supplemental Fig. 2 suggest that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in cells exposed to 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> are sufficient to activate these targets.</p><p>It is noteworthy that several previous reports referred to essentially anoxic conditions (&#x02264;0.02% O<sub>2</sub>) as &#x0201c;hypoxic,&#x0201d; in contrast to the levels of O<sub>2</sub> (0.5%-1.5%) typically used to define hypoxia. Increasing evidence indicates that hypoxia and anoxia elicit different cellular responses. For instance, anoxia results in rapid eIF2 inhibition and a delay in eIF4F regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>), whereas modest hypoxia rapidly inhibits eIF4F and gradually increases eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). Moreover, 24 h of anoxia was sufficient to induce cell death in several reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>), whereas moderate hypoxia (0.5% O<sub>2</sub>, 48 h) does not affect cell viability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). Secondary stresses, such as serum deprivation, were required to induce cell death during 48 h of moderate hypoxia. Thus, it is important to consider the severity and the length of O<sub>2</sub> deprivation when studying O<sub>2</sub> effects on cell metabolism and survival. The ROS-induced ISR reported here is an important prosurvival mechanism under moderate hypoxia, a situation that occurs in multiple pathophysiological conditions.</p><p>ROS are well recognized for playing dual roles as both deleterious and beneficial factors. The &#x0201c;two-facet&#x0201d; character of ROS is substantiated by growing evidence that ROS can promote ER stress, DNA, protein and lipid damage, and apoptosis but can also activate adaptive intracellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). The effects of ROS on cellular functions are likely to depend on the location and concentration of ROS produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Chronic and high doses of oxidative stress may induce cell death. However, moderate ROS levels produced during hypoxia facilitate early hypoxia tolerance by inhibiting global protein translation, conserving ATP, and inducing ATF4 target genes modulating survival (<italic>CHOP</italic>), protein translation (<italic>GADD34</italic>), and removal of oxidative stress (heme oxidase-1 and enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism) via the ISR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>G</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). It is noteworthy that NRF2, another PERK substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>), is activated during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>), possibly by ROS. NRF2 activates the transcription of genes encoding detoxifying enzymes and antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). Together, ATF4 and NRF2 target genes form a negative feedback loop to modify mRNA translation and modulate energy and redox status during hypoxia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>G</italic></xref>).</p><p>We also demonstrate that both growth factor availability and ISR activation are crucial for preventing hypoxic cell death. The protective response conferred by extrinsic growth factors against O<sub>2</sub> deprivation is likely to involve multiple mechanisms. Growth factor signals promote nutrient uptake and their intracellular metabolism and the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>). Additionally, the ability of cells to stimulate anaerobic glycolysis in response to hypoxia depends on growth factor receptor-mediated HIF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Our data indicate that the ISR promotes hypoxia tolerance by inducing stress genes and facilitating cellular energy and redox homeostasis. This model is supported by the demonstration that cells with a compromised ISR pathway exhibit significant sensitivity to O<sub>2</sub> and growth factor deprivation.</p><p>Many pathologies, such as solid tumors, ischemia, stroke, neurodegerative diseases, and inflammation, result in cellular redox imbalances. Notably, these are also associated with O<sub>2</sub> deprivation and/or ER stress. As a result, appropriate administration of antioxidants or free radical-generating compounds are potential therapeutic modalities for treating these diseases. For example, antioxidants inhibit tumorigenesis in three different models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). However, proper treatment strategies can only be designed based upon improved understanding of the interactions between hypoxia and ROS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M805056200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M805056200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank members of the Simon, Diehl, and Thompson laboratories for thoughtful discussions and critical review of the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Simon, M.
