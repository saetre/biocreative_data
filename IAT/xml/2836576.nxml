The P1 promoter is &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-dependent and P2 is &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent. Two-thirds of transcripts terminate within the leader region and the remaining third comprises <italic>greA</italic> mRNA. Termination efficiency seems to be unaffected by growth phase. Two collections of small 40&#x02013;50 (initiating from P2) and 50&#x02013;60 nt (from P1) RNA chains, termed GraL, are demonstrable <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. We document that GraL arrays arise from an intrinsic terminator with an 11 bp stem followed by an AU<sub>7</sub>GCU<sub>2</sub> sequence. Atypical chain termination occurs at multiple sites; the 3&#x02032;-ends differ by 1 nt over a range of 10 nt. Transcripts observed are shown to be insensitive to Gre factors and physically released from RNAP&#x02013;DNA complexes. The abundance of individual chains within each cluster displays a characteristic pattern, which can be differentially altered by oligonucleotide probes. Multiple termination sites are particularly sensitive to changes at the bottom of the stem. Evolutionarily conserved GraL stem structures and fitness assays suggest a biological function for the RNA clusters themselves. Although GraL overexpression induces &#x02265;3-fold transcriptional changes of over 100 genes, a direct target remains elusive.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcription termination is important for gene expression. Terminators can occur in the intergenic regions as well as within open reading frames. Prokaryotic terminators are divided into two classes; intrinsic terminators can function with just RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the DNA template, whereas other terminators have a requirement for additional proteins (such as Rho, MFD). The distinction can be somewhat artificial because intrinsic terminators often can also be influenced by other protein factors, such as &#x003bb;N and Nus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). About half of the terminators in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> genome are thought to be rho-independent, intrinsic terminators.</p><p>Usually, an intrinsic terminator consists of a GC-rich dyad symmetry stem followed by a U-rich tract. Termination typically occurs 7&#x02013;8 bp downstream from the base of the stem. Many models of termination have been proposed over the years [for review, see ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>)], and refined by the availability of the structure of RNAP&#x02013;DNA complexes and the ability to manipulate elongation complexes at different stages of termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">3&#x02013;8</xref>). The most recent advances with single-molecule studies allow a unified view of this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). From this study and others, it is apparent that distinctly different mechanisms of termination (either forward translocation or shearing of the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid induced by the formation of the hairpin) are determined by sequences upstream of the stem, the U-tract sequence itself, and basepairing within the stem. For example, for terminators like t500, forward translocation is necessary when U-tracts contain other bases than U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). For terminators like tR2 and <italic>his</italic>, the pairing of the 2&#x02013;3 bp at the bottom of the stem facilitates shearing of the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids with a more uniform U-rich tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This model does not exclude that conformational changes within the RNAP are also important for termination. Several allosteric models have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Pausing of RNAP at the U-rich tract during elongation is thought to be a prerequisite for the folding of the terminator hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Paused RNAP can also lead to elongation arrest due to backtracking, which can be rescued by transcription elongation factors such as GreA and GreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), that are homologues of eukaryotic TFIIS factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These proteins bind to the secondary channel of RNAP and activate its intrinsic endonucleolytic activity to restore the proximity of the 3&#x02032;-end of the nascent RNA in the catalytic center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16">11&#x02013;16</xref>).</p><p>A growing class of proteins shares the ability to bind to the secondary channel of RNAP. Besides GreA and GreB, this family includes DksA, TraR, Rnk, Gfh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>) which do not apparently induce RNase activity, but have other regulatory functions.</p><p>DksA has been well studied with respect to its interaction with guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp). Both are implicated in positive and negative transcription regulation during the bacterial stringent response through direct interactions with RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, this response involves curtailing ribosomal RNA and tRNA synthesis during stress conditions, such as starvation for amino acids, carbon, iron, or phosphate. DksA and ppGpp regulation was shown to be in some cases synergistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>), and in others independent or opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>Evidence that GreA&#x02019;s effect on growth and <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 activity can be altered by the absence of DksA led to finding a role for GreA in the process of transcription initiation and to a proposal that a balance of these proteins might be needed for cell growth because of mutual competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Indeed, the relative abundance of GreA, GreB and DksA seems to be maintained during all phases of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Functional consequences do result from changing the balance of secondary channel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28">25&#x02013;28</xref>). We are unaware of studies of promoter region elements responsible for the expression of any of these transcription factors although the biochemical properties of GreA and GreB have been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16">13&#x02013;16</xref>).</p><p>Here, the promoter region for <italic>greA</italic> gene expression is characterized and is found to be complex. An array of short transcripts, that we call GraL, originates from two overlapping upstream P1 (&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>) and P2 (&#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>) promoters. We first document that two clusters of RNA are generated by an intrinsic terminator present in the leader region. The imprecise termination over a range of 10 nt is very unusual. To our knowledge, a range of termination exceeding four sites and differing by 1 nt is not reported in prokaryotes or eukaryotes. Therefore, we attempt to characterize the basis for this atypical behavior. We also document the likelihood that GraL has a biological function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>The strains used are <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 derivatives and are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1150/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>.

Although P1 might be silenced by mutation of either its &#x02013;10 or &#x02013;35 region, we feared these might inadvertently affect the properties of P2. Instead we estimate P2 activity by comparing P1P2 activity with P1. Reporter activities of P1 as well as P1P2 are found to be &#x0223c;4-fold more active than pA-all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The activities of P1 and P1P2 are nearly equivalent.

We explore this question by transcribing a linear template of the same promoter region (<italic>greA</italic> pA-all) using either RNA polymerase &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>- or &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A shows a time course of single round transcription with RNAP-&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> holoenzyme under transcription conditions optimized for P1 promoter activity, using ApU dinucleotide for initiation (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). As can be seen, accumulation of full-length run-off transcripts (labeled P1 FL) is accompanied by clusters of 50&#x02013;60 nt long transcripts (marked by brackets). The time course of accumulation for the full-length transcripts is quantitatively similar for the short transcripts when the bracketed region activities are pooled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, subpanel).</p><p>The array of short transcripts is reminiscent of paused or arrested transcripts. Therefore the effect of adding GreB or GreA was measured with the expectation that these factors might eliminate pausing during transcription elongation and abolish the short transcripts. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B that GreB does alter the initial pattern of short transcripts. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B subpanel shows GreB markedly reduces the time needed to reach the final plateau value of both full-length and short-transcripts. Compared to panel A, adding GreB increases the amount of both short- and full-length products by 2.4-fold (the values plotted in the subpanels are relative to 100% full-length activity).</p><p>GreA addition does not change the pattern of short transcripts and does not appreciably alter full-length product amount (only 1.4-fold), although the plateau is reached at the same time as when GreB is added (data not shown). The lack of inhibition by GreA is contrary to expectations of auto-repression by GreA seen <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). GreB-mediated transient changes verify that pause bands initially do exist; their faster disappearance shows the added GreB protein is catalytically active. The persistence of the cluster of short transcripts argues that the transcripts are refractory to reversal by Gre factors.</p><p>Similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) were obtained when RNAP-&#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> holoenzyme is used to initiate P2 transcription just 11 bp downstream from the P1 promoter. The P2 transcripts produced are appropriately shorter, 40&#x02013;50 nt long, rather than 50&#x02013;60 nt for P1, but the pattern seems to be the same, indicating the chain lengths must be due to differences in the 3&#x02032;-ends.</p></sec><sec><title>The cluster of short transcripts arises from termination</title><p>The failure of Gre factors to abolish the short transcripts from the P1 or P2 promoters could be because even if rescued, elongation complexes cannot read through the arrest/pause site, or because the transcripts are released from elongation complexes independently of Gre factors. To decide, we measured transcript release in the absence of GreA or GreB. To do this, open complex formation is first allowed between RNAP and biotin-labeled templates linked to avidin-conjugated agarose beads, then NTP substrates are added. Short incubation times ensure a single round of transcription (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). Equal volumes of supernatant (S) and supernatant containing beads (S+B fraction) are removed, and analyzed on gels to determine the proportion of short and full-length transcripts bound to the beads. Transcripts completely arrested or paused during elongation should not appear in the supernatant fraction. Transcripts completely released are expected to be equally abundant in both the S and S+B fractions because the beads are not further washed.</p><p>The results reveal similar amounts of short transcripts in both fractions when transcription is initiated with &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D), as well as with &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-holoenzyme (data not shown). One band is exceptional (marked P in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D), as it is twice as abundant in the bound fraction. This behavior suggests it is a paused band, whereas the other short transcripts are completely released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Consistent with this notion is a similarly positioned band seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B that is eliminated after prolonged incubation with GreB. On the other hand, the full-length transcript is predominantly retained in the S + B fraction and not released. This feature of full-length transcript association with beads has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Taken together, the appearance of short transcripts in the supernatant is due to release, not from pausing or arrest.</p></sec><sec><title>The terminator in the <italic>greA</italic> leader functions <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>The release of transcripts just described in the absence of additional factors <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D) indicates the presence of an intrinsic terminator despite the unusually broad range of chain terminating sites. The sequence of the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) is also suggestive of an intrinsic terminator with a dyad symmetry stem followed by a run of U residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). We constructed a <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion bearing the <italic>greA</italic>P1P2 promoters with this region present (P1P2+T) to compare with the previous <italic>greA</italic>P1P2 construct lacking this terminator. Reporter activity of the <italic>greA</italic>P1P2 fusion is lowered by the presence of the terminator to display activities that are similar to the original pA-all construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), as if the terminator can solely account for the lowered reporter activity.</p><p>In order to verify that the short transcripts exist <italic>in vivo</italic>, a northern blot was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Two clusters of short transcripts are detected, one centered &#x0223c;55 nt, and the other &#x0223c;45 nt, as if they arise from P1 and P2 promoter start sites. Notably, the clusters are present when pA-all and P1P2+T are present on a plasmid (lane 1 and 3), but nearly absent when the terminator is missing (lane 4). When present in single copy, these short transcripts are barely detectable by our northern blot assay (lane 5). One could argue that the range of RNA chain lengths in each cluster could be generated by exonuclease processing that depends on endonuclease activity of RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). However, an <italic>rnc</italic> mutation does not affect the pattern (lane 2), nor does a <italic>rne</italic> mutation (data not shown) which is well known to alter the abundance of small noncoding RNA (sncRNA) chains that function by pairing with mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> probes of the terminator structures</title><p>The P1 and P2 promoted RNA chains begin at single sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and C) but give rise to two clusters of transcripts, whose chain lengths vary over a range of 10 nt both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Evidently termination, not initiation, is imprecise.</p><p>We now explore this phenomenon with a series of oligonucleotides. A set of 20-mer oligonucleotides (&#x02018;pins&#x02019;), completely complementary to nascent RNA, was designed. Four members of the set (pins 1&#x02013;4) anneal to progressively decreasing portions of the upstream stem I. A fifth (pin 5) anneals to all of stem II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). We reasoned that when each oligonucleotide is added to a transcription reaction, its potential to impair termination reflects its ability to disrupt or prevent pairing of a region of nascent RNA structure that is crucial for termination, provided the enzyme does not preclude annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). We expect pin 5 to be a negative control, unable to disrupt RNA&#x02013;RNA terminator structure because of inaccessibility, as well as that newly synthesized RNA of stem II would be more likely to anneal with the adjacent unpaired stem I RNA.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D summarizes the effects on full-length product formation when pins are titrated in single round transcription assays. Since the saturation levels of pins 1&#x02013;4 are reached at the same concentration, it seems that binding affinities of these pins are similar and yet produce different effects on termination efficiencies and patterns of terminated transcripts.</p><p>The pin that gives the least interference with termination is indeed control pin 5. Pins 3 and 4 give nearly three times more full-length transcripts than either adding pin 5 or omitting pins altogether. Therefore pins 3 and 4 are the most efficient inhibitors of termination. Pins 3 and 4 should not anneal to more than the first 7 nt of the upstream stem RNA. Pins 1 and 2 anneal to all, or almost all, of the upstream RNA stem, respectively; these alter full-length transcripts at only moderate levels. It is important that the effects of pins on full-length transcripts are accounted for by reciprocal changes of short frayed end transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This behavior verifies that pin effects are terminator-specific whereas full-length transcripts generated by run off reflect terminator read-through. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Oligodeoxyribonuclotide &#x02018;pins&#x02019; differentially affect the pattern of short RNA chains produced during termination.

Pins 3 and 4 are the most efficient termination inhibitors but pin 4 seems to inhibit longer transcripts (bands 8&#x02013;10) more severely than pin 3. As expected, pin 5 has little or no effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in the terminator sequence at the bottom of the stem affect termination patterns and efficiencies</title><p>It is puzzling to find that pin 4 is such an efficient termination inhibitor when it could anneal only to the first four bases of the upstream RNA stem. The puzzle is because pins that anneal beyond these four bases are less effective, even when they anneal to all of stem I. In contrast, an oligo complementary to the entire stem I of tR2 completely inhibits termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>This could reflect a key role for termination of these bases in the upstream stem or the importance of the unpaired bases upstream of the stem. Our first approach involves construction of a template in which three bases at the bottom of stem I were swapped with corresponding bases in stem II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). This swap preserves the same terminator structure that maintains the same content of G:C to G:U RNA base pairs, but changes the identity of the sequence adjacent to the U-rich region. The last base of the stem changes from U to G in the swapped template, creating a GAU7 from the wild-type UAU7 sequence. Intuitively, this would be expected to interfere with termination because it makes the region less AU-rich. Surprisingly, the swapped template markedly improves the precision of termination since a single short transcript now predominates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E, band 2). Overall termination is also improved by the mutated template as judged by full-length transcript abundance (3.6-fold decrease). As a control, adding pin 4 to the swapped template that no longer allows it to anneal to its former site in stem I, does not alter the pattern of short transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). However, the full-length product increases by &#x0223c;2-fold. This implies that regions upstream of stem I are involved in termination efficiency as well as the stem itself. With this caveat, pin effects on termination in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A are specific and the precision of termination is strongly dependent on the pairing at the bottom of the stem. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Role of the terminator stem sequence and pairing on termination patterns.

Does the identity of the three bases adjacent to the run of U residues remain important if pairing is not preserved? Intuitively, the importance of this sequence is because of stem formation.</p><p>To address this, the three bases at the bottom of the stem were altered to disrupt base pairing by changing either the upstream (pAd1) or downstream (pAd2) triplet sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). If pairing is important, then it would be expected that pAd1 and pAd2 would yield more full-length transcripts than wild-type and pAswap, respectively. Indeed, pAd1 gives 2.5-fold more full-length transcripts than wild-type, and pAd2 gives 4-fold more than pAswap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and C).</p><p>On the other hand, if the identity of the downstream residues neighboring the U-rich sequence is important, then pAd2 should terminate more efficiently than pAd1, and be nearly as efficient as wild-type. This prediction comes from results with the pAswap template where the three bases preceding the U-rich region are UCG, the same as in pAd2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Again, we find that relative to each other, the pAd2 template gives more efficient termination than pAd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and E).We take these results to indicate that both pairing and the identity of the triplet sequence adjacent to the AU-rich region also contribute to termination efficiency at this terminator.</p><p>Both pAd1 and pAd2 disrupted templates change the patterns of transcripts within the cluster relative to both wild-type and pAswap template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). In both cases, the longer transcripts (bands 7&#x02013;10) of the wild-type are abolished, which is consistent with the shorter stem. Unexpectedly, the shortened stem of pAd2 shifts the predominant terminated band to a position more equivalent to wild-type band 3, which is longer than the corresponding product found for pAswap (band 2).</p><p>These experiments suggest that both sequence and stem structure at the bottom of the stem are important for imprecise termination to occur (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section).</p></sec><sec><title>Deleting terminator sequences at the top of the stem affect termination efficiencies but not the pattern</title><p>An array of termination sites could result from formation of alternative stem-loop structures as well as steric hindrance of RNAP by shorter versions of a long stem. In order to investigate this, we have examined a series of GraL derived templates with stems progressively shortened by a maximum of 4 bp just below the loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). The transcripts of these templates reveal the pattern of multiple termination sites persists, although the termination is now less efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and C). The relative termination efficiency is systematically lowered to 4-fold, when stem length is reduced from 11 to 7 bp. This implies a key role for the bases at the bottom of the stem as determinants for termination site precision, as if alternative stem-loop structures do not form. Conversely, the length of this terminator is an important determinant of its termination efficiency. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Role of the terminator stem length on termination efficiency and precision.

In instances where sequences are not conserved the intrinsic terminator motif is nevertheless a conserved structure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1150/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>B). For the four species considered, 17 out of 18 mutations in the stem region preserve the structure of the stem. This is a strong indication that there is an evolutionary pressure for the existence of a terminator structure associated with GraL.</p><p>We can calculate that the termination efficiency remains constant throughout growth (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section). Thus the role for GraL could be regulation of <italic>greA</italic> expression in trans, through a variety of mechanisms. To test this, a plasmid with IPTG-inducible GraL, but not GreA, was constructed (pKP-<italic>graL</italic>) and its overproduction accompanying induction was verified by northern analysis (20-fold increase over wild-type levels). This plasmid and its vector control were introduced into strains with a chromosomal lacI<sup>q</sup> allele and its effect on the activity of the <italic>greA</italic> pA-all-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion was monitored after GraL induction.

We asked if GraL overproduction affects cell fitness during repeated cycles of overnight growth and dilution into fresh rich (LB) media; this method provides a sensitive indication of a variety of biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). To initiate the test, we mixed equal numbers of wild-type cells harboring either a plasmid that constitutively overproduces GraL (pKP-<italic>graL</italic>), or its vector control. We monitored population abundance by marking one of the pair of strains with a <italic>malT</italic> allele. After each overnight growth cycle, cells were titrated on maltose-MacConkey plates, and red <italic>malT</italic>+ colonies and white <italic>malT</italic> mutant colonies were counted. To ensure that the <italic>malT</italic> marker mutation was not the source of fitness variation, two reciprocally marked culture mixtures were used, along with additional controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The reversion rate of <italic>malT&#x02212;</italic> to <italic>malT+</italic> was also monitored on maltose-MacConkey plates (data not shown). We find that the cells harboring the GraL overexpressing plasmid take over the population after four overnight cycles of growth reaching 92&#x02013;95% of the population. This occurs whether GraL is overproduced in <italic>malT+</italic> or in <italic>malT&#x02212;</italic> hosts. Similar experiments were performed with a vector carrying scrambled GraL sequence (pKP-GraL<sup>Scrambled</sup>), to confirm that the effects of GraL on fitness were sequence specific and not due to overproduction of any small RNA. The sequence upstream of the terminator stem was randomly mixed and the terminator hairpin was inverted. Northern blots verified that GraL<sup>Scrambled</sup> expression was equivalent to GraL in the previous experiment (data not shown). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, pKP-GraL<sup>Scrambled</sup> has only a weak negative effect on fitness, in contrast to the strong positive effect of GraL. We take this to mean overproduced GraL does have a biological effect in that it clearly increases cell fitness during growth in rich media.

We anticipate subtle changes would be detectable by microarrays because it took several days of culture for GraL overproducing strains to predominate. We chose to study the effects of GraL overproduction with an inducible promoter rather than deletion because eliminating the GraL terminator (with or without P1 and P2 promoters) would lead to changes in GreA levels. It has been shown that deleting or overexpressing GreA affects transcription of a large set of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>The effects of overproduced GraL were measured during exponential growth in LB as for the fitness experiments. We tested continuous exposure to elevated levels of GraL as well as a 15 min induction. We expected that short-term induction would reveal direct targets of GraL, whereas long-term exposure would generate many indirect effects as well. In all cases samples were collected in exponential phase of growth in LB (A600 = 0.6) (see <italic>&#x02018;</italic>Materials and Methods&#x02019; section for details)<italic>.</italic> Since few changes were found in a wild-type strain, similar experiments were performed in a ppGpp deficient strain (ppGpp<sup>0</sup>) because the absence of ppGpp renders cells vulnerable to a variety of global regulators. The absence of ppGpp does not result in a change of GreA levels (data not shown). We also find ppGpp has no significant effects on reporter fusions measured as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B, nor in our <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> (data not shown).</p><p>Our scoring criteria with some exceptions required at least a 3-fold change in the signal ratio, where both signals had to be significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) and at least one of the signal&#x02019;s value had to be above 300 (see legend to <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1150/DC1">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2</ext-link>). Four strains (wt/GraL, wt/vector, ppGpp<sup>0</sup>/GraL, ppGpp<sup>0</sup>/vector) are compared four ways.

For example, although effects of GraL depend on presence or absence of ppGpp, there is no case where GraL has the same effect in both backgrounds. Also, it is evident that gene expression during long-term GraL overproduction is less severely affected than during the short term, judging by the number of genes (45 versus 173; or 17 versus 130 when genes exclusively affected by ppGpp are excluded). In general, genes affected in the short-term are not a subset of those affected in the long-term; instead the common set is limited to: <italic>efeB, efeU, fhuA, napF, oxyS, relA, ryhB</italic> and <italic>spoT</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1150/DC1">Supplementary Tables S3 and S4</ext-link>), but again they don&#x02019;t appear in the same category. Of course <italic>relA</italic> and <italic>spoT</italic> are an exception because they are deleted in ppGpp<sup>0</sup> strains and thus their abundance seems to be down-regulated whether or not GraL is present.</p><p>The most predominant functional classes of genes found to be affected are those involved in iron uptake and metabolism (33 genes); flagella (25 genes) and amino acid metabolism (17 genes). All of these are reported to be regulated by ppGpp itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), underscoring a relation between GraL and ppGpp. It is notable that different iron genes are affected after short- and long-term exposure to GraL, whereas flagella genes and amino acid metabolism genes are only affected during short-term exposure (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>GreA itself is a transcription regulator that can interact with RNA polymerase at two levels, relief of elongational pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and promoter-specific facilitation of initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These features raise the possibility that GreA functions could be recruited to feedback regulate its own synthesis. Indeed, reporter <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions indicate that GreA can auto-regulate its expression; deletion of <italic>greA</italic> derepresses, and overproduction of GreA represses the reporter activity 2&#x02013;3-fold. However, this phenomenon could not be reproduced with the pure <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription system. Thus we conclude that the auto-regulation is due to indirect effects or additional factors are necessary to observe it <italic>in vitro</italic>. We were instead rewarded with a different discovery. The <italic>greA</italic> leader region contains two strong promoters and an unusual terminator that gives rise to two clusters of small RNA chains that we call GraL.</p><p>Despite the primer extension evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), the existence of the P3 and P4 promoters is questionable. First, they lack clear consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Second, we are unable to find <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription conditions that detect their activity (with RNAP&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> or &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>; data not shown). Third, <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter fusions yield barely measurable activities. It seems likely P3 and P4 primer extension bands are generated post-transcriptionally. Also, note that the primer anneals to sequences downstream of the terminator and only the P1 and P2 transcripts that read through the terminator are detected.</p><p>The intrinsic terminator accounts for the differences in <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter activities between <italic>greA</italic>pA-all and P1 or P1P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Also, auto-regulation by GreA, mentioned above, seems to rely on the presence of this terminator as the activity of the <italic>gre</italic>AP1P2+T fusion is derepressed in the absence of GreA, similar to the Pall fusion. On the other hand, <italic>greA</italic>P1 as well as <italic>greA</italic>P1P2 fusion strains did not exhibit this effect (data not shown).</p><p>The extent of termination <italic>in vivo</italic> can be calculated as 66% efficient from the difference between P1, P1P2 (&#x0223c;750 U) and P1P2 + T or pA-all (&#x0223c;250 U). The slopes of this differential plot seem constant over a wide range of cellular densities. <italic>In vivo</italic> termination efficiency is in good agreement with termination <italic>in vitro</italic>: &#x0223c;60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>Termination at the <italic>greA</italic> intrinsic terminator is exceptionally imprecise. The GraL RNA chains comprise a population whose ends range over ten nucleotides. The occurrence of these frayed ends <italic>in vivo</italic> is demonstrable by northern blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). This could be explained by post-transcriptional endonuclease attack, followed by exonucleolytic nibbling. However, the cluster of RNA chains is visualized in a pure <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). The purity of the <italic>in vitro</italic> system is validated because more precise termination is accomplished by swapping three base pairs at the base of the stem, preserving the structure of the terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Nevertheless, we tested the effects of <italic>rnc</italic> and <italic>rne</italic> mutants by northern blots, and found no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and data not shown).</p><p>We attempted to identify the ends of the short RNA chains by direct RNA sequencing (using 3&#x02032;deoxy-NTPs). However, compression due to the GC-rich sequence of stem II prevented a clear identification of the first termination site, despite substituting ITP for GTP in sequencing reactions (data not shown). Because of this caveat, we can pinpoint each terminated position &#x000b1;2 nt in the UAU<sub>7</sub>GCU<sub>2</sub> sequence.</p><p>The predicted structure with the 11 bp stem is rare; terminators with such long stems comprise only 12% among 148 natural terminators surveyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). To our knowledge, imprecise termination over a range of 10 sites is not reported previously in prokaryotes or eukaryotes. Rho-dependent termination, which is distinctly different from intrinsic termination, is known for its imprecision but the stop points are often spread over a 100 bp of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Therefore, we decided the basis of this behavior warrants further investigation.</p><p>A recent allosteric termination model proposes that the terminator hairpin forms within RNAP and induces extensive conformation changes across polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In this model, the 7&#x02013;8 bp lambda tR2 hairpin ultimately clashes with the G(trigger)-loop to shorten the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid that leads to the collapse of the transcription bubble and transcript release. It could be imagined that the 11 bp GraL stem might enhance the conformational constraints within RNAP. When the GraL hairpin is shortened without changing the 7 bp sequence at the bottom of the stem the termination efficiency is greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This could be viewed as favoring or disfavoring the model. On one hand it could be expected that the GraL terminator should be very efficient while having just a 7 bp hairpin. On the other, if the base line value for the termination efficiency is applied from the GraL 7 bp hairpin construct, it is consistent that the longer the stem length the better termination. Without crosslinking studies and modeling it is difficult at this point to predict what would happen with an 11 bp stem.</p><p>It has been proposed that formation of 2&#x02013;3 bp at the bottom of the stem is critical for termination through shearing of the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Because of the space constraint, basepairing at the bottom of the stem might be limited for longer stems. Thus it can be imagined that the GraL hairpin does not form completely. Yet, if pairing is disrupted at the base of the stem (pAd1), termination efficiency is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), as if pairing of the wild-type GraL stem is complete.</p><p>On the other hand, the 3 nt sequence just upstream of the U-tract is also important for termination, independent of basepairing. If this sequence is changed but basepairing is maintained, as for pAswap, termination efficiency increases relative to wild-type. If the same 3 nt sequence is present without basepairing (pAd2), the efficiency of termination is restored to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Still, the imprecision of the GraL terminator is yet another issue. Because of its uniqueness it is not addressed by current models, which are derived from studies of precise terminators. Our evidence is that basepairing and sequence at the bottom of the stem, not stem length, are important determinants of precision because imprecision persists when the stem is shortened from the top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The UAU<sub>7</sub>GCU<sub>2</sub> sequence of the GraL U-rich tract is also unique, as the first three residues of the tract are typically UUU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). However, the second A residue in this region of GraL does not seem to be evolutionarily conserved (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1150/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>), whereas the bottom basepair GU is. The significance of this is uncertain without knowing the precision of the other terminators. Still, the precision is greatly improved when the GU basepair is replaced by UG (pAswap, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the GraL terminator is an exception in terms of both structure and multiple termination sites. Its study can provide additional insights and constraints into mechanisms of termination derived from models based on typical terminators. Unusual chimeric terminators have contributed useful information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), and yet there are naturally occuring terminators that lack dyad symmetry stems and poly-U tracts that are unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p><p>It is a puzzle why transcription from the two strong promoters (P1 and P2) is terminated so that <italic>greA</italic> expression depends largely on read-through. To maintain a constant amount of <italic>greA</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) it would seem simpler to have a single constitutive promoter. The complexity of this region may be explained by additional role for GraL, independent of GreA.</p><p>An additional role for GraL is suggested by the conservation of its sequences and/or predicted structures among related enteric bacteria. The biological importance of GraL is experimentally verified by the fitness experiments described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Cells with constitutive overexpression of GraL do enhance biological fitness as judged by their 95% predominance over cells with wild-type GraL expression during repeated cycles of overnight growth on rich LB media. This could be due to effects during exponential growth, stationary-phase or outgrowth after dilution into the fresh medium. Since overexpression of an RNA with scrambled GraL sequence did not show similar effect, we conclude these effects are GraL specific.</p><p>In parallel with wild-type strains, the fitness experiment was attempted in a ppGpp<sup>0</sup> host. However, several <italic>malT</italic> alleles themselves had effects on fitness in this background and this prevented assessment of specific effects of GraL. We suspect this is because so many cell processes are affected by ppGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) that the <italic>malT</italic> mutation is likely to give multiple indirect effects.</p><p>Profiles of global transcription activity were performed in search of presumably subtle changes due to GraL overproduction. Contrary to our expectation acute GraL induction did not produce the expected smaller subset of genes when compared to long-term exposure. Strikingly, short-term changes appear only in a ppGpp<sup>0</sup> background. We attribute this to the likelihood that gene expression in a ppGpp<sup>0</sup> strain is already imbalanced and a subtle perturbation caused by GraL overexpression can have more pronounced effects.</p><p>Many genes repressed by Fur are activated by GraL in ppGpp<sup>0</sup> background during short-term exposure. A simple explanation would be that GraL affects Fur levels, instead of regulating expression of each gene individually. On the other hand, this does not explain why only some, and not all Fur-dependent genes are derepressed [specifically, the <italic>suf</italic> genes which are invariably affected by iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>)]. Since a western blot analysis reveals that Fur levels change by only &#x0223c;2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), perhaps there is a hierarchy of sensitivity of Fur operators, i.e. changes in Fur levels can titrate out operators with weak Fur binding. The mechanism by which GraL affects Fur levels remains to be determined. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Effects of GraL overexpression on Fur levels and iron assimilation phenotypes.

As evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B, there is no significant difference between strains bearing the GraL overproducing plasmid or the vector control in ppGpp+ background.

This might indicate perturbance of iron metabolism in the absence of ppGpp and presence of GraL.</p><p>On the other hand, GraL represses 25 genes involved in flagella synthesis and four chemotaxis genes during short-term exposure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Analysis of the data from four way comparisons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1150/DC1">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>) reveals that these genes are actually induced in the ppGpp<sup>0</sup> strain and GraL cancels this effect. These effects are evident for genes in early, middle and late operons for flagella synthesis, and include those regulated by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>F</sup>, and also apply to transcription of flagellar regulators <italic>flgM</italic>, <italic>flhDC</italic> (but not <italic>fliA</italic> that encodes &#x003c3;<sup>F</sup> itself). Exponential growth in LB is known to involve continuous switching between many different nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). There is also a report that carbon source starvation generally derepresses flagella and chemotaxis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Perhaps when GraL is overproduced in the absence of ppGpp, either starvation is not sensed, or there is not enough starvation to induce flagella. In support of this hypothesis, in a ppGpp<sup>0</sup> strain, GraL represses 17 genes involved in amino acid metabolism, including arginine, glycine, histidine, lysine, tryptophan and tyrosine.</p><p>Clear biological effects can be attributed to GraL. Yet, despite regulatory effects on over 100 genes, we are unable to identify the complementarity with target mRNAs that is usually expected of many small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). It is possible that GraL does not function through basepairing, but instead through binding of proteins, similarly to CsrA or 6S RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that in eukaryotes a chaperone that protects RNA polymerase III transcripts from 3&#x02032; exonucleases and promotes their maturation, La protein, binds RNA depending on the number of U residues at the 3&#x02032; termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Products of PolIII that do not possess long enough 3&#x02032;oligo U ends, undergo maturation in a different pathway. Perhaps something similar is happening in <italic>E. coli</italic> and there is a different function associated with different members of the GraL cluster, rather than all of the species acting similarly.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1150/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: this work was supported by <italic>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</italic> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development intramural program of the <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source>.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
