Our identification of direct c-Myc target genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with pair-end ditag sequencing analysis (ChIP-PET) revealed that nucleotide metabolic genes are enriched among c-Myc targets, but the role of Myc in regulating nucleotide metabolic genes has not been comprehensively delineated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here, we report that the majority of genes in human purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway were induced and directly bound by c-Myc in the P493-6 human Burkitt's lymphoma model cell line. The majority of these genes were also responsive to the ligand-activated Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein, Myc-ER, in a Myc null rat fibroblast cell line, HO.15 MYC-ER. Furthermore, these targets are also responsive to Myc activation in transgenic mouse livers in vivo. To determine the functional significance of c-Myc regulation of nucleotide metabolism, we sought to determine the effect of loss of function of direct Myc targets inosine monophosphate dehydrogenases (IMPDH1 and IMPDH2) on c-Myc-induced cell growth and proliferation. In this regard, we used a specific IMPDH inhibitor mycophenolic acid (MPA) and found that MPA dramatically inhibits c-Myc-induced P493-6 cell proliferation through S-phase arrest and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate the direct induction of nucleotide metabolic genes by c-Myc in multiple systems. Our finding of an S-phase arrest in cells with diminished IMPDH activity suggests that nucleotide pool balance is essential for c-Myc's orchestration of DNA replication, such that uncoupling of these two processes create DNA replication stress and apoptosis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>MYC, which encodes the c-Myc (herein termed Myc) transcription factor, is frequently altered in human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Hecht1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Nesbit1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

This compilation highlights the critical role of MYC in human cancers and the importance of Myc target genes in mediating its oncogenic activity. The causal role of MYC in tumorigenesis is underscored by the tumors arising from its ectopic expression in various tissues of transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Cory1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Shchors1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequent to initial studies demonstrating that forced expression of MYC in lymphoid tissues resulted in lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphomas, virtually all other studies of constitutive or inducible MYC in tissues from skin to liver resulted in neoplastic transformation of the targeted tissue. Studies with these models have also revealed that MYC mediated tumorigenesis includes the concurrent activation of cell growth and proliferation along with inactivation of apoptotic pathways in a tissue specific fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Pelengaris1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Shchors1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The Myc protein heterodimerizes with Max to bind DNA, stimulate and repress transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Adhikary1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Schneider1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Global gene expression analysis now connects MYC with diverse metabolic pathways with an overrepresentation of Myc responsive genes involved in glucose and nucleotide metabolism. Although Myc's regulation of glucose metabolism has been well delineated, the connection between Myc and purine or pyrimidine metabolism is not well understood. It stands to reason, however, that a master regulator such as Myc must somehow couple cell cycle traversal through S-phase with regulation of nucleotide metabolism and energy generation.</p><p>Our global mapping of MYC binding sites in a human B cell lymphoma model identified over 2000 binding sites with 668 direct Myc target genes gleaned from accompanying microarray gene expression analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Zeller2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Among the direct Myc target genes is a statistically over-represented small set involved in nucleotide metabolism. This observation led us to determine comprehensively whether genes involved in both purine and pyrimidine synthesis pathways are directly regulated by Myc. We observed that virtually all genes involved in nucleotide <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis are up-regulated and bound by Myc. Although many nucleotide metabolic genes are up-regulated by Myc-ER in Myc null rat fibroblasts, only phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) survived the criterion of cycloheximide treatment, which would prevent indirect activation of targets. Cycloheximide, however, was found to be very problematic due to the noise induced by cycloheximide treatment alone.</p><p>To determine the effect of loss of function of target genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis on MYC-responsive B cell proliferation, we used a specific pharmacological inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), mycophenolic acid (MPA), and found that inhibition of IMPDH caused DNA replication stress, apoptosis and DNA replication arrest in B cells with high ectopic MYC expression. This arrest was rescued by a downstream metabolite precursor, guanosine, suggesting that maintenance of a balanced nucleotide pool is essential for proper DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Our studies demonstrate a link between MYC, a master regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and the regulation of nucleotide biosynthesis genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line P493-6, carrying an inducible MYC repression system, was a generous gift of D.

In the absence of estrogenic compounds, the Myc-ER protein is bound by HSP90 in the cytoplasm. Upon binding estrogenic compounds such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen, the chimeric protein disengages from HSP90 and translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes with Max and activates transcription even in the presence of cycloheximide, which blocks protein synthesis. Hence, direct Myc target genes are considered to be those that are responsive to Myc-ER in the presence of cycloheximide. This system is confounded by changes in the expression of specific genes induced by cycloheximide alone. In this regard, we arbitrarily consider direct Myc targets in this system to be induced at least 1.3 fold by Myc-ER in the presence of cycloheximide but no more than 1.3 fold by cycloheximide alone <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g005"><bold>Figure 5a</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.</p><fig id="pone-0002722-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002722.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>PPAT and DHODH are direct c-MYC target genes in the HO.15 MYC-ER system.</title><p>(A) The experiment design was shown in the diagram.

The putative direct regulation of IMPDH2 by Myc is further underscored by the highly statistically significant co-expression of MYC and IMPDH2 (Pearson correlation coefficient &#x0003e;0.85) in microarray experiments among 73 human tissues or cells and 6 human cell lines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas">http://symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Loss of IMPDH activity inhibits cell proliferation and survival of P493 B cells</title><p>Because many nucleotide metabolic genes appear to be directly regulated by Myc, we sought to determine the effects of loss of function of a specific enzyme, IMPDH, in purine metabolism on Myc-mediated cell proliferation and growth. In particular, we wish to delineate whether inhibition of IMPDH in high MYC expressing cells would simply deprive cells of guanosine and cause a G1-S checkpoint arrest or cause S-phase stress with apoptosis as an exit strategy for the perturbed cells. To determine if IMPDH is essential for MYC stimulation of cell proliferation, we used mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of the well-known clinical immunosuppressant Cellcept and specific inhibitor of IMPDH1 and IMPDH2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Ji1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. MPA inhibited P493-6 cell population growth in a dose-dependent manner with dose ranges that are clinically achievable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>). We also found that guanosine, which is converted first to guanine and then to GMP through HGPRT, could partly rescue the proliferative inhibitory effect of MPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Ji1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. We also studied the Ramos human Burkitt lymphoma cell line, and found that it is similarly inhibited by MPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g006"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>) and also rescued by low doses of guanosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g006"><bold>Figure 6D</bold></xref>). Intriguingly, high doses of guanosine inhibit cell proliferation that is associated with apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (data not shown). Hence, guanosine's own growth inhibitory effects at high concentrations confound its ability to rescue MPA inhibition. As such, we presumably could not use a sufficiently high concentration of guanosine to replenish the deficient state caused by MPA.</p><fig id="pone-0002722-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002722.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Mycophenolic acid (MPA) inhibits proliferation in P493-6 cells (left panels) and Ramos human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (right panels).</title><p>Cell proliferation was analyzed by using colorimetric microplate assay in which tetrazolium salt was bioreduced to orange product.

Similarly, we observed that the MPA-treated apoptotic Ramos cells were also rescued by guanosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g007"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>). Since MPA-induced apoptosis was almost fully rescued by guanosine, apoptosis is unlikely to account fully for the slowed population doubling with exposure to MPA. Hence, we determined the effects of MPA on the cell cycle. P493-6 cells synchronized by double thymidine block were released in the presence or absence of MPA and cells were harvested at 4, 8, and 12 hours for flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g008"><bold>Figure 8A</bold></xref>). Staining of cells for DNA content reveals that MPA treated cells persisted longer in S phase at 4 and 8 hours as compared with control cells or cells treated with MPA but rescued with guanosine. These studies suggest that MPA causes a delay in S phase.</p><fig id="pone-0002722-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002722.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Mycophenolic acid (MPA) induces apoptosis in P493-6 and Ramos cells.</title><p>Cells with designated treatments were subjected to annexin V staining with 7-AAD and flow cytometry after 48 hours.

Studies were performed after treatment with MPA with and without guanosine rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g008"><bold>Figure 8B</bold></xref>). MPA treated P493-6 cells display a population of S-phase cells that have severely blunted incorporation of BrdU that could be rescued by guanosine, but not by adenosine or inosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g008"><bold>Figure 8B</bold></xref>). We note in the guanosine-rescued cells, however, a change in the morphology of the BrdU and 7-AAD 2-dimensional flow cytometric dot plot. In particular, the S-phase BrdU arc, which normally curves down toward the G2M fraction of cells, is increased and peaked over the G2M region of the rescued cells. We surmise that while additional dGTP provided by guanosine is sufficient to allow additional incorporation of BrdU, the MPA-treated cells reaching G2M are not able to divide in the time window of the BrdU pulse. The blunted BrdU incorporation with MPA treatment suggests that DNA stress due to limited dGTP results in slowed DNA replication and diminished cell proliferation. We similarly found that the blunting of BrdU incorporation by MPA in Ramos cells could be fully rescued by guanosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g008"><bold>Figure 8C</bold></xref>). Furthermore, we observed that MPA treatment activated the phosphorylation of H2AX (&#x003b3;H2AX) that could be rescued by guanosine in both P493-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g008"><bold>Figure 8D</bold></xref>) and Ramos cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002722-g008"><bold>Figure 8E</bold></xref>). These observations are compatible with DNA stress induced by MPA depletion of dGTP, particularly at 500nM MPA which caused an S phase arrest or delay. In aggregate, the studies suggest that an ongoing maintenance of nucleotide pools is necessary for normal DNA replication, which could be stressed by imbalance in these pools particularly in Myc-driven cells. These findings also strongly suggest that the upregulation of IMPDH1 and IMPDH2 by MYC is essential for the proper transit of cells through S phase, such that interruption of IMPDH function results in an S phase delay or arrest that is accompanied by evidence of replication stress and apoptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>MYC is not only a proto-typical oncogene when activated in cancers, but it is also a master regulator of normal cell growth, cell proliferation and metabolism. In this regard, Myc as a transcriptional regulator has been shown to regulate a number of cellular metabolic functions including its upregulation of glycolytic genes and genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis. The coupling of energy metabolism and the cell cycle machinery by Myc ensures that adequate energy is attained for DNA synthesis. Hence, we sought to determine in this study whether Myc also couples cell cycle progression with regulation of nucleotide metabolism.</p><p>A balanced pool of dNTPs is not only required for the fidelity of DNA replication, but a total increase in the pool during S phase is also essential for cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Kunz1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Mathews1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous studies have shown that regulation of this pool is critical, such that an increase in any component of the pool would lead to misincorporation of nucleotides, resulting in mutagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Mathews1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the balance of the dNTP pool is regulated largely by the numerous enzymes catalyzing the inter-conversion of dNTPs, how the cell increases the total dNTP pool in synchrony with the cell cycle and DNA replication machinery is largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Kunz1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we demonstrate that one of the key regulators of cell cycle, MYC, can also directly activate genes involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and prepare the cells ready for cell cycle transition.</p><p>To identify direct Myc target genes, it is crucial to determine if the target genes are directly bound by Myc and their expression responds to Myc induction. ChIP is the only easily accessible method that provides direct evidence for the <italic>in situ</italic> association of a transcription factor to a specific target gene. We observed that the majority of the genes in the nucleotide biosynthetic pathways are directly bound by Myc. Furthermore the expression of these genes also peaked after the induction of Myc, thereby supporting the direct regulation of purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic genes by Myc.</p><p>Another criterion for the identification of direct Myc target genes is the induction of a target gene in the MYC-ER system in the presence of cycloheximide. As discussed above, the inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide is expected to prevent synthesis of a secondary factor that could activate secondary responsive genes. Hence, genes that respond to MYC-ER in the presence of cycloheximide are considered to be direct Myc targets. Although hypothetically appealing as a principle, the MYC-ER system is confounded by the effects of cycloheximide itself on the mRNA levels of specific genes. In this regard, the MYC-ER system is a highly stringent system for the inclusion of direct Myc targets, but its limitation prevents its use to eliminate genes as direct targets of Myc. In particular, it is possible that a feed-forward loop could be driving a direct Myc target such that Myc induces a hypothetical transcription factor X, which together with Myc are both required to activate a direct Myc target gene. The use of cycloheximide would prevent the induction of factor X and hence blocks the induction of a feed-forward loop direct Myc target. In our experience, the use of cycloheximide is associated with significant noise in the mRNA levels of specific genes in the nucleotide metabolic pathways. Well-known direct Myc targets such as the CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase) did not behave as a direct Myc target in our current study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Boyd1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the lack of the typical pattern of MYC-ER responsiveness with or without cycloheximide should not be used to exclude genes as direct c-MYC targets. Notwithstanding these caveats, PPAT and DHODH survived the MYC-ER criterion and were found to be bona fide direct Myc targets that are involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis.</p><p>Intriguingly, MYC was found to directly activate the expression of SHMT1, and SHMT2, which are enzymes involved in single carbon metabolism and are essential for dNTP synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Nikiforov1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. SHMT1 and SHMT2 donate single carbons to tetrahydrofolate for the methylation of dUMP to dTMP by thymidylate synthase, which was demonstrated to be a direct MYC target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Mao1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. SHMT2 was previously discovered as a gene that could partially rescue the diminished growth of rat fibroblasts lacking both copies of c-MYC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Nikiforov1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Our work indicates that MYC globally activates nucleotide biosynthesis by directly transactivating virtually all genes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis. In this fashion, the upregulation of cell cycle genes, such as cyclin D2 and CDK4, by MYC is coupled with an increase in dNTP nucleotide pool through direct activation of nucleotide biosynthetic genes. Nucleotide metabolic genes are hence not just &#x02018;housekeeping&#x02019; genes.</p><p>The coupling of cell cycle traversal with nucleotide biosynthesis is likely to involve the E2F family members since ribonucleotide reductase is a known target of E2F1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Chabes1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-DeGregori1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, our bioinformatics analysis of Myc binding sites identified by ChIP-PET revealed that the consensus binding site for E2F is highly statistically enriched in DNA fragments associated with Myc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Zeller2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Analysis of target genes with both Myc and E2F consensus sites reveal a group that are directly involved in DNA replication, such as MCM3, MCM4 and CDC6. In addition, analysis of the nucleotide metabolic gene promoters also reveals an enrichment of E2F sites. It is notable that Myc can induce E2F1 as a direct target, and in this regard Myc and E2F1 could participate in a putative feed-forward loop with nucleotide metabolic genes as direct targets of both transcription factors. We surmise that the orchestration between the cyclin-CDK axis, the DNA replication machinery and nucleotide pool regulation involve coordinating transcriptional regulation by MYC and E2F; however, the role of E2F family members in this context is beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>Nucleotide biosynthesis has been a cornerstone target for cancer chemotherapy that has contributed to the remarkable responses of many cancers including lymphoid malignancies. In fact, some of the more profound immunosuppressants, such as MPA and leflunomide, are inhibitors of nucleotide biosynthesis that is clearly required for normal lymphocytic immune function. We sought to determine the influence of MPA, which inhibits IMPDH function and hence reduction of GMP, on the proliferation, apoptosis and BrdU incorporation of the human P493-6 B cells bearing an inducible MYC construct. Although not unexpected, MPA at clinically relevant levels caused a significant growth inhibition. This inhibition, however, could be partly rescued by guanosine. While guanosine could fully rescue MPA-induced apoptosis, it is unable to rescue the S-phase arrest, indicating a dominant effect of MPA on S-phase arrest.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that MYC directly regulates genes involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. The global regulation of virtually all genes involved is consistent with the concept of metabolic control analysis (MCA) which has demonstrated that beyond the traditional concept of rate-limiting biochemical steps, the activation of many points along a biosynthetic pathway is essential for the increased flux of metabolites toward the end product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002722-Fell1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. While increased nucleotide flux is clearly required for normal DNA replication, we surmise that deregulated MYC could create enhanced expression of nucleotide metabolism genes, which would in turn abnormally elevates the nucleotide pools that could contribute to genomic instability. The effects of deregulated nucleotide metabolism pathways downstream of MYC will require additional studies, for which our work has provided a firm foundation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002722.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Changes in pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes gene expression with induction of MYC in HO.15 Myc-ER cells.
