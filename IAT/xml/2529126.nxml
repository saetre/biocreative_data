In VHL negative renal cancer cells, VHL(-), the lack of fibronectin matrix assembly is thought to promote and maintain tumor angiogenesis allowing vessels to infiltrate tumors. Therefore, and considering the importance of this process in tumor growth, we aimed to study why VHL(-) renal cancer cells fail to form a proper extracellular matrix. Our results showed that VHL(-) cells were not defective in fibronectin production and that the fibronectin produced by these cells was equally functional in promoting cell adhesion and matrix assembly as that produced by VHL(+) cells. We have previously reported that VHL(-) cells fail to form &#x003b2;1 integrin fibrillar adhesions and have a diminished organization of actin stress fibers; therefore, we aimed to study if the small GTPase family is involved in this process. We found that activation of the RhoA GTPase was defective in VHL(-) cells, and this was possibly mediated by an increased activation of its inhibitor, p190RhoGAP. Additionally, the expression of constitutively active RhoA in VHL(-) cells resulted in formation of a fibronectin matrix. These results strongly suggest an important role for RhoA in some of the defects observed in renal cancer cells.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported in part by <grant-num>SAF2006-04013</grant-num> from the <grant-sponsor>Ministerio de Educaci&#x000f3;n y Ciencia (MEC)</grant-sponsor> (to M.

According to the clinical manifestations, the disease has been classified into VHL type 1 and VHL type 2. VHL type 2 disease is further classified into three categories: type 2A, type 2B, and type 2C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). VHL protein (pVHL) plays an important role in the oxygen-sensing pathway, and its best known function is to promote the ubiquitination and subsequent elimination by the proteasome of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF1&#x003b1; and HIF2&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Loss of VHL leads to activation of the HIF pathway in normoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>), which in turn leads to excessive transcription of HIF-&#x003b1; target genes, including the angiogenic factor VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Despite the latter providing an explanation for the high vascularization of VHL(-) tumors, it remains unclear how the loss of VHL leads to renal cancer.</p><p>A recent study has suggested that in fibrosarcoma tumor models, additional genetic changes other than dysregulation of HIF are necessary for the induction of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Indeed, other pVHL functions independent of the regulation of HIF have been reported. These include regulation of cell motility and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), stability of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), maintenance of an epithelial-like cell shape and monolayer organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), cell cycle and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>), ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), and in addition, it has been recently shown that it serves as a protein kinase adaptor regulating the activity of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>).</p><p>Adequate interaction of cells with the surrounding matrix regulates essential aspects of normal cell function, and breakdown of the basement membrane occurs in cancer progression and is often associated with solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). With regard to RCC tumors, we and others have shown that RCCs lacking VHL fail to organize a normal extracellular fibronectin (FN) matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Therefore, the lack of a proper cell matrix might be involved in the aggressive behavior of VHL(-) tumors. In addition, highly angiogenic tumors are not only dependent on the pVHL-HIF 2&#x003b1; degradation pathway but are also a consequence of loss of a proper extracellular matrix assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). Extracellular matrix assembly is a complex multistep process, which first requires binding of FN to cell surface integrins, mostly &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). Additionally, other events such as actin stress fiber formation and cell contraction are required for the progressive ordination into detergent-insoluble fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). These processes are mediated by the small Ras-type GTPase member RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). In this respect, we have reported the inability of VHL(-) cells to form &#x003b2;1 fibrillar adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) and intracellular actin stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), and other authors have shown that these cells also lack the proper assembly of actin and vinculin, which promotes actin stress fiber formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Comparative study of FN mRNA and protein levels in several VHL(</bold>+<bold>) and VHL(</bold>-<bold>) RCC cells.</bold><italic>A</italic>, FN gene transcription levels in 786-O, RCC4, UMRC, RCC10, and pVHL mutants were determined by quantitative real time PCR.

We have also studied the role of the signaling pathway that controls formation of actin stress fibers and cell contraction in the regulation of FN matrix assembly in VHL(+) and VHL(-) cells. Our results demonstrated that FN expression levels in VHL(+) and (-) cells showed no correlation with the ability to assemble a FN matrix and that VHL(-) cells expressed functional FN that was properly assembled by VHL(+) cells. Additionally, we found that the lack of FN matrix in VHL(-) cells was partly due to sustained down-regulation of RhoA activity via p190RhoGAP-increased activation.

To determine whether this was a general phenomenon in RCCs, we first analyzed the FN mRNA and protein levels in several RCC cell lines and in cells with different pVHL mutations corresponding to types 2A, 2B, and 2C phenotype of the VHL disease. These included the mutants Y112H (type 2A), C162F (type 2B), L188V (type 2C), and a nonneddylateable version of pVHL termed RRR (type 2C), or the control termed KRR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>), all of them on the RCC 786-O background. Remarkably, FN mRNA levels measured by quantitative RT-PCR were significantly lower in 786-O and UMRC VHL(+) cells than in their corresponding VHL(-) counterparts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similarly, FN mRNA levels in the various pVHL mutants were higher when compared with the corresponding levels in 786-O VHL(+) cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, in RCC10 cells, FN mRNA expression was always higher in VHL(+) <italic>versus</italic> VHL(-) cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>We also analyzed FN protein levels in cell lysates or deoxycholate-insoluble fractions derived from all these cell types. In agreement with the mRNA data, VHL(-) and mutants derived from 786-O parental cells consistently showed higher FN protein expression than 786-O VHL(+) cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Because VHL(-) cells do not assemble FN, the FN encountered in the deoxycholate-insoluble fraction could be due to FN interacting with other cytoskeletal proteins. In contrast, RCC4, RCC10, and UMRC VHL(-) cells had lower FN protein levels than their VHL(+) counterparts, both in lysates and in deoxycholate-insoluble fractions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Therefore, protein levels did not always correspond with mRNA levels, and this might be partially explained by the fact that protein levels were measured in total cell lysates. Therefore, we discarded part of the FN contained in the conditioned medium. Interestingly, we purified FN from the conditioned medium of the different VHL(+) and (-) cell lines and found similar FN-secreted levels (data not shown). To further confirm the above conclusion, we analyzed the assembly of FN matrix in the absence or presence of exogenous FN. We have previously reported that addition of exogenous FN did not re-establish assembly in 786-O VHL(-) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Here we analyzed the assembly in three additional cell lines, RCC4, RCC10, and UMRC and in the VHL mutants described above. Our results showed that VHL(-) cells cultured on uncoated or FN-coated coverslips did not form visible FN fibrils, suggesting that FN availability is not exclusively responsible for their incapacity to form a matrix (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Interestingly, VHL(+) but not VHL(-) UMRC cells, only formed a visible matrix when cultured on exogenous FN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>), indicating that, in this particular case, low secretion of FN (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>) might be responsible for the lack of FN matrix in this VHL-expressing cell line. Additionally, none of the three different mutants, type 2A, 2B, or 2C, were able to assemble FN even when it was exogenously added (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Altogether, these results indicated a heterogeneous expression of FN on the various VHL(+) and VHL(-) RCCs and most importantly, that lack of matrix assembly by VHL(-) cells could not always be attributed to low FN production in these cells.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>FN stretching and cell matrix contacts in VHL(</bold>+<bold>) <italic>versus</italic> VHL(</bold>-<bold>).</bold><italic>A</italic>, 786-O VHL(+) and VHL(-) cells were plated on coverslips previously coated with FN (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) and cultured for either 4 h or 24 h.

We therefore studied whether the FN produced by VHL(-) cells was able to bind to its receptor, the &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin, and to form fibrils. To this end, we first performed cell adhesion experiments using FN purified from VHL(+) or VHL(-) cell-conditioned medium. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>, all cell lines showed similar levels of adhesion to FN from either source, and this was independent of their VHL status. These results indicated that FN synthesized by VHL(-) cells is able to mediate cell adhesion as efficiently as that synthesized by VHL(+) cells. Moreover, they also indicated that the lack of FN assembly by VHL(-) cells is not due to a decreased &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin activity, further extending our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) as well as those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), showing that expression and activation of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 on VHL(-) cells are normal.</p><p>We also compared the ability of FN purified from the conditioned medium of VHL(+) and VHL(-) cells to assemble into fibrils. Our results confirmed that VHL(-) RCCs did not assemble a FN matrix, even in the presence of exogenous FN from VHL(+) cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, VHL(+) RCCs consistently formed a FN matrix when cultured either on FN purified from their own conditioned medium or from that of VHL(-) cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). To discern between assembly of endogenous and exogenous FN, we used UMRC VHL(+) cells, because they barely produce FN, and hence they do not assemble unless we provide them with exogenous FN (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>, UMRC VHL(+) cells showed a similar assembly pattern when cultured on FN from VHL(+) or VHL(-) cells. Therefore, these results indicated that FN produced by VHL(-) cells does not interfere with normal FN function in VHL(+) cells. Additionally, they clearly established that FN secreted by VHL(-) cells is fully functional and able to be assembled by VHL(+) cells.</p><p><italic>VHL(</italic>-<italic>) Cells Are Unable to Trigger the FN Stretching Necessary for Its Assembly</italic>&#x02014;We have previously shown that VHL(-) cells fail to assemble proper &#x003b2;1 fibrillar adhesions (FAs), a cell matrix adhesion structure essential for FN assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Therefore, the lack of proper formation of actin stress fibers and cell contraction could explain the defective assembly of FN by VHL(-) cells, because these events are required for the exposure of cryptic sites in FN and its progressive ordination into detergent-insoluble fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). To further analyze this process, we repeated our previous studies but now in the presence of exogenous FN to determine if VHL(-) cells were able to initialize the first steps of FN stretching required for its assembly into fibrils. After 4 h in culture, we analyzed by confocal microscopy the formation of focal contacts (FCs) by staining with paxillin, a major component of these structures, and with a FN antibody to see how FN was being stretched from these structures. Our results showed that VHL(+) cells arranged proper FCs, and the initial steps of fibril formation with short fibrils appearing at the edge of the FCs were very evident (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>panels c</italic> and <italic>d, white arrow-heads</italic>). In contrast, VHL(-) cells, although forming proper FCs, were not as efficient as VHL(+) cells, and the number of cells forming proper FCs were lower compared with VHL(+) cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>panels f-h</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). These results strongly support our findings in that the impaired or defective formation of focal contacts may affect the proper formation of fibrillar adhesions required for FN assembly into fibrils. After 24 h, these structures became more mature and organized elongated FAs, which colocalized with FN fibrils in VHL(+) cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>panels j-l</italic>, see magnified area). On the contrary, and even in the presence of exogenous FN, VHL(-) cells failed to form FA structures as well as arranging FN into fibrils, (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>panels n-p</italic>). These results and our previous observation of a diminished organization of actin stress fibers in VHL(-) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) support the hypothesis that a decreased FN stretching could contribute to the lack of FN assembly in these cells.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>RhoA activation state in VHL(</bold>+<bold>) and (</bold>-<bold>) RCCs.</bold><italic>A</italic>, 786-O RCCs were cultured for 3-4 days in the absence or presence of the RhoA signaling inhibitor, Y27632 (5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) or the activator LPA (6 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>).

In the presence of Y-27632 or 2-3-BDM, inhibitors of RhoA downstream effectors, we found that the assembly of FN was completely abolished in VHL(+) cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref> and data not shown). Interestingly, stimulation of RhoA by LPA resulted in increased FN fibril formation in VHL(+) cell cultures and induction of a few FN fibrils by VHL(-) cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). We next performed RhoA activity assays using the C21-GST fusion protein. We evaluated RhoA activity in a time course from 0 to 72 h in culture. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>, the RCC cell line 786-O stably expressing wild-type pVHL showed a basal RhoA activity, which progressively increased over time. In contrast, 786-O VHL(-) cells and the VHL mutant L188V, had a very low basal RhoA activity that did not increase over time (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Similar results were obtained for the RCC4 cell line, which displayed higher levels of active RhoA in VHL(+) compared with VHL(-) cells (supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggested that the RhoA signaling pathway was playing a role in the functional alterations observed on these VHL(-) cells. Furthermore, the results with the type 2C mutants, which retained the ability to regulate HIF as the VHL wild type, indicated that RhoA activity in these cells seems to be independent of HIF.</p><p><italic>Constitutive Activation of RhoA Stimulates FN Assembly by VHL(</italic>-<italic>) Cells</italic>&#x02014;To obtain further evidence for the involvement of RhoA in the lack of FN assembly in VHL(-) cells, we introduced a constitutively active (GFP RhoA-Q63L) or a dominant negative (GFP RhoA-N19) recombinant RhoA form in VHL(-) and VHL(+) cells, respectively. The expression of RhoA was increased at least three times (supplemental Fig. S2). Three days after infection, we analyzed changes on cell morphology and observed that infection of VHL(+) cells with GFP RhoA-N19 did not induce phenotypic alterations (data not shown). In contrast, infection of VHL(-) cells with GFP RhoA-Q63L, induced an epithelial cytoarchitecture that resembled that of VHL(+) cells. Cell dimensions changed from 70 &#x000b1; 5-&#x003bc;m length and 20-&#x003bc;m width to 35 &#x000b1; 10-&#x003bc;m length and 20-&#x003bc;m width after infection with RhoA-Q63L, whereas infection with the empty vector did not have any effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). We next analyzed whether infection with these mutants induced alterations in the assembly of FN. Immunofluorescence experiments with VHL(+)/GFP RhoA-N19 cells revealed a decrease of FN fibrils when compared with the control VHL(+) cells or with cells infected with the empty vector (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>top</italic>). The GFP RhoA-Q63L mutant did not increase the constitutive FN matrix assembly observed on VHL(+) (data not shown). In contrast, infection of VHL(-) cells with GFP RhoA-Q63L stimulated the assembly of FN into fibrils, with a recovery of at least 39% with respect to that observed in VHL(+) cells. However, infection with the empty vector had no effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Altogether, these results further supported the conclusion that the inability of VHL(-) cells to properly assemble a FN matrix is due, at least in part, to an impaired activation of RhoA.</p><p><italic>Down-regulation of RhoA Activity in VHL(</italic>-<italic>) RCC Cells Correlates with Increased p190RhoGAP Phosphorylation</italic>&#x02014;Down-regulation of RhoA activity has been correlated with activation of GTPase-activating proteins such as p190RhoGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>).

We achieved an 85-95% interference detected by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>). Silencing p190RhoGAP partially restored the ability of VHL(-) cells to form FN fibrils, with a 39% of recovery (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>), and the resulting pattern was similar to that observed for (Q63L)RhoA-transfected VHL(-) cells. We also tested whether this effect was due to increased RhoA activity.

Considering that regulation of FN assembly by pVHL seems to be essential for its tumor suppressor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), the aim of our studies was to understand why VHL(-) RCC cells fail to form a proper extracellular matrix. An altered integrin expression/function or insufficient FN synthesis could account for this defect. However, we previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) that integrin expression or function did not significantly differ in VHL(+) or VHL(-) cells, and in this work we confirm that FN production did not correlate with its assembly. With respect to this, some RCC tumors accumulated FN in the tumor cell cytoplasm, and little or none in the stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), suggesting a defective transport and secretion of FN that could account for the lack of FN assembly by these cells. However, our previous results using cultured cells showed no evidence of intracellular accumulation of FN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated that VHL(-) cells maintain the ability to secrete FN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). These findings support our present results showing that the levels of FN produced by VHL(-) cells are apparently independent of its ability to assemble into a matrix.</p><p>Thus, other possibilities have to be considered regarding the regulation of FN assembly by pVHL. First, it has been proposed that VHL interaction with FN might be necessary for FN matrix assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). A direct interaction between pVHL and collagen IV was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>), indicating that the role of pVHL in the remodeling of extracellular matrix components is not exclusive for FN. Kurban <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) also demonstrated that the pVHL/collagen interaction seems to be necessary for collagen assembly into fibrils. However, it remains unclear how pVHL mediates this process, although these authors demonstrate that the effect of pVHL on the regulation of collagen assembly is independent of its ligase activity. With respect to FN, and given the role of pVHL in proteasomal-mediated degradation, pVHL could be involved in the removal of abnormally processed FN molecules; thus, regulating FN at the post-transcriptional level. Although this is still a possibility Kurban <italic>et al.</italic> also showed that the pVHL-FN interaction is indirect; hence it could be in fact mediated through collagen IV. Therefore, although a direct or indirect pVHL-FN interaction might be important, it may not always be sufficient to support FN assembly.</p><p>A second possibility is that pVHL indirectly regulates FN assembly by regulating other extracellular proteins that degrade this matrix. In this respect, it has been proposed that extracellular FN in VHL(-) cells is degraded by the increased activation of metalloproteinases such as MMP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). This possibility agrees with the fact that increased expression of MMPs is a consequence of pVHL loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). Finally, and considering our present results in which VHL(-) cells were unable to assemble exogenously added FN produced by VHL(+), we can suggest that additional functional defects associated with the lack of VHL and different from FN itself might also be taking part in this process. Therefore, in this report, we analyzed the possibility that intracellular events such as cytoskeleton reorganization and cell contractility might be regulating the assembly of FN in VHL(+) cells. In this regard, VHL(-) cells do not form proper structures related to cytoskeleton organization and cell contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). These facts support our present observations showing that VHL(-) cells plated on exogenously added FN were unable to make the initial FN stretching necessary for its assembly. This process might be partly caused by a deficient activation of the small GTPase RhoA in these cells. Because RhoA is an important regulator of cell cytoskeleton organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>), the altered activity of this GTPase in VHL(-) cells may also account for the fibroblastoid phenotype observed in VHL(-) cells. This phenotype, also caused by the lack of proper cell-cell adhesion structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), may also contribute to the lack of matrix assembly in these cells. In this respect, we clearly show that VHL(-) cells have a deficient RhoA activity, probably due to increased activity of the RhoA inhibitor p190RhoGAP. This was also supported by our results in which we partially restored the ability to form FN fibrils in VHL(-) cells, in which we silenced the p190RhoGAP gene. Besides these results, no relationship between pVHL and Rho-GTPases has been established to date, and thus it is still unclear how pVHL regulates this process. One possibility is that pVHL regulates Rho-GTPases indirectly, through a second VHL-interacting protein. For example, pVHL interacts with several atypical PKCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>) and may regulate its cellular activity in certain cases (Okuda and co-workers, Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Atypical PKCs have been involved in the regulation of the GTPase RhoA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>). Moreover, PKC-&#x003b4; was shown to interact with p190RhoGAP in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>). It is therefore possible that pVHL interaction with atypical PKCs regulates the activity of Rho-GTPases by modulating the phosphorylation state of RhoA inhibitors (GDI, p190RhoGAP) or activators (GEF). This hypothesis would be in agreement with our present results showing an increased p190Rho-GAP phosphorylation in VHL(-) cells. Another remaining question would be how decreased RhoA activity in VHL(-) cells may account for their phenotypic changes and contribute to tumorigenesis. It is well known that Rho GTPases have been involved in the pathology of various human diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>), and interfering RhoA activation via p190RhoGAP leads to melanoma cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to think that decreased Rho GTPase activity may be also involved in the pathogenesis of renal carcinomas.</p><p>In summary, our present study demonstrates that FN production and function are not deficient in VHL(-) cells but rather that altered intracellular signals regulating cell contractility contributes to the inability of these cells to assemble an FN matrix. Furthermore, our results with type 2C mutants indicated that these mechanisms are independent of HIF. Thus, we provide a mechanism that explains some of the defects in extracellular matrix assembly observed in VHL(-) cells. The precise role of pVHL in this mechanism and whether this is a general mechanism in other cell lines remains to be established.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M709390200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M709390200_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M709390200_2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Kaelin, W.
