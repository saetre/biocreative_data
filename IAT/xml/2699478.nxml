In contrast to mice, human Treg cells express isoforms of this protein. Besides the full length version (FOXP3fl), an isoform lacking the exon 2 (FOXP3&#x00394;2) is co-expressed in comparable amounts. Recently, a third splice variant has been described that in addition to exon 2 also misses exon 7 (FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7). Exon 7 encodes for a leucine zipper motif commonly used as structural dimerization element. Mutations in exon 7 have been linked to IPEX, a severe autoimmune disease suggested to be caused by impaired dimerization of the FOXP3 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>This study shows that the lack of exon 7 does not affect (homo-) dimerization. Moreover, the interaction of FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 to RUNX1, NFAT and NF-kB appeared to be unchanged in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and reporter gene assays, when compared to FOXP3fl and FOXP3&#x00394;2. Nevertheless, retroviral transduction with FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 failed to induce the typical Treg-associated phenotype. The expression of FOXP3-induced surface molecules such as CD25 and CTLA-4 were not enhanced in FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 transduced CD4&#x0002b; T cells, which also failed to exhibit any suppressive capacity. Notably, however, co-expression of FOXP3fl with FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 resulted in a reduction of CD25 expression by a dominant negative effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The leucine zipper of FOXP3 does not mediate dimerization or interaction with NFAT, NF-kB and RUNX1, but is indispensable for the characteristic phenotype and function in Treg cells.

The human protein comprises 431 amino acids (aa). It contains a repressor domain (aa 67&#x02013;132), a zinc finger (aa 199&#x02013;222), a leucine zipper motif (aa 239&#x02013;260) and a conserved DNA binding forkhead domain (FKH) at the C-terminus (aa 335&#x02013;418).

Exon 2 (aa 72&#x02013;106) associates and represses the function of retinoic acid-related orphan receptors &#x003b1; and &#x003b3;t (ROR&#x003b1;, ROR&#x003b3;t) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Du1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Ichiyama1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

While both FOXP3fl and FOXP3&#x00394;2 contribute to the phenotype of human Treg cells, the genes affected by the two isoforms seem to overlap only partly.</p><p>Recently, a third isoform has been identified lacking in addition to exon 2 also exon 7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Smith1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Exon 7 encodes for a leucine zipper motif (aa 239&#x02013;260; VX<sub>6</sub>LX<sub>6</sub>LX<sub>6</sub>L). The region was thought to be indispensable for FOXP3 function, since the analysis of different IPEX patients unveiled a concentration of fatal FOXP3 mutations in the FKH and the leucine zipper region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Ziegler1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Leucine zippers are a common dimerization element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Landschulz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and IPEX mutations lacking either a lysine residue at position 250 or a glutamic acid residue at position 251 in fact fail to dimerize during immunoprecipitations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Chae1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Li1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the region is also located proximal to another important binding site. The Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is reported to target a region c-terminal to the leucine zipper, which seems to be crucial for the induction of CD25 and the suppression of IL-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Ono1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we show that, despite the absence of the leucine zipper, FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 is still able to dimerize with all FOXP3 isoforms. Moreover, NFAT- and NF-kB-mediated transcription as well as direct binding to RUNX1 are not affected by the absence of exon 7. In contrast to FOXP3fl and FOXP3&#x00394;2, FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 fails to induce the expression of CD25 and CTLA-4 and does not mediate suppressive capacity into transduced CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x02212; T cells. As FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 is able to inhibit the FOXP3fl- or FOXP3&#x00394;2-induced expression in a dominant negative fashion, it may therefore have a regulatory impact on the function of the other two isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression and sub-cellular distribution of FOXP3 isoforms</title><p>Human Treg cells express constitutively high levels of the two FOXP3 isoforms FOXP3fl and FOXP3&#x00394;2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Hori1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Schubert1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We generated cDNA transcripts of purified Treg cells and identified in addition to these two isoforms a splice variant that lacks exon 2 and also exon 7. The latter was previously described as FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Smith1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. To test whether all FOXP3 isoforms can be expressed by mammalian cells, HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1&#x0002b; constructs, encoding for FOXP3fl, FOXP3&#x00394;2 or FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7.

However, the experiment did not reveal a clear result regarding the relative amount of FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 as at higher lysate concentrations the view was obstructed by the much broader band of FOXP3&#x00394;2 migrating slightly above FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7. To determine the relative frequency of the three isoforms in human PBMC we therefore performed also an RT-PCR analysis of primary CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b; T cells freshly isolated from healthy donors. Primer pairs spanning from exon 1 to exon 2 (FOXP3fl), from exon 1 to exon 3 (FOXP3&#x00394;2) and from exon 6 to exon 8 (FOXP3&#x00394;7) were used to analyse the amount of transcript for each isoform. By comparing 5 different donors a similar pattern for the relative ratios of FOXP3 splice variants was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006104-g002">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). In line with previous reports the dominant isoforms were FOXP3fl and FOXP3&#x00394;2. The amounts were comparable although, at least on the transcriptional level, FOXP3&#x00394;2 always exceeded FOXP3fl 2&#x02013;3 times. In comparison, FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 is much less frequent. 15&#x02013;70 times less transcripts were detected compared to FOXP3fl. In contrast to the isoforms of genes such as CD45 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Hermiston1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> the ratio was apparently unaffected from the activation status of the cells.

To determine the influence of the leucine zipper we, therefore, investigated the ability of the natural isoforms to form complexes with FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7. FLAG-tagged FOXP3fl was co-transfected with FOXP3fl, FOXP3&#x00394;2 or FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 in HEK293T cells, and dimeric FOXP3 complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with &#x003b1;-FLAG agarose. Western blot analysis confirmed that FLAG-FOXP3fl binds FOXP3fl, but also revealed that FOXP3&#x00394;2 and, surprisingly, also the leucine zipper deficient FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 isoform are able to bind FOXP3fl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006104-g003">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>).

While it lacks apparently its suppressive functions, it is able to inhibit FOXP3fl in a dominant negative manner. The effect is caused by the loss of exon 7, encoding for a typical leucine zipper domain usually used for homo-/heterodimerization.</p><p>Alternative splicing is a mechanism commonly used by eukaryotes to increase the functional variety of proteins by exon creation and/or loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Modrek1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. It is estimated that about 40&#x02013;60&#x00025; of human genes are alternatively spliced. In the case of FOXP3 the loss of exon 2 eliminates some of its repressor function, as it abrogates the interaction with ROR&#x003b3;t, the transcription factor driving the differentiation towards Th17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Zhou1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to this, FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 also lacks the leucine zipper domain in exon 7, which has been thought to be particularly crucial for the homodimerization of FOXP3. The latter assumption was based on the impaired dimerization reported for IPEX mutations &#x00394;K250 and &#x00394;E251 targeting this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Chae1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Li1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, however, the complete loss of this region in FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 did clearly not impair homodimerization with itself or any of the other FOXP3 isoforms. Also the homologue region in the N-myc protein was initially thought to be required for homodimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Chatila1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent findings showed instead that the N-myc leucine zipper mediates exclusively heterodimerization with other binding partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Nair1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Lebel1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In analogy, also exon 7 may therefore primarily mediate interactions with leucine zipper proteins other than FOXP3.</p><p>In contrast to the IPEX-linked single amino acid deletions &#x00394;K250 and &#x00394;E251 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Chae1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Li1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, the complete absence of exon 7 did not affect NFAT-mediated transcriptional repression. In this respect, the single amino acid deletions seem to have a more dramatic effect on the overall structure of the protein than the loss of the domain. Moreover, also the interaction with NF-kB was apparently not disturbed by the missing exon. This, however, may depend on the experimental system, since others have reported an isoform-specific effect in transfected Jurkat cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Krejsgaard1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although this would have matched the phenotype induced by FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7, co-immunoprecipitation experiments clearly showed that RUNX1 is still able to bind.</p><p>Smith et al. reported that FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 inhibits IL-2 release and CD69 upregulation in T cells cotransfected with a chimeric CD28/TCR&#x003b6; receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Smith1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In our system, however, FOXP3 transduction had no influence on CD69 expression (data not shown). In contrast to FOXP3fl and FOXP3&#x00394;2, FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 does not increase CD25 and CTLA-4 expression. Moreover, FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 expressing T cells are not able to inhibit lymphoproliferation. Thus, while FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 is able to recruit transcription factors, it is apparently functionally inactive with regard to the suppressor functions commonly linked to FOXP3. Notably, co-expression of FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 and FOXP3fl resulted in a reduction of FOXP3-induced CD25 expression but no FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7-mediated downregulation of CD25 was observed after exogenous overexpression in freshly isolated CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b; human Treg cells (data not shown). Although FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 clearly exhibits a dominant negative effect, at this point it is not clear yet if it is caused solely by the competition for transcription factors or also by the occupation of DNA binding sites. Also still unclear is whether FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 lost any ability to induce a Treg-like expression pattern or if some direct inducer/repressor function is conserved.</p><p>The crucial question relates to the physiological role of the FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 splice variant. In natural Treg, FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 is present at rather low copy numbers. The dominant negative effect observed in vitro after ectopic expression is therefore unlikely to have any significant impact in these cells. Others have shown, however, that FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 is overexpressed by certain malignant cells. S&#x000e9;zary Syndrome is an aggressive variant of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. A recent study suggests that in most cases the transformed T cells express FOXP3, but only FOXP3&#x00394;2 and, even more abundantly, FOXP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006104-Krejsgaard1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.
