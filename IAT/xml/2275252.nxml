The mechanisms and determinants responsible for these peripheral neuropathies are poorly understood. Using both streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and transgene-mediated murine models of type 1 diabetes (T1D), we demonstrate that Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression varies with the neuropathic phenotype. We have found that both STZ- and transgene-mediated T1D are associated with two distinct phases of thermal pain sensitivity that parallel changes in TRPV1 as determined by paw withdrawal latency (PWL). An early phase of hyperalgesia and a late phase of hypoalgesia are evident. TRPV1-mediated whole cell currents are larger and smaller in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons collected from hyperalgesic and hypoalgesic mice. Resiniferatoxin (RTX) binding, a measure of TRPV1 expression is increased and decreased in DRG and paw skin of hyperalgesic and hypoalgesic mice, respectively. Immunohistochemical labeling of spinal cord lamina I and II, dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and paw skin from hyperalgesic and hypoalgesic mice reveal increased and decreased TRPV1 expression, respectively. A role for TRPV1 in thermal DPN is further suggested by the failure of STZ treatment to influence thermal nociception in TRPV1 deficient mice. These findings demonstrate that altered TRPV1 expression and function contribute to diabetes-induced changes in thermal perception.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Symptoms of this debilitating condition include progressive loss of thermal and tactile pain sensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although, most individuals with diabetic neuropathy experience reduced perception, a fraction (~10%) experience painful symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Results from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] show that intensive glycemic control for 5 years reduces the incidence of neuropathy by 60% in individuals with T1D, suggesting that dysregulated glucose metabolism contributes to neuropathy. However, the fact that strict glucose regulation does not completely prevent DPN suggests additional mechanisms of pathogenesis exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, sensory neuropathy can be detected in some individuals who have impaired glucose tolerance but may not meet the criterion for a diagnosis of frank diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The occurrence of hyperalgesia prior to hyperglycemia in some rodent disease models also suggests that aspects of altered sensory perception may be independent of glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Additional studies suggest that insulin deficiency or insulin insensitivity could contribute to development of DPN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Direct insulin signaling achieved by intrathecal administration of insulin reverses neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are involved in sensing physical and chemical stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. TRPV1 is a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>permeant non-selective cation channel expressed predominantly by unmyelinated C-fibers and thinly myelinated A&#x003b4; fibers and plays a major role in inflammatory thermal sensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. TRPV1 is activated by heat (~&#x0003e;43&#x000b0;C), protons, N-arachidonyl dopamine (NADA), anandamide and lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Sensitization of TRPV1 by phosphorylation is mediated by numerous factors including, prostaglandins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], bradykinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], serotonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], histamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], trypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and nerve growth factor (NGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Since TRPV1 is involved in inflammatory thermal sensation, it is logical to determine the expression and function of TRPV1 in DPN. Furthermore, capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist has been shown to improve sensory perception in humans with DPN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we have used STZ-induced and transgene-mediated diabetes models to study the role of TRPV1 in DPN. We show in these animal models of diabetes, DPN manifests as an initial phase of thermal hyperalgesia and a late phase of thermal hypoalgesia. These phenotypes are accompanied by up and down regulation of TRPV1, respectively. We further confirm our findings by the lack of these phenotypes in STZ-injected diabetic TRPV1 knock-out mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Induction of diabetes</title><p>All procedures used in this study were approved by the animal care and use committee at Southern Illinois University, School of Medicine and conformed according to NIH and institutional guidelines.

Mice were tested in the same room of barrier facility on the days the cages were not cleaned. Mice were placed individually on a Hot Plate Analgesia Meter (Harvard Apparatus, Boston, MA) maintained at a constant temperature of 52 &#x000b1; 0.3&#x000b0;C after observing them for 5 five minutes in the cage. The paw withdrawal latency (PWL) is recorded as the time taken for the animal to exhibit a distinct pain behavior either by a hind paw lick or a characteristic hind paw flick (whichever occurs first). Mice that did not respond within 20 seconds were removed from the hot plate to prevent tissue damage. We did not find a significant difference in PWL either with habituation (1&#x02013;2 hrs) or without habituation (5 min) inside the barrier facility. Hot plate testing was performed on randomly chosen animals from diabetic or control groups. After completing the test, the ear tags were read to place them in the appropriate groups. There was no significant effect of sex, therefore males and females were grouped together for further analyses. The PWL of control animals remained constant, any deviation that is significantly different from these values was considered as hyper (PWL &#x0003c;8 s) or hypoalgesic (PWL &#x0003e;12 s). The PWL was significantly higher (PWL &#x0003e;16 s) in TRPV1 knockout mice as compared to control mice.</p></sec><sec><title>DRG neuronal cultures</title><p>After determining the PWL, the DRG were dissected from diabetic and control mice euthanized by deep anesthesia with isoflurane followed by decapitation.

DRG were dissociated by trituration using fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Cells were plated on 12 mm poly D-lysine coated glass coverslips placed in 24 well plates and grown in neurobasal medium (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and 10 &#x003bc;l/ml B27-supplement (Gibco, Invitrogen corporation, GrandIsland, N.Y).

The pipette solution contained (in mM): 130 Na gluconate, 10 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.5 EGTA. Both bath and pipette solutions were adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solutions were used to avoid desensitization and tachyphylaxis of capsaicin-induced currents. Currents were recorded using a WPC 100 patch-clamp amplifier (E.S.F. Electronic, Goettingan, Germany). The capacitance and the series resistance were compensated. Data were digitized (VR-10B; Instrutech, Great Neck, NY) and stored on video tape. For analysis, data were filtered at 2.5 kHz (-3 dB frequency with an eight-pole low-pass Bessel filter; LPF-8; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and digitized at 5 kHz. Current amplitudes were measured using Channel 2 (software kindly provided by Michael Smith, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia).

Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml binding buffer and protein levels were quantitated using Biorad protein assay (Bio-Rad laboratories, Inc., CA).</p><p>Binding assay mixtures were set up on ice in glass tubes (Kimble Glass Inc.) and consisted of 100 &#x003bc;l binding buffer, 50 &#x003bc;l [<sup>3</sup>H] RTX (37 Ci/mmol specific activity, Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) and 100 &#x003bc;l membrane preparation (~50 &#x003bc;g/assay tube). In each set of experiments, nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 100 &#x003bc;l of cold 100 &#x003bc;M capsaicin (final concentration). Reaction mixtures were incubated in a 37&#x000b0;C shaking (50 rpm) water bath for 1 hour. Reactions were terminated by chilling assay mixtures on ice for 5 minutes. To reduce non-specific binding, 100 &#x003bc;l of bovine &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein (2 mg/ml; Sigma) was added into the binding mix and incubated for an additional 10 minutes. After incubation, samples were filtered over Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) pretreated with 0.05% polyethyleneimine.

In this study, 6&#x02013;10 weeks old mice of either sex were used and observed for a period of 7&#x02013;9 weeks after the onset of diabetes. Ins-HA.D2 single transgenic mice were injected with a single dose of STZ (200 mg/kg). Blood glucose levels were significantly elevated within one week after treatment and remained elevated for the entire course of the study (pre-injection, 157 &#x000b1; 4.4; week 1 post-STZ injection, 503.5 &#x000b1; 24.6; week 6 post-STZ, 578.6 &#x000b1; 15.6 mg/dl, n = 11, p &#x0003c; 0.001) as compared to control non-diabetic mice (pre-injection, 197 &#x000b1; 6.1; week 1 vehicle control, 183.6 &#x000b1; 2.2; week 6 vehicle control, 186 &#x000b1; 1.6 mg/dl, n = 6) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). As disease progressed, body weights of STZ-treated animals remained stagnant, whereas the body weights of control animals increased steadily (control week 1, 22.1 &#x000b1; 0.2; control week 6, 26.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 gms, n = 6; post-STZ week 1, 22.9 &#x000b1; 0.5; post-STZ week 6, 21.2 &#x000b1; 0.6, gms n = 11, p &#x0003c; 0.001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As indicated in the Method Section, mice were tested for thermal pain sensitivity by measuring PWL using a hot plate maintained at 52 &#x000b1; 0.3&#x000b0;C. An early phase of thermal hyperalgesia occurred 1&#x02013;3 weeks post-STZ treatment, which paralleled the onset of hyperglycemia (control week 2, 8.9 &#x000b1; 0.5 s, n = 19; diabetic week 2, 7.1 &#x000b1; 0.4, n = 33, p &#x0003c; 0.001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Hyperalgesia was followed by a second phase of apparently normal PWL (control week 4, 9 &#x000b1; 0.5 s, n = 19; diabetic week 4, 9.4 &#x000b1; 0.3 s, n = 18) and then a final phase of hypoalgesia beginning at week 6 (control week 8, 9 &#x000b1; 0.8 s, n = 19, diabetic week 8, 13.4 &#x000b1; 0.7 s, n = 8, p &#x0003c; 0.001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). As the disease progressed, the mice which did not appear healthy were not used further, hence the 'n' values decreased over the study period. Together these results indicate that STZ-induced diabetic animals exhibited an initial phase of hyperalgesia and a phase of hypoalgesia.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Changes in blood glucose level, body weight and thermal pain sensitivity in mice (Ins-HAD2) injected with STZ.

However, unlike STZ-induced diabetic mice, a uniform change in PWL was not observed in double transgenic diabetic mice. To best explain the observations, the animals were separated into three groups based on the following criteria. First, the animals were divided into two groups based on the animals that developed hypoalgesia vs. the animals remained hyperalgesic. The group of animals that showed hyperalgesia was further subdivided because a subset of animals exhibited only hyperalgesic phenotype.</p><p>One group of diabetic SFE/Ins-HA mice was characterized by an initial stage of hyperalgesia (week 11, 4.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 s, n = 12, as compared to control single transgenic, 8.9 &#x000b1; 0.3 s, p &#x0003c; 0.01, n = 19) followed by an intermediate phase of apparently normal pain sensitivity (week 16, 8.7 &#x000b1; 0.7 s, n = 12, as compared to controls 9 &#x000b1; 0.5 s, n = 19) and a late phase of thermal hypoalgesia, which lasted for the remainder of the study (week 18, 13.1 &#x000b1; 1 s n = 8, as compared to controls, 9.3 &#x000b1; 0.4 s, n = 19, p &#x0003c; 0.05) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

Dissociated neurons were obtained after confirming the phenotype by PWL. Neurons were grown in the absence of trophic factors to avoid post translational and post transcriptional modification and used within 8 to 10 hrs. Whole-cell currents from these neurons were recorded using different concentrations of capsaicin. Peak current responses to 1 &#x003bc;M capsaicin were significantly larger (1056 &#x000b1; 136 pA, n = 26 cells from 6 mice) (1.91 &#x000b1; 0.12 fold, p &#x0003c; 0.05) from DRG obtained from hyperalgesic mice as compared to the age matched control mice (545 &#x000b1; 83 pA, n = 23 cells from 6 mice).

These results demonstrate that altered TRPV1 currents correlate with altered thermal pain sensitivities in diabetic mice. We have used near saturating concentrations of capsaicin and the differences in current amplitude suggest that the TRPV1 protein content as a result of altered transcriptional regulation is higher and lower in hyper and hypoalgesic mice, respectively rather than phosphorylation state of TRPV1, where they showed prolongation of decay phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Altered capsaicin-evoked TRPV1-mediated whole cell currents in diabetic mice.

In this study, we used both STZ- and transgene- (TCR-SFE/Ins-HA; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]) mediated Type 1 diabetes (T1D) models to determine whether TRPV1 expression and function were altered with changes in thermal pain sensitivity in diabetes. STZ was used because of its frequent use in similar studies of DPN, rapid and efficient rate of hyperglycemia induction, and ability to produce and sustain a 'moderate degree' of hyperglycemia (~450&#x02013;500 mg/dl). However, STZ has toxic effects on cells other than islet beta cells that might confound results making it important to use other models of diabetes. Unlike diabetes induced by STZ, TCR-SFE/Ins-HA double transgenic mice become hyperglycemic spontaneously by 4&#x02013;6 weeks of age. Disease parallels human diabetes in that it is immune-mediated, affects both genders equally and results from selective destruction of islet beta cells.</p><p>STZ-induced diabetic mice exhibited two phases of altered thermal pain sensitivity, an initial transient phase of hyperalgesia followed by a phase of hypoalgesia. Similarly, when subjected to the hot plate test, transgenic diabetic mice exhibited two phases of altered thermal pain sensitivity. However, the transition to different phases was not uniform in these animals. Careful examination of thermal sensitivities of individual mice over the course of the study allowed for classification of three unique phenotypes. One group exhibited thermal sensitivities similar to those observed with STZ treated mice. Thus, phenotype 1 was characterized by a period of hyperalgesia followed by a sustained phase of hypoalgesia. A second group of diabetic TCR-SFE/Ins-HA mice exhibited thermal hypoalgesia at approximately the same age as observed for phenotype 1 mice but lacked an early hyperalgesic phase (phenotype 2). The third group of animals became slightly hyperalgesic and remained hyperalgesic during the course of the study (phenotype 3). It is unclear why these unique thermal sensitivity phenotypes are observed among syngenic mice with uniformly dysregulated glucose control. Together these behavioral studies show altered heat sensation, a finding in diabetic neuropathy, is present in our animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence of TRPV1 involvement in the altered thermal nociception of diabetic mice</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that the altered pain sensation is due to changes in TRPV1 because the altered temperature sensitivity corresponds to the temperature range that activates TRPV1. We provide four lines of evidence to support the involvement of TRPV1. First, thermal sensitivity was not altered among STZ-induced diabetic TRPV1 deficient mice demonstrating the thermal sensitivity in diabetic mice is dependent on TRPV1. However, a significantly higher PWL was observed in TRPV1 knock-out mice as compared to wild type mice with similar back ground strain suggesting that TRPV1 knock-out mice has deficiency in acute thermal pain sensation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>Second, TRPV1 mediated capsaicin induced currents in DRG neurons collected from mice exhibiting hyperalgesia or hypoalgesia were significantly larger or smaller, respectively, compared to currents obtained from euglycemic control mice. The change could be as a result of enhanced expression or sensitivity. The increase was observed in saturating concentrations of capsaicin confirming increased TRPV1 protein levels rather than as a result of increased sensitivity due to phosphorylation of TRPV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Third, RTX binding assays demonstrated that TRPV1 expression parallels thermal sensitivity. DRG neurons from hyperalgesic mice bound more RTX and hypoalgesic mice bound less RTX than DRGs from age-matched euglycemic control mice. It is conceivable that peripheral TRPV1 expression might influence expression in DRG; therefore, we determined TRPV1 levels from the paw skin. Peripheral TRPV1 expression mirrored that observed in DRG neurons. Thus, changes in TPRV1 expression parallel the thermal sensitivity observed among diabetic mice and are seen both at peripheral tissue and in DRG.</p><p>Fourth, we used immunohistochemical localization of TRPV1 in DH of the spinal cord, DRG neurons and the paw skin to confirm changes in TRPV1 expression detected in RTX binding assays and to determine if increased RTX binding was the result of ectopic TRPV1 expression (on neurons other than C and A&#x003b4; fibers). In the DH, there was no obvious co-localization of TRPV1 with the neuronal marker NeuN, suggesting that the distribution of TRPV1 in DH is predominantly in fibers projecting from DRG rather than in the cell body of DH neurons. We observed a significant increase in expression of TRPV1 in DH, DRG and paw skin from hyperalgesic diabetic mice as compared to age-matched control mice. Significant decreases were also observed among tissues harvested from hypoalgesic diabetic mice. Furthermore, the number of neurons expressing TRPV1 is altered in tissues harvested from hypoalgesic mice, but the total number of neurons remains unchanged. This is important to address because it has been suggested that there may be neuronal loss in diabetes leading to altered thermal sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. We found the number of neurons expressing TRPV1 was higher in hyperalgesic mice, consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. There was no change in the number of neurons expressing TRPV1 in hypoalgesic mice relative to controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible down stream events leading to altered TRPV1 expression</title><p>In diabetes, the link between abnormal thermal sensitivity and hyperglycemia resulting from insulin deficiency is not clear. Here, we have shown that TRPV1 is a major player, but questions still exist with respect to how TRPV1 function and expression are modulated in diabetes. Previously, we showed that insulin and IGF-1, acting via the IGF-1 receptor, potentiates TRPV1 current by activating PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Based on this observation, the long lasting hypoalgesic phenotype could be explained by insulin deficiency leading to downregulation of TRPV1 expression and function. However, it is counterintuitive that lack of insulin results in hyperalgesic phenotype, which can not be explained readily. It is possible that an abrupt reduction in insulin levels as occurs in STZ-treated mice could trigger compensatory enhancement of TRPV1 expression resulting in hyperalgesia. On the other hand, diabetes in our transgenic mouse model results from a slower, more sustained destruction of beta cells that may lead to a different course of neuropathic progression. Based on this premise, hyperalgesia in some patients (~10%) may be explained by rapid metabolic decompensation, perhaps a sudden onset. An increase in TRPV1 expression in DRGs occurs as a transient compensatory mechanism to decreased TRPV1-mediated neuronal activity similar to what happens during deafferentation. Furthermore, hyperglycemia is known to induce oxidative stress, as a result a slight increase in ROS is known to activate transcriptional machinery enhancing the expression of TRPV1, at the same time higher levels of ROS can lead to neuronal cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Another important finding we have made in our recent studies is that some mice injected with STZ were not hyperglycemic but were hyperalgesic. These results have led to a new hypothesis that STZ has a direct effect and may contribute to hyperalgesia independent of hyperglycemia. This may be one of the reasons that the hyperalgesic phenotype is clearly seen in STZ induced diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>We have recently showed Increased sensitivity of TRPV1 in STZ-induced diabetic mice has been shown that increased thermal sensitivity results from sensitization of TRPV1, possibly through PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In chronic pain conditions, increased TRPV1 expression occurs via MAPK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Furthermore, increased enzyme activity from hyperglycemia, specifically PKC&#x003b2; is implicated in several diabetic complications including thermal hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. All these studies offer an explanation for the hyperalgesic phenotype, which is rarely observed in diabetes, or goes undetected because of its transient nature. The significant finding of this study is that the predominant phenotype observed over time is thermal hypoalgesia as a result of reduced TRPV1 expression and function. If untreated, this might lead to more serious complications, which include changes in microvascular function due to decreased release of CGRP, neuronal loss, development of gangrene and total loss of sensation leading to amputation. Careful monitoring of hypoalgesic phenotype and a prompt treatment with insulin may decrease the progression and the severity of the disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Consequences of enhanced and reduced TRPV1 expression and function other than abnormal thermal sensation</title><p>TRPV1 is present in areas that are not exposed to sufficient changes in temperature to cause channel activation and is widely believed to have functions other than temperature sensation. TRPV1 is detected throughout the neuroaxis by RT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and identification of specific ligands such as NADA and anandamide in certain brain regions confirms a role in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The nature of the receptors involved in this response and their roles in the CNS is not clearly understood, but suggest TRPV1 may have direct and/or indirect effects on neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. TRPV1 expressing neurons in pancreas are also shown to play a role in beta cell function and diabetes pathoetiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. TRPV1 is also expressed in the bronchi, urinary bladder, heart and blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Activation of TRPV1 in sensory nerve endings supplying heart and blood vessels causes release of multiple vasoactive agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Therefore, as diabetes progresses, modulation of TRPV1 has the potential to contribute to many complications such as CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory and urinary disturbances.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported with a grant from NIH (DK065742, NSO42296 to L.S.P; 1 R15 DK67086-01, M.E.P) and SIU
