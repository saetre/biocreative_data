Many epidermal genes induced by &#x003b2;-catenin, including the stem cell marker keratin 15, contain vitamin D response elements (VDREs) and several are induced independently of TCF/Lef. The VDR is required for &#x003b2;-catenin induced hair follicle formation in adult epidermis, and the vitamin D analog EB1089 synergises with &#x003b2;-catenin to stimulate hair differentiation. Human trichofolliculomas (hair follicle tumours) are characterized by high nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin and VDR, whereas infiltrative basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) have high &#x003b2;-catenin and low VDR levels. In mice, EB1089 prevents &#x003b2;-catenin induced trichofolliculomas, while in the absence of VDR &#x003b2;-catenin induces tumours resembling BCCs. We conclude that VDR is a TCF/Lef-independent transcriptional effector of the Wnt pathway and that vitamin D analogues have therapeutic potential in tumors with inappropriate activation of Wnt signalling.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult mammalian epidermis is maintained by stem cells that self-renew and produce progeny that differentiate along the lineages of the hair follicle (HF), sebaceous gland (SG) and interfollicular epidermis (IFE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001483-Owens1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001483-Blanpain1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Wnt3A induced TCF/Lef1 transcriptional activity 10 fold in wild type and VDR null cells but not in cells that expressed an N-terminally truncated form of Lef1 (&#x00394;NLef1) unable to bind &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001483-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Transient transfection of a stabilised &#x003b2;-catenin mutant (S37A) stimulated vitamin D dependent transcription in a dose dependent manner in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001483-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

Transfection of wild type VDR rescued the cooperative effects of Wnt3A or S37A&#x003b2;-catenin on vitamin D dependent transcription in VDR null cells (data not shown). Taken together, the transcription reporter assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments establish that &#x003b2;-catenin binds the VDR and is a transcriptional co-activator of ligand-activated VDR in epidermal cells.</p><p>We next examined whether &#x003b2;-catenin acted as a transcriptional co-activator of VDR on a natural promoter.

The highest induction occurred on combined treatment with EB1089 and Wnt3A. In VDR null cells the keratin 15 promoter was unresponsive. Transfection of an exogenous wild type VDR rescued the response to EB1089 and Wnt3A. We also performed real time PCR to investigate whether endogenous keratin 15 expression was modulated by vitamin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001483-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Wnt3A alone was unable to increase Krt15 mRNA levels in cultured wild type keratinocytes.

Of the 91 genes only two (p, Bdh) lacked VDREs. Two thirds (61/91) had multiple VDRE and TCF/Lef sites. 15/91 had multiple VDREs and a single TCF/Lef site. Strikingly, 13 genes contained VDREs but no TCF/Lef consensus binding sites, supporting the concept that nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin can activate vitamin D/VDR target genes in the absence of TCF/Lef.</p><p>Many of the genes upregulated by &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001483.s005">Table S1</xref>) encode proteins that are specifically expressed in hair follicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001483.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Using real time PCR to examine their expression in cultured mouse keratinocytes we could distinguish two categories of genes. One group, represented by PADI3, Gli1 and Tubb3, was induced by EB1089 alone or in combination with Wnt3A, in wild type and &#x00394;NLef1 cells but not in VDR null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001483-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We conclude that these genes are VDR dependent, TCF/Lef independent Wnt targets. The second group, comprising S1003A, Dlx3, PADI1 and Krt31, were also maximally induced in wild type keratinocytes by combined treatment with EB1089 and Wnt3A, but differed from the other category in being unresponsive in both VDR null and &#x00394;NLef1 keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001483-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus these genes, like Krt15, were VDR dependent, TCF/Lef dependent Wnt targets.</p><p>In order to characterise the transcription factor complexes binding to the promoters of these genes, we performed ChIP on three of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001483-g002">Figure 2B&#x02013;D</xref>). We designed primers to amplify three regions in each promoter analysed, corresponding to one region with both VDREs and TCF/Lef sites, one region with VDREs alone, and one region with neither (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001483.s007">Table S3</xref>). We used Q-PCR to determine the abundance of each region in the ChIP relative to a control, unrelated genomic region (UR). In the keratin 15 promoter &#x003b2;-catenin was present both in the region that contained exclusively VDREs (region 3) and in the site containing clustered VDREs and TCF/Lef sites (region 1), but only highly enriched when cells were stimulated with both EB1089 and Wnt3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001483-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Lef1 accumulated in region 1 only; VDR was most abundant in region 1 but was also detectable in region 3. In the S1003A promoter Lef, VDR and &#x003b2;-catenin accumulated in region 1, containing clustered VDREs and TCF/Lef sites, recruitment of &#x003b2;-catenin being dependent on the combination of EB1089 and Wnt3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001483-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). We conclude that Krt15 and S1003A depend on &#x003b2;-catenin binding to ligand activated VDR and Lef1 for Wnt induction.</p><p>The PADI3 promoter differed from the S100A and K15 promoters because it had no TCF/Lef binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001483.s005">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001483-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

Elevated and sustained activation of &#x003b2;-catenin in adult K14&#x00394;N&#x003b2;-cateninER epidermis leads to ectopic hair follicle formation and, subsequently, to trichofolliculomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001483-SilvaVargas1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001483-LoCelso1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.
