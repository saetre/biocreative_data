We show that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of the human &#x003b1;-thalassemia and mental retardation X-linked protein (dATRX), is important in the formation or maintenance of heterochromatin through modification of position effect variegation. We further show that there are two isoforms of the dATRX protein, the longer of which interacts directly with heterochromatin protein 1 (dHP-1) through a CxVxL motif both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These two proteins co-localise at heterochromatin in a manner dependent on this motif. Consistent with this observation, the long isoform of the dATRX protein localises primarily to the heterochromatin at the chromocentre on salivary gland polytene chromosomes, whereas the short isoform binds to many sites along the chromosome arms. We suggest that the establishment of a regular nucleosomal organisation may be common to heterochromatin and transcriptionally repressed chromatin in other locations, and may require the action of ATP dependent chromatin remodelling factors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pericentric heterochromatin is a well studied example of a stable condensed chromatin structure that can be inherited from one cell to its daughters, and provides a model system of epigenetic inheritance of a chromatin state. Its occurance correlates with methylation of both DNA at CpG dinucleotides, and histones, particularly tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 and H4 on lysine 20. One effector of this code is the heterochromatin protein HP-1, which binds preferentially to histone H3 methylated on lysine 9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Wallace1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. We suggest that formation of this condensed state involves the chromatin remodelling factor dATRX and that this protein may act as an effector of the epigenetic code at the pericentric heterochromatin.</p><p>Chromatin remodelling enzymes are ATP-driven motor proteins that act to alter chromatin structure and accessibility. They fall into four broad categories &#x02013; the switch independent / sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF), imitation switch (ISWI), chromodomain (CHD) and INO80-like proteins. The human ATRX protein bears closest homology to the Rad54 class of remodelling enzymes involved in recombination-based DNA repair but has been shown to have chromatin remodelling activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Xue1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and to be involved in DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Gibbons1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and &#x003b1;-globin gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Steensma1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, it interacts with the methylated DNA binding protein MeCP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Nan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> which is important for its recruitment to methylated DNA.</p><p>The human ATRX protein has been linked to heterochromatin function through its direct interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Lechner1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and colocalisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-McDowell1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> with the HP-1 protein. It localises to both heterochromatin and promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies in a cell cycle and phosphorylation dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Ishov1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The homologue of hATRX, <italic>xnp-1</italic>, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also shows a genetic interaction with the corresponding HP-1 homologue. Recent studies show that PML bodies contain the HP-1 protein, and implicate them in heterochromatin formation in the juxtacentromeric satellite DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Luciani1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several other chromatin remodelling complexes have been implicated in heterochromatin function. A complex containing human Mi-2 has been shown to be recruited to heterochromatin by the Ikaros protein on T-cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Kim1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Another chromatin remodelling factor (CRF), Brahma related gene 1 (BRG1), has been shown to interact both with HP-1&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Nielsen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and the N-terminal region of the human Mi-2 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Shimono1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Human ACF has been implicated in replication of heterochromatin during S-phase, and RNAi-mediated depletion causes a delay in cell cycle progression through late S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Collins1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. ACF has also been shown to bind directly to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> HP-1 variant dHP-1a, and aid its loading to chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Eskeland1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. A recent report shows a physical interaction of the NuRF complex with the heterochromatin protein dHP-2, although the NURF301 subunit failed to show any genetic effect on heterochromatin formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Stephens1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, purification of a complex containing the methyltransferase Clr3 from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> revealed the presence of the Mit1 protein, whose chromatin remodelling activity was necessary for heterochromatin formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Sugiyama1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these results imply a more general role for chromatin remodelling during heterochromatin formation.</p><p>A highly sensitive and selective screen for proteins involved in heterochromatin formation is the phenomenon of position effect variegation (PEV). This results from insertion of a gene near to a region of heterochromatin and causes inactivation of the gene in some cells, and activation in others due to variability in the extent of heterochromatin &#x0201c;spreading&#x0201d;. Screens for dominant suppressors of the variegated phenotype have resulted in identification of components involved in establishment or maintenance of heterochromatin, including HP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Eissenberg1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this work, we identify novel mutations in the dATRX gene, and show that this gene is involved in heterochromatin formation or maintenance <italic>in vivo</italic> through modification of PEV. We further show that the dATRX protein exists in two isoforms, the longer of which interacts strongly with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> HP-1a protein both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. This interaction is mediated by a CxVxL motif, a variant of a PxVxL motif shown previously to be important for the binding to the chromoshadow domain of HP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Lechner1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The long isoform of dATRX specifically localises to heterochromatin with HP-1a and a mutation in the CxVxL motif abolishes this. Analysis of dATRX distribution on polytene chromosomes shows that the long isoform localises to pericentric heterochromatin at the chromocentre, consistent with its binding to HP-1a, whereas the short isoform is localised to numerous sites along the chromosome arms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The dATRX protein is expressed in two isoforms</title><p>The dATRX gene encodes a protein of 148 kDa (1308 amino acids).

After affinity purification, endogenous protein was detectable on Western blots of extracts from S2 cells, <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and certain larval tissues, but gave significant cross-reactivity when used to detect such low levels of dATRX protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of novel alleles of the dATRX gene</title><p>A EP-element (EP(3)635) present at the beginning of the mRNA, 470 bp from the start of the open reading frame, was used to perform an excision screen for mutants in dATRX. Three semi-lethal lines and one lethal line were isolated. The lethal line, termed dATRX<sup>1</sup>, results from a large deletion of 7.5 kb of DNA including the entire dATRX ORF, the two neighbouring genes, Med28 and CG4553, and some of the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of CG5127 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002099-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). dATRX<sup>2</sup> and dATRX4 were semi-lethal and removed 238 bp or 246 bp of the promoter region respectively including the beginning of the dATRX mRNA. dATRX<sup>3</sup> was also semi-lethal, but removed 786 bp including the start codon of the dATRX gene and the first 105 amino acids of the coding region. RT-PCR analysis of the mutants using primers specific to the long isoform or both isoforms showed that dATRX<sup>2</sup> and dATRX<sup>4</sup> still expressed coding sequences corresponding to both isoforms, dATRX<sup>3</sup> lacked expression of the long isoform, but maintained expression of the short isoform, and dATRX<sup>1</sup> lacked expression of both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002099-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In embryonic extracts from dATRX<sup>3</sup> flies, the long isoform was no longer detectable at the protein level on Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002099-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This further verifies the specificity of the antibody. In summary, dATRX<sup>2</sup> and dATRX<sup>4</sup> are probably hypomorphic alleles resulting from a promoter deletion, dATRX<sup>3</sup> removes the long isoform specifically, and dATRX<sup>1</sup> is a small deficiency covering the dATRX gene and the two neighbouring genes.</p><fig id="pone-0002099-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002099.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Mutations in the dATRX gene.</title><p>A. dATRX genomic region showing extent of deletions.

Analysis of RNA polymerase II RNA (RNA pol II) was used as a positive control. Molecular weight markers are indicated. C. dATRX<sup>3</sup> shows reduced viability. &#x00025; viability is shown at pupal and adult stages from 100 embryos for both a precise excision (Precise<sup>exc</sup>) and the dATRX<sup>3</sup> mutation.

This suggests that removal of the long isoform causes lethality at many stages during development. Attempts to find specific phenotypes associated with the loss of dATRX-Long have not been successful, perhaps suggesting mild, pleiotropic phenotypes. After several generations, the effect of dATRX<sup>2</sup> and dATRX<sup>4</sup> mutations on viability was less evident, so these were not able to be analysed in such a manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>dATRX is involved in heterochromatin function</title><p>We analysed whether dATRX is involved in heterochromatin formation using an inversion of the first chromosome that places the <italic>white</italic> gene into pericentric heterochromatin (In(1)w<sup>m4h</sup>), which causes variegated expression in the eye.

The protein was overexpressed in salivary glands with a C-terminal HA tag. Detection of both isoforms was performed by immunostaining against this tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002099-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

Since the protein is overexpressed, we were also able to use the dATRX-Long antibody to specifically detect this isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002099-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This showed that the two isoforms differed significantly in their localisation, with an enrichment of the long isoform in the pericentric heterochromatin, colocalising with the HP-1a protein. This is consistent with the binding of dATRX-Long to dHP-1a, and their colocalisation in 3T3 cells.</p><fig id="pone-0002099-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002099.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Polytene chromosomes show overlap of dATRX and dHP-1a on chromosome IV and pericentric heterochromatin.</title><p>A.

This implicates the dATRX gene in the process of heterochromatin formation or maintenance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We further show that the dATRX protein is expressed in two isoforms, the longer of which shows a strong interaction with the dHP1a protein in both GST pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction is necessary for localisation of the long isoform to heterochromatin in 3T3 cells, and colocalisation with dHP-1a. This interaction is mediated by a CxVxL motif specific to the long isoform, mutation of which abolishes interaction and colocalisation with dHP-1a. Additionally, the long isoform specifically localises to the chromocentre in <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene chromosomes, providing further evidence for a role of the long isoform in heterochromatin formation. The observed suppression of PEV by the dATRX<sup>3</sup> allele that removes this isoform specifically suggests that the interaction is relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is also consistent with an observed interaction between human ATRX and HP-1&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Lechner1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and genetic interactions between the two homologues in <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Cardoso1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies combined with the results of the PEV assay strongly imply a role of ATRX in heterochromatin formation in a variety of organisms, and may provide a mechanism of recruitment to such regions.</p><p>The exclusion of the short isoform from heterochromatin in 3T3 cells suggests that this has a distinct function at non-heterochromatic sites throughout the genome, and is consistent with its lack of interaction with dHP-1a, and the staining observed in the chromosome arms on polytene chromosomes. Indeed, this staining largely associates with the interbands, representative of less dense chromatin. One role of the short isoform may be during central nervous system formation during embryogenesis, in controlling glial and neuronal patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Sun1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Analysis of the dATRX<sup>3</sup> mutation that removes the long isoform shows no visible phenotype, aside from reduced viability of the flies. Studies of the chromatin structure in these mutants have failed to show any difference in the nucleosome spacing as judged by micrococcal nuclease digestion (data not shown). This could simply be a consequence of the limitations of this assay or alternatively could suggest a different role in higher order structure formation, or redundancy with other chromatin remodelling factors such as dMi-2.</p><p>In order to form a condensed, heterochromatic structure, nucleosome positions must be optimised such that the relative orientations of two nucleosomes are consistent along the fibre. This would allow a regular, ordered structure to form, essential for the formation of a compact fibre and subsequent further folding into a higher order structure such as heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Wu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> ACF has been shown to act to alter nucleosome repeat lengths both <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Ito1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Fyodorov1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a role in &#x0201c;shuffling&#x0201d; of nucleosome positions to generate a more uniform array. One role of the dATRX remodelling factor may be to achieve this. A second mechanism may be by inducing twist, which would aid or antagonise compaction of the chromatin fibre depending on its direction.</p><p>We suggest that chromatin remodellers are the end effectors of histone modifications. Consistent with this view, many remodelling complexes contain components that recognise specific modification states of histone tails. For instance, the SANT domain of dISWI may bind to unmodified tails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-delaCruz1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, while one of the PHD domains from human Mi-2 binds preferentially to trimethylated lysine 36 of histone H3, which marks the end of active transcription units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Li1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. ATRX may be recruited by its interaction with HP-1 or MeCP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Nan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> to heterochromatin, or the PHD domain in the human protein may play a role in methylated histone binding. In this manner, the epigenetic code present on histones may be translated by chromatin remodelling factors into alterations in folding of the chromatin fibre. Consistent with this idea, the chromatin remodelling activity of Mit1 has been shown to be important for heterochromatin formation in <italic>S. pombe</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002099-Sugiyama1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.
