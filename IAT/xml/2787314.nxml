Using a one-step immunoprecipitation approach to isolate endogenous caspase-1 from the monocytic THP1 cell line, we identified previously undescribed binding partners using mass spectrometry. One of the proteins identified was Rab39a, a member of the Rab GTPase family, a group of proteins that have important roles in protein trafficking and secretion. We confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation that Rab39a binds caspase-1. Knock down of Rab39a with small interfering RNA resulted in diminished levels of secreted IL-1&#x003b2; but had no effect on induction of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA by lipopolysaccharide. Rab39a contains a highly conserved caspase-1 cleavage site and was cleaved in the presence of recombinant caspase-1 or lipopolysaccharide. Finally, overexpression of Rab39a results in an increase in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, and furthermore, overexpression of a Rab39a construct lacking the caspase-1 cleavage site leads to an additional increase in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. Altogether, our findings show that Rab39a interacts with caspase-1 and suggest that Rab39a functions as a trafficking adaptor linking caspase-1 to IL-1&#x003b2; secretion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>IL-1&#x003b2;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. It is first synthesized as biologically inactive pro-IL-1&#x003b2; and is processed by caspase-1 into mature and biologically active IL-1&#x003b2;. It is subsequently released into the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Most proteins that are secreted from the cell contain signal peptides that direct their transport to the plasma membrane through the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway. However, certain proteins, including IL-1&#x003b2;, do not contain signal peptides and are secreted by unconventional means, the mechanism of which is not entirely understood. Several models for IL-1&#x003b2; secretion have been described (for review, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), including the lysosome-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), microvesicle shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and exosome release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Caspase-1 is an important regulatory molecule in the innate immune response that is activated in the inflammasome in response to certain pro-inflammatory stimuli. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex, which, along with caspase-1, also contains a Nod-like receptor (NLR) protein such as NLRP1, NLRP3, or IPAF and the adaptor protein ASC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). A diverse range of stimuli can activate inflammasomes such as bacteria, viruses, and in the case of the NLRP3 inflammasome danger signals such as uric acid and ATP and aggregated materials such as silica and asbestos (for review, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Besides its well documented role in IL-1&#x003b2; processing and in the inflammasome, other roles for caspase-1 are emerging. A recent study describes how caspase-1 is important for the secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; as well as many other unconventionally secreted proteins such as fibroblast growth factor-2 and IL-1&#x003b1;. Using iTRAQ proteomics, 77 leaderless proteins with extracellular functions whose secretion is mediated by caspase-1 were identified. Many of these proteins are involved in inflammation, cytoprotection, or tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>In this study we used an immunoprecipitation approach to isolate caspase-1 from THP1 cells and then identified binding partners using mass spectrometry. One of the proteins identified was Rab39a. The human Rab protein family consists of &#x0003e;60 members. They are associated with specific membranes and are required for vesicle movement in pathways such as secretion and endocytosis (for review, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Rab39a is a relatively uncharacterized member of the Rab GTPase family. It was initially described by Stankovic <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) as a novel Rab protein that is widely expressed in a variety of tissues, including spleen and small intestine and in peripheral leukocytes. Rab39a shows 78% identity at the amino acid level to another recently described Rab protein, Rab39b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>We have investigated the nature of the interaction between caspase-1 and Rab39a, with particular interest in its role in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. Our findings suggest that Rab39a functions as a trafficking adaptor linking caspase-1 to IL-1&#x003b2; secretion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Plasmids and Reagents</title><p>PCMV-HA was purchased from Clontech.

Unlike other pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1&#x003b2; lacks a signal peptide and is secreted via unconventional methods. The process by which it is secreted from the cell has always been contentious. The role of caspase-1 in inflammasome functions and IL-1&#x003b2; processing has been widely described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, a role for caspase-1 in unconventional protein secretion is emerging. A recent paper describes how IL-1&#x003b2; secretion is mediated by caspase-1. This in turn may be mediated by factors that are substrates of caspase-1, the cleavage products of which might have a direct role in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Our results unveil further insight into caspase-1-dependent IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. We have shown that the small GTPase protein Rab39a is a novel binding partner of caspase-1 as identified by mass spectrometry and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. We provide evidence that Rab39a is necessary for the secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; but not induction of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; because siRNA targeted to Rab39a results in diminished secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; but does not affect mRNA levels of IL-1&#x003b2;.</p><p>Bioinformatic analyses indicated that Rab39a contained a conserved caspase-1 cleavage site, and our results demonstrated that Rab39a was cleaved using an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay. We were also able to show that Rab39a processing could take place in macrophages treated with LPS and ATP. However, this should be interpreted with caution because cleavage of endogenous Rab39a should be shown. We are currently raising an anti-Rab39a antibody to test this. Interestingly, several other Rab proteins (notably Rab4 and Rab14, which are involved in secretion) contain the putative caspase-1 cleavage site. Cleavage of Rab proteins may represent a general mechanism by which caspase-1 modulates protein trafficking within the cell.</p><p>Other recent results have also shown that Rab proteins are important for signaling in the innate immune system. For example, Rab7b can negatively regulate both TLR4 and TLR9 signaling by promoting their translocation to the lysosome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The results presented in this paper further add to this realization of the importance of Rab proteins during innate immunity.</p><p>We also found that Rab39a was inducible by pro-inflammatory stimuli, implying that its expression may be coordinated with that of IL-1&#x003b2; to promote secretion.</p><p>The precise mechanism of IL-1&#x003b2; secretion remains elusive because many models exist as to how this event may occur. Three of the best described models include the lysosome-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), microvesicle shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and exosome release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In the lysosome-dependent pathway, pro-IL-1&#x003b2; is translocated into secretory lysosomes together with caspase-1. The mature form of IL-1&#x003b2; is produced within the lysosome by caspase-1 cleavage, after which the lysosomes fuse with the plasma membrane and the contents are released into the extracellular space. In microvesicle shedding, caspase-1 activates IL-1&#x003b2; in the cytoplasm and is exported along with the mature cytokine into the extracellular space. The third mechanism, exosome release, is where caspase-1 and IL-1&#x003b2; are contained in the cytoplasm within endosomal internal vesicles that are released as exosomes.</p><p>These models involve many unknown trafficking requirements, and interestingly the last two models require the formation of specific vesicles that exit from the cell. Rab proteins have roles in trafficking and secretion, and Rab39a, although largely uncharacterized is likely to function in this manner.</p><p>If Rab39a proves to be a physiological substrate, why it would require such cleavage requires further investigation, but it may be necessary for vesicle formation and secretion. We propose the following mechanism of action in which Rab39a associates with caspase-1 and together they are required for efficient IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. During an inflammatory response, Rab39a is induced and binds to caspase-1. As IL-1&#x003b2; is secreted in a caspase-1-dependent manner, we propose that Rab39a is needed to help traffic IL-1&#x003b2; from the cell in a vesicle-dependent manner. Indeed, caspase-1 itself and other components of the inflammasome that also lack signal peptides are also released from activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), and Rab39a may be necessary in helping to secrete the entire inflammasome complex from the cell.</p><p>Interestingly, overexpression of a Rab39a construct lacking the caspase-1 cleavage site results in a boosting of IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. This suggests that cleavage of Rab39a by caspase-1 would serve as a mechanism of inactivating Rab39a and therefore act as a mechanism to control levels of IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. Hence, overexpression of a construct that cannot be cleaved results in an excess of IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. We are currently exploring the mechanism here.</p><p>The association between Rab39a and caspase-1 is highly specific. Rab39a is 78% similar to another Rab protein, Rab39b, but they have very different profiles with regard to caspase-1. Unlike Rab39a, Rab39b was not found to associate with caspase-1 in our screen, and it does not co-immunoprecipitate with caspase-1. It lacks a caspase-1 cleavage site and cannot be cleaved <italic>in vitro</italic>, and it is not induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli to the same extent as Rab39a. The role of Rab39a in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion is therefore specific.</p><p>We have therefore identified Rab39a as a caspase-1-associated protein required for IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. Future studies will aim to understand further precisely how Rab39a participates in this process.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by grants from the Health Research Board Science Foundation Ireland and the Wellcome Trust.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN2"><label>2</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">IL-1</term><def><p>interleukin-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">CHAPS</term><def><p>3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">ELISA</term><def><p>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">HA</term><def><p>hemagglutinin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">LPS</term><def><p>lipopolysaccharide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">MALDI-TOF</term><def><p>matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">NF-&#x003ba;B</term><def><p>nuclear factor &#x003ba;B</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">NLR</term><def><p>Nod-like receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">PBMC</term><def><p>peripheral blood mononuclear cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">siRNA</term><def><p>small interfering RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G11">TNF-&#x003b1;</term><def><p>tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thornberry</surname><given-names>N.
