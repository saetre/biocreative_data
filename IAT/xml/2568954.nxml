Mouse mutants with progressive hearing loss offer valuable insights, and ENU (<italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea) mutagenesis is a useful way of generating models. We have characterised a new ENU-induced mouse mutant, Oblivion (allele symbol <italic>Obl</italic>), showing semi-dominant inheritance of hearing impairment. <italic>Obl/&#x0002b;</italic> mutants showed increasing hearing impairment from post-natal day (P)20 to P90, and loss of auditory function was followed by a corresponding base to apex progression of hair cell degeneration. <italic>Obl/Obl</italic> mutants were small, showed severe vestibular dysfunction by 2 weeks of age, and were completely deaf from birth; sensory hair cells were completely degenerate in the basal turn of the cochlea, although hair cells appeared normal in the apex. We mapped the mutation to Chromosome 6. Mutation analysis of <italic>Atp2b2</italic> showed a missense mutation (2630C&#x02192;T) in exon 15, causing a serine to phenylalanine substitution (S877F) in transmembrane domain 6 of the PMCA2 pump, the resident Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pump of hair cell stereocilia. Transmembrane domain mutations in these pumps generally are believed to be incompatible with normal targeting of the protein to the plasma membrane. However, analyses of hair cells in cultured utricular maculae of <italic>Obl/Obl</italic> mice and of the mutant <italic>Obl</italic> pump in model cells showed that the protein was correctly targeted to the plasma membrane. Biochemical and biophysical characterisation showed that the pump had lost a significant portion of its non-stimulated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exporting ability. These findings can explain the progressive loss of auditory function, and indicate the limits in our ability to predict mechanism from sequence alone.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Progressive hearing loss is very common in the human population, but we know little about the causes. Environmental and genetic factors each may contribute. Knowledge of the genetic variants involved in hearing loss and understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanism of their action will aid the development of better treatments. One of the few genes known to be involved, in both mouse and humans, is <italic>Atp2b2</italic>, which encodes a calcium pump. We have discovered a new mutation in this gene leading to hearing loss in the mouse mutant oblivion. The mutation leads to a serine to phenylalanine substitution in a transmembrane domain. Mutations affecting such transmembrane domains are usually expected to interfere with the normal process of inserting the protein in the membrane and transporting it to its final destination on the plasma membrane of the cell. Surprisingly, the pump is produced and is targeted to the plasma membrane, in both cultured cells expressing the mutant gene and sensory hair cells from the oblivion mutant inner ear. However, we show it has impaired calcium pumping ability, which can account for the progressive hearing loss as well as the progressive degeneration of the sensory hair cells that we observe in the mutants.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>PMCA2 is one of four isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pumps of mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000238-Carafoli1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000238-Strehler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The expression of PMCA2 and PMCA3 is largely restricted to brain and muscle, whereas PMCA1 and 4 are ubiquitously expressed.

This maintains the low intracellular levels of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and may create a relatively higher concentration of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in the endolymph surrounding the stereocilia, contributing to the maintenance of the electrochemical gradient needed for transduction to occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000238-Yamoah1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.
