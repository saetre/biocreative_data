The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of an IP-10 and IL-2 based tests for the diagnosis of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic>-infection in recently exposed children from Nigeria.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology and Principal Findings</title><p>Samples were obtained from 59 children at high risk of infection with <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> (contacts of adults with smear and culture-positive tuberculosis) and 61 at low risk (contacts of smear-negative/culture-positive tuberculosis or community controls). IP-10 and IL-2 was measured in plasma after stimulation of whole-blood with <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> specific antigens and mitogen. Previously developed criteria for positive IP-10 and IL-2 tests were used and the diagnostic performances of the IP-10 and IL-2 tests were compared with the Quantiferon In-Tube (QFT-IT) and the Tuberculin Skin Tests (TST). In response to <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> specific antigens, the high-risk children expressed significantly higher levels of IP-10 (1358 pg/ml&#x0005b;IQR 278&#x02013;2535 pg/ml&#x0005d;) and IL-2 (164 pg/ml&#x0005b;11&#x02013;590 pg/ml&#x0005d;) than low risk groups 149 pg/ml(25&#x02013;497 pg/ml), and 0 pg/ml(0&#x02013;3 pg/ml), respectively. There was excellent agreement (&#x0003e;89&#x00025;,<italic>k</italic>&#x0003e;0.80) between IP-10, IL-2 tests and QFT-IT, better than with TST (&#x0003e;74&#x00025;,<italic>k</italic>&#x0003e;0.49). The IP-10 and IL-2 responses were strongly associated with <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> exposure and with grade of infectiousness of the index cases (p&#x0003c;0.0001). IP-10, IL-2, and TST but not QFT-IT was associated with age of the child in the low risk groups (p&#x0003c;0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>IP-10 is expressed in high levels and results of the IP-10 test were comparable to the QFT-IT. IL-2 was released in low amounts in response to the antigens and not in response to the mitogen therefore IL-2 seems a less useful marker. We have demonstrated that IP-10 and possibly IL-2 could be alternative or adjunct markers to IFN-&#x003b3; in the diagnosis infection with <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic>.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) in children has long been neglected.

The main findings are that a) IP-10 and IL-2 are expressed in high amounts in response to <italic>Mtb.</italic>specific antigens, b) The IP-10 test performs with excellent concordance and to the QFT-IT test and the agreement between the IP-10 and QFT-IT was stronger than with the TST, and c) The IP-10 and IL-2 responses were strongly associated with TB exposure as determined by exposure risk groups, by grade of infectiousness of the index cases, and by age of the child with low risk and d) combination of IFN-&#x003b3; and IP-10 identified a more SS&#x02212; contacts with no change in the control or SS&#x0002b; group and there were fewer indeterminate results.</p><p>Childhood tuberculosis has long been neglected, but there is now focus on improving the diagnosis of active TB, and an increasing awareness of the use of prevention. WHO emphasizes that exposed children &#x0003c;5 years and HIV positive should be offered chemo-prophylaxis. However, blind prescription of Isoniazid may result in poor compliance and rapid development of resistance. Therefore targeted treatment of the infected subgroups would be a more rational approach than mass treatment. TST has been the only tool for the identification of infection in recently exposed children but it suffers from several operational and performance constrains such as low specificity, subjectivity in readout, dual visits, risk of boosting etc. A qualified alternative to the TST are the IGRAs using the RD1 antigens specific to <italic>M.tb</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Menzies1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and we have recently shown that the QFT-IT was strongly associated with risk of recent exposure among children 1&#x02013;14 years old in Nigeria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Nakaoka3">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus with tests based on RD1 peptides, targeted chemo-prophylaxis may become a realistic option even in high endemic countries.</p><p>As part of our search for improved and simple diagnostic measures we have compared the performance of IP-10 and IL-2 with QFT-IT in a diagnostic setting without a gold standard for infection, we used predefined cut offs and criteria for positive test results and exposure gradient as indicators for infection. We found that children 1&#x02013;14 years old produced IP-10 and IL-2 in significant amounts after antigen-stimulation and we found a strong correlation between the biomarkers and risk of infection. Of the high risk children 71&#x02013;75&#x00025; were positive by IP-10 and IL-2 indicating a high sensitivity of a potential test based on IL-2 or IP-10.</p><p>The agreement between IGRA and TST varies between studies and ranges from excellent to poor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Menzies1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. There are several explanations for this discordance such as prevalence of TB, prior BCG, age at BCG vaccination, strain of BCG and batch of Tuberculin, age, co-morbidity etc. This matter has been intensively debated but there is consensus that the IGRAs are more specific for <italic>Mtb.</italic> infection, not influenced by prior BCG or exposure to NTM, and less affected by immuno-suppression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Menzies1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Using the QFT-IT, as the comparator, we found excellent agreement between both the IP-10 and the IL-2 test. Although the performance of TST was good in this study the agreement with the TST and QFT-IT or IP-10 test was low, a finding which is consistent with other studies comparing TST and IGRA in high prevalence countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Connell1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Rangaka1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In our previous study using exactly same IP-10 cut off and diagnostic algorithm, the positivity rate was 89&#x00025; for patients with active TB and 3&#x00025; for healthy unexposed students and we found 89&#x00025; agreement between IP-10 test and QFT-IT test results. Together these studies strongly suggest that IP-10 responses are truly reflecting infection with <italic>Mtb.</italic> and not an unspecific chemokine release.</p><p>Nigeria has one of the highest TB rates in Africa. Therefore, community exposure is high and the prevalence of infection is anticipated to rise with age, hereby diluting the association with other risk factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Hill1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Nakaoka2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Tsiouris2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, our study found that among the low risk groups (the CC and SS&#x02212;) there was a significant trend towards an increase in positive responders with increasing age for the IP-10, IL-2 and TST. This suggests that IP-10 and IL-2 actually did identify children infected by community exposure. We found no such trend in the high risk group which could be due to the fact that the majority of the high risk children were infected due to recent household exposure and not due community exposure increasing with age. The association between QFT-IT and increasing age was not significant, a result which remains to be explained or confirmed</p><p>Both QFT-IT and IP-10 test had high degrees of indeterminate responders (19/120, 16&#x00025;, and 18/120, 15&#x00025;, respectively). This could be caused by either poor sample handling or de-facto cellular anergy. A well described cause of inconclusive QFT-IT test results is HIV infection and low CD4 cell count<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Brock2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Luetkemeyer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and a limitation of this study was that the HIV status and CD4 cell count of the children were unknown and the number of families with known HIV status was too small for statistical analysis. The high degree of indeterminate responders underlines the importance of including a marker for cellular anergy.</p><p>The levels of PHA induced IFN-&#x003b3; usually exceeds the levels of antigen induced IFN-&#x003b3;. In the present study however, PHA responses were remarkably low and could have contributed to the high indeterminate rate. We do not think that this finding was due to low age of the children or to handling of the samples because there was no age-associated decrease in PHA and the responses to the specific antigens were comparable to our previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Ruhwald1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>IL-2 was not induced by phytohaemaglutinin stimulation a finding which has been reported by others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Schauf1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is not possible to develop an IL-2 based test algorithm with an option of indeterminate responses with the current set-up. Children with indeterminate IL-2 test results would therefore be classified as negative by default, which is a confounder when comparing results to the other tests. Still the IL-2 test had comparable performance to QFT-IT and IP-10.</p><p>In this and previous studies (Ruhwald et al submitted,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002858-Ruhwald1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>) the IP-10 test performed convincingly using whole blood stimulation and determination of IP-10 using xMAP technology. xMAP however, is not suitable for areas with limited resources. At present neither QFT-IT nor an IP-10 test using xMAP are affordable technologies for large scale screening of TB infection in low resource countries. There is still a need for improving the technology towards a simple, easy-to-use field friendly and cheap assay.</p><p>The present study had some limitation. First of all, the relative small sample size may have influenced the result of the analysis of association with age due to low numbers of children in each age category. However, the overall excellent agreement between the tests suggest that sample size was not too small for these comparisons.</p><p>The study was performed in Nigeria and the samples were transported to Denmark at a later stage which could have affected the quality. However, we have done stability studies showing that IP-10 and IL-2 are stable in plasma for at least 24 h at 20&#x000b0;C and are not degraded in plasma after &#x0003e;5 repeated freeze thaw cycles (unpublished).</p><p>Cut offs have been established using adult samples and it is possible that alternative cut offs should be used for testing in children. Our data does not suggest that age was a major problem as the positivity rate among children at high risk was &#x0003e;70&#x00025; in all age groups and there was no age related difference in the mitogen-response. Only in the low risk groups we found an association with age which could be explained by increasing <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure with age in a high endemic region.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that tests based on determination of IP-10 and IL-2 perform with excellent concordance to the QFT-IT test. IP-10 and IL-2 responses are strongly associated with TB exposure as determined by exposure risk groups and by grade of infectiousness of the index cases. In addition IP-10 response was associated with increasing age in the child with low risk of infection.</p><p>We have provided data suggesting that IP-10 may serve as an alternative and/or adjunct marker to IFN-&#x003b3; in the diagnosis of active as well as latent TB infection and that IP-10 may improve the overall diagnostic performance of the RD1 specific in vitro tests. IL-2 holds similar properties but is released in low amounts and there is no useful marker for anergy. As IP-10 is expressed in high amounts, it holds promise for the development of a new generation TB tests such as the lateral flow dipstick. Simpler and cheap tests are needed to facilitate the management of TB by increasing test accessibility and targeted preventive treatment especially of infected HIV&#x0002b;ve patients and in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002858.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Biomarker and Tuberculin Skin Test performance.

The cut offs with the highest proportional diagnostic strength (or maximum Youdens Index, sensitivity&#x0002b;specificity-1) were 635 pg/ml for IP-10, YI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.56, sensitivity 69&#x00025;, Specificity 87&#x00025;); 13 pg/ml for IL-2, YI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.57, sensitivity 75&#x00025;, specificity 83&#x00025;; 15 pg/ml for IFN-&#x003b3;, YI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.65, sensitivity 78&#x00025;, Specificity 87&#x00025;; and 6 mm for the TST, YI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.44, sensitivity 68&#x00025;, specificity 76&#x00025;.</p><p>(2.21 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002858.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002858.s002"><label>Methods S1</label><caption><p>Diagnostic algorithms</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002858.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002858.s003"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Head-to-head comparison of Quantiferin in tube test (QFT-IT), IP-10 test and IL-2 test</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002858.s003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002858.s004"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Head-to-head comparison of Tuberculin Skin Test (10 mm cut off), IP-10 test and IL-2 test</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002858.s004.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Ove Andersen PhD, MD Director of the Clinical Research Centre and Gitte Kronborg, DMSci, MD, Department of infectious Diseases Copenhagen University, Hvidovre Hospital for support.
