Representative NS5A fragments previously described and seven new NS5A constructs were used to generate stably expressing Jurkat cell lines in this study as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g001">Fig. 1</xref>.

Furthermore, the serine residue at position 158 appears important for the HIV inhibitory function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), since a phosphomimetic substitution (S158E) inhibited HIV as well as the expression of either the full length NS5A protein or the parent peptide. Of note, the parent peptide and S158E peptide inhibited HIV significantly more than the S158A and S158G peptides; however, these peptides also inhibited HIV replication compared to the scrambled peptide, frame-shift and vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g004">4A and 4B</xref>). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the serine at position 158 is important for the HIV inhibitory effect of this peptide, and suggest that either phosphorylation or a structural motif of the peptide is required for HIV inhibition. The GBV-C NS5A inhibition effect was specific for HIV, as both mumps virus replication and the transduction efficiency of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV particles was not diminished in the NS5A expressing cells in which HIV replication was inhibited. Interestingly, full-length NS5A (1&#x02013;414) enhanced mumps replication in Jurkat cells compared to parental and vector control cells. To our knowledge, viral enhancement has not been previously described for flavivirus NS5 proteins. However, expression of HCV NS5A in a HepG2 cell line was shown to enhance hepatitis B protein expression and virus replication, potentially as a result of NS5A partial inhibition of interferon responsiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Pan1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Ongoing studies are examining potential mechanisms of the mumps virus replication enhancement by GBV-C NS5A. Nevertheless, since the GBV-C 152&#x02013;181 protein did not enhance mumps virus replication, the HIV inhibitory domain within GBV-C NS5A is distinct from the mumps-enhancing domain. This enhancement in mumps replication further emphasizes the data showing that NS5A expression is not toxic to the Jurkat cells.</p><p>Although GBV-C NS5A protein function is not completely understood; in the closely related HCV, NS5A is required for viral replication and is part of the viral replication complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Evans1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Macdonald1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, because GBV-C NS5A and the NS5A peptides downregulate the HIV co-receptor CXCR4 and induce the release of SDF-1, NS5A protein expression would appear to have a bystander effect on cells not infected with GBV-C. Consistent with these findings, previous studies demonstrated that GBV-C infection of healthy PBMCs <italic>in vitro</italic> resulted in the induction of SDF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Xiang2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Xiang4">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and prior studies with full-length NS5A expressing Jurkat cells found that neutralizing SDF-1 activity with neutralizing antibodies diminished but did not abolish the HIV inhibitory effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Xiang5">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, additional mechanisms of HIV inhibition appear to be elicited by the GBV-C NS5A protein.</p><p>Addition of a synthetic peptide representing GBV-C NS5A 152&#x02013;191 amino acids and the S158E mutant peptide to Jurkat and MT-2 cells reproducibly inhibited HIV replication, although to a less extent than that observed when the peptides were expressed intracellularly in Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g008">8</xref>). The S158E peptide was not active by itself; however, the addition of a tat-protein transduction domain to the amino terminus resulted in HIV inhibition for the S158E peptide but not the 152&#x02013;167scr peptide. These data suggest, but do not prove that intracellular uptake of the native peptide and/or degradation may have contributed to it's lack of efficiency.</p><p>The secondary structure of the 152&#x02013;167 peptide and S158E mutant is predicted to contain a beta-strand (DNAMan software, Lynnon Biosoft). In contrast, the S158A, S158G, and 152&#x02013;167scr peptides are not predicted to form a beta strands, suggesting that a critical peptidic structure is responsible for the HIV inhibitory interaction. The activity of the S158E peptide appeared to be potentially greater than the parent peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Comparison of the probability of the predicted structures indicates that the probability of a beta-strand is greater in the S158E peptide than the parent peptide, suggesting that this substitution may result in a more stable structure than the parent sequence. Alignments of the GBV-C NS5A 152&#x02013;167 amino acid sequence with NS5 sequences of isolates representing related flaviviruses (HCV, Dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and West Nile Virus) did not identify &#x0003e;32&#x00025; homology. In addition, Blast search (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi</ext-link>) of all proteins (non-redundant GenBank CDS translations&#x0002b;PDB&#x0002b;SwissProt&#x0002b;PIR&#x0002b;PRF excluding environmental samples from WGS projects) did not identify proteins sharing homology with the 152&#x02013;167 peptide or the S158E peptide.</p><p>GBV-C viremia is associated with prolonged survival in HIV-infected people in most studies conducted prior to the availability of combination antiretroviral therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Zhang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, although some argue that GBV-C is a marker of low HIV RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Bjorkman1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> or high CD4 counts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Bjorkman2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-VanderBij1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Demonstration that NS5A peptide expression inhibits HIV replication adds to previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that support a causal relationship between GBV-C viremia and survival in HIV-infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Zhang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Like HIV, GBV-C replicates in CD4&#x0002b; lymphocytes and in addition, GBV-C replicates in CD8&#x0002b; T cells and B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-George1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the NS5A 152&#x02013;167 peptide induces the release of SDF-1 and downregulates CXCR4 surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g005">figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002580-g006">6</xref> and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Xiang5">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>), it is reasonable to speculate that the bystander effect of NS5A expression and chemokine modulation would influence HIV replication in lymphoid tissue. Further studies to characterize the structural requirements of the GBV-C 152&#x02013;167 NS5A peptide, and to identify intracellular interacting proteins are underway. These data suggest that the GBV-C NS5A peptide may be useful from a therapeutic standpoint. Because the peptide functions by altering CXCR4 and inducing SDF-1 instead of inhibiting HIV replicative enzymes, it may provide a therapeutic approach that is more difficult for HIV to overcome by the selection of virus mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>GBV-C NS5A proteins and peptides</title><p>The full length GBV-C NS5A protein coding sequence (numbering based on AF121950) was previously amplified from the plasma of an individual with GBV-C viremia, ligated into the pTRE2-Hyg plasmid (Clontech, Inc., Mountain View, CA) modified to include a stop codon after NS5A, followed by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC) IRES element directing the translation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002580-Xiang5">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.
