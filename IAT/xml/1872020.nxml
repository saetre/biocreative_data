Astroglia play an important role in the initiation and propagation of hypoxia/ischemia-induced inflammation by secreting inflammatory chemokines that attract neutrophils and monocytes into the brain. However, triggers of chemokine up-regulation by hypoxia/ischemia in these cells are poorly understood. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a dimeric transcriptional factor consisting of HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-1&#x003b2; subunits. HIF-1 binds to HIF-1-binding sites in the target genes and activates their transcription. We have recently shown that hypoxia-induced expression of IL-1&#x003b2; in astrocytes is mediated by HIF-1&#x003b1;. In this study, we demonstrate the role of HIF-1&#x003b1; in hypoxia-induced up-regulation of inflammatory chemokines, human monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) and mouse MCP-5 (Ccl12), in human and mouse astrocytes, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Primary fetal human astrocytes or mouse astrocytes generated from HIF-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/+ </sup>and HIF-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/- </sup>mice were subjected to hypoxia (&#x0003c;2% oxygen) or 125 &#x003bc;M CoCl<sub>2 </sub>for 4 h and 6 h, respectively. The expression of HIF-1&#x003b1;, MCP-1 and MCP-5 was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, western blot or ELISA. The interaction of HIF-1&#x003b1; with a HIF-1-binding DNA sequence was examined by EMSA and supershift assay. HIF-1-binding sequence in the promoter of MCP-1 gene was cloned and transcriptional activation of MCP-1 by HIF-1&#x003b1; was analyzed by reporter gene assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Sequence analyses identified HIF-1-binding sites in the promoters of MCP-1 and MCP-5 genes. Both hypoxia and HIF-1&#x003b1; inducer, CoCl<sub>2</sub>, strongly up-regulated HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in astrocytes. Mouse HIF-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/- </sup>astrocytes had lower basal levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; and MCP-5 expression. The up-regulation of MCP-5 by hypoxia or CoCl<sub>2 </sub>in HIF-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/+ </sup>and HIF-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/- </sup>astrocytes was correlated with the levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; in cells. Both hypoxia and CoCl<sub>2 </sub>also up-regulated HIF-1&#x003b1; and MCP-1 expression in human astrocytes. EMSA assay demonstrated that HIF-1 activated by either hypoxia or CoCl<sub>2 </sub>binds to wild-type HIF-1-binding DNA sequence, but not the mutant sequence. Furthermore, reporter gene assay demonstrated that hypoxia markedly activated MCP-1 transcription but not the mutated MCP-1 promoter in transfected astrocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that both MCP-1 and MCP-5 are HIF-1 target genes and that HIF-1&#x003b1; is involved in transcriptional induction of these two chemokines in astrocytes by hypoxia.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ischemic brain damage, including that caused by stroke and trauma, elicits inflammation in the injured areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A number of inflammatory mediators are expressed in the brain in response to ischemia and hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Hypoxia or ischemia stimulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;), chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1/CCL2) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) in the brain and in cultured astrocytes and brain endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These inflammatory mediators play a critical role not only in the initiation and propagation of ischemica/hypoxia-evoked neuroinflammation but also in the resolution of brain damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, triggers of inflammatory chemokine up-regulation by hypoxia/ischemia in these cells are poorly understood. We have recently shown that hypoxia-stimulated IL-1&#x003b2; expression in astrocytes is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in cellular and systemic homeostatic responses to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein complex consisting of two subunits, the redox-sensitive HIF-1&#x003b1; (120&#x02013;130 kD), which is unique to HIF-1, and the constitutively expressed HIF-1&#x003b2; (91&#x02013;94 kD), a common partner for many other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Both subunits are necessary for DNA binding and activation of HIF-1 target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Several HIF-1&#x003b1; isoforms have been found, including HIF-2&#x003b1; and HIF-3&#x003b1;, both of which have significant homologies to HIF-1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although these HIF-1 isoforms may also contribute to the response to hypoxia, HIF-1&#x003b1; is considered the major regulator of O<sub>2</sub>-tension sensitive genes in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Decrease in cellular O<sub>2 </sub>tension or the presence of CoCl<sub>2 </sub>or desferroxamine leads to elevation of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression, whereas carbon monoxide and nitric oxide inhibit HIF-1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. HIF-1&#x003b1; is cytosolic and degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] via binding of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein to the oxygen-dependent degradation domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

The length of hypoxic stress determines HIF-1&#x003b1; half-life upon reoxygenation. During hypoxia, HIF-1&#x003b1; is stabilized and dimerized with HIF-1&#x003b2;, and the complex is translocated into nucleus where it binds to hypoxia-responsive elements in the promoters or enhancers of the target genes, such as the genes encoding erythropoetin (EPO), glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, heme oxygenase-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, transferin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Astrocytes subjected to <italic>in vitro </italic>ischemia/hypoxia produce a large amount of chemoattractant MCP-1 which is 30-time higher than that secreted by human brain endothelial cells subjected to the same treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].

Chomokines (including MCP-1, MCP-5, IL-8, GRO, etc) produced by astrocytes and other cell types in response to hypoxia/ischemia play a central role in the inflammatory process by forming a chemoattractant gradient that attracts blood-borne inflammatory cells (neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages) to transmigrate across the blood-brain barrier into the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Both MCP1 and MCP-5 are potent chemokines selective for monocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. <italic>In vivo </italic>studies have shown that infiltrating blood-borne monocytes and macrophages were recruited into the ischemic tissue as early as 18 h following a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The infiltration peaked at 48 h and remained abundant at 96 h after MCAO. Furthermore, anti-MCP-1 gene therapy attenuated infarct volume and infiltration of inflammatory cells in focal brain ischemia of hypertensive rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Astrocytes are main cytokine/chemokine-producing cells in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and astrocyte-produced MCP-1 directs the transmigration of monocytes and macrophages across the BBB to the sites of axonal injury in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>findings suggest that hypoxia/ischemia-induced infiltration of monocytes and macrophages contributes to the pathophysiology and damage induced by stroke.</p><p>Up-regulation of inflammatory genes by hypoxia/ischemia may be regulated by different transcription factors at different stages of the inflammation, including HIF-1, NF&#x003ba;B, and AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The evidence provided in this study and an previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] established that HIF-1 induces transcriptional up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during hypoxia; whereas NF&#x003ba;B is mainly involved in transcriptional regulation of these genes during the phase of reoxygenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The temporal interplay of these transcription factors may be critical in the regulation of inflammatory gene expression at different stages of hypoxia/ischemia-evoked inflammation. Targeting transcriptional regulators of inflammatory genes may help tune the inflammatory response. Neuroinflammation following brain ischemic damage is an important part of damage resolution process by which macrophages remove dead cells and inflammatory mediators stimulate multipotent cells to differentiate to functional neuronal or glial cells in the injured area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. MCP-1 has been shown to induce migration of rat-derived adult neural stem cells in an <italic>in vitro </italic>model of brain inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Tuning of MCP-1 levels at different stages of the inflammation associated with ischemic brain damage may maximize the benefit effects of the inflammation. The evidence of HIF-1&#x003b1;-mediated up-regulation of MCP-1 and MCP-5 during hypoxia suggests that HIF-1<inline-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1" name="1742-2094-4-12-i1" overflow="scroll"><mml:semantics definitionURL="" encoding=""><mml:munder><mml:mi>&#x003b1;</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x002d9;</mml:mo></mml:munder><mml:annotation encoding="MathType-MTEF"> MathType@MTEF@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatCvAUfKttLearuWrP9MDH5MBPbIqV92AaeXatLxBI9gBaebbnrfifHhDYfgasaacH8akY=wiFfYdH8Gipec8Eeeu0xXdbba9frFj0=OqFfea0dXdd9vqai=hGuQ8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qiLsFr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacaGaaeqabaqabeGadaaakeaacuaHXoqygaqgaaaa@2E6B@</mml:annotation></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> may be a target for the regulation of inflammatory chemokines in the neuroinflammation induced by hypoxia/ischemia.

Hypoxia and CoCl<sub>2 </sub>up-regulate the expression of both HIF-1&#x003b1; and chemokines MCP-1 and MCP-5 in astrocytes. The levels of MCP-5 up-regulation induced by hypoxia or CoCl<sub>2 </sub>correlated with the levels of hypoxia-stimulated HIF-1&#x003b1; in mouse astrocytes. HIF-1 protein complex activated by hypoxia binds to the HIF-1-binding DNA sequence as shown by EMSA and activates MCP-1 transcription as demonstrated by reporter gene assay, respectively. These findings suggest that HIF-1 is involved in transcriptional regulation of hypoxia-upregulated expression of chemokines MCP-1 and MCP-5 in astrocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AP-1: Activator protein-1</p><p>BBB: Blood-brain barrier</p><p>CCL2: Chemokine, CC motif, ligand 2 (human MCP-1)</p><p>Ccl12: Chemokine, CC motif, ligand 12 (mouse MCP-5)</p><p>ELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p><p>EMSA: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay</p><p>EPO: Erythropoetin</p><p>HIF-1: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1</p><p>ICAM-1: Intercellular adhesion molecule-1</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2;: Interleukin-1&#x003b2;</p><p>IL-8: Interleukin-8</p><p>MCAO: Middle cerebral artery occlusion</p><p>MCP-1: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or CCL2</p><p>MCP-5: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-5 or Ccl12</p><p>NF&#x003ba;B: Nuclear factor kappa B</p><p>PCR: Polymerase chain reaction</p><p>RT: Reverse transcription</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1;: Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;</p><p>VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JMP performed the experiments on mouse astrocytes generated from HIF-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/- </sup>and HIF-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/+ </sup>mice (genotyping, RT-PCR and ELISA) and reviewed the manuscript.
