Here we describe functional characterization of the yeast RNA helicase Dbp8p (YHR169w). Our results show that Dbp8p is an essential nucleolar protein required for biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit. <italic>In vivo</italic> depletion of Dbp8p resulted in a ribosomal subunit imbalance due to a deficit in 40S ribosomal subunits. Subsequent analyses of pre-rRNA processing by pulse&#x02013;chase labeling, northern hybridization and primer extension revealed that the early steps of cleavage of the 35S precursor at sites A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are inhibited and delayed at site A<sub>0</sub>. Synthesis of 18S rRNA, the RNA moiety of the 40S subunit, is thereby blocked in the absence of Dbp8p. The involvement of Dbp8p as a <italic>bona fide</italic> RNA helicase in ribosome biogenesis is strongly supported by the loss of Dbp8p <italic>in vivo</italic> function obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of some conserved motifs carrying the enzymatic properties of the protein family.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA helicases of the DEAD box protein family are present in almost all organisms and over 100 such proteins from a variety of species are found in the sequence databases. The genome of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> by itself contains 26 DEAD box proteins. They are characterized by the presence of eight conserved motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c2">2</xref>) grouped in a central core domain and flanked by poorly conserved N- and C-terminal extensions. Based on sequence variations within the conserved motifs, related proteins are grouped in the DEAH box family, the Ski2p family, the Snf2p family or the Upf1p family. Several DEAD box and DEAH box proteins have been shown to possess <italic>in vitro</italic> helicase activity, i.e. they can unwind short duplex RNAs in an ATP-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c8">8</xref>). Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis combined with <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic assays allowed the assignment of specific functions, like binding of ATP, ATP hydrolysis and RNA helicase activity, to some of the conserved motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c11">11</xref>). Regarding the highly variable N- and C-terminal extensions, they may confer substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c12">12</xref>), direct the protein to its subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c13">13</xref>) or bind accessory proteins.</p><p> So far, DEAD box proteins and their relatives have been shown to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA export from the nucleus, translation initiation and RNA decay, but in most cases their substrates and thus their precise functions have still not been elucidated. Ribosome biogenesis is the cellular process that employs by far the largest number of putative RNA helicases. Indeed, 15 of these proteins from yeast have been reported to be involved in this process &#x0005b;Dbp3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c13">13</xref>), Fal1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c14">14</xref>), Rrp3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c15">15</xref>), Rok1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c16">16</xref>), Drs1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c17">17</xref>), Dbp10p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c18">18</xref>), Dbp4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c19">19</xref>), Spb4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c20">20</xref>), Mak5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c21">21</xref>), Dbp6p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c22">22</xref>), Dbp7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c23">23</xref>), Dob1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c24">24</xref>), Dhr1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c25">25</xref>), Dhr2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c25">25</xref>) and Sen1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c26">26</xref>)&#x0005d;. Synthesis of ribosomes represents a major metabolic activity in the eukaryotic cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c27">27</xref>). It has been calculated that an exponentially growing yeast cell contains &#x0223c;200 000 ribosomes and that up to 50&#x00025; of the RNA polymerase II activity is devoted to transcription of ribosomal protein (r-protein) encoding genes. In addition, rRNA is encoded by 120&#x02013;200 repeats on chromosome XII, representing &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of the yeast genome. These repeats are actively transcribed by RNA polymerase I to give rise to a large pre-rRNA precursor, which contains, in addition to the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs, external and internal spacer sequences that have to be accurately removed by a series of ordered endo- and exonucleolytic cleavages during pre-rRNA processing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f1">1</xref>). Furthermore, very early in ribosome biogenesis rRNA sequences within the pre-rRNA are modified by pseudo-uridinylation as well as by base and ribose methylation. These modifications are guided by approximately 100 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that hybridize to specific regions of the pre-rRNA. In addition, pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly are tightly linked and during transcription of the large pre-rRNA precursor, <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors and ribosomal proteins are already associated with the nascent transcript. Over 65 <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved in ribosome biogenesis have been characterized in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and the mature ribosome contains 32 and 46 r-proteins in the small and large ribosomal subunits, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c29">29</xref>).</p><p> Thus, ribosome biogenesis is a very complex process that requires a multitude of RNA&#x02013;RNA and RNA&#x02013;protein interactions and involves numerous structural rearrangements. Furthermore, due to the high demand for ribosomes in the cell the process of ribosome biogenesis needs to be precisely coordinated. One can assume then that putative RNA helicases play a crucial role both in the structural rearrangements and as directional driving forces during this process. They are probably required for melting local rRNA secondary structures to allow coordinated binding of r-proteins or <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors and appropriate formation of mutually exclusive RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions. Moreover, RNA helicases may be involved in pairing and dissociation of the guide snoRNAs. Indeed, Dbp4p has been isolated in a screen for suppressors of a snoRNA (U14) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c19">19</xref>) and Dhr1p has been shown to be associated with the snoRNA U3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c25">25</xref>). They may also act as cofactors of nucleolytic activities, as has been shown for Dob1p and the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c24">24</xref>). Finally, it cannot be excluded that some of the putative RNA helicases are involved in rearrangements of RNA&#x02013;protein interactions.</p><p> To better understand the process of ribosome biogenesis and to fully characterize the DEAD box protein family of putative RNA helicases we analyzed the gene <italic>YHR169w</italic>, which we rename <italic>DBP8</italic> for DEAD box protein 8 encoding gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids, oligonucleotides, media and microbiological methods</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke210tb1">1</xref> and in the following sections.

It is located on the right arm of chromosome VIII and encodes a basic protein of 431 amino acids with a predicted pI of 9.78 and a predicted mass of 47.8 kDa. Dbp8p contains the eight conserved motifs constituting the so-called helicase core region characteristic of the DEAD box proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f2">2</xref>).

The GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> strain was obtained after transformation of the MCD8H-3C &#x0005b;pMCD8-1&#x0005d; strain with plasmid pMCD8-2 followed by plasmid shuffling on galactose plates containing 5-FOA.

After a shift from YPGal to YPD liquid medium the growth rate of the GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> strain remained similar to that of the wild-type strain for the first 12 h, then progressively decreased to reach a doubling time of &#x0223c;10 h after 36 h in YPD medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f3">3</xref>B). As shown by western blot analysis, cellular depletion of Dbp8p was concomitant with the decrease in growth rate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f3">3</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> depletion of Dbp8p leads to a 40S ribosomal subunit shortage</title><p>Amongst the DEAD box proteins that have already been characterized, several have been implicated in translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c2">2</xref>). We first investigated by polysome profile analysis whether Dbp8p was involved in one of these two processes. The GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> and the wild-type strains were grown in parallel in YPGal medium at 30&#x000b0;C, then shifted to YPD medium and polysome extracts were prepared from cells harvested at different times. After 6 h in YPD medium the polysome profile of the GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> strain is very similar to that of the wild-type strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f4">4</xref>A and B). In perfect correlation with the depletion of Dbp8p and the decrease in growth rate described before, differences in the GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> polysome profiles appeared after 12 h and were even more pronounced after 18 h in YPD medium. The size and number of polyribosomes dropped and the peak corresponding to the free 40S ribosomal subunit pool was nearly undetectable, whereas there was a strong increase in the free 60S ribosomal subunit pool (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f4">4</xref>C and D). This reflected a ribosomal subunit imbalance due to a deficit in 40S ribosomal subunits, which was confirmed by quantifying total ribosomal subunits in polysome run-off and low Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> cell extracts. The A<sub>254</sub> 60S:40S ratio measured for the GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> strain increased from 1.6 to 5.9 after 18 h in YPD medium, whereas it was around 1.6 and remained constant for the wild-type strain. These results suggest that Dbp8p plays a role in 40S ribosomal subunit metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Formation of the 18S rRNA is impaired upon Dbp8p <italic>in vivo</italic> depletion</title><p>The biogenesis of ribosomal subunits is tightly linked to the formation of the rRNAs. Therefore, to further investigate the 40S ribosomal subunit shortage phenotype of the GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> strain we analyzed the effects of depletion of Dbp8p on synthesis and processing of pre-rRNA. For that purpose, &#x0005b;5,6-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;uracil pulse&#x02013;chase labeling experiments were performed on wild-type and GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> strains after &#x0223c;20 h depletion in glucose-containing medium.</p><p> In the wild-type strain the 35S precursor was rapidly converted into the 32S pre-rRNA and then into the 27S and 20S pre-rRNAs, which were subsequently processed to the mature 25S and 18S rRNAs, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f5">5</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;5). Within the first minutes of chase the radioactive 35S pre-rRNA was entirely processed and the labeled mature rRNAs reached their maximum levels after 5 min, when most of the labeled precursors had disappeared. In the GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> strain processing was clearly delayed, since a significant level of labeled 35S precursor persisted after &#x0003e;30 min of chase. The radioactive 35S pre-rRNA was converted into labeled 27SB precursor and an aberrant 23S molecule, but neither 27SA nor 20S labeled precursors were detectable. The 27SB precursor was processed following the same kinetics as in the wild-type strain and resulted in similar levels of labeled mature 25S rRNA. In contrast, only very little labeled 18S mature rRNA was formed. Similar experiments performed with &#x0005b;methyl-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;methionine revealed that the overall methylation of the pre-rRNAs was unaffected upon Dbp8p depletion (data not shown). The formation of low molecular weight RNAs (5S and 5.8S rRNAs and tRNAs) was also unaffected (data not shown).</p><p> These results show that the deficit of 40S ribosomal subunits observed upon Dbp8p depletion is due to impaired production of mature 18S rRNA and strongly suggest that Dbp8p is involved in 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Dbp8p is required for pre-rRNA processing at A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub></title><p>To further define the pre-rRNA processing steps that are affected upon Dbp8p depletion, steady-state levels of mature rRNAs and pre-rRNA intermediates were assessed by northern blot and primer extension analyses. Different oligonucleotides hybridizing to defined regions of the 35S pre-rRNA transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f6">6</xref>A) were used to monitor specific processing intermediates in the GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> strain during the time course of depletion of Dbp8p and in an isogenic wild-type strain as a control. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f6">6</xref>A, depletion of Dbp8p resulted in a drastic decrease in mature 18S rRNA steady-state level, whereas that of mature 25S rRNA was not affected. Probing with oligonucleotide B, which hybridizes 5&#x02032; upstream of site A<sub>0</sub>, revealed that with ongoing Dbp8p depletion the 35S pre-rRNA and an aberrant 23S processing product accumulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f6">6</xref>B). The increase in 35S pre-rRNA steady-state level, detected by all the other precursor-specific probes used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f6">6</xref>C&#x02013;F), indicated that cleavage at site A<sub>0</sub> is impaired or at least delayed in the absence of Dbp8p. The aberrant 23S processing product could still be detected by oligonucleotides C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f6">6</xref>C) and D (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f6">6</xref>D) but not with oligonucleotide E (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f6">6</xref>E). Thus, it extends from the 5&#x02032;-end of the 5&#x02032;-external transcribed spacers (ETS) to the A<sub>3</sub> site and originates from direct cleavage of the 35S precursor at site A<sub>3</sub> within internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS), which occurs in the absence of cleavages at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c29">29</xref>). Consistent with generation of the 23S processing product, we observed that the steady-state levels of the 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA and 20S pre-rRNA, which is the direct precursor of mature 18S rRNA, were strongly reduced upon Dbp8p depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f6">6</xref>C&#x02013;E). Only a slight decrease in 32S pre-rRNA levels was observed upon Dbp8p depletion, probably due to the faint detection of this species in our northern hybridization. Depletion of these pre-rRNA species, products of cleavages at sites A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>, indicated that these cleavage steps were impaired in the absence of Dbp8p. In contrast, as shown by hybridization with oligonucleotide F (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f6">6</xref>F) and G (data not shown), the steady-state level of the 27SB processing intermediates remained unchanged during depletion, indicating that the major subsequent processing step, cleavage at site A<sub>3</sub>, was unaffected. Moreover, northern blot analyses of low molecular weight RNAs using oligonucleotides G and H revealed that the steady-state levels of 7S pre-rRNA and mature 5.8S rRNA were similar in wild-type and Dbp8p-depleted cells, indicating that processing in ITS2 was also unaffected (data not shown).</p><p> Detection of the 33S and 27SA<sub>3</sub> pre-rRNA species, discrimination between the 27SB<sub>L</sub> and 27SB<sub>S</sub> precursors and confirmation of the accuracy of cleavage, which are not amenable to northern hybridization, were performed by primer extension analyses. The 33S pre-rRNA steady-state level, as shown by the primer extension stop at site A<sub>0</sub>, seems to rise after 12 h of Dbp8p depletion and then returns progressively to initial levels. However, as described above, the appearance of the 23S processing intermediate showed that cleavage at site A<sub>0</sub> was clearly delayed in the Dbp8p-depleted strain. The levels of 27SA<sub>3</sub>, 27SB<sub>L</sub> and 27SB<sub>S</sub> pre-rRNAs, shown by primer extension stops A<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>1L</sub> and B<sub>1S</sub>, respectively, remained unchanged during Dbp8p depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f7">7</xref>B and C). In contrast, and consistent with the results of northern hybridization, the steady-state level of 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA, shown by the primer extension stop at site A<sub>2</sub>, dropped after 12 h of depletion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f7">7</xref>B). The accuracy of cleavage at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>1L</sub> and B<sub>1S</sub> was conserved upon Dbp8p depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f7">7</xref> and data not shown).</p><p> Taken together, the results indicate that Dbp8p is essential for the processing cleavages at sites A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> and is required for optimal cleavage at site A<sub>0</sub>. Subsequent processing reactions in ITS1 and ITS2 leading to the production of 25S and 5.8S rRNAs do not require Dbp8p. Furthermore, the steady-state levels of the snoRNAs U3, U14, snR10 and snR30, which are amongst the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved in the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> processing steps, were not affected by depletion of Dbp8p (data not shown), which strengthens a direct involvement of Dbp8p in these pre-rRNA processing steps.</p></sec><sec><title>Dbp8p is localized in the nucleolus</title><p>To determine the subcellular localization of Dbp8p, an epitope-tagged HA<italic>-DBP8</italic> allele under the control of its cognate promoter was constructed.

Under all conditions tested the HA-<italic>DBP8</italic> strain exhibited the same growth behavior as an otherwise isogenic wild-type strain, demonstrating that the HA&#x02013;Dbp8p protein was fully functional. Western blot analysis performed with primary monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibodies and secondary goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies detected a single protein with an estimated molecular mass of 55 kDa in a whole cell lysate of the HA-<italic>DBP8</italic> strain but not from the control strain (data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed with the HA-<italic>DBP8</italic> strain following growth in YPD medium to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6. Detection of the HA&#x02013;Dbp8p protein was performed with monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibodies and goat anti-mouse fluorescein-conjugated antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f8">8</xref>C). The DNA was stained with DAPI to visualize the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f8">8</xref>A) and the nucleolus was visualized by detection of Nop1p with polyclonal rabbit anti-Nop1 and goat anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f8">8</xref>B). Superimposition of the signals obtained from detection of HA&#x02013;Dbp8p and Nop1p, respectively, is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f8">8</xref>D. A typical crescent-shaped staining mostly excluded from DAPI stained areas and characteristic of the nucleolar structure was observed with anti-Nop1p antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f8">8</xref>B). A highly similar staining was obtained using anti-HA antibodies and was confirmed by the perfect superimposition of both signals, demonstrating that Dbp8p is exclusively localized in the nucleolus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f8">8</xref>C and D). Only weak background staining was obtained with anti-HA antibodies on the control strain containing untagged Dbp8p (data not shown).</p><p> The nucleolar localization of Dbp8p is again consistent with a direct involvement of the protein in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic evidence that Dbp8p acts as an RNA helicase</title><p>As a member of the DEAD box protein family, Dbp8p contains all the sequence motifs of an ATP-dependent RNA helicase. Furthermore, for this class of enzymes specific activities like ATP and RNA binding, ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding have been assigned to some of the highly conserved motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c2">2</xref>). To determine whether these motifs play a role in <italic>in vivo</italic> Dbp8p function we modified them by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f9">9</xref>A). Walker motifs A (AX<sub>4</sub>GKT) and B (DEAD), involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, were modified to AX<sub>4</sub>AAT (<italic>dbp8-1</italic> allele) and DAAD (<italic>dbp8-2</italic> allele), respectively. Motif III (TAT), important for RNA unwinding, was converted into AAA (<italic>dbp8-3</italic> allele) and motif VI (HRSGR), implicated in ATP hydrolysis-dependent RNA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c11">11</xref>), was replaced by HAAGR (<italic>dbp8-4</italic> allele). These four plasmid-borne mutant alleles were then introduced into the MCD8H-3C &#x0005b;pMCD8-1&#x0005d; strain and their functionality was tested through their capability to allow loss of the plasmid-borne <italic>DBP8</italic> allele monitored on 5-FOA-containing medium.

Furthermore, it exhibited an altered polysome profile reflecting a 40S ribosomal subunit deficit similar to those observed during depletion of Dbp8p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f9">9</xref>B).

The wild-type behavior of the <italic>dbp8-4</italic> mutant indicates that the first arginine residue of motif VI is dispensable for Dbp8p function, however, it does not preclude the potential importance of other residues of the motif.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>DEAD box proteins are involved in a variety of processes involving RNA molecules. To completely characterize the DEAD box family of RNA helicases from the yeast <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> we analyzed the role of the <italic>DBP8</italic> gene. The Dbp8p protein contains the eight conserved motifs of the DEAD box protein family. However, motif III has a conservative replacement of one of the amino acids (TAT instead of SAT) and motif VI is HRSGRxGR, whereas most helicases have a isoleucine or valine instead of the serine (except for Mak5p, Prp5p and Spb4p). The TAT sequence is also present in the Prp28p and Dbp3p proteins, involved in pre-mRNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis. Thus, the Dbp8p protein is a typical DEAD box protein despite these alterations. Comparison with sequence databases show significant homologies with proteins from <italic>H.sapiens</italic>, <italic>A.thaliana</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. This high evolutionary conservation between the yeast protein and its putative orthologs in several higher eukaryotes argues in favor of Dbp8p playing an essential role in a fundamental cellular process. Indeed, Dbp8p is involved in ribosome biogenesis, a process largely conserved in eukaryotes.</p><p> Since <italic>DBP8</italic> is an essential gene, phenotypic analyses were done with a conditional system based on Dbp8p depletion by transcriptional repression of a plasmid-borne GAL::<italic>DBP8</italic> gene. Our data clearly indicate that Dbp8p is involved in biogenesis of the 40S small ribosomal subunit. The first indication was from polysome analyses and quantification of the overall ribosomal subunits, which revealed that ongoing Dbp8p depletion was accompanied by a deficit in the 40S subunit pool leading to a ribosomal subunit imbalance, i.e. an increase in 60S relative to 40S subunits. Subsequent analysis of pre-rRNA processing by pulse&#x02013;chase labeling showed that synthesis of 18S rRNA is impaired whereas 25S, 5.8S and 5S rRNAs are normally produced. A more detailed analysis of the different processing intermediates by northern hybridization and primer extension indicated that endonucleolytic cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA at sites A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> is inhibited and at least delayed at site A<sub>0</sub>. This was reflected in the decrease in 32S, 20S and 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNAs associated with accumulation of the 35S precursor and appearance of the aberrant 23S intermediate. As has been described for other proteins required for these early cleavages, such an inhibition results in direct cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA precursor at site A<sub>3</sub>, producing a 23S aberrant intermediate and 27SA<sub>3</sub> pre-rRNA. Whereas the latter follows the normal processing pathway resulting in production of the 25S and 5.8S mature rRNAs, the 23S species is not further processed to yield mature 18S rRNA. Therefore, depletion of Dbp8p results in a deficit of 18S rRNA compared to the other mature rRNAs. Furthermore, HA epitope-tagged Dbp8p was found to localize exclusively in the nucleolus, the cellular compartment where ribosome biogenesis mainly takes place, arguing for a direct role of Dbp8p in formation of 18S rRNA and the 40S ribosomal subunit.</p><p> Several other RNA helicases have been described as required for early cleavage of pre-rRNA. Depletion of Fal1p, Rok1p, Rrp3p and Dhr2p results in a more or less strong delay in cleavage at site A<sub>0</sub> and inhibition of cleavage at sites A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>, characterized by accumulation of the 35S pre-rRNA precursor and the 23S intermediate, as upon depletion of Dbp8p. So far, neither substrate nor interacting partner has been identified for any of these RNA helicases and their precise functions in ribosome biogenesis are still not elucidated. Upon depletion of Dhr1p, a DEAH box protein, cleavage at sites A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> is predominantly affected and the protein has been shown to be physically associated with U3 snoRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c25">25</xref>). On the basis of these observations, a more precise function has been proposed for Dhr1p in pre-rRNA processing. Rok1p and Dbp4p interact genetically with the snoRNAs snR10 and U14, respectively, however, in both cases no physical interaction has been detected. Furthermore, a detailed characterization of the pre-rRNA processing defects associated with Dbp4p impairment is still lacking. As for the other RNA helicases affecting early cleavages, except Dhr1p, we cannot so far assign a precise function to Dbp8p in these early processing steps. We could, however, tell that accumulation of the four snoRNAs U3, U14, snR30 and snR10 involved in these processing steps is not impaired upon Dbp8p depletion (data not shown).</p><p> Although a helicase activity has not been demonstrated for any of these putative RNA helicases involved in early processing reactions, we strongly believe that Dbp8p has such an activity and that this activity is absolutely required for ribosome biogenesis. Two motifs have been shown to be critical for ATP binding and hydrolysis, motif I (AxxGxGKT) and motif II (DEAD). Mutations in motifs I and II completely abolish the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of Dbp8p. Based on mutations made in <italic>RAD3</italic> and eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c41">41</xref>), the mutation in motif I is expected to abolish ATPase activity. Mutations in the DEAD motif have been shown to affect ATPase activity in Ded1p, eIF4A and many other putative helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c40">40</xref>). Thus, these mutant phenotypes are in agreement with the requirement for ATPase activity for <italic>in vivo</italic> function of Dbp8p. The modification of motif III (TAT&#x02192;AAA) within Dbp8p, although viable, severely affects growth. Furthermore, analysis of polysomes and ribosomal subunits from these mutant cells revealed a deficit of 40S ribosomal subunits similar to that observed upon Dbp8p depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f9">9</xref>B). Certain motif III mutations result <italic>in vivo</italic> in a dominant negative phenotype for Prp2p and Prp43p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c43">43</xref>) and in a cold-sensitive phenotype for Prp28p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c44">44</xref>). Motif III mutations in mouse eIF4A and Nph-II from vaccinia virus result in loss of their RNA helicase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> whereas their ATPase activity is poorly affected or even enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c45">45</xref>). This motif is thus considered as critical for RNA helicase activity. A mutation in motif VI (HRSGR&#x02192;HAAGR) of Dbp8p has no effect on growth under the test conditions. Substitutions of R with E, G, I, S or T (but not K) in Tif1p (yeast eIF4A) completely abolished the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of the protein and, in addition, resulted in a strong dominant negative phenotype when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c46">46</xref>). Similar results have been reported for mammalian eIF4A protein, where <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of the eIF4A protein is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c11">11</xref>). In contrast, mutations of the first R in motif VI to K, I or T in the <italic>ROK1</italic> gene did not reveal a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c47">47</xref>). Thus, mutation of the first R in this motif may have drastic effects or may be silent. Indeed, other residues within this motif have been shown to be important, especially the second arginine residue. It was originally proposed that motif VI is involved in RNA binding. Although mutational analysis and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using mammalian eIF4A were in accord with this postulate, similar analyses using the vaccinia NPH-II helicase protein showed an involvement in ATP hydrolysis but not in RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c48">48</xref>). The structural data indicate that motif VI is required to hold the ATP in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c51">51</xref>). This nicely explains the results obtained from eIF4A and NPH-II, since the bound nucleotide influences the affinity for the RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke210c53">53</xref>). In the case of Dbp8p it is possible that the nucleotide can be held in place even after mutating the HRSGRxGR motif, due to compensatory structural elements present in this protein. On the other hand, affinity for the RNA substrate may not be regulated in the same way by the bound nucleotide, allowing the protein to function to a sufficient extent to allow almost wild-type growth.</p><p> Dbp8p is the seventh putative RNA helicase required for biogenesis of the 40S subunit and the sixteenth helicase required for ribosome biogenesis in general (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke210f1">1</xref>). The question thus arises, why are so many RNA helicases required for ribosome biogenesis? In view of the massive production of ribosomes in the exponentially growing cell, it is not surprising that this process requires an optimal machinery. In this sense, RNA helicases may help to dissociate intra- and intermolecular RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions for efficient rearrangements to take place. The use of highly specific helicases certainly contributes to optimization of the process. Moreover, recognition of specific substrate structures avoids backward reactions or inhibiting product&#x02013;catalyst interactions. Thus, Dbp8p is a putative RNA helicase presumably involved in a very specific step of ribosome biogenesis. Further work is required to elucidate interacting proteins and its substrate.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke210f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Pre-rRNA processing in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>.

It is thought that the early pre-rRNA cleavages A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> are carried out by a large snoRNP complex, which is likely to be assisted by the putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases Dbp4p, Fal1p, Rok1p, Rrp3p, Dhr1p, Dhr2p and Dbp8p. Final maturation of the 20S precursor takes place in the cytoplasm, where an endonucleolytic cleavage at site D yields the mature 18S rRNA. The 27SA<sub>2</sub> precursor is processed by two alternative pathways that both lead to the formation of mature 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. In the major pathway the 27SA<sub>2</sub> precursor is cleaved at site A<sub>3</sub> by RNase MRP. The putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase Dbp3p assists in this processing step. The 27SA<sub>3</sub> precursor is 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleolytically digested up to site B<sub>1S</sub> to yield the 27SB<sub>S</sub> precursor, a reaction requiring the exonucleases Xrn1p and Rat1p. A minor pathway processes the 27SA<sub>2</sub> molecule at site B<sub>1L</sub>, producing the 27SB<sub>L</sub> pre-rRNA. While processing at site B<sub>1</sub> is completed, the 3&#x02032;-end of mature 25S rRNA is generated by processing at site B<sub>2</sub>. The subsequent ITS2 processing of both 27SB species appears to be identical. Cleavage at sites C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> releases the mature 25S rRNA and the 7S pre-rRNA. The latter undergoes exosome-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease digestion to the 3&#x02032;-end of the mature 5.8S rRNA; this reaction also requires the putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase Dob1p. Assembly of the 60S subunit and the associated pre-rRNA processing reactions requires four other putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases: Dbp6p, Dbp7p, Dbp10p and Spb4p. The roles of the Drs1p and Mak5p proteins have not yet been defined. Only <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors belonging to the class of putative RNA helicases are indicated.
