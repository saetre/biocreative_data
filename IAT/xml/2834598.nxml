Observations of leech long-term behavior in an unstructured environment have resulted in identification of several behavioral states, including stationary states, and transitions between these states that depend only on the most recent prior behavioral state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Invertebrate electrophysiological studies of a given behavioral state such as quiescence and switching between behavioral states <italic>e.g</italic>. swimming and crawling in <italic>Tritonia </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], swallowing and quiescent states in <italic>Lymnea </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] among many others have elucidated several neuronal mechanisms. However the genetic basis of these processes are less well studied.</p><p>Despite a single gait underlying locomotion in liquid and solid media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], referred to as swimming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and crawling respectively, nematodes exhibit distinct behavioral patterns when observed for long periods of time in liquid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We have previously described that in liquid, wild type worms display periods of active swimming alternating with a quiescent state lasting for several minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We previously showed that quiescence in liquid results from high cholinergic signaling downstream of motor neurons and that the maintenance of the quiescent state requires command inter-neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the quiescent state exhibited by worms in liquid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], two other behavioral quiescent states have been studied in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Movement of <italic>C. elegans </italic>stops when they undergo lethargus, a developmental state that occurs before each of the four molts during its life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This quiescent state exhibits characteristics that resemble sleep in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. On agar plates with high-quality food, movement and feeding of an adult worm is interjected by stops, a behavioral characteristic that has parallels to satiety in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Molecularly, two different signaling systems have been identified to influence these quiescent states. Insulin/TGF-&#x003b2; and EGF signaling induce quiescence on plates with high quality food and during lethargus respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In both quiescence paradigms, protein kinase G (PKG) activity in sensory neurons is required to promote quiescence. Eventually the activity of PKG at the sensory neuronal level must modulate activities of the motor and/or interneurons to bring about quiescence. How PKG activity in sensory neurons drives quiescence at the motor/interneuron levels is not known. Also it remains to be seen how much overlap exists in the genetics of the three behavioral quiescence states that have been described. The unique features of long term swimming behavior, ease of genetic analysis and the knowledge of the pattern of synaptic connectivity of the entire nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] that allow mapping of molecular to neuronal correlates underlying behavior makes <italic>C. elegans </italic>a suitable model to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying this long-term behavioral pattern.</p><p>To further investigate the underlying mechanism(s) of quiescence in liquid, we examined the cellular site of action of several genes that had important effects on swim/quiescence cycling. Several of these do not act at the motor neuron-muscle circuitry but instead act in sensory neurons. We found that maintenance of swimming requires calcineurin activity in the sensory neurons. The PKG homolog <italic>egl-4 </italic>promotes quiescence by acting at two levels: in the sensory neurons and also downstream of command interneurons. Our analysis suggests that there may be two mechanisms by which swimming motions may be stopped, one by blocking output of the motor system at the level of motor neurons and muscles, a mechanism that appears to come into play when worms swim in liquid, and one by inhibition of initiation of swimming motions upstream of this block, which is strongly influenced by sensory input.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PKG is required for maintenance of the quiescent state during swimming in liquid</title><p>The PKG homolog of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>egl-4</italic>, regulates long-term olfactory adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], different locomotory states (roaming and dwelling) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and promotes longer duration of quiescence bouts under different paradigms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Though it is widely expressed in the neuro-muscular system and has been implicated in modulation of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the pleiotropic effects of <italic>egl-4 </italic>have been mostly attributed to its activity in sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We have previously shown that loss-of-function alleles of <italic>egl-4 </italic>affected maintenance of the naturally occurring quiescent bouts that occur with regular periodicity when a worm is swimming in liquid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Indeed, when compared to the wild type animals, the median fraction of <italic>egl- 4(ks60) </italic>animals that remained in quiescence during the second phase of swimming (phase one is defined as the first ninety minutes from the start of the assay and the subsequent 90 minutes is defined as the second phase of the assay) was significantly lower (wild type: 0.21; <italic>egl-4(ks60)</italic>: 0.14, p &#x0003c; 0.0001, Mann Whitney test, trends are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Here we show that the loss-of-function mutant, <italic>egl-4(ks60)</italic>, suppresses increased quiescence resulting from including 0.01 mM aldicarb in the assay medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). The median quiescent bout durations of <italic>egl-4(ks60) </italic>in 0.01 mM aldicarb did not differ from <italic>egl-4(ks60) </italic>in buffer alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Mann Whitney U test, p = 0.5683). This suppression was absent at higher doses (0.1 or 1 mM) aldicarb (data not shown). However <italic>egl-4 </italic>mutants still went into quiescence albeit for a shorter duration in 0.01 mM aldicarb. Taken together these data suggest that increased quiescent bout durations in liquid due to increased cholinergic activity require <italic>egl-4 </italic>function.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>PKG promotes quiescence</bold>.

Thus calcineurin activity is required for preventing animals from going into quiescence. Moreover, the increased quiescence duration in calcineurin loss-of-function mutants is indicative of a role of calcineurin in proper termination of quiescence.

Taken together, these data suggest that activity of calcineurin in the sensory neurons is necessary and sufficient for maintaining a wild type swimming-quiescence pattern in liquid.

We found that like other calcineurin-modulated behaviors in <italic>C elegans</italic>, activity of calcineurin in the sensory neurons is critical to maintain swimming in <italic>C. elegans </italic>in liquid. In analogy with the neuronal properties that change in a calcineurin mutant, namely defect in gain control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], it is likely that increased quiescence in the <italic>tax- 6/cnb-1 </italic>loss-of-function mutants is due to hyperactivation of one or more sensory neurons. In addition, calcineurin mutants displayed a temporally changing phenotype in which there was a significant drop in the fraction of worms in quiescence after 90 minutes. This recovery after 90 minutes from start of assay was more pronounced in case of <italic>tax-6(db60) </italic>mutants than <italic>cnb-1(jh300) </italic>mutants, suggesting other phosphatases or autoregulatory mechanisms may play a role in shaping the temporal pattern of swim- quiescence pattern in liquid. It is possible that in <italic>tax-6 </italic>loss-of-function mutants unopposed phosphorylation of a yet unidentified substrate induces prolonged quiescence. The phosphorylation possibly involves <italic>egl-4 </italic>activity as the increased quiescence in calcineurin loss of function mutants was suppressed by loss of function muations in <italic>egl-4</italic>. During the first 90 minutes of the assay, PKG and calcineurin play opposing roles in maintenance of swimming. In the second phase (the subsequent 90 minutes) of the assay, however, the fraction of worms in quiescence in <italic>egl-4;cnb-1 </italic>double mutants was lower than the <italic>egl-4 </italic>loss of function mutants, suggesting that additional yet unidentified mechanisms may play a role in shaping the temporal pattern of quiescence during swimming in liquid.</p><p>We found that the protein kinase G homolog <italic>egl-4 </italic>acts in the sensory neurons to enhance the quiescence duration liquid. Similar to other paradigms of behavioral quiescence, we found that PKG activity in sensory neurons expressing the cGMP-gated calcium channel <italic>tax-4 </italic>is critical for regulating quiescent bout duration. However, beyond the involvement of <italic>egl-4 </italic>in <italic>tax-4 </italic>expressing neurons, the pathways for induction of different types of quiescence seem to be different. For instance, in quiescence induced by high quality food, loss-of-function mutants of <italic>tax-2</italic>, encoding the alpha subunit of the cGMP gated ion channels, exhibited very little quiescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However quiescence in liquid without food doesn't seem to involve participation of these channels as quiescence bouts of double mutants of alpha and beta subunits, <italic>tax-2(p691);tax-4(ky89)</italic>, were not different from wild type (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), ruling out these channels as phosphorylation targets of <italic>egl-4 </italic>in modulating quiescence duration in liquid without food. This difference may be attributed to a different target of <italic>egl-4 </italic>in the sensory neurons or action of <italic>egl-4 </italic>in additional sites beyond the sensory neurons.</p><p>Our data also suggests a second site of action of <italic>egl-4 </italic>other than the sensory neurons. It seems likely that <italic>egl-4 </italic>may be acting functionally downstream of acetylcholine release at an as yet unidentified site in regulating quiescence bouts. Our hypothesis is supported by the lack of complete rescue of <italic>egl-4 </italic>loss of function by expression in the sensory neurons, the suppression in <italic>egl-4 </italic>mutants of increased quiescence resulting from manipulations of the command interneurons as well as lack of suppression of the GABAergic loss of function mutants. These observations support a site of action of EGL-4 other than within sensory neurons. One possibility is that during quiescence, <italic>egl-4 </italic>inhibits GABA-ergic signaling and therefore signaling through the ACh pathway is increased causing quiescence. According to this model, in an <italic>egl-4 </italic>loss-of-function mutant GABA-ergic signaling is enhanced, which terminates quiescence prematurely (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It is also possible that <italic>egl-4 </italic>acts solely in the sensory neurons by activating a neurosecretory pathway that inhibits GABAergic activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This is consistent with two pathways in maintenance of quiescence. However this scenario requires that sensory neurons with global defects in cilia result in excessive activation of the neurosecretory pathway. Further studies are required to distinguish between these two models. The data is also consistent with a possibility that partial loss of function mutations in <italic>egl-4 </italic>counters "gain-of-function" like situation that may be mimicked by aldicarb or constitutive depolarization of command interneurons. However this is less likely as increased quiescence due to loss of function mutations in <italic>nmr-1</italic>, <italic>osm-3 </italic>and osm-6 was suppressed by <italic>egl-4 </italic>loss of function mutants.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Model for action of EGL-4 and TAX-6 in regulation of the quiescent state</bold>.

Though <italic>egl-4 </italic>has been implicated in all paradigms of behavioral quiescence in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, our results indicate that the target of EGL-4 in regulating quiescence in liquid is distinct from the other forms of quiescence. Based on our results we propose dual function of <italic>egl-4</italic>: one in the sensory neurons that is inhibited by calcineurin and another in inhibiting GABAergic neurotransmission (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Our study also implicates opposite roles of a kinase and a phosphatase in generating temporal pattern in behavior. It is likely that the activity of kinase(s) increases the probability of the motor circuit to switch to a quiescent state. Such a process is opposed by calcineurin phosphatase activity in the sensory neurons. Studies of temporal patterns generated by intermittent motor activities have explored statistical properties of the behavioral state transitions or neuro-physiological properties of neural circuits underlying them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].
