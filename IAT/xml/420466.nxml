In a tri-ethnic elderly population of African-Americans, Caribbean Hispanics and Caucasians, a G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at -386 in the <italic>TP73 </italic>P3 promoter was weakly but significantly associated with AD (crude O.R. for AD given any -386G allele 1.7; C.I. 1.2&#x02013;2.5; after adjusting for age and education O.R. 1.5; C.I. 1.1&#x02013;2.3, N= 1191). The frequency of the -386G allele varied by ethnicity and was highest in African-Americans and lowest in Caucasians.

However, additional studies will be necessary to exclude genetic admixture as an alternative explanation for the observed associations.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Genes functioning in neurons could modulate AD susceptibility either by acting during development to determine the number of cortical neurons at birth, thereby determining "cognitive reserve", or by acting during adult life to determine the cell death threshold of neurons when faced by external insults, such as amyloid-beta peptide. In principle, the protein encoded by <italic>TP73 </italic>could play a role in both processes. This protein is related to p53, which triggers apoptotic cell death as an effector mechanism in tumor surveillance. <italic>p73 </italic>knockout (KO) mice are born with disorganized hippocampal cyto-architecture, and they show degeneration of sympathetic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Moreover, these mice, which survive to adulthood, showed progressive cerebral atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Gene regulation at the <italic>TP73 </italic>locus is complex. The mRNA transcripts are initiated from two alternative promoters, leading to the production of two different protein isoforms. "Full-length" <italic>p73 </italic>mRNA, initiating from the P1 promoter, encodes a protein with an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain, while the shorter "delta-N" (&#x00394;Np73) isoform, initiating from the major downstream P3 promoter, lacks this domain. The full-length p73 protein is pro-apoptotic, while the &#x00394;Np73 acts as a natural dominant-negative, and protects cells from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The fact that the &#x00394;Np73 isoform is preferentially expressed in neurons explains the net anti-apoptotic function of p73 in the peripheral nervous system, and probably in cortical neurons of the brain.</p><p>Some evidence suggests that there may be a second kind of complexity at the <italic>p73 </italic>locus &#x02013; allelic expression bias. Monoallelic expression of <italic>TP73 </italic>was reported in neuroblastoma cells in the first publication describing this gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Monoallelic gene expression affects loci that are subject to parental imprinting, and it was initially suggested that <italic>TP73 </italic>might be imprinted. The significance of these observations were called into question by the finding of lack of imprinting of this gene in studies of the <italic>p73 </italic>KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and the finding of biallelic expression of <italic>TP73 </italic>in some normal human tissues. But biased allelic expression can have other explanations in addition to imprinting, and a number of subsequent studies have continued to report monoallelic or biased allelic representation of <italic>TP73 </italic>mRNA, albeit in a tissue-specific pattern, and with inter-individual variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Such variation suggests that there may be functional genetic polymorphisms in regulatory sequence (promoters/enhancers) of this gene. Here we assess the allele frequencies of two <italic>TP73 </italic>SNPs in a case-control analysis of AD in a tri-ethnic elderly population sample, and we test for an allelic expression bias at the <italic>TP73 </italic>locus in human brains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants and diagnosis</title><p>Selection of participants and diagnosis was previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and key aspects are repeated here. Subjects were individuals over the age of 65 residing in the Washington Heights-Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan. For those who agreed to participate, an in-person interview and a standardized assessment including a medical history, physical and neurological examination and neuropsychological battery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] was completed. Individuals who qualified for initial inclusion in the community study (n = 1401) all had at least one subsequent follow-up evaluation. 282 (20.1%) were non-Hispanic Whites, 462 (33%) were African-American, 646 (46.1%) were Caribbean Hispanic and 11 (0.8%) were from other ethnic groups. We excluded individuals with other forms of dementia or Parkinson's disease. DNA for genotyping was available from most of these individuals. For AD cases, the diagnosis was established at a consensus conference of physicians and neuropsychologists and required evidence of cognitive deficit on the neuropsychological battery as well as evidence of impairment in social or occupational function. A Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 1.0 was the cut-off for the diagnosis of AD. These studies were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA and RNA isolation</title><p>Peripheral blood was obtained with informed consent. DNA for genotyping was isolated from blood using the FlexiGene&#x02122; kit (Qiagen). To prepare DNA and RNA from frozen brain the tissue was first pulverized under liquid nitrogen.

As a screening panel, we chose genomic DNA from 12 people (24 chromosomes), including several individuals from each of the three ethnic groups. This analysis would not be expected to detect rare variants, but would detect common alleles. Sequencing of the exons encoding the DNA binding domain of p73 did not reveal any coding variants, although the <italic>Ban</italic>I SNP, which is coding-neutral, was observed with a high frequency and served as a positive control.

This variant was a G&#x02192;A transversion at position minus-386 relative to the transcriptional start site of the &#x00394;N-p73 isoform. A transcription factor binding site database search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess/"/> showed that this SNP converted a variant consensus progesterone receptor binding site overlapping the -386A allele to a non-consensus sequence in the -386G allele (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Small variations in the net expression of the &#x00394;Np73 mRNA isoform in human brains would be hard to quantify, but examining allele-specific expression, in which one allele serves as an internal control for the other, is expected to be more sensitive. We therefore screened a series of 34 brains for heterozygosity at the <italic>TP73 </italic>exon 5 <italic>Ban</italic>I polymorphism, which would allow mRNA from the two alleles to be distinguished by RFLP and direct sequencing. Since the collection of autopsy brains available to us was primarily, though not exclusively, from Caucasians, the allele frequency at this marker was low. Nonetheless, we found 4 brains, 1 fetal mid-gestation and 3 adult, which were heterozygous. Two of the adult brains were affected by AD and one was normal.</p><p>Among these 4 brains, 3 manifested approximately equal biallelic mRNA expression of <italic>TP73 </italic>mRNA, as indicated by comparison with genomic PCR controls, while one adult brain (the normal brain) showed a strong allelic expression bias (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This bias was reproducible in multiple independent RT-PCR reactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and was also reproduced starting from two separate RNA preparations from this same brain. We utilized RFLP analysis since this method gives a simple read-out of the two alleles. Heteroduplex formation can cause artifacts in this method when the cDNA is over-amplified, so we kept the PCR cycle number to a minimum (35 cycles). Genomic controls were run in parallel using the same PCR conditions, and these gave highly reproducible RFLP results, which were taken as the standard for biallelic representation. Lastly, the results of direct sequencing, which is not sensitive to heteroduplex formation, were consistent with the RFLP results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). From this analysis, we conclude that some human brains manifest an allelic bias for <italic>TP73 </italic>mRNA expression. Lastly, we established the genotype at the -386G/A P3 SNP in the 4 brains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">8</xref>). The adult brain with strongly biased expression was indeed heterozygous for this marker, but heterozygosity was also found in the fetal brain, which showed approximately equal biallelic mRNA expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Allele-specific <italic>TP73 </italic>mRNA expression in human brains. </bold>In the <italic>Ban</italic>I RFLP autoradiograms the T-allele (uncut) is indicated by the thick marker line and the C-allele (cut) by the thin marker.

But further studies, notably a knockout mouse model, demonstrated that p73 is in fact required for the development, maintenance and survival of neurons. &#x00394;Np73 is a dominant isoform in brain and it has anti-apoptotic function in neurons. This background motivated us to examine the possibility of an association between <italic>TP73 </italic>variants and the risk of AD. In the current study, a nucleotide polymorphism, -386G/A, in the P3 promoter of <italic>TP73 </italic>(the promoter that drives expression of the &#x00394;Np73 isoform) showed a weak but statistically significant association with AD. Moreover, we found that 1 of 4 human brains manifested a strong allelic expression bias at the <italic>TP73 </italic>locus, consistent with the presence of functional SNPs in the regulatory sequences of this gene.</p><p>Our brain expression data add to the findings of one prior study, in which 3 of 4 informative fetal brains showed virtually monoallelic expression of <italic>TP73 </italic>mRNA, with one fetal brain showing equal biallelic expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While our current results are in a broad sense consistent with those findings, our experimental approach was different in two respects, which make the two sets of data complementary. First, we examined adult brains; and second, we utilized the exon 5 <italic>Ban</italic>I RFLP as a marker, while the previous study utilized a different polymorphism (<italic>Sty</italic>I RFLP) in exon 2, upstream of the P3 promoter. This second difference means that we have examined <italic>TP73 </italic>mRNA derived predominantly from the P3 promoter (the major isoform in neural tissues), while the prior study examined mRNA derived exclusively from the upstream P1/P2 promoters.</p><p>Explanations for an allelic expression bias include genomic imprinting, which seems unlikely at the <italic>TP73 </italic>locus based on the negative data from mice but has not been strictly excluded in humans, or the presence of functional sequence polymorphisms in the promoters/enhancers of this gene. The -386G/A SNP itself is one candidate. The adult hippocampus that showed an allelic expression bias in our study was indeed heterozygous for this SNP, but in the fetal cerebral cortex that we examined, heterozygosity for this SNP evidently did not result in biased expression. So either the -386G/A SNP is not the critical sequence variant, or alternatively the effect of this variant is manifested in the adult hippocampus but not in whole fetal cerebral cortex. Our promoter-reporter assays in SK-NSH-N neuroblastoma cells did not indicate a strong difference in basal P3 promoter activity in comparing the -386G and -386A alleles. However, this polymorphism affects a predicted progesterone receptor binding site and progesterone-dependent transcriptional activity remains to be tested.</p><p>The interpretation of the statistical association of the -386G allele with AD risk is amenable to several interpretations. Since the -386G allele is significantly more frequent in African-Americans and Caribbean Hispanics compared to Caucasians, and since we have observed an increased rate of AD in the former two ethnic groups in our population sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the association of the -386G allele with AD might reflect genetic admixture. That is, this allele may associate with AD simply because it is more frequent in the two ethnic groups that, at least in the population that we have studied, have a higher frequency of AD. That the association of the -386G allele with AD remained significant when we confined our analysis only to the Hispanics, together with the fact that the direction of the observed effect was the same when the analysis was confined to African-Americans, argues against this explanation. However, these observations do not completely exclude ethnic admixture as an explanation for our findings. More interesting, of course, is the possibility that sequence variation in or near the <italic>TP73 </italic>P3 promoter may have a direct effect on &#x00394;Np73 expression in the brain. Haplotype analysis is in progress to further investigate this question.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>Authors QL, ESA, EY, MW and SLR carried out the genotyping, promoter-reporter assays and allelic expression analysis.
