Here we show that the endogenous <italic>trans</italic>-acting (ta)siRNA pathway, which depends on Dicer-like (DCL) 4 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) 6, is suppressed by infection of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with <italic>Cauliflower mosaic virus</italic> (CaMV). This effect was associated with overaccumulation of unprocessed, RDR6-dependent precursors of tasiRNAs and is due solely to expression of the CaMV transactivator/viroplasmin (TAV) protein. TAV expression also impaired secondary, but not primary, siRNA production from a silenced transgene and increased accumulation of mRNAs normally silenced by the four known tasiRNA families and RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs. Moreover, TAV expression upregulated <italic>DCL4</italic>, <italic>DRB4</italic> and <italic>AGO7</italic> that mediate tasiRNA biogenesis. Our findings suggest that TAV is a general inhibitor of silencing amplification that impairs DCL4-mediated processing of RDR6-dependent double-stranded RNA to siRNAs. The resulting deficiency in tasiRNAs and other RDR6-/DCL4-dependent siRNAs appears to trigger a feedback mechanism that compensates for the inhibitory effects.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Multiple RNA silencing pathways in plants downregulate gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by generating small (s)RNAs, 21&#x02013;24 nt in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). These sRNAs act either by guiding the cleavage of cognate RNAs, blocking productive translation of these RNAs, or inducing methylation of cognate DNA targets. The major pathways in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> differ in the nature of sRNA precursors and requirements for Dicer-like (DCL) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) proteins. Micro (mi)RNAs are generated by DCL1 from hairpin structures of primary-miRNA transcripts. In contrast, endogenous small interfering (si)RNAs are generated by different DCLs from double-stranded (ds)RNA precursors produced by RDRs. For example, heterochromatic and repeat-associated siRNAs are generated by DCL3 from RDR2-dependent precursors, whereas <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) by DCL4 from RDR6-dependent precursors. Both miRNAs and siRNAs bind Argonaute (AGO) proteins and guide the resulting RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) to the complementary region of target nucleic acids.</p><p>The present study focuses on effects of viral infection on the function and regulation of the tasiRNA-generating (TAS) pathways. Genetic evidence and limited biochemical data suggest that tasiRNA biogenesis is initiated by miRNA-mediated cleavage of a primary TAS transcript to generate a substrate for RDR6 that lacks the cap and/or the poly(A) tail. The presumed long dsRNA product of RDR6 activity is then processed by DCL4 from the miRNA-cleaved terminus into 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 2 nt 3&#x02032;-overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). TasiRNAs are encoded by both strands of dsRNA precursors and at different in-phase positions, 2&#x02013;12 21 nt processing cycles from the site of miRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10">5&#x02013;10</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Models for the biogenesis of tasiRNAs from two distinct types of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tasiRNA-generating (<italic>TAS</italic>) loci. (<bold>A</bold>) For each type of tasiRNA biogenesis the TAS gene structure is shown schematically with the promoter indicated with an arrow shape. Pol II transcription driven by this promoter generates capped and polyadenylated transcript. This transcript is targeted for cleavage by miRNA. In the case of <italic>TAS1</italic>, <italic>TAS2</italic> and <italic>TAS4</italic> tasiRNA families (top), the 3&#x02032;-product of this cleavage event is converted into dsRNAs by RDR6 activity. In the case of the TAS3 tasiRNA family (bottom), the 5&#x02032;-product is converted into dsRNA by RDR6. In both cases, the resulting dsRNA is processed by DCL4 into 21-nt tasiRNAs. Suppression of the latter step by the CaMV TAV protein is inferred from the present study.(<bold>B</bold>) The hypothetical dsRNAs derived from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 tasiRNA-generation loci <italic>TAS1a</italic>, <italic>TAS1b</italic>, <italic>TAS1c</italic>, <italic>TAS2</italic>, <italic>TAS3a, TAS3b, TAS3c</italic> and <italic>TAS4</italic> are shown schematically.

The tasiRNAs probed in this study are in bold-lined boxes with their names indicated. The <italic>TAS1</italic> loci-derived siR255 and siR255-like species are in dark boxes. <italic>TAS1a</italic>- and <italic>TAS1b</italic>-derived siRNAs D1(+) species differ only at 5&#x02032;-terminal nucleotide (U and A, respectively).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn590f1"/></fig></p><p>Four <italic>Arabidopsis TAS</italic> families with up to three distinct loci have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). <italic>TAS1</italic> and <italic>TAS2</italic> tasiRNAs are initiated by miR173, <italic>TAS3</italic> ones by miR390 and <italic>TAS4</italic> ones by miR828 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The <italic>TAS3</italic> family is special in that the two functional tasiRNAs are encoded upstream of the miR390 cleavage site and that a second miR390 target site further upstream is not cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The two miRNA target sites are thought to delimit the region of <italic>TAS3</italic> primary transcripts converted into dsRNA. Although target mRNAs for all four TAS families have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), biological functions have only been elucidated for <italic>TAS3</italic>-tasiRNAs that target the auxin-response factor genes <italic>ARF3</italic> and <italic>ARF4</italic> to control the juvenile-to-adult transition in leaf development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence indicates that the AGO7 protein specifically associates with miR390 to target the <italic>TAS3a</italic> transcript and thereby initiate tasiRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, only the <italic>TAS3</italic> pathway genetically requires <italic>AGO7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and the biogenesis of tasiRNAs of other <italic>TAS</italic> families appear to be initiated by AGO1-RISC that associates with most miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). DRB4, a dsRNA binding (DRB) protein, has been implicated in tasiRNA biogenesis as a DCL4-binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, DRB4-deficient mutants still accumulate substantial levels of 21 nt tasiRNAs from <italic>TAS1, TAS2 and TAS3</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>), suggesting that DCL4 does not absolutely require DRB4 for processing dsRNA precursors of tasiRNAs or that DRB4 acts downstream of the processing step.</p><p>Certain protein coding genes give rise to siRNAs that depend on RDR6 for their production. Interestingly, many of these genes are targets of tasiRNAs and, in some cases, of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). A common feature of such secondary siRNA-generating loci is that they are targeted by more than one small RNA. It has been proposed that successive amplification of secondary siRNAs by an RDR6-/DCL4-dependent mechanism might function to achieve efficient silencing of paralogous genes in expanding gene families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The same mechanism involving RDR6 and DCL4 appears to generate secondary siRNAs from silenced transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), which contribute to amplification and cell-to-cell spread of silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>By analogy, RDR6-dependent production of secondary siRNAs might contribute to anti-viral defense based on RNA silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Indeed, RDR6 was implicated in defense against an RNA cucumovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and in exclusion of an RNA potexvirus from the shoot apical meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is a pararetrovirus with a dsDNA genome and a polycistronic pregenomic RNA with seven genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The transactivator/viroplasmin (TAV) is produced from a subgenomic monocistronic CaMV RNA, and this protein activates polycistronic translation of the remaining six proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). TAV is multifunctional and equipped with the nuclear targeting and export signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), as well as ssRNA- and dsRNA- and protein-binding domains. It forms large cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, within which virus particles accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). TAV also determines symptom severity and host range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and, as a transgene, causes virus-like symptoms and late flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Recently it was shown to act as a suppressor of transgene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>We and others have previously reported that four <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DCL proteins generate CaMV-derived siRNAs, 21, 22 and 24 nt in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The relative contribution of DCL4, known to restrict RNA virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) was minor, however, and RDR6 was not required for CaMV siRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), suggesting that <italic>RDR6-/DCL4</italic>-dependent amplification of viral secondary siRNAs is suppressed.</p><p>Here we report that CaMV infection interferes with endogenous <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent tasiRNA and secondary siRNA pathways and demonstrate that TAV is solely responsible for this interference. Furthermore our work uncovers novel mechanistic features of tasiRNA-generating pathways and suggests feedback regulation of tasiRNA levels through activation of the tasiRNA biogenesis machinery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant and transgenic lines</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DCL- and RDR-deficient mutant lines <italic>dcl2-5, dcl3-1, dcl4-2, dcl23, dcl34, dcl234, rdr6-15</italic> and <italic>rdr2-1</italic> (all in Col-0 background) used in this study were described previously (35 and references therein).

Total RNA was prepared by the Trizol method as described above and further purified using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, AG, Hombrechtikon, Zurich, Switzerland) following the manufacturer's recommendations.

To test whether the CaMV TAV protein implicated in silencing suppression contributes to this effect, we analyzed two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenic lines that constitutively express TAV proteins from the CaMV strains CM1841 and D4 (lines CM-2 and D4-2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Both lines accumulate comparable levels of TAV, but the CM1841 TAV plants develop extensive chlorotic symptoms, whereas the D4 plants are nearly symptom-less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Blot hybridization analysis of total plant RNA using the siR255-specific probe showed that both transgenic lines accumulate, in addition to the 21-nt siR255, several precursors ranging in size from &#x0223c;35 to &#x0223c;600 nt. The sizes and relative abundances of these RNAs were very similar in both transgenic lines as well as in control Col-0 (wt) plants infected with CaMV strain CM1841. Moreover, CaMV infection of the TAV transgenic lines did not alter these patterns of RNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, these long precursors of siR255 are also present in non-infected wt plants, albeit at very low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and data not shown). The levels of siR255 normalized for the U6 loading control were reduced to 55% of the wild-type levels in CaMV-infected plants. Of the two TAV transgenic lines, significant reduction in siR255 levels was observed only in the D4 line (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The stronger interference with siR255 biogenesis in the D4 line than in the CM1841 line was also apparent from a higher ratio of the siR255 precursors (a total of several RNAs ranging from &#x0223c;35 to &#x0223c;600 nt) to the 21 nt siR255 product, compared to the CM1841 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, see the imbedded table).

Note that these precursors were much less abundant in CaMV-infected plants than in the TAV transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast to <italic>TAS1</italic> and <italic>TAS2</italic>, the <italic>TAS3a</italic> tasiRNA precursors were more abundant in the D4 line than in the CM1841 line and were inversely correlated in abundance with their mature tasiRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

This suggests that TAV expression in the D4 line exerts strong and comparable effects on both the miR173- and the miR390-initiated tasiRNA biogenesis, whereas TAV expression in the CM1841 line has generally weaker effects on both but a more pronounced effect on the miR173-initiated tasiRNA biogenesis.</p><p>The miR828-initiated tasiRNAs derived from the single <italic>TAS4</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) are of very low abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

Thus, CaMV infection and TAV expression both interfere with the <italic>TAS4</italic> biogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>CaMV infection and TAV expression upregulate both tasiRNA targets and components of tasiRNA biogenesis</title><p>Our finding that TAV expression dramatically increased the accumulation of tasiRNA precursors and the ratio of precursors to tasiRNA suggests that TAV impairs processing of RDR6-dependent dsRNA to tasiRNA by DCL4. However, the levels of tasiRNAs themselves are not drastically reduced in CaMV-infected or TAV D4 plants, and, in some samples of the CM1841 plants, are even slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This could be due to incomplete spatial and/or temporal overlap of viral infection (TAV protein production) and the tasiRNA biogenesis and activity pathways. Additionally, a feedback regulation may partially or fully restore normal levels of tasiRNAs. We therefore investigated if the action of tasiRNAs in knocking down their target gene transcripts is affected and whether the genes mediating tasiRNA biogenesis are regulated in CaMV-infected and TAV transgenic plants. Using the ATH1 whole-genome microarray, we profiled total RNA from CaMV-infected versus mock-inoculated wt (Col-0) and tasiRNA-deficient <italic>dcl234</italic> plants (harvested 1 month post-inoculation) as well as from non-infected transgenic versus wt (Col-0) plants harvested 15 days post-germination. Confirming the above time-course experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), the siR255 precursors were more abundant in the CM1841 than in the D4 line samples (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn590/DC1">Figure S2</ext-link>; note that, of the two independent, CM1841 TAV-expressing lines shown, CM-2 was profiled). Notably, the TAV transgene transcript levels were higher in the D4 line than in the two CM1841 lines CM-2 and CM-6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn590/DC1">Figure S2</ext-link>), which is consistent with slightly higher accumulation of TAV protein and its breakdown products in this D4 line (D4-2) compared to the CM1841 lines (38; and data not shown). The higher expression of TAV protein in the D4 line might account for the stronger negative impact on tasiRNA biogenesis in this line as inferred above from the dsRNA precursors/tasiRNA ratios. However we cannot exclude that 5% difference at the amino acid level between the two TAV proteins is responsible for the observed effects.</p><p>The microarray analysis showed that the key genes involved in tasiRNA biogenesis including <italic>DCL4</italic>, <italic>DRB4</italic> and <italic>AGO7</italic> were upregulated by both CaMV infection and TAV expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn590/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>), thus supporting the feedback regulation hypothesis.

In this system, the 21-nt primary siRNAs produced by <italic>DCL4</italic>-mediated processing of the GF-FG dsRNA are thought to target the GFP transcript for cleavage and degradation. The latter process triggers <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent production of secondary siRNAs from the P region of the GFP transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). The <italic>rdr6</italic> mutation introduced into the GFP &#x000d7; GF-FG line has been shown to eliminate the secondary siRNAs without affecting accumulation of primary siRNAs or GFP silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). CaMV infection of the GFP &#x000d7; GF-FG line did not result in re-appearance of GFP fluorescence under UV light (data not shown), indicating that GFP silencing was not suppressed. Consistent with the silenced GFP phenotype, RNA blot hybridization of total plant RNA with probes specific to the GF region showed that accumulation of primary siRNAs of both polarities was not reduced but rather slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). In contrast, accumulation of secondary siRNAs from the P region was substantially reduced during viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). These results suggest that CaMV infection selectively interferes with the biogenesis of <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent secondary siRNAs without any substantial effect on the production of primary siRNAs and their action in silencing GFP expression. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>CaMV infection interferes with the biogenesis of secondary siRNAs derived from the GFP transgene silenced by GF-FG dsRNA.

In the GF-FG transgene the inverted repeat of the GF region of the GFP coding sequence is equipped with an intron. The Pol II transcription generates a GF-FG transcript that folds back into perfect dsRNA. The latter is processed by DCL4 (and DCL3) into primary siRNAs (GF). These siRNAs target <italic>in trans</italic> a GFP mRNA transcribed from the GFP transgene for cleavage at multiple positions within the GF region. The 3&#x02032;-product of these cleavage events retaining an intact P region is converted by RDR6 into dsRNA. The resulting dsRNA is processed by DCL4 (and DCL3) into secondary siRNAs (P). The later step is selectively impaired by CaMV infection as inferred from the following experiment.(<bold>B</bold>) Total RNA from CaMV-infected (+) and mock-inoculated (&#x02013;) transgenic GF-FG X GFP line plants harvested 1 month post-inoculation were analyzed by RNA blot hybridization (15% PAGE). Membranes were successively hybridized with DNA oligo probes specific for sense and antisense siRNAs derived from the GF and P regions of the GFP coding sequence and U6 (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn590/DC1">Table S1</ext-link> for probe details).

This interference is associated with (i) overaccumulation of unprocessed, RDR6-dependent precursors of tasiRNAs; (ii) increased levels of some <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mRNAs normally silenced by tasiRNAs of four known <italic>TAS</italic> families; and (iii) upregulation of genes encoding DCL4, DRB4 and AGO7, which are involved in tasiRNA biogenesis. We also found that CaMV TAV interferes with RDR6-dependent secondary siRNA pathways. The latter finding is consistent with the ability of TAV to suppress amplicon transgene-induced silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) that depends on <italic>RDR6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Furthermore, CaMV siRNAs accumulating in infected plants are largely <italic>RDR6</italic>- and <italic>DCL4</italic>-independent (35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Taken together, these findings suggest that TAV suppresses silencing by preventing <italic>RDR6</italic>-/<italic>DCL4</italic>-dependent amplification of secondary siRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>TAV might act at the step of DCL4-mediated processing of RDR6-dependent dsRNA</title><p>The available evidence suggests that TAV impairs processing of RDR6-produced dsRNA to small RNAs. In the case of tasiRNAs, this is likely to occur in an RDR6/DCL4 processing center believed to recruit <italic>TAS</italic> transcripts targeted for cleavage by miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This processing center might also generate secondary siRNAs from some genes targeted by miRNAs or primary siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Exactly how TAV inhibits processing is not known. One possibility, which we favor, is that TAV interacts with a protein or proteins in the processing center downstream of RDR6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Potential targets include dsRNA-binding proteins, such as DRB4, which is known to interact with DCL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), or DCL4 itself. Another possibility, which is not mutually exclusive, is that TAV binds dsRNA precursors and thereby inhibits their processing to siRNAs by DCL4. While this hypothesis is consistent with the presence of a conserved dsRNA-binding motif in TAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), we have not been able to detect binding of TAV to either long dsRNA and short RNA duplexes (Shivaprasad,P.V. and Burgyan,J., unpublished data) using a sensitive assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Moreover, several lines of evidence suggest that binding of TAV to dsRNAs <italic>per se</italic> is not sufficient to block downstream processing. Thus, we found that, in the presence of TAV, DCLs can still efficiently process non-RDR-derived dsRNAs such as a fold-back structure of the GF-FG transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Similarly, <italic>RDR6</italic>-/<italic>RDR2</italic>-independent primary CaMV siRNAs presumably processed from dsRNAs derived from sense and antisense viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) were not affected by TAV overexpression in transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In future studies, it will be interesting to analyze how TAV-mediated suppression selectively impairs processing of RDR6 products and identify which DCL4 co-factor could be responsible for selective action of DCL4 on such dsRNA substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Novel features of tasiRNA pathways</title><p>Our functional characterization of TAV uncovered novel mechanistic and regulatory features of tasiRNA-generating pathways. RDR6-dependent, potentially double-stranded precursors of tasiRNAs, which overaccumulated in the presence of TAV, had been previously inferred from small RNA cloning and genetic evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) but escaped detection so far. Using <italic>dcl</italic> mutants and RNA blot hybridization analysis, we verified that these precursors are preferentially processed by DCL4 and identified intermediates (and/or byproducts) of this processing. Notably, the estimated sizes of the longest (full-length) <italic>TAS1</italic>-derived RDR6-dependent sense and antisense RNAs fall into a range of 450&#x02013;600 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), suggesting that complete products of miR173-guided cleavage of <italic>TAS1</italic> transcripts are converted by RDR6 into dsRNA. It was proposed that <italic>TAS1</italic>- and <italic>TAS2</italic>-derived dsRNAs are preferentially processed from the miRNA cleavage site terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Unexpectedly, we discovered that some abundant, <italic>DCL4</italic>-dependent, shorter-than-full-length <italic>TAS1</italic> sense and antisense RNAs retain the miR173-cleavage site terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This might be due to processing of <italic>TAS1</italic> dsRNA precursors from the opposite side. Alternatively, at a first round of tasiRNA biogenesis, certain antisense tasiRNAs produced from the full-length dsRNAs might target the miR173-cleaved ss<italic>TAS</italic> transcript and thus create secondary, shorter substrates for RDR6. Such a two hit trigger mechanism has been proposed for biogenesis of <italic>TAS3</italic>-derived tasiRNAs as well as for secondary siRNAs derived from some <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Our work in progress aims to precisely map the termini of the full-length precursors of tasiRNAs and their derivatives described here, which should lead to new insight in the biogenesis of tasiRNAs and other RDR6-dependent siRNAs.</p><p>Our transcriptome analysis suggests that the tasiRNA pathway is subject to negative auto-regulation. TAV impairs processing of tasiRNAs and secondary siRNAs, leading to increased accumulation of their target transcripts. But it also upregulates genes coding for proteins that mediate siRNA biogenesis, including <italic>DCL4, DRB4</italic> and <italic>AGO7</italic>. Together with the rather modest effects of TAV expression on target genes, this implies that deficiencies in the tasiRNA pathway can lead to a compensatory activation of the key pathway components that partially or fully restores tasiRNAs and target mRNA levels. This hypothesis explains the difference observed for the two distinct TAV transgenic lines, one of which (D4) accumulating higher levels of target mRNAs and lower levels of tasiRNAs than the other (CM1841), at least for <italic>TAS1</italic>, <italic>TAS2</italic> and <italic>TAS3</italic> pathways (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and S2, respectively). This would imply more efficient, feedback-mediated restoration of the tasiRNA and mRNA target levels in the CM1841 line than in the D4 line. Nonetheless in both lines, as a net effect of the ongoing TAV-mediated inhibition of tasiRNA processing and the feedback upregulation of tasiRNA biogenesis, the unprocessed precursors of <italic>TAS1</italic>, <italic>TAS2</italic> and <italic>TAS3</italic> tasiRNAs overaccumulate. The miRNA pathway genes <italic>DCL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and <italic>AGO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) are known to be auto-regulated. Our study supports the view that negative feedback regulation is a general feature of small RNA silencing pathways in plants. The mechanism of feedback regulation of the tasiRNA pathway remains to be investigated. Like in the case of miRNA-mediated regulation of <italic>DCL1</italic> and <italic>AGO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), the mRNAs of <italic>DCL4, DRB4 and AGO7</italic> may be targeted by some tasiRNAs and/or secondary siRNAs, the biogenesis of which is mediated by the DCL4, DRB4 and AGO7 proteins. Therefore, TAV-mediated interference with the biogenesis of such siRNAs would elevate the levels of the respective mRNAs. To our knowledge, no RDR6-dependent siRNA cognate to <italic>DCL4</italic>, <italic>DRB4</italic> or <italic>AGO7</italic> sequences have been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>TAV might suppress RNA-silencing based antiviral defense</title><p>Virus infection involves a complex interplay of host defense mechanisms and counter-defense mechanisms of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). We believe that one function of TAV is to suppress host defense mechanisms concerned with restricting virus spread by systemic RNA silencing. RDR6-/DCL4-dependent mechanisms generating secondary siRNAs from silenced transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and endogenous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), which are inhibited by TAV, appear to contribute to the amplification and spread of transgene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). RDR6 is required for exclusion of potato virus X from shoot apical meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and defense against cucumber mosaic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We propose that by interfering with the amplification of CaMV secondary siRNAs, TAV reduces the effectiveness of systemic silencing. This is consistent with the finding that secondary viral siRNAs do not appear to accumulate in CaMV-infected tissues: most CaMV siRNAs are <italic>RDR6</italic>-independent (35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), while DCL4, which restricts RNA-virus infection through production of 21-nt viral siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), makes only a minor contribution to production of CaMV siRNAs (35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>Many viruses overcome host defenses by expressing viral proteins that suppress RNA silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Overexpression of these suppressors in transgenic plants often results in developmental abnormalities that result from the interference of these proteins with the miRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Thus, some abnormalities associated with virus infection may be &#x02018;collateral&#x02019; effects of the viruses counter-defense to RNA silencing. Finally, the functional redundancy of components of the miRNA pathway and their negative auto-regulation by miRNAs might be additional layers of host defense. We assume that a similar interplay between host and virus defenses affects tasiRNA and other secondary siRNA pathways targeted by TAV. While our data show that TAV does not generally affect miRNA pathways, overexpression of TAV in transgenic plants leads to various abnormalities including delayed flowering (32,33,38; and this study) that appear to be correlated with inhibition of tasiRNA processing. Interestingly, recent studies using the GF-FG &#x000d7; GFP transgenic line established that suppressor proteins of two RNA viruses, the potyvirus HC-Pro and the carmovirus P38, interfere with the accumulation of secondary, but not primary, GFP siRNAs and endogenous <italic>TAS1</italic>-derived tasiRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Feedback regulation in the <italic>TAS</italic> pathway may well explain conflicting findings that HC-Pro transgene expression does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) or does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) affect accumulation of <italic>TAS1</italic> tasiRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Endnote</title><p>While the manuscript of this paper was under review, Haas <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) reported that transgene expression of TAV protein from the CaMV Cabb B-JI strain suppresses silencing through physical interaction with DRB4 protein, which leads to reduction of siR255 levels. They also reported that siR255 precursors accumulate in a <italic>drb4</italic> mutant line. Thus, their work confirms our findings for the CaMV D4 TAV line and further suggests that TAV binding to DRB4 might interfere with DCL4-DRB4 co-operation in processing tasiRNAs, which would in turn trigger the feedback upregulation of tasiRNA biogenesis components including <italic>DCL4, AGO7</italic> and <italic>DRB4</italic> itself as reported here.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn590/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Indo-Swiss Collaboration in Biotechnology and Swiss National Science Foundation.
