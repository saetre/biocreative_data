The level of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is known to be significantly elevated in the maternal plasma at preterm birth. Although, CRH, CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP), CRH-receptor 1 (CRH-R1) and CRH-R2 have been identified both at mRNA and protein level in human placenta, deciduas, fetal membranes, endometrium and myometrium, no corresponding information is yet available on cervix. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the levels of the mRNA species coding for CRH, CRH-BP, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 in human cervical tissue and myometrium at preterm and term labor and not in labor as well as in the non-pregnant state, and to localize the corresponding proteins employing immunohistochemical analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Cervical, isthmic and fundal (from non-pregnant subjects only) biopsies were taken from 67 women. Subjects were divided in 5 groups: preterm labor (14), preterm not in labor (7), term labor (18), term not in labor (21) and non-pregnant (7). Real-time RT-PCR was employed for quantification of mRNA levels and the corresponding proteins were localized by immunohistochemical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The levels of CRH-BP, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 mRNA in the pregnant tissues were lower than those in non-pregnant subjects. No significant differences were observed between preterm and term groups. CRH-BP and CRH-R2 mRNA and the corresponding proteins were present at lower levels in the laboring cervix than in the non-laboring cervix, irrespective of gestational age. In most of the samples, with the exception of four myometrial biopsies the level of CRH mRNA was below the limit of detection. All of these proteins could be detected and localized in the cervix and the myometrium by immunohistochemical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Expression of CRH-BP, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 in uterine tissues is down-regulated during pregnancy. The most pronounced down-regulation of CRH-BP and CRH-R2 occurred in laboring cervix, irrespective the length of gestation. The detection of substantial expression of the CRH and its receptor proteins, as well as receptor mRNA in the cervix suggests that the cervix may be a target for CRH action. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of CRH in cervical ripening.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Despite the existence of strategies for treatment, the frequency of PTB has not changed significantly during the past three decades and the mechanisms underlying the initiation of both preterm and term labor remain largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To date, research and treatment of PTB has focused on myometrial contractions but for successful preterm delivery these contractions must be coordinated with a softening of the cervix. Cervical softening involves intensive remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), with extensive changes in concentration and composition of collagens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Cytokines and several other mediators, including estrogen, progesterone, nitric oxide and prostaglandins, participate in the remodeling of extracellular matrix and ripening of the human cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This process can be regarded as an inflammatory reaction associated with elevated levels of cytokines at the time of both preterm and time labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is the principal regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis has been of interest in connection with labor since Liggins induced premature parturition in sheep with corticotropin and cortisol infusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. CRH is produced by fetomaternal tissues and secreted into the maternal circulation, so that during pregnancy the maternal plasma levels of this hormone increase while of the corresponding binding protein (CRH-BP) is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It has been suggested a "placental clock" model, which determines the duration of gestation and the timing of parturition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Patients at risk for preterm birth have significantly elevated plasma levels of CRH and lower CRH-BP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, usefulness of maternal plasma CRH as a predictor of preterm birth is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>CRH, CRH-BP and the receptors for CRH, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2, together with the corresponding proteins are expressed in human placenta, deciduas, fetal membranes, endometrium and myometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no studies of a similar nature have been performed on human cervical tissue. Accordingly, our present aims were to compare the levels of expression of CRH, CRH-BP, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 in human cervical tissue and myometrium in preterm and term labor and not in labor as well as in the non-pregnant state, and to localize the corresponding proteins employing immunohistochemical analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Material</title><p>The 67 women included in this study were divided into 5 study groups. The two preterm groups consisted of 14 women undergoing preterm labor (PTL) and 7 at preterm not in labor (PTnotL), delivered by caesarean section prior to the onset of labor. Premature delivery was defined as delivery before the 37<sup>th </sup>week of gestation. The two term groups included 18 women undergoing term labor (TL) and 21 at term not in labor caesarean section (TnotL). The labor groups were in active labor and demonstrated a ripe cervix, with dilatation more than 4 cm. They were either delivered vaginally or by emergency caesarean section due to malpresentation (at preterm) or due to threatening fetal asphyxia (at term). In all patients delivered by caesarean section, the assessment of cervical dilatation was established immediately before surgery. Women not in labor had unripe cervices (with a Bishop score of &#x0003c;5 points) and were delivered by caesarean section prior to the onset of labor. The preterm indications were suspected ablatio or intra-uterine growth retardation and the term indications were breech presentation, humanitarian or disproportion.</p><p>None of the women included in the study suffered from pre-eclampsia, diabetes or other systemic disease, nor did any of our subjects demonstrate clinical signs of infection in connection with parturition or during postpartal period.</p><p>There were no significant differences between these four groups with respect to maternal age, parity, previous preterm births and caesarean sections (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the study groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Parameter</td><td align="left">Preterm labor (PTL)</td><td align="left">Term labor (TL)</td><td align="left">Preterm not in labor (PTnotL)</td><td align="left">Term not in labor (TnotL)</td><td align="left">Non-pregnant (NP)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Number of subjects</td><td align="left">14</td><td align="left">18</td><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">21</td><td align="left">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Age (median, range)</td><td align="left">27.5 (18&#x02013;37)</td><td align="left">28.5 (20&#x02013;37)</td><td align="left">32 (27&#x02013;35)</td><td align="left">32 (25&#x02013;42)</td><td align="left">45 (37&#x02013;49)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Parity (median, range)</td><td align="left">1 (0&#x02013;3)</td><td align="left">1 (0&#x02013;2)</td><td align="left">1 (0&#x02013;2)</td><td align="left">1 (0&#x02013;3)</td><td align="left">1 (0&#x02013;3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Previous preterm births in the group</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Previous C/S (median, range)</td><td align="left">0 (0&#x02013;1)</td><td align="left">0 (0&#x02013;1)</td><td align="left">0 (0&#x02013;0)</td><td align="left">0 (0&#x02013;2)</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Gestational age in days (median, range)</td><td align="left">237.5 (184&#x02013;255)</td><td align="left">278 (259&#x02013;292)</td><td align="left">193 (183&#x02013;256)</td><td align="left">270 (259&#x02013;278)</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Treatment with corticosteroids</td><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The fifth group consisted of 7 non-pregnant (NP) premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for benign gynecological conditions such as menorrhagia or dysmenorrhea (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Serial cryostat sections 14 &#x003bc;m thick were air-dried.</p><p>Tissue sections were stained employing the avidin-biotinylated (ABC)-peroxidase complex method. When analyzed, they were rewashed in PBS for three times five minutes. The endogenous peroxidase activity was eliminated by pre-treatment with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 minutes followed by washing in PBS/BSA (0,05%). The slides were incubated overnight with primary rabbit (CRH) or goat (CRH-BP, CRH-R1, CRH-R2) polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Heidelberg, Germany) directed towards the protein indicated. The dilutions employed for paraffin-embedded sections were as follows: CRH, 1:25 (sc-10718); CRH-BP, 1:100 (sc-1822); CRH-R1, 1:100 (sc-12381); and CRH-R2, 1:50 (sc-1826). In the case of air-dried sections, the antibodies towards CRH were diluted 1:400 and those against CRH-BP 1:800. Subsequently, the sections were washed in PBS/BSA and afterwards incubated with horse anti-goat or horse anti-rabbit the secondary antibody diluted in blocking sera for 30 min. The sections were washed with PBS/BSA, incubated with ABC-complex for 30 minutes, and then rewashed in PBS/BSA. The reaction was developed using the DAB-kit (diaminobenzidine) from Vector (Burlingame, CA, USA). The slides were then rinsed in distilled water. Counterstaining was performed in 10% Mayer's Haematoxylin solution for 3&#x02013;4 minutes, thereafter the sections were washed in water. Control sections were stained in the same manner, but with omission of the primary antibody. The slides were finally mounted with glycerolgelatin.

Of course, we cannot totally exclude the presence of undetectably low levels of CRH mRNA in the cervix and this tissue did stain positively for the CRH protein in connection with our immunohistochemical analysis. However, it appears likely that this cervical CRH originates from the placenta, which is the main source of this protein in reproductive tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In present investigation the levels of CRH-BP, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 mRNA were found to be lower in the pregnant cervix and corpus than in the corresponding tissues from women who were not pregnant. Again, this finding is in line with earlier reports that CRH-R1 is down-regulated in the pregnant in comparison to the non-pregnant myometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, there was a discrepancy between these two previous studies: Stevens and coworkers observed up-regulation of CRH-R1 at the time of labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], whereas, as was also the case in our study, Rodriguez-Linares et al found no such significant up-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This discrepancy might be due to the use of different methodologies: Stevens et al employed semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Rodriguez-Linares and coworkers competitive RT-PCR and we used real-time RT-PCR, which allows more exact quantitation with high fidelity and identity of the product. The down-regulation of CRH-BP, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 in the pregnant uterus could be related to the elevated levels of CRH in maternal plasma or, possibly, less CRH effect is needed in pregnancy than in a non-pregnant state. However, our immunohistochemical analysis revealed no clear reduction in the levels of the CRH-BP, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 proteins in connection with pregnancy, which indicates that there may be no change in physiological function.</p><p>There has been much speculation concerning the role of CRH in connection to preterm labor. Here, we observed no differences between preterm and term laboring groups, but the level of CRH-R1 mRNA was significantly higher in preterm not in labor compared to term not in labor cervix. However, eight of our preterm patients received corticosteroid treatment and earlier studies have shown that administration of exogenous corticosteroid enhances the level of maternal plasma CRH, as well as the intensity of immunohistochemical staining for CRH in the placenta and fetal membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, in order to ascertain whether this treatment influenced our findings, the data was re-analyzed following elimination of the women being treated. The only change was that there were no longer any significant differences between all respective preterm and term groups (data not shown), which indicates that the difference in cervical CRH-R1 mRNA levels between women undergoing preterm and term caesarean section prior to labor was due to corticosteroid treatment. It would have been preferable from a scientific point of view to conduct a similar study on a large number of patients not receiving corticosteroid treatment, but current obstetric practice in Sweden and other Western countries makes it extremely difficult to obtain samples from patients in preterm labor who have not received exogenous corticosteroids.</p><p>Since there appeared to be no essential differences between preterm and term groups, we decided to analyze the study groups irrespective of gestational age. This analysis revealed down-regulation of the levels of both CRH-R2 and CRH-BP mRNA in the cervix in connection with labor. This result, in combination with our previous findings that changes in cytokine and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase levels occur in association with labor irrespective of the length of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], indicate that the process of preterm cervical ripening is similar to the one that occurs at term. This decrease in cervical CRH-BP, both at the mRNA and protein levels at the time of labor is associated with a similar decrease in the maternal plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], which means that more CRH is bioavailable in cervix and can act on the receptors there.</p><p>The down-regulation of CRH-R2 in the cervix and myometrium both at mRNA and protein levels at the time of labor is in some respects to the findings by Jirecek and coworkers that expression of the CRH-R2 protein in the myometrium is markedly lower in association with labor at term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, these other investigators detected no differences in the levels of this protein between patients in preterm labor and not in labor, whereas we report here the same down-regulation tendency at mRNA levels irrespective of gestational age. On the other hand, we performed immunohistochemical analysis only in the term groups and have no data concerning levels of CRH-R2 protein in preterm groups. Similar down-regulation of this receptor has been described in animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and this phenomenon may be important for progression of normal labor. Since urocortins are the main ligands for CRH-R2 and play a role in human reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], it would be important to look for changes in the levels of these hormones in the human cervix during pregnancy and labor.</p><p>The detection of substantial expression of the CRH and its receptor proteins, as well as receptor mRNA in the cervix suggests that the cervix may be a target for CRH action. The down-regulation of CRH-R2 and CRH-BP, together with the most intense immunohistochemical staining for CRH-R1 in the cervix at the time of labor indicate that CRH may be involved in cervical ripening. No investigations concerning a possible effect of this hormone on the cervix have been published, but there are several mechanisms by which CRH could be involved in the cervical ripening: by up-regulating expression of NOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], enhancing the production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>and PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] or stimulating secretion of MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, there are controversial findings concerning the role of CRH in the release of cytokines in different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Earlier studies from our group have identified fetal fibronectine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], MMP-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and Syndican-1 and -3 (unpublished data) in the cervical epithelium. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the presence of CRH in the cervical epithelium with the highest levels at term not in labor. All these findings support the proposal that the cervical epithelium plays a significant role in the signaling processes involved in cervical ripening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CRH-BP, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 mRNA and the corresponding proteins are expressed in the human cervix. The CRH protein is also detected in the cervical tissue, which indicates that the cervix is a target for the action of this hormone. In comparison to the non-pregnant state, CRH-BP, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 are all down-regulated in the uterine tissues in connection with pregnancy. The most pronounced down-regulation of CRH-BP and CRH-R2 occurs in the cervix during labor, irrespective of gestational age. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of CRH in the process of cervical ripening.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AK participated in designing this study, performed real-time PCR, statistical analyses, interpretation of data and drafted the manuscript.
