To better understand the functions of human PIF1, we investigated biochemical properties of this protein. Analysis of single-stranded (ss) DNA-dependent ATPase activity revealed nonstructural ssDNA to greatly stimulate ATPase activity due to a high affinity for PIF1, even though PIF1 preferentially unwinds forked substrates. This suggests that PIF1 needs a ssDNA region for loading and a forked structure for translocation entrance into a double strand region. Deletion analysis demonstrated novel functions of a unique N-terminal portion, named the PIF1 N-terminal (PINT) domain. When the PINT domain was truncated, apparent affinity for ssDNA and unwinding activity were much reduced, even though the maximum velocity of ATPase activity and <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for ATP were not affected. We suggest that the PINT domain contributes to enhancing the interaction with ssDNA through intrinsic binding activity. In addition, we found DNA strand-annealing activity, also residing in the PINT domain. Notably, the unwinding and annealing activities were inhibited by replication protein A. These results suggest that the functions of PIF1 might be restricted with particular situations and DNA structures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Helicases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the unwinding of DNA duplexes using ATP as their energy source. They therefore play vital roles in nearly all DNA metabolic processes, including DNA replication, recombination and repair. The PIF1 subfamily of 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10">1&#x02013;10</xref>) belongs to the SFI superfamily, conserved in diverse organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>Sc</italic>), <italic>Sc</italic>Pif1 was originally identified because of its involvement in recombination of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Dysfunction of <italic>Sc</italic>Pif1 leads to mitochondrial genetic instability due to spontaneous oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>), and induces mtDNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). <italic>Sc</italic>Pif1p has not only mitochondrial targeting but also nuclear targeting signals and therefore is localized in both the mitochondria and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Nuclear <italic>Sc</italic>Pif1p has multiple functions. When it is over-produced, telomeres become shorter, while they elongate when it is eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In the absence of nuclear <italic>Sc</italic>Pif1, gross chromosome rearrangement is also increased, and healing of double-stranded broken ends via telomere addition increases &#x0223c;200- to 1000-fold. These data suggest a negative regulatory role of <italic>Sc</italic>Pif1 in telomere metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">18&#x02013;24</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Sc</italic>Pif1 catalytically inhibits telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Other genetic data suggest that <italic>Sc</italic>Pif1 plays roles in Okazaki fragment processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), pausing of replication progression at ribosomal DNA loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and unwinding of hemicatenans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> encodes a PIF1 homolog, Pfh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) which is required for cell cycle progression in late <italic>S</italic>-phase and for appropriate responses to DNA damage agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). It is also implicated in lagging strand DNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Previous biochemical studies of human PIF1 were performed using N-terminal-truncated forms of PIF1, containing only the conserved helicase motifs, located in the C-terminus, since it earlier proved impossible to obtain purified full-length human PIF1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, we found that the N-terminal region of human PIF1, named here as the PIF1 N-terminal (PINT) domain, is well conserved in the PIF1 family, suggesting a possible functional role. Here, we established a method to purify full-length human PIF1 protein and provided the first evidence that the PINT domain has crucial functions in this enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The nucleotide sequence of the 5&#x02032;-end of human PIF1 cDNA was obtained by 5&#x02032;-rapid amplification of cDNA ends.

They are presumed to use the hydrolysis of ATP to translocate to ssDNA and to subsequently break the hydrogen bonds of duplex DNA.

Among these, M13 mp18 ssDNA proved to strongly and dsDNA to poorly stimulate ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).

These results supported our conclusion that the predominant requirement for stimulation of ATPase is nonstructural ssDNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of ATPase activity of PIF1C, a mutant lacking the PINT domain</title><p>We noted that the <italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub> value for ssDNA of PIF1 was in line with one report for <italic>Sc</italic>Pif1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), but significantly lower than that for human PIF1 with a N-terminal truncated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). We consider that the difference could be attributed to the missing function of the PINT domain. To test this possibility, we examined ATPase activity of PIF1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), and also tested PIF1N as a control. First, we confirmed no ATPase activity of PIF1N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), as expected from the lack of any ATPase motifs. When M13 mp7 ssDNA was titrated in the reaction with PIF1C, we detected similar levels of maximum ATPase activity at higher concentrations of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), suggesting that the helicase domain is sufficient to express ATPase activity. However, the required concentrations of ssDNA to achieve maximal activity were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A inset). The calculated <italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub> value, 8.7 &#x003bc;M (in nucleotides) for M13 mp7 ssDNAs with PIF1C was more than 20 times higher than that for PIF1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).

We considered that the defect might be attributed to binding ability to ssDNA. To measure DNA binding of PIF1 and PIF1C directly, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using a oligonucleotide, d(AC)60 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) as a model substrate. It has been reported that this assay detects DNA&#x02013;protein complexes in yeast and human PIF1 in an ATP-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Binding reactions were carried out under the optimal ATPase assay conditions, then products were loaded on gels as described in the Materials and methods section.

The apparent affinity was increased to about 0.3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). To determine whether the effect of ATP is caused by binding or hydrolysis, titration experiments were carried out omitting MgCl<sub>2</sub> to prevent hydrolysis of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Under this condition, the ATPase activity was under the background level (data not shown), suggesting that, even though trace amounts of Mg ions were present as contaminants of chemicals, the contribution was negligible. The result clearly demonstrated the binding curves to be identical to that under standard assay conditions containing ATP and MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), suggesting that ATP binding itself affected the interaction between ssDNA and the helicase domain.</p></sec><sec><title>ssDNA binding activity of the PIF1N</title><p>Our results suggested that the PINT domain plays a role in modulating the ssDNA binding activity of the helicase domain. Therefore, we carried out the same binding assays with PIF1N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

This could be due to more than one protein molecule binding to the 60-mer oligonucleotide. To determine the minimal ssDNA size for binding of PIF1N, six different oligonucleotides in lengths ranging from 55 to 15 bases were subjected to binding assays. When the 55-mer was used as the substrate, the result was essentially identical to that for a 60-mer. However, further reduction of the length to 45-mer and 35-mer decreased the extent of multiple binding. With the 30-mer oligonucleotide, but not the 20-mer and 15-mer, a distinct band of the complex was observed. These results demonstrated that the minimal ssDNA size could be between 30 and 20 bases.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA strand annealing activity of PIF1, residing in the PINT domain</title><p>During helicase assays, we unexpectedly found that PIF1 possessed robust annealing activity. For detailed analysis, a forked substrate (1F:2L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) was denatured by heating at 100&#x000b0;C for 5 min, and then incubated with PIF1 under the conditions for the standard ATPase assay omitting ATP to avoid unwinding reactions. Titration of PIF1 showed about 50% of ssDNA could be annealed within 10 min when 46 nM PIF1 was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). To determine the region of PIF1 responsible for the annealing activity, PIF1C and PIF1N were tested for their ability to promote the reaction.

To avoid the effect of unwinding, titration of ATP was carried out in the absence of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The result demonstrated both PIF1 and PIF1N to be inhibited by ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Time course experiments demonstrated that, in the absence of ATP, PIF1 annealed up to 70% of ssDNA, whereas, in the presence of the optimal concentration of ATP (2 mM) for helicase activity, the annealed fraction reached only 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). The properties of PIF1 were same as those of PIF1N, 2 mM ATP also inhibiting annealing activity from 50% to 17% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). Importantly, the ATP-titration curve and time course with PIF1 were essentially identical to those for PIF1N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C&#x02013;E), suggesting that the properties are intrinsic to the PINT domain.</p><p>Further confirming this conclusion, we used completely complementary strands as a substrate.

To do this, first, we determined the optimal concentration of RPA for the substrate DNA binding by EMSA. The substrate, 3F:4L was used for the binding reactions at the final concentration of 0.35 nM. The results of titration of RPA are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A.

RPA was mixed with the forked substrate, 3F:4L, under the standard reaction conditions on ice, then PIF1 was introduced and incubation was performed at 30&#x000b0;C for 10 min. We found that RPA did not affect unwinding reactions at low concentrations &#x0003c;0.4 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, left panel), in which majority of the substrate was RPA-free (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). When the concentration of RPA reached 0.9 nM, at which almost all the oligonucleotides were occupied with RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), severe inhibition was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, left panel). At much higher concentrations of RPA, we observed unwinding products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, left panel). However, a control experiment without PIF1 revealed that the products detected at higher concentrations &#x0003e;1.8 nM of RPA were PIF1 independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, right panel). The quantified results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C demonstrate no difference in the two reactions at higher concentrations of RPA (&#x0003e;0.9 nM). These results suggest that RPA does not enhance, but rather inhibits, the helicase activity of PIF1.</p><p>To examine annealing activity in the presence of RPA, we also determined the optimal concentration of RPA for ssDNA binding. In the reactions, we used the same substrate as for the unwinding assay (3F:4L) at the final concentration of 0.35 nM, but after denaturation by heating. The assay detected only complexes with the labeled oligonucleotide 3F (55-mer), although another fragment, 4L (51-mer), was present. The results of titration of RPA are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D. When the concentration of RPA was increased to 0.9 nM, almost all the oligonucleotides 3F and probably 4L were occupied by at least one molecule of RPA.

We could establish intrinsic properties of the helicase domain and functional roles of the PINT domain.</p><p>Biochemical analysis of yeast PIF1 homologs has demonstrated that they preferentially unwind forked substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). We showed that the property is conserved in human PIF1. However, we found that forked substrates were not optimal with respect to stimulation of ATPase activity. Rather nonstructural ssDNA greatly stimulated ATPase activity. The finding that the <italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub> value for nonstructural ssDNA was lower than for other DNA molecules, including forked structures, suggested preferential binding of PIF1 to ssDNA. From these results, we suggest that PIF1 needs an ssDNA region for loading and a forked structure for entrance to the double strand region by translocation.</p><p>We present several lines of evidence that the enzymatic characters of PIF1C reflect the intrinsic properties of the helicase domain. First, PIF1C expressed ATPase activity to the level equivalent to full-length PIF1 (about 1000 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and also equivalent to that for yeast homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Second, full-length PIF1 and PIF1C both showed a similar preference for poly(purine&#x02013;pyrimidine) and polypyrimidine, but not polypurine, for stimulation of ATPase. This property is also conserved in yeast homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Third, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for ATP of full-length PIF1 and PIF1C were essentially identical. This is also in agreement with a previous report for N-terminal truncated PIF1, purified as a C-terminus GST-fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). These results suggest that the determined properties of PIF1C are intrinsic to the helicase domain, and could also exclude the possibility that the his-tag at the N-terminal of PIF1C interferes with activities of the helicase domain.</p><p>Interestingly, we noted a significant difference between PIF1 and PIF1C with regard to the required concentration of ssDNA for stimulation of ATPase activity. PIF1C needed a 20 times higher concentration and also exhibited much lower unwinding activity. The results suggest that the defects could be attributed to missing functions of the PINT domain. The difference in the <italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub> values could be due to lower binding affinity of the helicase domain for ssDNA. Consequently, we demonstrated ssDNA binding of PIF1 directly by EMSA. The apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value, 3 nM was in good agreement with the <italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub> value of 2 nM when expressed with reference to the oligonucleotide concentration, suggesting that this assay well reflected the functional interaction between ssDNA and PIF1. In this assay, as expected, we demonstrated lower affinity of PIF1C to ssDNA. We suggested that the defect in PIF1C could be due, at least in part, to lower binding affinity for ssDNA, and the PINT domain plays a role for increasing this affinity of the helicase domain. Notably, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value (10 nM) of PIF1C determined by EMSA was still 6 times lower than the <italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub> value (60 nM in oligonucleotides) for the ATPase assay. We consider the following possible explanations for the discrepancy. We found that PIF1C exhibited a much higher affinity for ssDNA without binding of ATP. With the EMSA, an ATP-free fraction of PIF1C could exist, even in the presence of ATP. Therefore, the results could be an overestimation, due to high affinity binding of the ATP-free fraction of PIF1C. Alternatively, the PINT domain could possess another function for enhancing activity of the helicase domain by modulating the mode of interaction with ssDNA. The higher affinity of PIF1C for ssDNA without binding of ATP could be intrinsic to the helicase domain. The results suggested that ATP modulated the binding mode with ssDNA. The higher affinity to ssDNA before binding of ATP is reduced by binding of ATP. The alteration must be alternatively repeated during turnover of reactions of ATPase. With the full-length PIF1, such alteration due to ATP binding was not detected, suggesting that the PINT domain somehow could suppress the alteration during turnover of ATPase reactions. In this study, we demonstrated that the PINT domain also possesses ssDNA binding activity. We suggest that its enhancement of the activities of the helicase domain is due, at least in part, to this ssDNA binding activity.</p><p>We unexpectedly found the PINT domain to further possess ssDNA annealing activity. Among the proteins handled in this study having ssDNA binding activity, including PIF1C, PIF1N and RPA, we could detect annealing activity only with PIF1N. We consider that the annealing activity could be mediated by ssDNA binding, although not attributable to the general effect of high affinity ssDNA binding. Annealing activity has been reported to be associated with the RecQ family helicase in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41 B42 B43 B44 B45">39&#x02013;45</xref>). While the RecQ family is distinct from PIF1 family, annealing activity shares similar properties in common. It is located outside of the conserved helicase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), is inhibited by RPA, and is ATP-independent or rather inhibited by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41 B42">39&#x02013;42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). We demonstrated that inhibition by ATP is not a consequence of the unwinding reaction, suggesting that it is an intrinsic property of the PINT domain.</p><p>At the present time, the biological significance of our findings cannot be readily assessed. Importantly, we showed that RPA inhibited unwinding and annealing reactions, suggesting that these functions of PIF1 might be restricted under particular situations in DNA metabolism. There is a marked difference from RecQ helicases, whose unwinding activity is proficient on RPA-coated ssDNA and stimulated by RPA, although annealing activity is suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41">39&#x02013;41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46 B47 B48">46&#x02013;48</xref>). Notably, unwinding activity of <italic>Sc</italic>Pif1 was stimulated by RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), but that of the fission yeast homolog, Pfh1, was inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) like human PIF1, suggesting that the outcomes in cells would differ. This could be related to the fact that budding yeast has another member of the PIF1 superfamily, Rrm3, but human and fission yeast have only one. Further analysis of the precise cellular roles of PIF1 should shed light on functions in maintenance of genetic stability.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn609/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Grants-in-Aid from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (to Y.M. and K.K.); 21st Century Center of Excellence Program from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (to K.K.); Health and Labour Science Research Grants (to K.K.); Grants-in-Aid for Cancer Research from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (to K.K.).
