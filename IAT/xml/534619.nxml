Most NER proteins are indispensable for repair. In contrast, the yeast Rad23 represents a class of accessory NER proteins, without which NER activity is reduced but not eliminated. In mammals, the complex of HR23B (Rad23 homolog) and XPC (yeast Rad4 homolog) has been suggested to function in the damage recognition step of NER. However, the precise function of Rad23 or HR23B in NER remains unknown. Recently, it was suggested that the primary function of RAD23 protein in NER is its stabilization of XPC protein. Here, we tested the significance of Rad23-mediated Rad4 stabilization in NER, and analyzed the repair and biochemical activities of purified yeast Rad23 protein. Cellular Rad4 was indeed stabilized by Rad23 in the absence of DNA damage. Persistent overexpression of Rad4 in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells, however, largely failed to complement the ultraviolet sensitivity of the mutant. Consistently, deficient NER in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts could not be complemented by purified Rad4 protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, partial complementation was observed with purified Rad23 protein. Specific complementation to the level of wild-type repair was achieved by adding purified Rad23 together with small amounts of Rad4 protein to <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts. Purified Rad23 protein was unable to bind to DNA, but stimulated the binding activity of purified Rad4 protein to <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-2-aminofluorene-damaged DNA. These results support two roles of Rad23 protein in NER: (i) its direct participation in the repair biochemistry, possibly due to its stimulatory activity on Rad4-mediated damage binding&#x0002f;recognition; and (ii) its stabilization of cellular Rad4 protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA is frequently damaged by many environmental agents. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an important mechanism for removing a wide spectrum of different DNA lesions. Many bulky DNA adducts are specifically repaired by NER in eukaryotes, such as <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) adducts, cisplatin intra-strand crosslinks, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts, and the major ultraviolet (UV) lesions cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4) photoproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c7">7</xref>). Therefore, NER constitutes a crucial defense mechanism against DNA damage-induced cytotoxicity, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Compromising NER activity will lead to increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, increased mutation frequency and a high risk of carcinogenesis, as exhibited by the human hereditary disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c8">8</xref>).</p><p>Cellular NER consists of two subpathways: global genome repair and transcription-coupled repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c10">10</xref>). Transcription-coupled NER is specific to the repair of actively transcribed genes and specifically involves at least RNA polymerase II, CSA and CSB. On the other hand, global genome NER is responsible for the repair of the untranscribed regions of the genome and the untranscribed strand of an actively expressed protein-coding gene. Conceptually, NER can be divided into five distinct biochemical steps: damage recognition, incision, excision, repair synthesis and DNA ligation. <italic>In vivo</italic> genetics and <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemistry with cell-free repair systems and purified NER proteins have contributed a great deal to the understanding of eukaryotic NER. <italic>In vitro</italic> NER systems established to date in eukaryotes specifically reflect the global genome repair subpathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c13">13</xref>). Two categories of NER proteins are known. Most of the NER proteins are indispensable for repair, such as the repair&#x0002f;transcription factor TFIIH, and the yeast Rad4 and Rad14, which corresponds to the human XPC and XPA, respectively. The second category of NER proteins plays accessory roles in repair, without which cells exhibit moderate rather than severe sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Rad23 is such an accessory NER protein in yeast. Its mammalian homologs are HR23A and HR23B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c14">14</xref>). Rad23 (HR23) strongly interacts with Rad4 (XPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c16">16</xref>). Some studies have suggested that the XPC&#x0002f;HR23B complex functions in the damage recognition step of NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c18">18</xref>). However, the role of HR23B in the complex-mediated damage binding&#x0002f;recognition is not known.</p><p>Yeast <italic>rad23</italic> deletion mutant cells are moderately sensitive to DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c19">19</xref>). Both transcription-coupled and global genomic NER in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells are significantly reduced, but not totally abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c20">20</xref>). Consistently, <italic>in vitro</italic> NER in <italic>rad23</italic> deletion mutant extracts is also deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c15">15</xref>). Clearly, proficient NER requires Rad23 function. Rad23 protein contains multiple functional domains: an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, a Rad4-interaction domain and two ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c23">23</xref>). The UBA domains are not required for NER activity of Rad23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c23">23</xref>). Thus, in addition to its role in NER, this protein most likely plays other functions in cells, such as the suggested cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c25">25</xref>). Consistent with multi-functionality of RAD23, knockout mice deleted of both the <italic>HR23A</italic> and the <italic>HR23B</italic> genes lead to embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c26">26</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that Rad23 interacts with the 26S proteasome and the UBL domain is required for this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c28">28</xref>). The 26S proteasome, consisting of a 20S core particle and two copies of a 19S regulatory complex, is a large protein complex involved in the degradation of proteins targeted by the ubiquitin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c29">29</xref>). It was further shown that the 19S regulatory complex negatively modulates NER in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c31">31</xref>). More recently, Lommel <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c32">32</xref>) found that Rad4 protein transiently accumulates following DNA damage and that Rad23 enhances Rad4 stability following UV radiation of yeast cells. It was suggested that Rad23 protects Rad4 from degradation by the proteasome in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c32">32</xref>). A similar XPC stabilization effect by HR23A&#x0002f;B was reported by Ng <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c26">26</xref>) most recently in cultured mouse cells even without UV radiation. These observations led Ng <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c26">26</xref>) to conclude that the primary function of RAD23 protein in NER is its stabilization of XPC protein.</p><p>To better understand the role of Rad23 protein in NER, we have used the yeast model system to test the significance of Rad23-mediated Rad4 stabilization in NER and further analyzed the repair and biochemical activities of purified Rad23 protein. In this report, we show that (i) decreased Rad4 stability is not the major cause of deficient NER in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells; (ii) Rad23 protein directly participates in NER; and (iii) Rad23 protein stimulates the binding activity of Rad4 on damaged DNA. These results support two roles of Rad23 protein in NER: its direct participation in the repair biochemistry, possibly due to its stimulatory activity on Rad4-mediated damage binding&#x0002f;recognition; and its stabilization of cellular Rad4 protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Purified yeast Rad2 protein was obtained from Enzymax (Lexington, KY), which was purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells overexpressing the yeast <italic>RAD2</italic> gene.

After washing the column with 10 ml of FPLC buffer A, bound Rad23 or Rad4 protein was eluted with a 30 ml linear gradient of 50&#x02013;500 mM KCl or 100&#x02013;500 mM KCl, respectively, in FPLC buffer A. Rad23 protein was eluted at &#x0223c;275 mM KCl, and Rad4 protein was eluted at &#x0223c;375 mM KCl in separate purifications. During purification, both silver staining of SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels and western blot analysis were used to identify Rad4 or Rad23 protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Rad4 protein is stabilized by Rad23 in yeast cells</title><p>It was reported that yeast Rad4 protein is unstable in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells following UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c32">32</xref>). To determine whether Rad23 is able to stabilize Rad4 protein in the absence of DNA damage, we examined the stability of Rad4 under normal growth conditions. The <italic>rad23</italic> deletion mutant cells were transformed with either a single plasmid expressing Rad4 or two plasmids expressing Rad4 and Rad23, respectively. To facilitate protein detection, Rad4 was tagged with His<sub>6</sub> and Rad23 was tagged with the HA epitope at the protein N-terminus. Both <italic>RAD4</italic> and <italic>RAD23</italic> genes were under the control of the yeast <italic>GAL1&#x0002f;10</italic> promoter. Gene expression from this promoter is suppressed by 2% glucose but induced by 2% galactose in the growth medium. Without induction, Rad4 and Rad23 expression from the plasmids were undetectable by western blot analysis in cell extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f1">1</xref>A, lanes 1 and 3). Following galactose induction of the yeast culture, both Rad4 and Rad23 proteins were readily detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f1">1</xref>A, lanes 2 and 4). The steady state level of Rad4, which reflects the balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation, was slightly lower in the absence of Rad23 (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f1">1</xref>A, lanes 2 and 4). To directly examine the stability of Rad4 protein in yeast cells, we first induced gene expression with galactose. Then, Rad4 expression or Rad4 and Rad23 expressions were turned off by transferring yeast cells back to the medium without galactose but containing 2% glucose. Aliquots of the culture were removed at various times for cell extract preparation. Finally, Rad4 protein in the cell extracts were determined by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f1">1</xref>B (lanes 2&#x02013;7), in the presence of Rad23 protein, &#x0223c;50% of Rad4 remained 5 h after turning off the gene expression from the <italic>GAL1&#x0002f;10</italic> promoter. In contrast, Rad4 protein became non-detectable 3 h after turning off the gene expression from the <italic>GAL1&#x0002f;10</italic> promoter in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f1">1</xref>B, lanes 8&#x02013;13). These results show that Rad23 stabilizes Rad4 in yeast cells. This Rad4 stabilization by Rad23 does not require exogenously induced DNA damage.</p><p>Since Rad4 forms a tight complex with Rad23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c36">36</xref>), it is possible that Rad4 protein alone may be intrinsically unstable, thus contributing to the quick disappearance of Rad4 in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells. To examine this possibility, we purified Rad4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f2">2</xref>A) and Rad23 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f2">2</xref>B) proteins separately. To ensure that our Rad23 preparation was absolutely devoid of Rad4, Rad23 was purified from <italic>rad4</italic> deletion mutant cells, following overexpression from pEGUh6-RAD23. We did not notice any abnormal instability of either Rad4 or Rad23 protein during purification. We then added the purified Rad4 alone or the purified Rad4 and Rad23 together to cell-free extracts of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells. Aliquots of the extracts were removed at various incubation times. The stability of the purified protein in the extracts was determined by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f2">2</xref>C and compared to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f1">1</xref>B, purified Rad4 was relatively stable in the yeast cell-free extracts with or without Rad23. It should be noted that the small protein tags used in these experiments did not significantly affect the protein function, based on the following observations. First, the tagged Rad4 and Rad23 fully complemented UV sensitivity of the respective mutant strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f3">3</xref>A) (data not shown). Second, the tagged Rad4 and Rad23 proteins also formed a protein complex, as indicated by their co-purification sequentially through Ni-affinity and Resource Q columns following their co-expression in yeast cells (data not shown). These results show that Rad4 protein is not associated with an intrinsic instability. Thus, the quick disappearance of Rad4 in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells is probably a result of active cellular protein degradation.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Rad4 overexpression on UV sensitivity of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells</title><p>Recently, Ng <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c26">26</xref>) concluded that the primary function of RAD23 in NER is to stabilize XPC protein (Rad4 homolog) in mammals. Since Rad23 indeed stabilizes Rad4, we then tested this possibility in yeast. Cells lacking Rad23 are sensitive to UV radiation due to deficient NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c19">19</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f3">3</xref>A). If the primary function of Rad23 is to stabilize Rad4, it is predicted that persistent overexpression of Rad4 protein should lead to complementation of the UV-sensitive phenotype of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells. The mutant cells were transformed with a <italic>RAD4</italic> overexpression plasmid under the control of the strong <italic>GAL1&#x0002f;10</italic> promoter. Rad4 overexpression was achieved by induction with 2% galactose in the culture medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f1">1</xref>A). Following Rad4 overexpression, the cells were irradiated with UV and grown in plates containing 2% galactose for continued Rad4 induction. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f3">3</xref>A, only a partial complementation for UV resistance was observed. The UV sensitivity of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells remained largely unaffected by the overexpressed Rad4 protein. The small enhancement of UV resistance was specific to Rad4 overexpression in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells, because this effect was not observed when Rad14 was overexpressed in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f3">3</xref>B), or when Rad4 was overexpressed in <italic>rad14</italic> mutant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f3">3</xref>C). Rad4 overexpression also had no effect on UV resistance of wild-type yeast cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f3">3</xref>A). These results are inconsistent with the notion that the primary function of Rad23 is to stabilize Rad4.</p></sec><sec><title>Rad23 protein directly participates in NER</title><p>To directly determine whether decreased Rad4 stability is the major cause of the deficient NER in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells, we performed NER assays in yeast cell-free extracts, using plasmid DNA containing AAF adducts. We have previously shown that under the conditions used, AAF DNA adducts are repaired specifically by the NER pathway in yeast cell-free extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c15">15</xref>). NER was monitored by radiolabeling the repair patch during DNA repair synthesis.</p><p>Consistent with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c15">15</xref>), NER was deficient in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f4">4</xref>A, lane 2), as compared to the proficient repair in wild-type cell extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f4">4</xref>A, lane 1). We then attempted to complement the deficient repair in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts with purified Rad4 and Rad23 proteins. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f4">4</xref>A (lanes 3&#x02013;6), purified Rad4 was unable to complement deficient NER of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant extracts even at high protein concentrations. Purified Rad23 protein only partially complemented deficient repair of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f4">4</xref>A, lanes 7&#x02013;10). In contrast, addition of purified Rad23 and Rad4 together restored the deficient repair to the wild-type level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f4">4</xref>A, lanes 11&#x02013;14). Combining 10 ng of Rad4 with 50 ng of Rad23 was sufficient to achieve full complementation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f4">4</xref>A, lane 11). The complementation activity of purified Rad4 and Rad23 was specific to <italic>rad23</italic> mutant extracts, because deficient NER in <italic>rad2</italic> mutant extracts was complemented by purified Rad2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f4">4</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;6), but could not be complemented by purified Rad4 and Rad23 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f4">4</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;10).</p><p>In separate experiments, we also attempted to complement the deficient repair in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts with cell-free extracts containing overexpressed Rad4 and&#x0002f;or Rad23. In these experiments, Rad4 protein was overexpressed in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells, and Rad23 protein was overexpressed in <italic>rad4</italic> mutant cells. The respective cell-free extracts were prepared and added to the <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts for <italic>in vitro</italic> NER. Again, neither overexpressed Rad4 cell extract nor overexpressed Rad23 cell extract (10&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g) alone could fully complement deficient NER of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant extracts. In contrast, addition of small amounts of an extract (3 &#x003bc;g) containing both overexpressed Rad4 and Rad23 proteins fully complemented deficient NER of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant extracts (data not shown).</p><p>Together, these results show that Rad23 protein directly participates in NER, and that decreased Rad4 stability is not the major cause of deficient NER in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells. Furthermore, these results suggest that Rad4 is the only NER protein being significantly stabilized by Rad23 in yeast cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Rad23 protein stimulates the DNA-binding activity of Rad4 protein</title><p>The Rad4&#x02013;Rad23 protein complex is thought to play a major role in DNA damage recognition during NER, due to its DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c37">37</xref>). To understand what direct role Rad23 plays during NER, we examined the effect of Rad23 protein on the DNA-binding activity of Rad4. DNA binding was determined by an EMSA. Purified Rad4 protein alone was able to bind to AAF-damaged DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f5">5</xref>, lane 2). In contrast, purified Rad23 protein alone was unable to bind to the damaged DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f5">5</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;7). Rad23 protein was also unable to bind to undamaged duplex DNA and single-stranded DNA with or without AAF-adducts (data not shown). When Rad23 protein was added, Rad4 binding to the AAF-DNA was significantly enhanced, by as much as &#x0223c;3-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f5">5</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). These results show that Rad23 protein stimulates the DNA-binding activity of Rad4 protein.</p><p>To determine whether the DNA-binding activity of Rad4 is affected by DNA damage, we performed competition experiments in the presence of Rad23 protein. Standard EMSA was performed using purified Rad4, Rad23 and <sup>32</sup>P-labeled duplex AAF-DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f6">6</xref>A and B, lanes 2 and 9). In separate reactions, increasing amounts of unlabeled DNA were added as the competitor. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f6">6</xref>A (compare lanes 3&#x02013;8 with lanes 10&#x02013;14) and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f6">6</xref>C, AAF-damaged double-stranded DNA was a significantly better competitor than the corresponding undamaged DNA. Similarly, AAF-damaged single-stranded DNA was a significantly better competitor than the corresponding undamaged DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f6">6</xref>B, compare lanes 3&#x02013;8 with lanes 10&#x02013;14 and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f6">6</xref>C). Furthermore, double-stranded DNA was a better competitor than single-stranded DNA, either in the absence of DNA damage (compare lanes 3&#x02013;8 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f6">6</xref>A and B; and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f6">6</xref>C) or in the presence of DNA damage (compare lanes 10&#x02013;14 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f6">6</xref>A and B; and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh934f6">6</xref>C). These competition experiments were also carried out with purified Rad4 protein alone. Similarly, Rad4 protein exhibited a stronger binding activity toward AAF-damaged DNA over the undamaged DNA, regardless of whether it was in double-stranded or single-stranded form (data not shown). These results show that Rad4 protein binds to damaged DNA stronger than undamaged DNA and binds to double-stranded DNA stronger than single-stranded DNA with or without Rad23 protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have examined the role of Rad23 protein in yeast NER. Our results support two roles of Rad23 protein in NER: its direct participation in NER and its stabilization of Rad4 protein. Furthermore, we found that Rad23 protein stimulates Rad4 binding to damaged DNA. This stimulatory activity is probably responsible for the direct role of Rad23 in NER.</p><p>The stabilization effect of Rad23 on Rad4 has been observed by Lommel <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c32">32</xref>) following UV radiation of yeast cells. Since transcription of the <italic>RAD23</italic> gene is UV inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c38">38</xref>), we asked whether Rad23 exerts a similar cellular effect on Rad4 in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. This proved to be the case. Apparently, the Rad23 function in stabilizing Rad4 is well conserved in mammals. It was shown recently that XPC protein, which is the homolog of Rad4, is also stabilized in mouse cells by HR23A and HR23B, two homologs of Rad23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c26">26</xref>). Lommel <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c32">32</xref>) suggested that Rad23 stabilizes Rad4 by protecting it from proteasome-mediated degradation. Supporting this notion, Rad4 protein is stabilized in proteasome-deficient mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c32">32</xref>), and removal of UV-induced CPDs was reported to be enhanced in these mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c30">30</xref>). In our studies, we found that although Rad4 was unstable in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells, the purified Rad4 protein was relatively stable in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, Rad4 protein by itself is not associated with an intrinsic instability. Our results are consistent with the conclusion of Lommel <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c32">32</xref>) that cellular Rad4 is actively degraded by the 26S proteasome, and its quick turnover is protected by Rad23 protein.</p><p>Since purified Rad4 and Rad23 together are necessary and sufficient for full complementation of deficient NER of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts, it is clear that Rad4 is the only NER protein that is significantly stabilized by Rad23 in cells, at least for the global genome repair. It was observed that Rad4 and XPC proteins transiently accumulate in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively, following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c32">32</xref>). This has been proposed as an important mechanism of NER regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c26">26</xref>). However, since persistent overexpression of Rad4 protein in wild-type yeast cells did not yield an effect on cellular resistance to UV radiation, it is unlikely that damage-induced Rad4 accumulation may represent a significant regulatory mechanism for repair. Rad4 accumulation may simply reflect its enhanced stabilization by higher levels of Rad23, as the <italic>RAD23</italic> gene is damage inducible in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c38">38</xref>).</p><p>XPC stabilization by HR23A&#x0002f;B led Ng <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c26">26</xref>) to conclude that this is the primary function of RAD23 protein. Such a mechanism predicts that deficient NER in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells should be largely complemented by persistent high levels of Rad4 protein in the cell through gene overexpression. This prediction is not supported by our results in yeast. First, persistent overexpression of Rad4 protein only slightly enhanced the UV resistance of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells, in contrast to full complementation by expressing the <italic>RAD23</italic> gene. Thus, deficient NER in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells is not corrected to a large extent by high levels of Rad4 protein. Second, deficient <italic>in vitro</italic> NER in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts could not be effectively complemented by purified Rad4 protein. Consistent with our results, Lommel <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c32">32</xref>) reported that overexpression of Rad4 or lack of the proteasome function could not suppress the deficient removal of UV-induced CPDs in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells. On the other hand, we observed that Rad4 overexpression slightly enhanced the UV resistance of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells, and that purified Rad23 protein alone could not fully complement deficient NER <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts. Clearly, the Rad4 protein concentration in <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells is limiting relative to other NER proteins for repair. Hence, stabilizing Rad4 protein is an important but not the only function of Rad23 protein in yeast NER. Another important function of Rad23 protein is its direct participation in NER, as demonstrated by the requirement for both purified Rad23 and Rad4 proteins to fully complement the deficient NER of <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cell extracts. Since <italic>rad23</italic> mutant cells are only modestly sensitive to UV radiation unlike other mutant cells such as <italic>rad4</italic> and <italic>rad14</italic>, Rad23 protein can only play an accessory role rather than an indispensable role in the biochemical pathway of NER. We found that while it is unable to bind DNA, Rad23 protein stimulates the DNA-binding activity of Rad4 protein. This is the only biochemical activity observed for Rad23 protein in NER. Thus, we postulate that stimulation on Rad4 binding to damaged DNA represents the major mechanism of the direct participation of Rad23 protein in NER. Definitive proof of this model awaits extensive structure-function studies of this protein.</p><p>Although the precise mechanism by which Rad23 stimulates DNA binding by Rad4 is not clear at present, physical interaction between these two proteins may be involved. Indeed, Rad23 strongly interacts with Rad4 in the yeast and the mammalian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c16">16</xref>). Intriguingly, a protein complex consisting of XPC, HR23B and CEN4 was isolated from human cells, in which the CEN4 component directly interacts with XPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c39">39</xref>). The role of CEN4 in this complex and whether this protein contributes to NER remains unknown. Since the stimulatory activity of Rad23 on Rad4 DNA binding was observed with purified proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is unlikely that the stimulatory mechanism involves protein modification during damage recognition by Rad4. In addition to Rad4, Rad23 also interacts with several other proteins, one of which is the 3-methyadenine DNA glycosylase involved in base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c40">40</xref>). Consistent with our model that stimulating Rad4 binding to damaged DNA accounts for a major role of Rad23 in NER, the human RAD23 proteins additionally stimulate the activity of the 3-methyadenine DNA glycosylase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh934c40">40</xref>). Our conclusions that yeast Rad23 plays dual functions by stimulating Rad4-mediated damage binding&#x0002f;recognition and by stabilizing Rad4 in cells may provide a general model for understanding RAD23 protein in NER of other eukaryotes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh934f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Stability of Rad4 protein in yeast cells.
