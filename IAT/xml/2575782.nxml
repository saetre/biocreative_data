Microtubules (MTs) extend within forward protrusions to sustain cell polarity and promote adhesion site turnover. Memo is an effector of the ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase involved in breast carcinoma cell migration. However, its mechanism of action remained unknown. We report in this study that Memo controls ErbB2-regulated MT dynamics by altering the transition frequency between MT growth and shortening phases. Moreover, although Memo-depleted cells can assemble the Rac1-dependent actin meshwork and form lamellipodia, they show defective localization of lamellipodial markers such as &#x003b1;-actinin-1 and a reduced number of short-lived adhesion sites underlying the advancing edge of migrating cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Memo is required for the localization of the RhoA guanosine triphosphatase and its effector mDia1 to the plasma membrane and that Memo&#x02013;RhoA&#x02013;mDia1 signaling coordinates the organization of the lamellipodial actin network, adhesion site formation, and MT outgrowth within the cell leading edge to sustain cell motility.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: FA, focal adhesion; HRG, heregulin-&#x003b2;1; MT, microtubule; ROCK, Rho-associated kinase.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell motility is the result of a complex series of events that must be integrated both spatially and temporally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>). Efficient motility requires the coordinated regulation of actin, microtubules (MTs), and adhesion sites throughout the migration process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rodriguez et al., 2003</xref>). While investigating signaling pathways involved in ErbB2-driven breast carcinoma cell migration, we have identified Memo, a protein that does not belong to any known family of signaling molecules, as a novel ErbB2 effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Marone et al., 2004</xref>). Memo knockdown cells showed reduced migration despite their preserved ability to extend lamellae/lamellipodia. Interestingly, Memo appears to be involved in MT outgrowth within cell protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Marone et al., 2004</xref>). We have investigated the mechanisms underlying Memo's function in ErbB2-driven motility in living breast carcinoma cell lines. We found that Memo regulates MT dynamics, formation of adhesion sites, and the organization of the lamellipodial actin network by contributing to localize the small G protein RhoA and its effector mDia1 at the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In migrating cells, MTs are usually organized radially with the minus ends anchored at the centrosome and the plus ends probing the cytoplasm. Because MT plus ends are dynamically unstable and switch abruptly between phases of growth, pause, and shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>), MT net growth depends on the tight regulation of MT dynamic instability. Upon heregulin-&#x003b2;1 (HRG)&#x02013;induced ErbB2 activation, breast carcinoma cells extend wide membrane protrusions in the direction of cell displacement invaded by outgrowing MTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Incorporation of EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin into MTs allowed the tracking of individual MT plus ends in the lamellae/lamellipodia and the analysis of MT dynamics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805107/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805107/DC1</ext-link>). We found that HRG treatment did not affect MT growth or shortening rates (not depicted) but strongly decreased the frequency of transitions from growth or pause to shortening (catastrophes) and increased the frequency of transitions from shortening to growth or pause (rescues; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and E</xref>). As a consequence, MTs spent more time growing than shortening, in contrast to what was observed in the absence of stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and F</xref>). Expression of Memo was knocked down via siRNA (Fig. S1). Memo knockdown cells were still capable of forming protrusions of the same size and at the same rate as control cells (unpublished data). However, despite the fact that MTs were still dynamic (Video 2), they failed to enter lamellipodia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Analysis of plus end dynamics showed that in Memo knockdown cells, HRG treatment failed to decrease catastrophes or increase rescues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and E</xref>) and no longer affected the time MTs spent in the growth/shortening phases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and F</xref>) in SKBR3 and T47D breast carcinoma cells. Importantly, reexpression of Memo restored all ErbB2 effects on MTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Interestingly, Memo depletion did not significantly affect basal MT dynamics. Thus, Memo is an essential effector of ErbB2-regulated MT dynamics.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Memo is required for ErbB2-regulated MT dynamics.</bold> (A and B) SKBR3 cells expressing EGFP-tubulin and control (Ctrl; A) or Memo siRNA (B) were treated with 5 nM HRG for 10 min.

Thus, we investigated the consequences of Memo knockdown on adhesion complexes formed by migrating cells, using paxillin as a marker. We observed that DsRed-paxillin was incorporated into two discrete populations of adhesions: small short-lived adhesion sites (mean lifetime of 12.3 &#x000b1; 0.4 s; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 70 individual adhesions in seven cells) underlying the advancing leading edge and large stable sites, the focal adhesions ([FAs] mean lifetime of 11.6 &#x000b1; 1.2 min; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 20 individual adhesions in four cells) deeper within the lamella, which derive from a subpopulation of the former (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Video 3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805107/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805107/DC1</ext-link>). Interestingly, Memo knockdown resulted in a striking decrease in the number of small adhesion sites, whereas the number of FAs increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>; and Video 4). In accordance with the known role of MTs on FA turnover, we found that the lifetime of adhesion sites was increased in the absence of Memo (unpublished data). Reintroduction of Memo in knockdown cells restored small adhesions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We propose that the reduction in short-lived adhesion sites that underlie membrane protrusions combined with the increased number of FAs that anchor cells to the substratum contributes to the motility defect in Memo knockdown cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Memo is involved in small adhesion site formation and &#x003b1;-actinin lamellipodial localization.</bold> (A) Still images from Videos 3 and 4 showing paxillin-DsRed&#x02013;labeled adhesion sites in SKBR3 cells.

Actin filaments assemble at the leading edge of migrating cells in a Rac1- and Arp2/3-dependent manner to form a branched network that pushes the cell membrane forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>). EGFP-actin labeling was concentrated in several structures, including the cell cortical area and actin stress fibers, and appeared similar in control and Memo-depleted cells. In particular, the extent of the EGFP-actin&#x02013;labeled cortical actin meshwork (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> and Videos 5 and 6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805107/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805107/DC1</ext-link>) was similar in control and Memo knockdown cells (width of cortical actin &#x0003d; 1.32 &#x000b1; 0.11 &#x003bc;m and 1.42 &#x000b1; 0.13 &#x003bc;m in control and Memo siRNA&#x02013;expressing cells, respectively; 18 cells, 10 regions per cell). Similarly, the lamellipodial localization of Arp3 was unaffected by Memo depletion (Fig. S1). A recent study proposed that a dense actin network comprising the actin-bundling protein &#x003b1;-actinin might be associated with initiation of adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Giannone et al., 2007</xref>). We observed that &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;EGFP labeled a structure that overlapped with EGFP-actin&#x02013;labeled lamellipodia. Interestingly, we observed that the &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;labeled lamellipodia were almost 50% thinner in Memo knockdown relative to control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, and Videos 7 and 8). Importantly, the width of &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;labeled lamellipodia was restored to normal upon Memo reexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The effect was even more drastic for endogenous &#x003b1;-actinin-1, as immunolabeling appeared to be decreased throughout the lamellipodia of Memo-deficient cells (Fig. S1).</p><p>We have further explored the organization of the lamellipodial network using FRAP experiments. After photobleaching of EGFP-actin, the whole bleached area flowed back until disappearance in the lamella, with little recovery through diffusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref> and Video 9, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805107/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805107/DC1</ext-link>). This observation illustrates that the lamellipodial actin network is assembled at the cell membrane as a stable structure that is carried back by retrograde flow until it reaches the lamellipodium/lamella border, where it is disassembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ponti et al., 2004</xref>). Arp3 displayed the same type of recovery pattern (unpublished data). In contrast, recovery of fluorescence after bleaching of &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;EGFP occurred throughout lamellipodia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref> and Video 10), reflecting fast &#x003b1;-actinin-1 association/dissociation to the actin network. Interestingly, Memo-depleted cells recovered fluorescence at the same rate as control cells (recovery half-time of <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003d; 8.7 &#x000b1; 1.1 s and 9.8 &#x000b1; 1.8 s, respectively, for control and Memo-depleted cells; 45 regions in 15 cells; three independent experiments), indicating that Memo depletion does not directly affect the &#x003b1;-actinin association/dissociation rate. Instead, it could affect the actin network structure, preventing &#x003b1;-actinin binding/cross-linking. This is supported by the fact that lamellipodial localization of cortactin, another actin filament&#x02013;binding protein, is also dependent on Memo. Although cortactin was present in the lamellipodia of control cells, it was restricted to the cell membrane in Memo knockdown cells (Fig. S1).</p><p>Our results show that Memo regulates MT dynamics, organization of the lamellipodial actin network, and initiation of adhesion sites. To position Memo in a signaling pathway, we investigated mDia1 because mDia formins are known to control actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ishizaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kovar et al., 2006</xref>) and the alignment and stability of a subpopulation of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Palazzo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wen et al., 2004</xref>). mDia1 knockdown (Fig. S1) prevented MT outgrowth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), inhibited formation of small adhesion sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), and decreased the thickness of actinin-labeled lamellipodia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) to the same extent as Memo knockdown. Importantly, expression of a constitutively active form of mDia1, mDia1(&#x00394;N3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ishizaki et al., 2001</xref>), in Memo knockdown cells compensated for the loss of Memo and restored Memo MT outgrowth toward the cell cortex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) in Memo knockdown cells. Analysis of MT dynamics showed that in the presence of active mDia1, Memo knockdown had no impact on the frequency of MT rescues or catastrophes, nor was the time MTs spent growing versus shortening affected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Expression of active mDia1 also restored formation of small adhesion sites (in 92% of the cells vs. 12% of Memo knockdown cells; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 69 and 74, respectively; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and normal actinin-labeled lamellipodia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) in Memo knockdown cells. Because mDia1 is an effector of RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Watanabe et al., 1997</xref>), we tested the role of RhoA in Memo signaling. Expression of moderate levels of an active form of RhoA (RhoV14) in Memo knockdown cells induced thick stress fibers and large FAs but also restored Memo functions: MT outgrowth (in 89% of the cells vs. 5% of Memo-depleted cells and 90% of control cells; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 73, 61, and 87, respectively; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), formation of small adhesion sites (in 87% of the cells vs. 8% of Memo-depleted cells and 92% of control cells; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 78, 63, and 79, respectively; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), and normal lamellipodial &#x003b1;-actinin labeling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). These results demonstrate that RhoA and mDia1 are important Memo effectors that control MTs, the actin network, and adhesion sites. Finally, we evaluated the impact of the Memo&#x02013;RhoA&#x02013;mDia1 signaling pathway on cell motility using time-lapse microscopy. We found that Memo knockdown decreased velocity of SKBR3 cells by 40&#x02013;50% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Reintroduction of Memo, active mDia1, or active RhoA in Memo knockdown cells restored normal cell velocity, revealing the significant contribution of the Memo&#x02013;RhoA-mDia1 pathway to ErbB2-dependent breast carcinoma cell migration.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>RhoA and mDia1 restore MT dynamics and peripheral adhesions in Memo-depleted cells.</bold> (A and B) SKBR3 cells expressing Memo, mDia1, or control siRNA and constructs coding for Memo, active mDia1 (mDia1[&#x00394;N3]), or active RhoA (RhoAV14) were analyzed for MT dynamic instability as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.

We investigated the possibility that Memo controls the recruitment of RhoA and mDia1 to the cell membrane. HRG treatment induced the recruitment of Memo from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Marone et al., 2004</xref>). EGFP-mDia1, EGFP-RhoA, and the respective endogenous proteins were similarly recruited to lamellipodial membranes and ruffles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). RhoA and mDia1 labeling is not simply caused by increased cell volume at ruffles because cytoplasmic markers (e.g., the mCherry fluorescent protein) show limited labeling of ruffles (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805107/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805107/DC1</ext-link>). Importantly, Memo knockdown prevented recruitment of EGFP-tagged and endogenous RhoA and mDia1 to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref> and Fig. S2). This was not caused by decreased ruffling activity, as other RhoGTPases such as Rac1 and Cdc42 are still associated with plasma membrane and ruffles in the absence of Memo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and Fig. S3). Biochemical analysis of lamellipodia- and cell body&#x02013;enriched fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cho and Klemke, 2002</xref>) confirmed that RhoA and Memo were enriched in the cell leading edge and that decreased expression of Memo led to a specific reduction of RhoA in lamellipodia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). In fact, the functional interaction between Memo and RhoA could be the consequence of a physical interaction, as bacterially expressed Memo interacted with purified RhoA in pull-down experiments. Interestingly, Memo interacted preferentially with the active forms of RhoA (GTP-bound and constitutively active L63QRhoA). In contrast, Memo did not bind GTP-loaded Cdc42 or Rac1, which is indicative of the specificity of the interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Thus, we propose that Memo retains active RhoA at the plasma membrane to allow spatially and temporally restricted activation of RhoA effectors such as mDia1 at the cell leading edge.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Memo is required for localization of RhoA and mDia1 to membrane ruffles and lamellipodia.</bold> (A and B) SKBR3 cells expressing EGFP-RhoA or EGFP-mDia1 (A) or EGFP-Cdc42 or EGFP-Rac1 (B) constructs and control or Memo siRNA, as indicated, were treated with 5 nM HRG for 10 min. EGFP-RhoA and EGFP-mDia1 were recruited to cell membrane and ruffles (arrowheads) in control but not in Memo-depleted cells, whereas localization of EGFP-Cdc42 and EGFP-Rac1 was independent of Memo. (C) Cell body (CB) and lamellipodia (Lp) of control and Memo siRNA&#x02013;expressing cells were fractionated. Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by Western blotting to reveal the relative amounts of RhoA in the respective fractions. RhoA is decreased in the lamellipodia-enriched fraction but is unchanged in the cell body of Memo knockdown cells. (D) Bacterially produced Memo was incubated with GDP-loaded GST-RhoA or GTP&#x003b3;S-loaded GST-RhoA, GST-RhoA L63, GST-Cdc42, or GST-Rac1 bound to glutathione beads. RhoGTPase-associated Memo was visualized by Western blotting. Ponceau S protein staining (bottom) shows equivalent amounts of GST fusion proteins. (E) Cells were transfected with Memo siRNA and EGFP-RhoA or EGFP-RhoA-CCKVL. MTs were visualized by incorporation of &#x003b2;-tubulin&#x02013;DsRed.

Expression of a fusion protein between wild-type RhoA and the palmitoylation motif of RhoB (RhoA-CCKVL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Michaelson et al., 2001</xref>) promoted constitutive membrane localization independently of Memo expression levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Expression of RhoA-CCKVL in Memo-deficient cells restored MT outgrowth (in 81% of the cells vs. 10% of RhoA-expressing cells; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 65 and 61 cells, respectively) but also normal lamellipodial localization of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 and cell motility (unpublished data), showing that forcing RhoA to the plasma membrane recapitulates Memo's functions. The data also suggest that Memo is not directly required for activation of RhoA because wild-type membrane-associated RhoA was fully functional in the absence of Memo.</p><p>It is noteworthy that Memo signals via RhoA but does not control known functions of RhoA such as formation of stress fibers or maturation of FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004</xref>). In fact, these are under the control of the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), as Y27632 inhibition of ROCK activity drastically reduced stress fibers (not depicted) and FAs while preserving small peripheral adhesions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), which is in striking contrast to mDia1 inhibition. These results are in line with earlier work showing that ROCK is involved in the formation of central but not peripheral adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Totsukawa et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, an active form of ROCK induced thick stress fibers and large FAs but failed to restore small adhesion sites or lamellipodial &#x003b1;-actinin labeling in Memo-depleted cells (unpublished data). Thus, Memo knockdown provides a method to distinguish between discrete pools of RhoA with distinct functions: one controlling cortical actin and initiation of adhesion sites via the mDia1 effector at the cell leading edge, and the other triggering ROCK-dependent stress fiber formation, adhesion maturation, and cell contraction within the cell body.</p><p>Although the role of the Rac1&#x02013;Scar&#x02013;Arp2/3 pathway for the assembly of the branched actin meshwork was clearly demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>), models of lamellipodia protrusion need to take into account evidences for the coexistence within the lamellipodium of kinetically distinct yet overlapping actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ponti et al., 2004</xref>) and the role of other types of regulators of actin assembly such as formins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yang et al., 2007</xref>) and Ena/VASP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bear et al., 2002</xref>). We propose that mDia1, as an effector of Memo&#x02013;RhoA, contributes to the organization of the lamellipodial actin network. mDia1 controls the lamellipodial localization of both &#x003b1;-actinin-1 and cortactin, suggesting that an alteration of the network organization allows actin-binding protein association to the actin network. We are exploring the possibility that, as shown for mDia2 recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), mDia1 controls the length or branching of actin filaments. This could lead to a modification of the structure of the actin network and allow &#x003b1;-actinin-1 localization and bundling or scaffolding activity in lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Otey and Carpen, 2004</xref>). As a recent study suggested that myosin-dependent tension exerted on the lamellipodial network controls formation of adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Giannone et al., 2007</xref>), changes in actin filament length, branching, or bundling could in turn affect the response of the actin network to tension and formation of peripheral adhesions. Thus, our study showing that the Memo&#x02013;RhoA&#x02013;mDia1 pathway controls the cytoskeleton and adhesion sites at the cell leading edge adds a layer of complexity to the signaling network that controls cell motility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell transfection and plasmid constructs</title><p>SKBR3 and T47D breast carcinoma cells grown in DME and 10% fetal calf serum were transfected by nucleofection (Amaxa) with 2 &#x003bc;g siRNA for Memo (nt 1,438&#x02013;1,458; within the 3&#x02032; untranslated region), mDia1 (nt 132&#x02013;152), or LacZ (nt 2,289&#x02013;2,309; Invitrogen) and the following plasmid constructs: GFP-Memo, Myc-Memo<sup>6</sup>, EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), DsRed&#x02013;&#x003b2;-tubulin (provided by V.
