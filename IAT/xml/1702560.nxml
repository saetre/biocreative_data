We have previously demonstrated, using a mouse cancer model, that oncogenic tyrosine kinase inhibition of DNA damage&#x02013;induced Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation tightly correlates with T cell transformation in vivo, although the pathway to Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation remains unknown and its functional consequences unclear. We show here that rBcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation generates an iso-Asp<sup>52</sup>/iso-Asp<sup>66</sup> species that is unable to sequester pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins such as Bim and Puma. DNA damage in thymocytes results in increased expression of the NHE-1 Na/H antiport, an event both necessary and sufficient for subsequent intracellular alkalinisation, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, and apoptosis. In murine thymocytes and tumour cells expressing an oncogenic tyrosine kinase, this DNA damage&#x02013;induced cascade is blocked. Enforced intracellular alkalinisation mimics the effects of DNA damage in murine tumour cells and human B-lineage chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells, thereby causing Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and increased apoptosis. Our results define a signalling pathway leading from DNA damage to up-regulation of the NHE-1 antiport, to intracellular alkalanisation to Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, to apoptosis, representing the first example, to our knowledge, of how deamidation of internal asparagine residues can be regulated in a protein in vivo. Our findings also suggest novel approaches to cancer therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cell survival and cell death (apoptosis) are controlled by a finely tuned ensemble of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic proteins. When the two types of protein are balanced, cells survive. But if the pro-survival proteins dominate, there is a danger that cells with damaged DNA will stay alive, leading to malignancy. One of the key pro-survival proteins, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, acts by blocking the actions of pro-apoptotic proteins. We show here that DNA damage results in an important modification of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>. Specifically, when the amide groups are removed from two critical asparagine (amino acid) residues, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> can no longer block pro-apoptotic proteins, leading to cell death. Surprisingly, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation is catalysed not by an enzyme, but by increased pH inside the cell due to the up-regulation of an NHE-1 transporter that moves positive ions across the cell membrane. Indeed, artificially increasing pH causes Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and apoptosis in the absence of initial DNA damage. Exploring this novel pathway may ultimately suggest approaches to cancer therapy, especially when malignant cells are resistant to chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Until now, the mechanisms and functional implications for DNA damage-induced Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation were unknown.

Deamidation of both Gln and Asn residues in vitro can be greatly accelerated by exposure to either acid or alkaline pH, with minima in the range pH 4&#x02013;6. Until recently, it was assumed that Asn protein deamidation rates in vivo were set up by a &#x0201c;fixed clock&#x0201d; that was defined only by the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of proteins that specified the half-life of the particular Asn residue in question. However, this view has been radically changed by the recent observation that DNA damage induces the relatively rapid deamidation of the pro-survival protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in an osteosarcoma cell line system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, indicating that the deamidation &#x0201c;clock&#x0201d;, far from being fixed, is a dynamic process that can be regulated in vivo by biologically critical events. Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation in response to DNA damage occurs at two internal Asn residues (Asn<sup>52</sup> and Asn<sup>66</sup>), causing a characteristic retardation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel eletrophoresis (PAGE) gels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Initial work from the Weintraub laboratory suggested that when Asn<sup>52</sup> and Asn<sup>66</sup> are both mutated to Asp, then Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> loses its ability to bind to the BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein Bim, thereby providing a putative linkage between DNA damage and apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. However, a secondary mutation was later identified, which, when corrected, enabled the N52D/N66D Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to bind Bim, casting doubt on this interpretation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Using a different model system, we have previously implicated the oncogene-mediated inhibition of DNA damage-induced Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation in the transformation of murine thymocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

The absence of CD45-mediated dephosphorylation results in hyperphosphorylation of positive regulatory p56<sup>lck</sup> pTyr-394, causing hyperactivation of the kinase and triggering oncogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Despite a normal p53 response, DNA damage&#x02013;induced apoptosis is suppressed in pretumourigenic thymocytes, correlating with the inhibition of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, the preservation of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> binding to Bim, and the inhibition of cytochrome c release and the apoptotic caspase execution cascade. Therefore, we proposed that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation is a critical switch in oncogenic kinase-induced T cell transformation, and we suggested that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation to an Iso-Asp<sup>52</sup>/Iso-Asp<sup>66</sup> version, rather than the mutant N52D/N66D version investigated by the Weintraub laboratory, might be the key step in disabling the antiapoptotic functions of the protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Neither in the osteosarcoma cell line work &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; nor in our own work based on primary thymocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; has there been any indication as to how DNA damage might induce Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation. Neither have there been previous reports in the literature showing how protein Asn deamidation in general might be regulated in vivo; we address here this question. We confirm that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation does indeed destroy its ability to sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bim and Puma, thereby establishing a clear molecular link between DNA damage, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, and apoptosis. Surprisingly, DNA damage&#x02013;triggered deamidation in primary wild-type cells is mediated not enzymatically, but by intracellular alkalinisation caused by increased expression of the NHE-1 Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger (antiport), events blocked by expression of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase (OTK). In the case of either murine or human cancer cells, enforced alkalinisation triggers Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, crippling its ability to provide protection from the pro-apoptotic consequences of DNA damage, thereby indicating possible novel approaches to cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DNA Damage&#x02013;Induced Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> Deamidation Does Not Depend on Mitochondrial Apoptosis</title><p>An important consideration is whether DNA damage&#x02013;induced Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation in murine thymocytes is a cause or consequence of thymic apoptosis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows that whereas the addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, as expected, inhibited DNA damage&#x02013;induced apoptosis in murine thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), no inhibition of DNA damage&#x02013;induced Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation was observed in cell aliquots taken from the same thymic cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).

We therefore used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to deplete Bax and Bak from CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (double-negative, DN) thymocytes, confirmed that depletion was sufficient to block caspase 9 cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), and showed that DNA damage&#x02013;induced Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation proceeded normally in the absence of Bax and Bak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).

Immunoprecipitation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, followed by immunoblotting for Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, revealed that Bim sequestered only the N52/N66 Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and failed to bind the slower migrating deamidated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, upper panel), although the amount of Bim in each immunoprecipitate was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lower panel).

A comparable result was obtained when Puma immunoprecipitates were blotted for Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). Therefore, deamidated Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> appears unable to sequester BH3-only proteins.</p><p>To confirm the results using intact thymocytes, we carried out in vitro biochemical experiments. Recombinant purified His-tagged Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> was exposed to alkaline conditions to cause partial deamidation and separated by anion-exchange chromatography into three peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, peaks A, B and C). Mass spectrometric analysis revealed an increase of 1 Da for peak B relative to peak A, and a further increase of 1 Da for peak C relative to peak B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). On SDS-PAGE gels, peak A Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> migrated slightly faster than the more acidic peaks B and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), reproducing the characteristic profile of N52/N66 Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and its deamidated versions found in our cellular studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).

In fact, deamidation of a single Asn increases protein mass by 1 Da, at the same time increasing its net negative charge, confirming that the shifts are due to deamidation. Importantly, when the three species of rBcl-x<sub>L</sub> were tested for their ability to bind to Bim in wild-type thymic lysates, only peak A bound Bim effectively, whereas binding to peak B rBcl-x<sub>L</sub> was reduced by 88&#x00025; &#x000b1; 2&#x00025; and completely ablated using peak C rBcl-x<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, upper panel). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g002">Figure 2</xref>E shows that the Asp<sup>52</sup>/Asp<sup>66</sup> version of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, or the Ala<sup>52</sup>/Ala<sup>66</sup> version that cannot be deamidated, does still bind both Bim and Puma, consistent with the correction published by the Weintraub laboratory &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

To address this question, we incubated wild-type thymocytes in the pH range of 7.2&#x02013;8.0 for 20 h in the presence of the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ionophore monensin to ensure complete equilibration of pH<sub>i</sub> and extracellular pH (pH<sub>e</sub>), and to neutralize acidic intracellular compartments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, and we then assessed the extent of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>B shows that whereas only 22.5&#x00025; &#x000b1; 3.2&#x00025; was deamidated at pH 7.2, this increased to 56.1&#x00025; &#x000b1; 3.8&#x00025; at pH 7.6 and 67.0&#x00025; &#x000b1; 4.5&#x00025; at pH 8.0. Therefore, a rise in pH<sub>i</sub> comparable with that observed after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) is sufficient to cause substantial deamidation. Furthermore, the addition of Z-VAD-fmk to thymic cultures following DNA damage did not inhibit their alkalinisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Fig. 3</xref>C), showing that the rise in pH<sub>i</sub> is not downstream of caspase activation. To investigate Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, pH<sub>i</sub>, and apoptosis in parallel, we manipulated pH<sub>i</sub> values artificially by incubating cells at varying pH<sub>e</sub> values in the absence of monensin. The left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>D shows that when DNA damage was induced in wild-type thymocytes, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation could be largely prevented by artificially maintaining the pH<sub>i</sub> at 7.1 (value shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>E, left panel), thereby reducing the percentage of apoptotic CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes by 2-fold relative to those incubated at physiological pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>F, left panel). Conversely, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>D (right panel) shows that the resistance to Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation observed in DNA-damaged pretumourigenic thymocytes could be completely overcome by artificially increasing the pH<sub>i</sub> to 7.55 or above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>E, right panel), correlating with a 2-fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes relative to those incubated at physiological pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>F, right panel). Interestingly, enforced alkalinisation alone in the absence of DNA damage caused a marked increase in Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation in the OTK expressing thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, right panel), with a concomitant increase in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>F, right panel), albeit at a level lower than with DNA damage, perhaps reflecting the somewhat lower pH<sub>i</sub> values achieved under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>E, right panel).</p><p>We considered that the tight correlation between pH<sub>i</sub>, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, and apoptosis might nevertheless be coincidental and that enforced alkalinisation might be inducing apoptosis by a mechanism independent of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation. Mutant Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> Ala<sup>52</sup>/Ala<sup>66</sup> or Asp<sup>52</sup>/Asp<sup>66</sup>, both of which sequester BH3-only proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), were therefore over-expressed in wild-type CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes by retroviral transduction prior to enforced alkalinisation by incubation in media at pH 8.0 or 8.5. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>G (middle panel) shows that, as expected, the Ala<sup>52</sup>/Ala<sup>66</sup> mutant migrates as the lower nondeamidated version of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, whereas Asp<sup>52</sup>/Asp<sup>66</sup> migrates as the more negatively charged deamidated version. Interestingly, in the cells expressing these mutant forms of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, the apoptosis induced by enforced alkalinisation was reduced 4-fold compared to cells transduced with empty vector, or more than 2-fold in comparison with the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>G, right panel), which of course undergoes deamidation in response to alkali treatment. These results show that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in a version able to sequester BH3-only proteins protects thymocytes from an enforced increase in pH<sub>i</sub>. Nevertheless, protection was not absolute, suggesting that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> may not be the only mechanism protecting cells from apoptosis triggered by alkalinisation. As a further control, we have confirmed that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> isolated from wild-type thymocytes exposed to a high pH buffer can no longer sequester Bim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g002">Figure S2B</xref>), thereby mimicking the effects of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p><p>Taken overall, these results demonstrate that intracellular alkalinisation following DNA damage is both necessary and sufficient for nonenzymatic Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, that the oncogenic suppression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation in pretumourigenic thymocytes is caused by inhibition of alkalinisation, and that versions of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> competent for BH3-only protein sequestration are sufficient per se to protect cells from apoptosis at alkaline pH<sub>i</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>DNA Damage&#x02013;Induced Alkalinisation, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> Deamidation, and Apoptosis are Mediated by Increased NHE-1 Antiport Expression</title><p>We next investigated the molecular mechanisms leading from DNA damage to the regulation of pH<sub>i</sub> and subsequent Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g004">Figure 4</xref>A shows that de novo protein synthesis is essential for Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation following DNA damage in wild-type thymocytes.

No inhibition of increased NHE-1 expression in wild-type thymocytes was observed following addition of the Z-VAD-fmk caspase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A) nor following depletion of Bax and Bak from the cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B). We therefore carried out a further series of experiments to demonstrate that there was a direct causal linkage between the regulation of NHE-1 expression, pH<sub>i</sub>, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, and apoptosis. Given that the OTK blocks DNA-damage induced NHE-1 expression in pretumourigenic thymocytes, this provides a powerful system for examining the consequences of experimentally enforcing NHE-1 expression in these cells by retroviral transduction. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g004">Figure 4</xref>C illustrates (upper panel), an enforced 2-fold&#x02013;3-fold increase in NHE-1 expression in pretumourigenic thymocytes, without DNA damage, restored Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation to a level comparable to that observed in a retrovirally transduced wild-type control in five separate experiments, thereby bypassing the OTK-mediated inhibition in deamidation. Overexpression of NHE-1 increased both pH<sub>i</sub> and apoptosis to comparable levels in both pretumourigenic and wild-type thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, lower panels). These results suggest that increased NHE-1 expression per se is sufficient to cause increased pH<sub>i</sub>, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and apoptosis. To address this question further, we used the selective NHE-1 inhibitor 5-(N,N&#x02032;-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA) to block the actions of the antiport following its increased expression on thymocytes upon DNA damage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g004">Figure 4</xref>D shows that DMA prevented the alkalinisation of wild-type thymocytes following DNA damage (top left panel), their apoptosis (top right panel), and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation (lower panel), correlating with increased survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg005">Figure S5</xref>A).</p><p>To extend these findings, we also used shRNA to deplete thymocytes of NHE-1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg006">Figure S6</xref>A). NHE-1 knockdown almost completely blocked the actions of DNA damage in causing Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), intracellular alkalinisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg006">Figure S6</xref>B). We measured apoptosis by two different methods to ensure that DNA damage&#x02013;induced cell death following retroviral transduction was by apoptosis and not by necrosis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg006">Figure S6</xref>B illustrate that double staining for Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) followed by FACS analysis revealed a major increase in Annexin V<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> PI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (apoptotic) cells following transduction with the negative control shRNA followed by either &#x003b3; irradiation or treatment with etoposide, whereas there was no increase in apoptotic cells above baseline in the cells depleted of NHE-1: DNA damage&#x02013;induced apoptosis was blocked 100&#x00025;.

Nevertheless, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that not all pSer/pThr sites were recognised by the cocktail of monocolonal antibodies (mAbs) used. Taken together, our findings therefore suggest that the increased expression of the NHE-1 transporter is both necessary and sufficient for DNA damage&#x02013;induced alkalinisation, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, and apoptosis in wild-type thymocytes, and that the suppression of these three parameters in pretumourigenic thymocytes is caused by oncogenic inhibition of the DNA damage&#x02013;triggered increase in NHE-1 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Enforced Alkalinisation Causes Increased Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> Deamidation and Apoptosis in Murine and Human Cancer Cells</title><p>The experiments illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g001">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g005">5</xref> were all carried out on wild-type or primary pretumourigenic <italic>CD45<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>lck<sup>F505</sup></italic> thymocytes.

Furthermore, a modest rise in pH<sub>i</sub> following incubation in a mildly alkaline buffer produces levels of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and apoptosis in murine tumour cells comparable to those observed by adding a DNA damaging reagent to wild-type thymocytes incubated at physiological pH.</p><p>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common adult haematological malignancy in the Western world and, like many cancers, is characterised by the development of drug resistance. We therefore determined whether genotoxic treatment in vitro of primary human B lineage CLL (B-CLL) cells might cause increased NHE-1, alkalinisation, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, and apoptosis, as in primary murine thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g005">5</xref>), or whether this might be inhibited, as with the murine cancer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). In addition, we examined the consequences for these parameters of incubating cancer cells in alkaline pH buffers. To perform these investigations, we divided each sample of patient cancer cells into nine aliquots that were either untreated, subjected to &#x003b3; irradiation, or exposed to etoposide, followed by incubation at pH 7.2, pH 8.0, or pH 8.5 for 24 h. Each aliquot was then further subdivided into three samples to measure pH<sub>i</sub>, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, and apoptosis. As expected, exposure of cells to mildly alkaline buffers generated pH<sub>i</sub> values that displayed some variation between samples from different patients within a narrow range. The 18 values per patient obtained from 10 different patients, the mean values calculated for each pH<sub>e</sub> value considered separately, and representative Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation results from a single patient are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg008">Figure S8</xref>A, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg008">Figure S8</xref>B, respectively. Interestingly, unlike the murine tumour cells expressing an OTK, the B-CLL cells behaved somewhat more like wild-type thymocytes in that DNA damage at physiological pH<sub>e</sub> caused a mean increase of pH<sub>i</sub> of 0.22 units, an 8&#x00025; increase in Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, and an 18&#x00025; increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg008">Figure S8</xref>A), compared to the higher thymocyte values of 0.45 pH<sub>i</sub> units, 40&#x00025; increase, and 37&#x00025; increase, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The human cancer cell values for these parameters were greatly increased at alkaline pH<sub>e</sub>, generating tight correlations between increasing pH<sub>i</sub>, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, and apoptosis (<italic>r</italic> values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Thus, a mean increased pH<sub>i</sub> of 0.5 correlated with 1.7-fold and 2.4-fold increases in Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and apoptosis, respectively. It is also striking that enforced intracellular alkalinisation alone (by 0.3 pH<sub>i</sub> units), in the absence of experimentally induced DNA damage, was itself sufficient to increase Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and apoptosis by 1.5-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively. This point is further illustrated by the gray shaded area shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, which encompasses the overlap in sub-G1 (apoptosis) values that were obtained either by DNA damage at physiological pH or by enforced alkalinisation without DNA damage. Conversely, incubation of B-CLL cells at lower pH inhibited DNA damage&#x02013;induced Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Therefore with respect to enforced changes in pH<sub>i</sub>, the B-CLL cells behaved in a comparable way to both murine thymocytes and tumour cells. A small increase in pH<sub>i</sub> induced by incubation in alkaline buffer in the absence of induced DNA damage generated as much, if not more, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and apoptosis as that triggered by genotoxic attack at physiological pH<sub>e</sub>.</p><p>NHE-1 expression in response to DNA damage was investigated in a further six B-CLL patients. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g006">Figure 6</xref>C shows by immunoblotting (right panel) that there was some variation between patients, but that in all cases (left panel), etoposide caused increased NHE-1 expression by 3 h, achieving optimal values by 6&#x02013;9 h ranging from 1.9-fold&#x02013;2.6-fold over basal levels.

Furthermore, DNA damage&#x02013;induced Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation in B-CLL cells was prevented by addition of either cycloheximide (CHX) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg008">Figure S8</xref>C) or DMA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg008">Figure S8</xref>D), establishing a possible linkage between DNA damage, NHE-1 function, and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation in human cancer cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has previously been suggested that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation is critical in the signalling pathway that leads from DNA damage to apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, such a hypothesis does not explain why the Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> mutants that still bind BH3-only proteins retain their anti-apoptotic potency at high pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figure 3</xref>G).</p><p>The striking blockade in DNA damage&#x02013;induced NHE-1 expression, alkalinisation, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, and apoptosis noted in <italic>CD45<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>lck<sup>F505</sup></italic> pretumourigenic thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g004">4</xref>), together with the reversal of this blockade by enforced expression of NHE-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), provide strong support for the model illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g007">Figure 7</xref>B.

We have previously demonstrated in pretumourigenic thymocytes a tight correlation between inhibition of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, resistance to DNA damage induced apoptosis, and oncogenesis, suggesting that the consequent accumulation of DNA-damaged thymocytes is critical in the transforming process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

By contrast, DNA damage of human B-CLL cells, which should not express OTKs, triggered increased NHE-1 expression and apoptosis, achieving levels comparable with wild-type thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). However, enforced alkalinisation of either the murine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050001-sg007">Figure S7</xref>) or human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g006">Figure 6</xref>) cancer cells triggered significant increases in Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and apoptosis, even in the absence of genotoxic attack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). In the case of the B-CLL cells, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that the tight correlation observed between these events does not reflect causal efficacy, and further work will be necessary to elucidate this point. In any event, the key issue for cancer cell therapy in this context is not whether inhibition of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation is involved in the initial transforming process, but whether Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is the main prosurvival protein protecting the tumour cells from the normal consequences of DNA damage. An extensive literature suggests that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> does indeed play this role in many tumour types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

Knockdown of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> also significantly reduces the viability of pancreatic cancer cells to tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;)&#x02013; and TNF-&#x003b1; - related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis by antitumour drugs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our findings therefore have potential relevance to cancer therapy, whereby enforced alkalinisation, perhaps by amplification of NHE-1 expression, would promote Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation, thereby triggering apoptosis.</p><p>The pioneering work of Warburg &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; established that tumours display acidic extracellular pH, although more than half a century passed before it was clearly established that the intracellular pH of tumour cells is comparable with normal cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050001-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Warburg's legacy has included intermittent interest in the possibility of pH manipulation as a means to cancer therapy.

Likewise, alkalinisation (B, upper panel), apoptosis (B, lower panel) and increased NHE-1 expression (C) were all suppressed in tumour cells to nearly the same extent as in pretumourigenic thymocytes. Furthermore, in the absence of monensin, extracellular buffers at pH 8.0&#x02013;8.5 forced pH<sub>i</sub> values of 7.5&#x02013;7.7 (E) triggering Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation (D) and apoptosis (F). It is particularly striking that incubation in buffer at pH 8.0, for example, which achieves a pH<sub>i</sub> value of 7.43, triggers 66.4&#x00025; and 36.6&#x00025; levels of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and apoptosis, respectively, irrespective of whether, in addition, DNA damage was induced by etoposide or by &#x003b3; irradiation. These results show that murine tumour cells resistant to genotoxic insult at physiological pH<sub>i</sub> values can be sensitised to die by enforced alkalinisation leading to Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation.</p><p>(1.3 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050001.sg007.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050001-sg008"><label>Figure S8</label><caption><title>Inhibition of NHE-1 Synthesis by CHX or Inhibition of NHE-1 Function by DMA in B-CLL Cells Blocks DNA Damage&#x02013;Induced Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> Deamidation</title><p>(A) Replotting of data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050001-g006">Figure 6</xref>A to show the absolute mean values SD (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10) for Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation (right panel) and apoptosis (left panel) obtained at each of the three extracellular pH values investigated.

The chromatographic conditions used for the separation of the peptides in the LC-MS analyses were optimised so as to resolve the Asn, Asp, and iso-Asp forms of peptides 1 and 2.

The chromatograms show LC-MS analyses at time point 72 h of the rBcl-xl base treatment. For both peptides, the major deamidation product is the iso-Asp form; the iso-Asp:Asp ratios are approximately 10:1 for N52 and 5:1 for N66.
