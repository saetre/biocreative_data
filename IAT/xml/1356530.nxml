Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have found a missense mutation in Hfq (V43R) which strongly affects2 the RNA binding capacity of the Hfq protein and its ability to stimulate poly(A) tail elongation by poly(A)-polymerase <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, overexpression of this Hfq variant fails to stimulate <italic>rpoS&#x02013;lacZ</italic> expression and does not restore a normal growth rate in <italic>hfq</italic> null mutant. Cells in which the wild-type gene has been replaced by the <italic>hfq</italic>V43R allele exhibit a phenotype intermediate between those of the wild-type and of the <italic>hfq</italic> minus or null strains. This missense mutation derepresses Hfq synthesis. However, not all Hfq functions are affected by this mutation. For example, HfqV43R represses OppA synthesis as strongly as the wild-type protein. The dominant negative effect of the V43R mutation over the wild-type allele suggests that hexamers containing variant and genuine subunits are presumably not functional. Finally, molecular dynamics studies indicate that the V43R substitution mainly changes the position of the K56 and Y55 side chains involved in the Hfq&#x02013;RNA interaction but has probably no effect on the folding and the oligomerization of the protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA transmits the genetic information encoded in DNA and also plays a variety of essential structural, catalytic and regulatory roles within the cell, often in association with specific proteins. One of the most intriguing examples of the global regulatory role of RNA&#x02013;protein interactions in gene expression is provided by the Hfq protein [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>)]. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, inactivation of the <italic>hfq</italic> gene causes a variety of phenotypes and alters the expression of many proteins, indicating that Hfq acts as a pleiotropic regulator which controls expression of many genes positively or negatively, directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Recently, this protein was reported to regulate poly(A)-dependent mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), to affect RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), to modulate RNA processing by RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Hfq binds to 30% of the small regulator noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) identified in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) and it is essential for the function exerted by the OxyS, DsrA, RyhB, Spot 42, MicA, SgrS ncRNAs on their mRNA targets <italic>rpoS</italic>, <italic>fhlA</italic>, <italic>sodB</italic>, <italic>sdhCDAB</italic>, <italic>galK, ompA</italic>, <italic>ptsG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>Although the multiple roles of the protein seem to be correlated with its capacity to bind RNA, the structural basis of the Hfq&#x02013;RNA interaction has not been elucidated. Hfq recognizes A-U rich single-stranded region of RNA and was also reported to interact with a curved form of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Moreover, the finding that Hfq activates poly(A)-polymerase (PAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), copurifies with H-NS, PAP and polynucleotide phosphorylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), interacts with RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), associates with RNase E through the C-terminal scaffold of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and stimulates Q&#x003b2; RNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) suggests that it probably has the capability to establish structural and functional interactions with several proteins. Finally, Hfq has been reported to exhibit an ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have aimed at identifying the functional regions of Hfq. It was shown that a truncated protein deprived of its 19 C-terminal residues is fully able to bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and that the <italic>hfq2</italic>::&#x003a9; mutation which leaves 79 N-terminal amino acids intact out of 101 residues does not affect its functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Consistently, the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> Hfq which comprises only 82 amino acids functionally replaces the <italic>E.coli</italic> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Hfq is a member of the Sm protein family involved in RNA splicing and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). These proteins form ring-shaped oligomeric structures which are homohexameric in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and heteroheptameric in eukaryotes. Comparison of the structure of the <italic>E.coli</italic> Hfq with that of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> crystallized in association with a short oligonucleotide suggests that D40, F42 and K56 residues of the <italic>E.coli</italic> protein may be implicated in the RNA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Moreover, it was reported that in <italic>Azorhizobium caulinodans</italic>, a C to R missense mutation at position 43 altered the function of the Hfq paralog NrfA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).</p><p>We report here the construction of a set of <italic>E.coli</italic> Hfq variants at positions expected to participate in RNA binding and Hfq functions. These include single point mutants (D40A, F42A and K56A) and a double mutant (D40A&#x02013;F42A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The V43R variant was constructed to mimic the mutation previously shown to be deficient for Hfq function in <italic>A.caulinodans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) as well as the V43C variant used as a control protein. We find that only one of them, in which valine at position 43 was substituted for arginine (V43R), was significantly affected for RNA binding and stimulation of poly(A) elongation. We also show that this Hfq variant (HfqV43R) failed to stimulate RpoS expression and that substitution of the wild-type gene by the mutant allele on the chromosome affects growth rate and abolishes autocontrol of Hfq synthesis. We present evidence that Hfq represses the expression of OppA, a protein whose synthesis was previously shown to be regulated by the GcvB ncRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Interestingly, the V43R mutation does not alter the repression of OppA synthesis. We also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which indicate that the V43R substitution mainly affects side chain positions of K56 and Y55 within the monomer but not the overall structure of the hexamer. This set of data leads us to propose that introduction of arginine at position 43 perturbs binding of the RNA at the proximal site or interferes with the good positioning of some RNA molecules on the Hfq protein. This may impair formation of Hfq&#x02013;RNA complexes and perturbates some functions of Hfq. Incidently, our data also provide evidence that Hfq, which is known to be involved in various stress situations, also ensures important functions during exponential growth in rich medium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Mutant forms of the <italic>hfq</italic>His6 gene were constructed either by using the PCR-based Stratagene QuickChange kit or by a two-step PCR amplification of the <italic>hfq</italic> gene from pTE607 (kindly provided by Thomas Elliott) using the reverse primer and T7term-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG primer and the corresponding forward primer and the pT7-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG primer (Supplementary Table 1).

Furthermore, Hfq mutant proteins retained on Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA column were further purified on poly(A) sepharose column to eliminate contaminating RNAs.</p><p>RNA binding capacity of Hfq variants was evaluated by mobility shift assay using a polyadenylated <italic>rpsO</italic> RNA fragment [3&#x02032;-<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)18] that was previously shown to be very strongly bound by wild-type Hfq (Hfqwt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). All mutant and wild-type proteins bound the RNA with similar affinities except HfqV43R whose affinity was dramatically lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Precise measurements show that HfqV43C bound the 3&#x02032;-<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)18 with the same affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 360 &#x000b1; 54 pM) as Hfqwt (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 280 &#x000b1; 51 pM), and that substitution of V43 by R increased the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value to 10 &#x000b1; 2.6 nM, i.e. by 35-fold [<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, column (a)]. Because preincubation of HfqV43R for 10 min at 90&#x000b0;C before mixing with the RNA did not change the affinity of HfqV43R for the polyadenylated <italic>rpsO</italic> RNA compared with non-preincubated protein, we assumed that the lower affinity of HfqV43R for RNA does not result from a significant thermodynamic destabilization of the protein (data not shown).</p><p>We then assayed whether the Hfq deficiency in binding the 3&#x02032;-<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)18 RNA impairs elongation by PAP as proposed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). PAP is a distributive enzyme; at the beginning of the reaction, the 3&#x02032;-<italic>rpsO</italic> RNA substrate rapidly disappeared and all molecules were elongated at approximately the same rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left part). Addition of Hfqwt caused partition of the RNA substrate into elongated and non-elongated molecules demonstrating that Hfq switches PAP from a distributive to a processive mode of polyadenylation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Moreover, these kinetics confirm that Hfq stimulates the elongation of molecules already harbouring poly(A) tails (30 and 90 min of incubation). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that HfqV43R is impaired in these functions, whereas the HfqV43C protein that binds this RNA normally, does have an effect on poly(A) synthesis. HfqV43R is able to provide the same stimulating effect only at increased concentration (compare 30 min lanes for HfqV43R 100 and 400 nM).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of HfqV43C and HfqV43R expression in <italic>hfq</italic> and wild-type strains</title><p>We then examined whether the HfqV43R mutation impairs Hfq functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. For that purpose, we first constructed an in-frame deleted <italic>hfq</italic> gene in order to avoid polar effects that affected expression of downstream genes in the available <italic>hfq1</italic>::&#x003a9; mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Then, we attempted to complement this <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394; strain with <italic>hfq</italic> mutant genes cloned in pACYC184 (pTX381 derivatives, about 15 copies per cell) and in pCL1921 (pCL derivatives, about 5 copies per cell). We verified that the amount of Hfq synthesized from pTX381 is two times higher than that synthesized from pCL<italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> in an <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394; strain (data not shown). Strikingly, while HfqV43C and Hfqwt correct the growth defect of the <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394;, HfqV43R, faulty for RNA binding, either does not complement at all (when expressed from the higher copy number plasmid, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or only partly complements (when expressed from the lower copy number plasmid, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) this growth deficiency, suggesting that higher amount of HfqV43R synthesized from pTX381 is deleterious for the cell. It is also interesting to point out that the <italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> strain transformed with pTX381<italic>hfq</italic>V43R exhibited a growth curve similar to that of the <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394; strain transformed with the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), which suggests that the <italic>hfq</italic>V43R allele exerts a dominant negative effect on the wild-type gene when overexpressed from pTX381<italic>hfq</italic>V43R.</p><p>Then, we examined whether Hfq substituted at position 43 regulates the expression of RpoS. This was achieved by following the expression of the <italic>rpoS::lacZ</italic> translational fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) in <italic>hfq</italic>-deficient strain containing the <italic>hfq</italic>10::cat mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) transformed by the pCL1921 series of <italic>hfq</italic> containing plasmids. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase was measured in cells grown in LB medium to the phase when the growth begins to slow down (OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.7&#x02013;1.9). A 10-fold increase of &#x003b2;-galactosidase synthesis was measured when <italic>hfq</italic>-deficient cells were transformed with pCL<italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> and pCL<italic>hfq</italic>V43C, while plasmid carrying the <italic>hfq</italic>V43R mutant did not stimulate the expression of the <italic>rpoS&#x02013;lacZ</italic> fusion. Interestingly, expression of <italic>hfq</italic>V43R in the wild-type strain causes repression of the <italic>rpoS&#x02013;lacZ</italic> translation to the level observed in the <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain, thus confirming that HfqV43R exerts a severe dominant negative effect on Hfq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the &#x003b2;-galactosidase level measured in cells harvested in the middle of the exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5&#x02013;0.6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) was lower than in the prestationary phase. However, the hierarchy of expression levels was the same as in the prestationary phase. This indicates that Hfq controls translation of rpoS both in stationary phase and during exponential growth, when <italic>rpoS</italic> is expressed at a so-called basal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). One can hypothesize that under these conditions in which no characterized sRNA has been hitherto found as a player in RpoS expression, Hfq but not HfqV43R, could directly regulate <italic>rpoS</italic> translation as earlier reported for <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative immunoblots were performed to estimate Hfq levels in the different strains entering in stationary phase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> shows that the amount of Hfq protein synthesized is higher when both <italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains were transformed with pCL<italic>hfq</italic>V43R compared with pCL<italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> plasmid, thus suggesting that Hfq expression is affected by the V43R substitution (see below).</p><p>These experiments show that the Hfq harbouring the V43R substitution fails to complement Hfq deficiency and has a dominant negative effect on a number of Hfq functions while, in contrast, the V43C substitution does not cause these negative effects, although it is expressed from the plasmid at higher level than Hfqwt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the <italic>hfq</italic>V43R mutant</title><p>We then examined some phenotypic characteristics of strains containing single copy of the <italic>hfq</italic>V43R, <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>hfq1</italic>::&#x003a9; which were previously attributed to Hfq deficiency in comparison with the wild-type allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>hfq</italic>V43R mutant exhibits an intermediary phenotype between the <italic>hfq1</italic>::&#x003a9; interrupted mutant and the wild-type strain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394; growth is diauxic in LB liquid medium containing 0.17 M NaCl as previously reported for <italic>hfq1</italic>::&#x003a9; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), whereas <italic>hfq</italic>V43R exhibits only a gradual transition from log growth to stationary phase. Moreover, on LB plates, <italic>hfq1</italic>::&#x003a9;, <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>hfq</italic>V43R colonies were noticeably less opaque than the <italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> parent, while no marked difference was observed in the size of <italic>hfq</italic>V43R and wild-type colonies. The same effects were observed in the HfrG6 genetic background (IBhfq95) (data not shown).</p><p>We then tested whether <italic>hfq</italic> mutations affected the sensitivity of bacterial cells to UV light by streaking liquid cultures onto LB plates and exposing portions of the plates to different doses of UV light. As expected, the <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>hfq1</italic>::&#x003a9; mutants were more sensitive than the <italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>hfq</italic>V43R mutation did not affect the UV sensitivity (data not shown). We found that the V43R mutation did not reduce the viability of bacteria after a heat-shock at 55&#x000b0;C in contrast to the disruption of the gene that has a dramatic effect on bacterial survival at that temperature (data not shown). The exact function of Hfq underlying these effects remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Together, these results indicate that not all functions of Hfq are affected by a single copy of <italic>hfq</italic>V43R on the chromosome. However, as shown below, the V43R mutation leads to small (1.9) increase in Hfq levels, which could partly compensate for a reduced activity of the mutant protein. Since HfqV43R fails to stimulate <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA translation, it was reasonable to suppose that this mutation may also alter expression of other mRNAs, as shown earlier for the <italic>hfq1</italic>::&#x003a9; and <italic>hfq10</italic>::cat mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Protein patterns from <italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394; (transformed or not with the pACYC184 derivatives) visualized by Coomassie blue staining show that one band &#x0223c;56 kDa is present only in <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 3, 8 and 13), indicating that Hfq negatively regulates synthesis of the corresponding protein. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight and LC-MSMS analysis of trypsic peptides generated from the excised band, unambiguously identified these peptides as belonging to the <italic>oppA</italic> gene product. The 56 kDa OppA protein was also observed in HAT10 (containing <italic>hfq10</italic>::cat) but not in CSH26 isogenic wild-type parent (data not shown) or in an <italic>hfq</italic>&#x00394;-<italic>oppA</italic>::kan strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 14). OppA is a periplasmic protein component of the oligopeptide transport system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>) involved in the active transport of aminoglycoside antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Interestingly, the OppA band is faint (lane 2) or absent (lane 11) in cells containing either <italic>hfq</italic>V43R or <italic>hfq</italic>V43C (lane 10), indicating that both variant proteins retained the ability to inhibit the synthesis of this polypeptide. HfqV43R seems, however, to act less efficiently than the wild-type protein. The complete repression of OppA synthesis observed when HfqV43R is overproduced allows us to speculate that a higher level of this variant compensates the lower binding affinity of the protein for the ncRNA, namely GcvB, previously shown to negatively control OppA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The HfqV43R mutant fails to autoregulate Hfq expression</title><p>Since the above results show that HfqV43R is expressed at a higher level than Hfqwt or HfqV43C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), we speculated that the V43R mutation also affects the negative control that Hfq exerts on its own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). To exclude the possibility that variations in gene copy number may account for this result, we measured the Hfq level originating from a single-copy wild-type or <italic>hfq</italic>V43R genes on the chromosome. Hfq synthesis in the <italic>hfq</italic>V43R mutant was found to be 1.9 times higher than in <italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> cells during exponential growth [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> column (b)].</p><p>We hypothesized that the inability of HfqV43R to control its own synthesis is due to its RNA binding deficiency and that the autocontrol occurs most likely at the translation level. Indeed, long stretches of A and U residues just upstream of the AUG start codon can be regarded as potential Hfq binding sites in the <italic>hfq</italic> mRNA where Hfq could compete for ribosome binding and repress its translation. To examine this possibility, we measured the yield of &#x003b2;-galactosidase from a <italic>hfq::lacZ</italic> translational fusion inserted as a single copy in the chromosome of <italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>hfq</italic>V43R cells. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> column (a) shows that the <italic>hfq</italic> TIR is 1.7 times more active in the <italic>hfq</italic>V43R background when compared to wild-type, a repression factor similar to that measured by immunoblot [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> column (b)].</p><p>We then determined the RNA binding affinity of the wild-type and variant proteins to the <italic>hfq</italic> TIR by mobility shift assay using an RNA fragment extending from the P3<italic>hfq</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>) to the nucleotides specifying the 12th amino acid of the <italic>hfq</italic> coding region, <italic>hfq</italic>(1&#x02013;101). <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> column (b) shows that Hfqwt and HfqV43C bind the <italic>hfq</italic>(1&#x02013;101) RNA fragment with the same affinity, while HfqV43R has a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value 3.5-fold higher. In conclusion, direct measurements of Hfq cellular levels, expression of the <italic>hfq::lacZ</italic> translational fusion and Hfq TIR binding experiments gave consistent results, which, in spite of the modesty of the effects, support the idea that Hfq represses its own synthesis about 1.7 times. The results indicate that HfqV43R partly lost the capacity to exert the autocontrol probably because it poorly binds the 5&#x02032;-part of its own mRNA. Given that HfqV43C appears to be synthesized at higher level than Hfqwt from the pCL plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), it remains to be confirmed that this substitution possibly also affects Hfq autoregulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular dynamics</title><p>Because affinity and functional defects of the HfqV43R protein may result from folding or oligomerization defaults, we investigated the impact of this change on Hfq structure by performing MD simulations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows the root-mean square deviations (RMSDs) of the backbone C alpha atoms with respect to the minimized structures as a function of time for the three Hfq proteins (Hfqwt, HfqV43C and HfqV43R). The minimized structures of both variants deviate by 0.2 &#x0212b; from that of wild-type Hfq. All proteins behave similarly with RMSD versus time and fluctuate around 2 &#x0212b;. Analysis of the MD-generated secondary structure shows, however, significant differences between the three Hfqs. Supplementary Table 3 reports the average and standard deviation of the helix and the five &#x003b2;-strands for each Hfq protein using the DSSP program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). The statistics are very similar for the wild-type and HfqV43C proteins, but show a significant decrease in the strands B3 and B4 for V43R, with the mean percentage of B4 being 74% in R43 versus 90, 91% in wild-type and C43. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows a representative MD-generated structure of each Hfq sequence and the destabilizing effect of V43R on the strands B3 and B4. Complementing these analyses, we have followed the percentage of intramolecular/intermolecular side chain contacts in all variants. As expected, V43C does not change the native intramolecular/intermolecular contacts involving residue 43. In contrast, the V43R substitution has no effect on the intermolecular contacts responsible for oligomerization but disrupts the intramolecular interactions between residue 43 (strand B3) and residues Y55 (strand B4) and K56. This disruption destabilizes the strands B3 and B4 and changes the side chain positions of the K56 and the Y55 residues involved in the binding to a AU5G RNA and a 27 nt poly(A) oligomer, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present report shows that a single substitution in the Hfq polypeptide weakens the affinity of the protein for a polyadenylated mRNA and the <italic>hfq</italic> TIR, decreases the activation of PAP elongation, abolishes stimulation of RpoS expression and repression of its own synthesis while, in contrast, it does not impair repression of <italic>oppA</italic> expression.</p><p>Although both crystallographic data and sequence comparison suggest that D40, F42 and K56 may be involved in oligoribonucleotide binding by analogy with <italic>S.aureus</italic> Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and Lsm&#x02013;RNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>), none of these residues independently changed to alanine, modified Hfq interaction with polyadenylated RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our data are consistent with recent experiments showing that these single mutations, which all are supposed to disrupt the RNA binding site surrounding the central channel of the homohexameric ring, have minor effect on binding of a A27 oligomer and of an <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). Moreover, a double mutation D40A&#x02013;F42A still allows Hfq to bind RNA as strongly as the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As to the K56A substitution, it was shown to affect binding to the small DsrA RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). This fact allowed Mikulecky <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>) to propose that Hfq harbours two binding sites, one on the proximal face involving K56 and another on the distal face interacting with poly(A). We suggest that the Hfq interaction with the 3&#x02032;-<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)18 RNA may be realized via the distal face and with another amino acid within the binding site of the proximal face.</p><p>While the K56A substitution did not affect Hfq interaction with the polyadenylated RNA, we found that a single valine to arginine substitution at position 43 increased the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value 35 times for the same RNA. Moreover, a valine to cysteine substitution at the same position did not alter the RNA affinity. No role in RNA binding was previously assigned to residue 43. Because the bulky residue may affect folding and subunit interactions, we next investigated whether the V43R substitution affects the structure of the protein. MD studies indicate that this replacement destabilizes the strands B3 and B4 and induces reorientation of K56 and Y55 side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) but does not affect the stability of the protein. The fact that the V43C substitution does not affect the interaction with the polyadenylated RNA indicates that the V43 residue is not directly involved in the binding. Nevertheless, arginine 43 may modify the proximal site containing Y55 and K56 and/or the capability of RNA to interact with the two RNA binding sites. Since our data show that K56 does not interact with 3&#x02032;-<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)18, it is possible that this RNA interacts with Y55. This is consistent with the fact that a Y55A substitution reduces the affinity of Hfq for a A27 oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). Furthermore, the crystal structure of Hfq associated with AU5G allows to hypothesize that Y55 may interact with an adenine residue of an A-rich oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Alternatively, the insertion of the bulky, positively charged arginine may result in modification of the protein surface and, therefore, impedes the simultaneous binding of the polyadenylated RNA to the proximal and distal faces of the protein. It is worth recalling here that the very strong affinity of Hfq for the polyadenylated RNA presumably reflects simultaneous binding to several sites on the surface of Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>).</p><p>HfqV43R overproduction affects cell growth and reduces expression of <italic>rpoS::lacZ</italic> fusion protein in the presence of the wild-type allele. This phenomenon corresponds to the dominant negative effect which was already observed for multimeric proteins acting as repressors or activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Since modelling predicts that the overall structure of the homohexamer is not perturbed by the V43R substitution, we assume that wild-type and HfqV43R subunits could assemble to form heterohexamers, the biological functions of which are impaired. At present, it is the only possible explanation for the dominant negative effect of mutated oligomeric proteins in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative immunoblots, measurement of binding efficiency and comparative analysis of the <italic>hfq&#x02013;lacZ</italic> translation efficiency in <italic>hfq</italic><sup>+</sup> versus <italic>hfq</italic>V43R strains argue in favour of modulation of the <italic>hfq</italic> translation by Hfqwt and the loss of this ability in the case of HfqV43R. However, since Hfq can bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and has been shown to be associated with HN-S and RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) we cannot exclude that Hfq may also control its own expression at the transcriptional level. Tsui and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) previously proposed that Hfq modulates its own synthesis. Our data indicate that this modulation, at least partly, takes place at the translational level and that the translational operator region may be restricted to a region present in the transcripts initiated from the <italic>hfq</italic> promoters functional during exponential growth. It is neither clear, however, whether Hfq binding competes with formation of the translation initiation complex as was proposed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>), induces refolding of the mRNA to facilitate degradation or delivers RNase E within the RNase E&#x02013;Hfq complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) nor whether <italic>hfq</italic> mRNA is targeted by a small RNA. It must be recalled here that Hfq represses very modestly its own synthesis, with a repression factor about 2. This may reflect the fact that Hfq which is implicated in many mechanisms involving various RNAs has a lot of targets in the cell without a strict preference to its own mRNA.</p><p>OppA is a periplasmic component involved in the transport of nutritional peptides and in the sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). It was previously reported that GcvB ncRNA co-immunoprecipitates with Hfq and represses <italic>oppA</italic> expression by sequestering the ribosome binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). As numerous data show that multiple functions of Hfq as a regulator of gene expression are realized via its interaction with small RNAs, it is reasonable to expect that GcvB exerts repression of OppA expression in concert with Hfq. Consistent with this idea, we show here that negative regulation of OppA synthesis takes place only in the presence of Hfq. Interestingly, the V43R mutation does not abrogate this function. Secondary structure predictions suggest that GcvB possesses U-rich single-stranded sequences which may be equally well bound by Hfqwt and HfqV43R. It remains to be determined whether Hfq acts by promoting pairing between GcvB and the <italic>oppA</italic> mRNA or by stabilizing GcvB. Yet, we cannot completely exclude that Hfq facilitates degradation of the <italic>oppA</italic> mRNA by delivering RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>Hfq is an important regulator of gene expression through its RNA chaperon activity, the mechanism of which is still poorly understood. In particular, it is not clear how the protein interacts with its targets and facilitates RNA&#x02013;RNA annealing. The HfqV43R protein is affected in RNA binding and in some, but not all Hfq functions. Among them, stimulation of RpoS expression and repression of OppA synthesis were shown to involve ncRNAs but only RpoS stimulation was affected by the V43R substitution. We concluded that the V43R substitution affects RpoS expression, probably by impairing the interaction of Hfq with an ncRNA, while it only marginally modifies the GcvB mediated regulation of OppA. Interestingly, this suggests that the GcvB and DsrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>) RNAs may bind Hfq differently. We thus hypothesize that there are several ways for ncRNAs to accommodate the different binding sites of the Hfq protein.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_34_2_709__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_34_2_709__1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_34_2_709__gkj464_NAR-02259-A-2005.R2Figure1Sup.tif"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to J.
