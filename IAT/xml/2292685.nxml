The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of the <italic>MAL </italic>(T-cell differentiation protein) gene as an early epigenetic diagnostic marker for colorectal tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) the promoter methylation status of <italic>MAL </italic>was analyzed in 218 samples, including normal mucosa (n = 44), colorectal adenomas (n = 63), carcinomas (n = 65), and various cancer cell lines (n = 46). Direct bisulphite sequencing was performed to confirm the MSP results. <italic>MAL </italic>gene expression was investigated with real time quantitative analyses before and after epigenetic drug treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis of MAL was done using normal colon mucosa samples (n = 5) and a tissue microarray with 292 colorectal tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Bisulphite sequencing revealed that the methylation was unequally distributed within the <italic>MAL </italic>promoter and by MSP analysis a region close to the transcription start point was shown to be hypermethylated in the majority of colorectal carcinomas (49/61, 80%) as well as in adenomas (45/63, 71%). In contrast, only a minority of the normal mucosa samples displayed hypermethylation (1/23, 4%). The hypermethylation of <italic>MAL </italic>was significantly associated with reduced or lost gene expression in <italic>in vitro </italic>models. Furthermore, removal of the methylation re-induced gene expression in colon cancer cell lines. Finally, MAL protein was expressed in epithelial cells of normal colon mucosa, but not in the malignant cells of the same type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Promoter hypermethylation of <italic>MAL </italic>was present in the vast majority of benign and malignant colorectal tumors, and only rarely in normal mucosa, which makes it suitable as a diagnostic marker for early colorectal tumorigenesis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Epigenetic changes &#x02013; non-sequence-based alterations that are inherited through cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] &#x02013; are frequently seen in human cancers, and likewise as genetic alterations they may lead to disruption of gene function. In colorectal cancer, several tumour suppressor genes have been identified to be epigenetically inactivated by CpG island promoter hypermethylation, including the DNA mismatch repair gene <italic>MLH1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the gatekeeper <italic>APC </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and the cell cycle inhibitor <italic>CDKN2A </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], to mention some. In addition to contributing to, or accompanying, the stepwise development of malignant colorectal carcinomas from benign adenomas, aberrant DNA methylation holds great promises for cancer diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Based on the ubiquity of aberrant promoter methylation and the ability to detect this methylated DNA in body fluids, such as blood, the presence of this altered DNA may represent potential diagnostic biomarkers for cancer. For non-invasive detection of colorectal tumours, stool is the obvious source of DNA for such investigations and several studies have identified cancer-derived aberrant DNA hypermethylation using this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are still suboptimal and would benefit from incorporating additional biomarkers.</p><p>We recently published a list of promising novel target genes for hypermethylation in colorectal tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Among these was the <italic>MAL </italic>(T-cell differentiation protein) gene, and we then communicated that the CpG rich promoter of <italic>MAL </italic>seemed to be hypermethylated in the majority of colorectal tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>MAL </italic>gene, which was initially isolated and cloned in 1987, maps to chromosome band 2cen-q13, encodes a 17 kDa integral membrane protein, and contains a CpG island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Originally, expression of <italic>MAL </italic>was found in intermediate and late stages of T-cell differentiation, and MAL was suggested to play a role in membrane signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In recent years, MAL has also been shown to play a role in apical transport, which is a polarized transport of lipids and proteins to the apical (external facing) membrane in certain cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Such polarized transport is essential for the proper functioning of epithelial cells, and the neoplastic transformation process is frequently associated with loss of this polarized phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Finally, MAL has been shown to possess tumour suppressor capabilities by suppressing motility, invasion, and tumorigenicity and enhance apoptosis in oesophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we have compared the promoter methylation status of <italic>MAL </italic>in a large series of normal colorectal mucosa samples, with those of benign and malignant colorectal tumours. Furthermore, RNA and/or protein expression levels of MAL were determined in <italic>in vivo </italic>tumours as well as in <italic>in vitro </italic>models, the latter also including various cancer types. The findings were used to decide whether or not methylated <italic>MAL </italic>is suitable as a diagnostic marker for early colorectal tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and cell lines</title><p>DNA from 218 fresh-frozen samples was subjected to methylation analysis, including 65 colorectal carcinomas (36 micro satellite stable; MSS, and 29 with micro satellite instability; MSI) from 64 patients, 63 adenomas, median size 8 mm, range 5&#x02013;50 mm (61 MSS and 2 MSI) from 52 patients, 21 normal mucosa samples from 21 colorectal cancer patients (taken from distant sites from the primary carcinoma), and another 23 normal colorectal mucosa samples from 22 cancer-free individuals, along with 20 colon cancer cell lines (11 MSS and 9 MSI), and 26 cancer cell lines from various tissues (breast, kidney, ovary, pancreas, prostate, and uterus; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The mean age at diagnosis was 70 years (range 33 to 92) for patients with carcinoma, 67 years (range 62 to 72) for persons with adenomas, 64 years (ranging from 24 to 89) for the first group of normal mucosa donors, and 54 years (ranging from 33 to 86) for the second group of normal mucosa donors. The colorectal carcinomas and normal samples from cancer patients were obtained from an unselected prospective series collected from seven hospitals located in the South-East region of Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The adenomas were obtained from individuals attending a population based sigmoidoscopic screening program for colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The normal mucosa samples from cancer-free individuals were obtained from deceased persons, and the majority of the total set of normal samples (27/44) consisted of mucosa only, whereas the remaining samples were taken from the bowel wall. Additional clinico-pathological data for the current tumour series include gender and tumour location, as well as polyp size and total number of polyps per individual for the adenoma

The adenomas and carcinomas analyzed in the present study are from unselected clinical series and are therefore representative for the average risk population. However, the equal distribution between MSI and MSS carcinomas in the present study is not representative for a consecutive series.</p><p>Hypermethylation of <italic>MAL </italic>has, by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), previously been shown by others to be present only in a small fraction (6%, 2/34) of colon carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], even though the expression of <italic>MAL </italic>was reported to be reduced/lost in the majority of colorectal tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In contrast, we report here a significantly higher methylation frequency of <italic>MAL </italic>in both benign and malignant colorectal tumours (71% in adenomas and 80% in carcinomas). The discrepancy in methylation frequencies between the present report and the previous study by Mori and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] is probably a consequence of study design. From direct bisulphite sequencing of colon cancer cell lines, we have now shown that the DNA methylation of <italic>MAL </italic>is unequally distributed within the CpG island of its promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). CpG islands often span more than one kilobase of the gene promoter, and the methylation status within this region is sometimes mistakenly assumed to be equally distributed. This is exemplified by the <italic>MLH1 </italic>gene in which hypermethylation of a limited number of CpG sites approximately 200 base pairs upstream of the transcription start point invariably correlates with the lack of gene expression, while other sites do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Since the results of an MSP analysis rely on the match or mismatch of the unmethylated and methylated primer sequences to bisulphite treated DNA, one should ensure that the primers anneal to relevant CpG sites in the gene promoter. In the present study, we designed the MSP primers close to the transcription start point of the gene (-72 to +70) and found, by bisulphite sequencing, concordance between the overall methylation status of <italic>MAL </italic>as assessed by MSP and the methylation status of the individual CpG sites covered by our MSP primer set (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This part of the CpG island was hypermethylated in the majority of colon cancer cell lines (95%). We also found that these cell lines, as well as those of other tissues, showed loss of <italic>MAL </italic>RNA expression from quantitative real time analyses, and that removal of DNA hypermethylation by the combined treatment of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and Trichostatin A re-induced the expression of <italic>MAL </italic>in colon cancer cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Furthermore, by analyzing a large series of clinically representative samples by protein immunohistochemistry we confirmed that the expression of MAL was lost in malignant colorectal epithelial cells as compared to normal mucosa.</p><p>We have further analyzed the same region of the <italic>MAL </italic>promoter as Mori <italic>et al.</italic>, which is located -206 to -126 base pairs upstream of the transcription start point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. By direct bisulphite sequencing, we showed that only a minority of the CpG sites covered by the Mori antisense primer were methylated in the 19 colon cancer cell lines that were heavily methylated around the transcription start point (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We therefore conclude that the very low (six percent) methylation frequency initially reported for <italic>MAL </italic>in colon carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] is most likely a consequence of the primer design and choice of CpG sites to be examined.</p><p>Inactivating hypermethylation of the <italic>MAL </italic>promoter might be prevalent also in other cancer types where low expression of <italic>MAL </italic>has been shown not to correlate with allelic loss or somatic mutations in the <italic>MAL </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the present study, hypermethylated <italic>MAL </italic>was found in cancer cell lines from breast, kidney, ovary, and uterus.</p><p>The present analyses of cancer cell lines from seven tissues indicate that the hypermethylation of a limited area in the proximity of the transcription start point of <italic>MAL </italic>is associated with reduced or lost gene expression. However, among colorectal carcinomas and cell lines, MAL protein and gene expression seemed to be lost or reduced in all samples, including the minority with unmethylated <italic>MAL </italic>promoters. This underlines that loss of the MAL protein might have an important function in colorectal tumorigenesis and we hypothesize that early during colorectal neoplasia the gene is turned off by epigenetic mechanisms other than DNA methylation. The DNA methylation is subsequently recruited to the MAL promoter to "seal" the unexpressed state. Hence, it needs to be established whether <italic>MAL </italic>promoter hypermethylation is a cause or a consequence of the observed loss of gene expression in colorectal tumors. This is interesting from a biological &#x02013; but not necessarily a diagnostic &#x02013; perspective. The distinction between the two is supported by the fact that one of the most promising diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer reported so far, DNA hypermethylation of the vimentin (<italic>VIM</italic>) gene, is not expected to alter the gene expression, nor to confer a selective advantage upon cancer cells in the colon, considering the lack of <italic>VIM </italic>expression by normal colonic epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>A sensitive non-invasive screening approach for colorectal cancer could markedly improve the clinical outcome for the patient. Such a diagnostic test could in principle measure the status of a single biomarker, although multiple markers are probably needed to achieve sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Several studies have successfully detected such tumour-specific products in the faeces, and most experience has been with mutant genetic markers, including <italic>APC</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, and BAT-26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, one of the most promising faecal DNA tests so far consisted of a combination of a genetic DNA integrity assay and an epigenetic <italic>VIM </italic>methylation assay, resulting in 88% sensitivity and 82% specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This panel might be further improved by implementing <italic>MAL </italic>and/or, as suggested by others, the <italic>SFRP2 </italic>marker, which has an independent sensitivity and specificity of 77% in faecal DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Hypermethylation of the <italic>MAL </italic>promoter represents, to the best of our knowledge, the most frequently hypermethylated gene among pre-malignant colorectal lesions, accompanied by low methylation frequencies in normal colon mucosa. The presence of such epigenetic changes in pre-malignant tissues might also have implications for cancer chemoprevention. By inhibiting or reversing these epigenetic alterations, the progression to a malignant phenotype might be prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].
