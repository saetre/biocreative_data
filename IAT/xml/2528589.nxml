During biosynthetic delivery, some cargo proteins move from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) into recycling endosomes (RE) before being delivered to the plasma membrane. However, proteins that regulate this transport step remained elusive. In this study, we show that Rab13 partially colocalizes with TGN38 at the TGN and transferrin receptors in RE. Knockdown of Rab13 with short hairpin RNA in human bronchial epithelial cells or overexpression of dominant-active or dominant-negative alleles of Rab13 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells disrupts TGN38/46 localization at the TGN. Moreover, overexpression of Rab13 mutant alleles inhibits surface arrival of proteins that move through RE during biosynthetic delivery (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein [VSVG], A-VSVG, and LDLR-CT27). Importantly, proteins using a direct route from the TGN to the plasma membrane are not affected. Thus, Rab13 appears to regulate membrane trafficking between TGN and RE.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CHX, cycloheximide; FcR, FcII-B2 receptor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HBE, human bronchial epithelial; LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; RE, recycling endosomes; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; TfnR, transferrin receptor; VSVG, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Polarized epithelial cells exhibit two functionally and biochemically distinct plasma membrane domains, which are separated by tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nelson, 2003</xref>). To maintain this apical/basolateral polarity, cells must constantly sort transmembrane proteins to the correct locations during biosynthetic and endocytic delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">F&#x000f6;lsch, 2008</xref>). Sorting of internalized cargo takes place in perinuclear recycling enzymes (RE), whereas sorting of newly synthesized cargo takes place at the TGN or in RE (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cancino et al., 2007</xref>). For example, a cargo thought to follow a direct pathway from the TGN to the apical membrane is influenza HA (hereafter referred to as HA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fullekrug and Simons, 2004</xref>), and basolateral cargos thought to follow a direct pathway are FcII-B2 receptors (FcR) and a mutant low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR[Y18A]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Simmen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fields et al., 2007</xref>). These cargos are either segregated into glycolipid rafts (HA) or may interact with adaptor proteins that are recruited to the TGN such as AP-4 (LDLR[Y18A]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Simmen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fullekrug and Simons, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fields et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, cargos moving from the TGN into RE during biosynthetic delivery to the plasma membrane are vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG), an apical variant of VSVG (A-VSVG), and a truncated version of LDLR (LDLR-CT27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fields et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gravotta et al., 2007</xref>). At RE, cargos destined for the basolateral membrane frequently rely on the epithelial cell-specific adaptor complex AP-1B for sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">F&#x000f6;lsch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fields et al., 2007</xref>), whereas cargo destined for the apical membrane may segregate into Rab11-positive apical RE before being delivered to the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mostov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson et al., 2007</xref>). Other transmembrane proteins such as the TGN resident protein TGN38 may travel through RE after internalization from the plasma membrane on their way back to the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghosh et al., 1998</xref>). Despite our increasing knowledge of proteins that traffic between the TGN and RE, we know virtually nothing about the proteins regulating this step.</p><p>In general, membrane trafficking is regulated by small GTPases of the Ras superfamily. For example, in yeast, the Rab protein Sec4p regulates exocytic transport to the emerging bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Novick and Guo, 2002</xref>). Among the closest mammalian homologues of Sec4p are Rab8, Rab10, and Rab13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pereira-Leal and Seabra, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buvelot Frei et al., 2006</xref>). In polarized epithelial cells, Rab8 plays a role in exocytosis of AP-1B&#x02013;dependent cargo from the RE to the basolateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ang et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, Rab8a activity is necessary for the outgrowth of the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yoshimura et al., 2007</xref>). Likewise, Rab10 regulates endosomal sorting of internalized cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babbey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2006</xref>), and/or surface delivery of newly synthesized basolateral cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schuck et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, Rab13 seems to regulate tight junction integrity. In MDCK cells stably expressing dominant-active Rab13Q67L but not dominant-negative Rab13T22N, mutants delayed tight junction formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marzesco et al., 2002</xref>). This effect might be caused by impaired endocytic recycling of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin, and down-regulation of PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marzesco et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yamamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kohler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morimoto et al., 2005</xref>). However, these studies did not address whether Rab13 might also play a role during biosynthetic delivery of transmembrane proteins. Here, we show that Rab13 regulates surface delivery of cargos that travel through RE during biosynthetic delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To test whether Rab13 affects cell polarity, we microinjected V5-tagged Rab13Q67L or V5-tagged Rab13T22N cDNAs into filter-grown, fully polarized MDCK cells. Neither Rab13Q67L nor Rab13T22N overexpression disrupted basolateral localization of the marker protein gp58 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Furthermore, tight junction assembly as judged by ZO-1 staining and cilium biogenesis were not affected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Therefore, within the short times (4 h) of overexpression achieved by microinjection, the overall polarity is unaffected, in contrast to previous studies, which were based on prolonged overexpression (&#x0003e;24 h) of Rab13 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marzesco et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morimoto et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of Rab13 mutants affects surface delivery of VSVG.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Filter-grown MDCK cells were microinjected with cDNAs encoding V5-Rab13Q67L or V5-Rab13T22N alone or together with cDNAs encoding VSVG-CFPts045 (see text for details).

As a transmembrane protein, VSVG passes through the canonical biosynthetic pathway, from the ER and Golgi to the TGN. It then traverses the RE, from which it is sorted to the basolateral membrane in the AP-1B pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3 and 3b</xref>). Filter-grown MDCK cells were coinjected with cDNAs encoding Rab13 mutants and a CFP-tagged, temperature-sensitive mutant of VSVG (VSVG-CFPts045; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Toomre et al., 1999</xref>). Cells were incubated for 2 h at the nonpermissive temperature of 39&#x000b0;C, at which VSVG accumulated in the ER, whereas Rab13 mutants were produced in the cytosol. To release VSVG from the ER for surface delivery, cells were shifted to 31&#x000b0;C for 2 h in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) to prevent further protein synthesis. VSVG localized at the plasma membrane was detected with antibodies recognizing its ectodomain before fixation. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained for Rab13 and total VSVG. Although VSVG arrived at the basolateral surface in control cells, coinjection of either mutant allele severely blocked surface delivery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). We noted that the signal intensity of total VSVG also decreased, which perhaps indicates a missorting into lysosomes. Therefore, we incubated the cells with lysosomal inhibitors (50 &#x003bc;M ammonium chloride) and proteasomal inhibitors (3 mM MG132) to inhibit protein degradation during the chase. This treatment enhanced the signal for VSVG without restoring surface delivery (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802176/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802176/DC1</ext-link>). Overall, we observed impaired surface delivery in 98% of cells analyzed expressing Rab13Q67L and in 97% of cells expressing Rab13T22N (Fig. S1 C).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Rab13 overexpression affects selective cargos.</bold> (A) The model depicts trafficking pathways between the TGN and plasma membrane domains (see text for details). (B&#x02013;F) Fully polarized MDCK cells were coinjected with cDNAs encoding V5-Rab13Q67L or V5-Rab13T22N and cDNAs encoding various reporter proteins. (B and C) cDNAs encoding V5-Rab13 mutants were coinjected with cDNAs encoding either LDLR-CT27 (B) or LDLR(Y18A) (C). Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C followed by 4 h at 20&#x000b0;C and 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C with CHX, and then stained for Rab13 and surface LDLR.

Cells were incubated at 39&#x000b0;C for 2 h followed by 2 h at 20&#x000b0;C in the presence of CHX. During the 20&#x000b0;C incubation, VSVG exited the ER and became trapped in the Golgi. Specimens were fixed and immunolabeled for the cis-Golgi marker GM130, GFP, and V5-Rab13. There was no discernible difference in the transport of VSVG into the Golgi as judged by colocalization of VSVG and GM130 in control cells and those coinjected with Rab13 mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Colocalization was observed in virtually 100% of cells analyzed independent of Rab13 overexpression. Thus, Rab13 may function in surface delivery of proteins downstream of the Golgi.</p><p>To narrow down which post-Golgi trafficking steps might be regulated by Rab13, we tested the effect of Rab13 overexpression by microinjection on the surface delivery of other reporter proteins. First, we analyzed LDLR-CT27, which is sorted to the basolateral membrane similar to VSVG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3 and 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fields et al., 2007</xref>). We found that surface delivery of LDLR-CT27 was severely inhibited by both Rab13Q67L (93% of cells analyzed) and Rab13T22N (90% of cells analyzed) overexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2 B</xref> and S1 C). Next, we tested LDLR(Y18A) and FcR, receptors that are thought to travel directly from the TGN to the basolateral surface independent of AP-1B function (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roush et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fields et al., 2007</xref>). Overexpression of Rab13 mutants had no effect on surface delivery of LDLR(Y18A) or FcR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested influenza HA and an apical mutant of VSVG (A-VSVG). Although the HA protein is sorted directly from the TGN to the apical membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schuck and Simons, 2004</xref>), A-VSVG moves through RE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3 and 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ang et al., 2004</xref>). We found no inhibition of surface delivery for HA in the presence of overexpressed Rab13 mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of Rab13Q67L or Rab13T22N severely inhibited surface delivery of A-VSVG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Again, we found decreased fluorescent signals of A-VSVG in the cells. However, as was the case for VSVG, inhibition of protein degradation with ammonium chloride (50 &#x003bc;M) and MG132 (3 mM) raised the signal intensity without rescuing surface delivery (Fig. S1 B). The lack of surface arrival for A-VSVG was observed in 100% of cells analyzed expressing Rab13Q67L and in 100% of cells analyzed expressing Rab13T22N (Fig. S1 C).</p><p>Collectively, we found that cargos that travel to the surface via RE (LDLR-CT27, VSVG, and A-VSVG) were stalled within the cells upon overexpression of Rab13 mutants. In contrast, cargos not traversing the RE, such as the basolateral cargos LDLR(Y18A) and FcR as well as the apical cargo HA, were not affected. Because both VSVG and its apical variant A-VSVG were affected, Rab13 appears to function between the TGN and RE, as opposed to regulating post-RE trafficking pathways, which are different for VSVG and A-VSVG.</p><p>Because Rab13 appears to function at the TGN or RE, we sought to determine its detailed intracellular location. To this end, we used defective adenoviruses to express low levels of wild-type, GFP-tagged Rab13 (GFP-Rab13) in MDCK cells grown on coverslips. Coinfection with defective adenoviruses encoding GFP-Rab13 and &#x003bc;1A-HA or &#x003bc;1B-myc was used to monitor Rab13's localization relative to AP-1A or AP-1B, respectively. Rab13 colocalized with AP-1A at the TGN in 97 &#x000b1; 7% of cells analyzed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Note that although Rab13 did not colocalize entirely with AP-1A, almost all AP-1A staining colocalized with Rab13. In addition, Rab13 partially colocalized with AP-1B in RE in 76 &#x000b1; 15% of cells analyzed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). We then analyzed Rab13 staining versus TGN38 (a marker for AP-1A&#x02013;positive TGN) and transferrin receptor (TfnR; a marker for AP-1B&#x02013;positive RE) in the same cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">F&#x000f6;lsch et al., 2003</xref>). Again, Rab13 partially colocalized with both TGN38 (98 &#x000b1; 3% of cells analyzed) and TfnR (95 &#x000b1; 8% of cells analyzed; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Furthermore, we found no colocalization between Rab13 and GM130 (not depicted). In addition to TGN/RE localization, some Rab13 stained the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>, arrows; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marzesco et al., 2002</xref>). Because Rab proteins localize to both donor and acceptor membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins, 2003</xref>), the partial localization of Rab13 at the TGN and RE supports our hypothesis that Rab13 functions at the interface between TGN and RE in addition to its described function at the tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marzesco et al., 2002</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Intracellular localization of Rab13.</bold> MDCK cells grown on coverslips were infected with defective adenoviruses encoding GFP-V5-Rab13 wild type together with defective adenoviruses encoding &#x003bc;1A-HA (A), &#x003bc;1B-myc (B), or TGN38 (C). 24 h (C) or 36 h (A and B) after infection, cells were fixed and stained for HA, myc, TfnR, or TGN38.

Bars, 10 &#x003bc;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820845f03"></graphic></fig><p>Next, we tested whether overexpression of Rab13 mutants might affect the TGN. We coinjected Rab13Q67L or Rab13T22N cDNAs together with TGN38 cDNAs into MDCK cells grown on coverslips. TGN38 is localized at the TGN in cells coinjected with an unrelated plasmid (mRFP-FcR cDNA; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), whereas coexpression of Rab13Q67L or Rab13T22N dispersed TGN38 localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref> and not depicted). This phenotype was observed in 97% of cells analyzed for Rab13Q67L and &#x0223c;80% of the cells analyzed for Rab13T22N (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). In addition, TGN38 might be misrouted into lysosomes because staining intensities also decreased. This effect was specific because overexpression of Rab13 mutants by microinjection had no discernible effect on the localization of GM130, &#x003b3;-adaptin (AP-1A and AP-1B), TfnR, or AP-3 (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802176/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802176/DC1</ext-link>, and not depicted). Interestingly, the TGN marker protein furin was also not affected upon overexpression of Rab13 mutants by microinjection (Fig. S2 D), which indicates that perhaps only a subdomain of the TGN is affected by Rab13 or that only the retrieval pathway of TGN38, but not the retrieval pathway of furin, is inhibited by Rab13 overexpression.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of Rab13 mutants disrupts TGN38.</bold> (A&#x02013;D) MDCK cells grown on coverslips were microinjected with cDNAs encoding TGN38 or mRFP-FcR (A), or TGN38 together with cDNAs encoding V5-Rab13Q67L (B), T7-Rab8Q67L (C), or T7-Rab10Q68L (D).

Notably, cells transiently overexpressing Rab13Q67L for prolonged times may compensate by expressing more GM130, as judged by its more intense GM130 staining (Fig. S3 A). Although this phenotype prevented us from using defective adenoviruses for biochemical analysis, this finding might reconcile our data with the published literature. Over time, disruption of the Golgi may lead to polarity defects. In addition, overexpression of Rab13Q67L may lead to tight junction defects perhaps caused by enhanced delivery of activated Rab13 to the tight junctions. Importantly, our study is the first one to demonstrate any phenotype for the Rab13T22N allele. Therefore, it seems likely that Rab13's primary function may be in controlling membrane trafficking between TGN and RE.</p><p>To confirm Rab13's effects on the TGN by an independent assay, we knocked down Rab13 in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells (the 16HBE14o<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain was used). Like MDCK cells, this cell line expresses Rab13 and &#x003bc;1B based on RT-PCR, and fully polarized HBE cells sort LDLR-CT27 to the basolateral membrane and grow out a single primary cilium (unpublished data). In addition, HBE cells form ZO-1 containing tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kizhatil et al., 2007</xref>). We obtained three GFP-tagged short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs targeting Rab13 and one control construct targeting glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Thermo Fisher Scientific. To test knockdown capacities, shRNA constructs were transfected into HBE cells together with a dual expression plasmid encoding both monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) and T7-tagged Rab13 from different promoters. 48 h after transfection, cells were immunolabeled for Rab13 and analyzed by confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). We then calculated values for Rab13 knockdown as described in Materials and methods. Constructs Rab13 Nos. 1 and 3 decreased Rab13 expression by 87 and 82% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>), respectively, whereas construct No. 2 was not effective (not depicted). Next, we tested the effect of Rab13 knockdown on endogenous TGN46 and GM130. We observed a disruption and/or loss of TGN46 staining in &#x0223c;57% of cells analyzed for construct No. 1 and in &#x0223c;80% of cells analyzed for construct No. 3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). These data indicate that Rab13 is indeed necessary for the maintenance of TGN38/46 localization at the TGN. Interestingly, as was the case with prolonged Rab13 overexpression, knockdown of Rab13 also led to a disruption/loss of GM130 staining in 43% of cells analyzed for construct No. 1 and 62% of cells analyzed for construct No. 3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Recently, it was shown that Rab13 knockdown in MDCK cells disrupted tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yamamura et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, it seems that prolonged overexpression and knockdown of Rab13 share the same phenotypes in disrupting TGN38/46 and GM130 localization at the TGN/Golgi together with impairing tight junctions. This is in contrast to acute overexpression by microinjection, which leaves the tight junctions and the Golgi mainly intact.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Knockdown of Rab13 in HBE cells disrupts TGN46 and GM130.</bold> (A) HBE cells grown on coated coverslips were cotransfected with plasmids encoding shRNA constructs and dual-expression plasmids encoding mRFP and T7-Rab13. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed and stained for Rab13.

Therefore, the inhibition of surface delivery is unique to Rab13. To test whether Rab13 may have an equally unique function in TGN38 localization, we injected cDNAs encoding Rab8 or Rab10 mutants together with plasmids encoding TGN38 into MDCK cells and analyzed TGN38 localization. Neither Rab8Q67L nor Rab10Q68L or Rab10T23N had any discernible effects on TGN38 localization in &#x0003e;90% of cells analyzed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C&#x02013;E</xref>; and not depicted). Interestingly, when Rab8T22N was coinjected with TGN38 cDNA, &#x0223c;50% of the cells lacked TGN38 staining (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Note, during biosynthetic delivery of AP-1B cargos, only Rab8Q67L, but not Rab8T22N, showed any effects on basolateral delivery from RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ang et al., 2003</xref>). However, because Rab8 localizes in RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ang et al., 2003</xref>), overexpression of Rab8T22N might interfere with retrieval pathways back to the TGN from early endosomes through RE. Regardless, the effects on TGN38 localization are most pronounced upon overexpression of both Rab13 mutants, indicating that Rab13's effects on TGN38 are specific for Rab13.</p><p>In summary, Rab13 clearly differs from its homologues Rab8 and Rab10 with respect to two key assays. First, overexpression of Rab13 mutants inhibited surface delivery in the biosynthetic pathway of both apical and basolateral cargos that move through RE as opposed to apical missorting of AP-1B&#x02013;dependent cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schuck et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, Rab13 appears to operate at an earlier membrane trafficking step distinct from Rab8 or Rab10. Second, in contrast to Rab13Q67L, neither Rab8Q67L nor Rab10Q68L showed any effects on TGN38 localization at the TGN. Having established a role for Rab13 at the interface between TGN and RE, we can now begin to analyze Rab13's interplay with known regulators of the TGN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cloning, RNAi constructs, and adenoviruses</title><p>The open reading frame of human Rab13 was cloned by coupled RT-PCR using the gene-specific PCR primers 5&#x02032;-ATATAAACATAACAAGATAAACATGGCCAAAGCCTACGAC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-TCTTCTTTTCTTCAGCCCAGGGAGCACTTG-3&#x02032;.
