Worldwide it causes around 2 million deaths every year, mostly in developing countries. Some 2 billion people&#x02014;or one-third of the world's population&#x02014;are chronically infected without active symptoms. In humans the disease is usually caused by a bacterium called <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content>. Another related bacterium, <italic>Mycobacterium bovis,</italic> causes TB in cattle and sometimes in people.</p><p>The immune system, which defends the body against infections, involves a number of cells (for example, the white blood cells) and also chemicals. People with defects in their immune system are more likely to suffer from infectious diseases. Cytokines are one class of chemicals in the immune system. A particular cytokine called interleukin-32 (IL-32) has been shown to play a role in the development of inflammation, which is a part of the body's response to infection. Previous research has suggested that IL-32 might be of particular importance in the defenses against TB. In recent years scientists have discovered a lot about the processes involved in the &#x0201c;switching on&#x0201d; of the individual parts of the immune system in response to infection. However, very little is known about the factors influencing the switching on of production of IL-32.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>It would be useful to know more about the production of IL-32 because it would advance understanding of the immune system in general and, more specifically, how the body protects itself against bacteria, such as those that cause TB.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>Working with eight healthy volunteers, the researchers took white blood cells of a particular type (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and exposed them to substances known as TLR agonists. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are receptors on the surface of leukocytes that recognize specific components of microorganisms. Upon recognition of these microbial components, which function as TLR stimuli (or TLR agonists), signals are transmitted that activate the immune system and thus the host defense. Using a complex series of laboratory procedures, they found that one type of TLR agonist (known as LPS) produced a big increase in IL-32 production, whereas all the other types of TLR agonists that they used produced only small increases. The researchers tested <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. bovis</named-content> bacteria to see whether they increased IL-32 production and they found that they did so, to a greater degree even than LPS. The researchers also learned other details about IL-32 and the pathway of chemical changes that eventually leads to its production.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>The researchers say their study provides several important insights into the biology of IL-32. The findings confirm that IL-32 is an important factor in the body's defenses against TB. This information will help in understanding how the disease spreads and who is most vulnerable to it. Ultimately, it may assist in the search for new ways of treating and preventing the disease.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030277">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030277</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The online encyclopedia Wikpedia has useful information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia also has useful information on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system">immune system</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>More detailed information about international efforts to control TB may be found at the Web sites of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iuatld.org">International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease</ext-link> and the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tb/en">World Health Organization's Stop TB Department</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Netea MG, Azam T, Lewis EC, Joosten LAB, Wang M, et al.

Steady-state levels of mRNA for IL-32 were present in freshly obtained blood PBMCs in the absence of culture or stimulants in healthy individuals, but also after 24 h of incubation. LPS and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> increased steady-state levels of IL-32 mRNA for isoforms &#x003b1; and &#x003b3; of the cytokine. Although the ability of LPS to induce the synthesis of IL-32 was moderate (3- to 4-fold increase), the mycobacteria <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. bovis</named-content> BCG induced up to a 20-fold increase in IL-32 synthesis over PBMCs cultured in the absence of mycobacteria. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the increase in IL-32 production by mycobacteria is dependent of the proinflammatory pathway involving active IL-18 induced by a caspase-1-dependent pathway. However, the role for IL-18 is primarily the production of IFN&#x003b3;, which in turn stimulates IL-32. Indeed, neutralization of endogenous IFN&#x003b3; prevents <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content>&#x02013;induced IL-32, and culturing PBMCs with exogenous IFN&#x003b3; increases IL-32 production 10-fold. We conclude that IFN&#x003b3; is the ultimate mediator of IL-32 synthesis induced by mycobacteria.</p><p>When PBMCs were stimulated with a large variety of TLR agonists and heat-killed microorganisms, mycobacteria were the most potent in inducing the synthesis of IL-32 in both whole blood and freshly isolated PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030277-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Of the TLR agonists, only the TLR4 stimulus LPS was able to stimulate moderate production of IL-32 (3- to 4-fold increase). These data suggest that while LPS/TLR4 interaction can increase transcription of IL-32 mRNA over that present in unstimulated cells, a second signal for synthesis is provided specifically by mycobacteria for the production of the protein. The specificity of IL-32 stimulation by mycobacteria, but not other microorganisms, is clinically significant since IL-32 is an IFN&#x003b3;-inducible gene, and IFN&#x003b3; pathway defects are accompanied by an increased susceptibility to infection with low-virulent mycobacteria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030277-b006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030277-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. This specificity suggests a potential role of IFN&#x003b3;-induced IL-32 in the host defense against mycobacterial infections. The findings are also suggestive of a role of IL-32 in mediating some of the consequences of mycobacterial stimulation.

We investigated whether stimulation of IL-32 by <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> is indeed mediated through synthesis of endogenous IFN&#x003b3;. Although the monocyte is the primary source of IL-32, lymphocytes are also required for optimal IL-32 synthesis. It is well established that lymphocytes and natural killer cells are the two main cell populations involved in the production and release of IFN&#x003b3; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030277-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

Because caspase-1 also inhibits processing of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; into an active mature form, it was necessary to exclude a role for endogenous IL-1&#x003b2; in the effects of the caspase-1 inhibitor. Unlike for IL-18, blockade of IL-1 by IL-1Ra had no effect on <italic>M. tuberculosis&#x02013;</italic>induced IL-32 production. The fact that IL-32 stimulation by <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> was mediated by the release of endogenous IFN&#x003b3; was further demonstrated by the blockade of IL-32 synthesis by a neutralizing antibody to IFN&#x003b3;. Thus, the chain of events leading to stimulation of IL-32 by <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> involves caspase-1-dependent IL-18 from monocytes, which stimulates production of IFN&#x003b3; from lymphocytes.

IL-32 mRNA of isoforms &#x003b1; and &#x003b3; was stimulated by both LPS and <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> while isoform &#x003b2; was quite strongly expressed in steady-state unstimulated cells, and was not further induced by stimulation. In contrast, IL-32 mRNA isoform &#x003b4; expression was heterogenous, both in terms of basal steady-state expression and response to stimulation. Even after 24 h of culture on a plastic surface, there was no IL-32 protein in the lysates. However, upon stimulation with LPS and mycobacteria, IL-32 protein concentration rose 4-fold and 20-fold, respectively. Since the ECL method for detecting IL-32 does not distinguish between the different isoforms, the IL-32 protein in the lysates could be due to any one of the isoforms.</p><p>The dissociated expression of the IL-32 gene and synthesis of the cytokine itself is reminiscent of the dissociation of IL-1&#x003b2; gene expression and synthesis in PBMCs.

However, the data in the present study suggest that unlike most mRNA coding for cytokines, IL-32 mRNA belongs to the class of proinflammatory cytokines that are regulated unless a second signal is provided. In addition, stronger IFN&#x003b3; stimulation by mycobacteria compared to other stimuli could also have played a role in the differential stimulation of IL-32. However, IFN&#x003b3; and IL-32 production were not completely correlated, as some microorganisms such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. albicans</named-content> induced IFN&#x003b3; production, yet they were incapable of stimulating IL-32 release.

However, the localized immunohistochemical staining of the cell membrane after stimulation with LPS or <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> suggests that IL-32 is a cell-associated cytokine, similar to other cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b1; or lymphotoxin-&#x003b1; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030277-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030277-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Both IL-32 (all isoforms) and IL-1&#x003b2; lack a classic signal peptide. Therefore, it is not unexpected that in stimulated blood monocytes there is no detectable IL-32 in the supernatant whereas the cell lysates contain nearly all of the measurable IL-32. Because LPS and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> stimulate caspase-1 cleavage of IL-1&#x003b2;, the lack of secreted IL-32 is consistent with the absence of a caspase-1 site in any of the isoforms of IL-32. In fact, the decrease in IL-32 synthesis in the presence of a caspase-1 inhibitor is not a direct effect of caspase-1 on IL-32 but rather on IL-18-induced IFN&#x003b3; production. In addition, there is no structural relationship between members of the IL-1 family and IL-32, also supporting the absence of caspase-1 cleavage sites in IL-32.</p><p>Several cytokines and growth factors lack a clear signal peptide and are not secreted, but nevertheless play a role in the pathogenesis of disease. For example, IL-1&#x003b1; is not secreted from monocytes following stimulation by LPS and other TLR agonists, despite the presence of large intracellular stores. Yet, IL-1&#x003b1; plays an important role in immune responses to specific antigens. Comparing mice deficient in IL-1&#x003b1; or IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-1&#x003b1; but not IL-1&#x003b2; was required for contact-allergen-specific T cell activation during the sensitization phase in contact hypersensitivity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030277-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, macrophages of mice deficient in IL-1&#x003b1; display defective phagocytosis and killing of <italic>C. albicans,</italic> which contributes to their increased susceptibility to disseminated infections in these mice (A. G. Vonk, M. G. Netea, J. H. van Krieken, Y. Iwakura, J.&#x02009;W. van der Meer, et al., unpublished data). Similarly, membrane-bound TNF&#x003b1; plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030277-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Another cytokine, acidic fibroblast growth factor also lacks a signal peptide and is found primarily in the cytosol. Yet, acidic fibroblast growth factor plays an important role in neural cell growth &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030277-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, although IL-32 appears to be mainly a cell-associated cytokine, its proinflammatory properties suggest important effects on inflammation and host defense.</p><p>An important issue relevant to the present study is the identity of the pattern-recognition receptors that trigger the translation the of IL-32 mRNA following stimulation with mycobacteria. The induction of IL-32 by LPS suggests that TLR4 may be involved, and this is consistent with the studies showing a role of TLR4 in the recognition of mycobacteria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030277-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. However, TLR4 alone is unlikely to be the sole pathway needed for IL-32 stimulation, given the less efficient induction of IL-32 by LPS compared with <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. bovis</named-content> BCG. It is therefore likely that a secondary pathway is activated by mycobacteria, which is needed in combination with TLR4 stimulation for the induction of IL-32. Further studies are needed to elucidate this aspect.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study give several important insights into the biology of IL-32. Firstly, mycobacteria species induce production of IL-32 from human monocytes and macrophages, while other microorganisms such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> and the fungal pathogens <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> do not. Secondly, this capacity of mycobacteria to stimulate IL-32 is mediated by their capacity to induce IFN&#x003b3;, a crucial cytokine of host defense against these microorganisms. Furthermore, IL-32 is a cell-associated cytokine, and in this form may exert its proinflammatory effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="ack1"><title/><p>We thank BioVeris Corporation for assistance with the ECL assays described in this study.</p><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author Contributions.</bold> MGN, DL, TO, SHK, and CAD designed the study.
