This physical barrier separates subepithelial mucosal immune cells such as lymphocytes and myeloid cells from a variety of antigenic substances present within the intestinal lumen (e.g. bacteria, bacterial products, food antigens) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Ley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Haller1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, the integrity of the epithelial barrier is essential for the maintenance of host homeostasis, as it prevents a dysregulated uptake of luminal antigens. The incidence and prevalence of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been increasing in developed countries worldwide over the last few decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Loftus1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Of note, the knowledge of basic molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to IBD has significantly increased over the past decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Hanauer1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, multiple studies support the concept that an improper activation of effector T cells in conjunction with insufficient regulatory T cell activity are key events leading to the development of IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Bouma1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the endogenous intestinal flora itself seems to play an important role in initiating the dysregulated host immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Sartor1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, leading to the release of a number of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3; that participate in the pathology of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Cominelli1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B controls the production of many of these inflammatory mediators, and we recently demonstrated its important role in driving bacteria-induced chronic intestinal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Karrasch1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, this transcriptional system represents a potential therapeutic target to treat IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Neurath1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Jobin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Mainstream treatments to manage IBD are largely based on immunosuppressive approaches with broad acting agents such as prednisone, cyclosporin A and tacrolimus (FK506) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Hibi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Although these are relatively effective, a number of patients develop significant side effects and/or become unresponsive to them. These concerns and the perception that alternative medicine is &#x0201c;healthier&#x0201d; than classical therapeutic options lead a growing segment of the population to seek alternative treatments to ameliorate various disorders including chronic intestinal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Bent1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This is clearly exemplified by the considerable amount of money spent by the general population on alternative medicine with an estimated world market of 62 billion dollars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Gupta1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Sampson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Herbal medicine encompassing extracts or active components derived from plants, barks, roots, leaves, flowers, and fruits represents an extremely popular segment of alternative medicine. However, despite their clear popularity, absence of empirical data showing efficacy and mechanisms of action in vivo prevents their incorporation into mainstream medicine.</p><p>Of interest, a large number of dietary products have been shown to inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B activity in different cell systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Aggarwal1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Luteolin for example is a flavonoid present in significant amounts in vegetables including celery, sage, carrots and broccoli, and a healthy diet is believed to contain between 2 mg and 125 mg of luteolin per day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Ross1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Manach1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. We recently demonstrated that luteolin suppresses LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B signaling both in vivo and in vitro through inhibition of the I&#x003ba;B-kinase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Kim1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, numerous other studies have shown the anti-inflammatory action of this flavonoid both in vivo and in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Hendriks1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Ruiz1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, this polyphenolic compound may have a beneficial impact either in treating IBD or preventing their development.</p><p>In the present study, we examined the impact of luteolin on the DSS model of acute colitis in mice. To follow patterns of NF-&#x003ba;B activation, we conducted experiments using NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> and IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> transgenic mice, which express the reporter gene enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under control of the NF-&#x003ba;B promoter. We found that luteolin significantly enhanced intestinal epithelial cell caspase-3 activation and prevented the induction of cytoprotective molecules such as COX-2 following DSS-exposure. DSS-exposed, luteolin-fed mice demonstrated more severe colitis than control-fed animals, whereas spontaneous colitis in IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> mice was significantly attenuated. We conclude that while luteolin shows beneficial effects on spontaneous colitis, it aggravates DSS-induced experimental colitis by blocking NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent protective molecules in enterocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DSS-induced acute colitis</title><p>The NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> transgenic mice were described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Magness1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mice were maintained in standard housing cages in a specific pathogen free (SPF) environment and allowed to drink and feed ad libitum at all times. Luteolin (SYNORx; San Clemente, CA) was incorporated in standard laboratory chow AIN-76 in different amounts (weight-percentages: 0.5&#x00025;, 2&#x00025;, 5&#x00025;) (Research Diets Inc; New Brunswick, NJ). Mice (7/group) were pre-fed luteolin-chow (0.5&#x00025;, 2&#x00025;, 5&#x00025;) or control chow (AIN-76) for 3 days (loading period) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Sugimoto1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Jian1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. After this time, mice were given 3&#x00025; DSS (MP Biomedicals; Aurora, OH) in drinking water for an additional 6 days. Control mice were given water. Water consumption was comparable between the different groups. Similarly, chow consumption (control AIN76 and luteolin) was comparable between DSS and water control groups, both before and during the induction of colitis (daily consumption approximately 1.6 g/mouse, equaling 32 mg luteolin; differences&#x02264;0.08 g/day or 5&#x00025;). Mice were monitored daily for weight loss as well as signs of rectal bleeding (Hemoccult, Beckmann Coulter Inc; Fullerton, CA).

Noteworthy, we found that luteolin inhibits DSS-induced, NF-&#x003ba;B dependent enterocyte COX-2 expression in both total colonic protein extracts and purified enterocytes obtained from luteolin-fed mice. Similarly, in vitro experiments showed that luteolin blocks TNF&#x003b1;-induced COX-2 gene expression and PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion in HT29 cells. Interestingly, luteolin attenuated restitution in a wound-healing assay in rat intestinal epithelial cells IEC-18 in vitro (69&#x00025; of control, p&#x0003c;0.01), which was partially restored by adding exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> (87&#x00025; of control, p&#x0003c;0.01 versus luteolin treatment alone). Thus, COX-2 and its derivative metabolites seem to play an important role in maintaining mucosal homeostasis. Of note, it should be stressed that although blocking COX-2 expression appears detrimental in the DSS model of acute colitis, a luteolin-rich diet may be beneficial in preventing colorectal cancer, where COX-2 overexpression is associated with carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Oshima1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Wendum1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Exacerbated colitis in luteolin-treated, DSS-exposed mice may involve a higher susceptibility of enterocytes to undergo signal-induced apoptosis and a decreased ability to initiate restitution. This possibility is supported by our findings that luteolin fed mice displayed enhanced caspase 3 processing in colonic tissue following DSS exposure, suggesting a higher rate of apoptosis. In addition, in vitro experiments showed that luteolin sensitizes HT29 cells to TNF&#x003b1;-induced caspase-3 processing/activity as well as DNA fragmentation. These effects were associated with blockade of TNF&#x003b1;-induced NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity and the concomitant decreased expression of down-stream target genes C-IAP1 and C-IAP2. The failure to maintain an intact intestinal epithelium and to repair DSS-induced intestinal epithelial damage would result in an increased uptake of luminal antigens, including bacteria and bacterial products, and thus lead to the activation of underlying immune cells and the mounting of an inflammatory response: In the DSS model of acute chemical-induced colitis, luteolin's foremost impact is likely geared towards enterocytes, inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent protective molecules. Enhanced injury then leads to enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B activation (EGFP expression) in mononuclear cells from the colonic lamina propria, where luteolin's inhibitory effect on NF-&#x003ba;B in LPMNC is likely overcome by the strong impact of abundantly translocated luminal antigens. Enhanced lamina propria NF-&#x003ba;B activation (EGFP expression) in turn correlates with clinical and histological signs of colitis in luteolin-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000596-g009">Fig. 9A,C</xref>).</p><p>Numerous pro-inflammatory mediators are known to be associated with the development of DSS-induced acute inflammation including IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18 and TNF&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000596-Lorenz1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this spontaneous model of chronic, Th1-mediated intestinal inflammation, without primary epithelial damage, luteolin's inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation (EGFP expression) is predominantly seen in lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNC). Its actions at least in part ameliorate the clinical and histological signs of colitis in luteolin-fed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000596-g009">Fig. 9B,C</xref>).

An impaired epithelial wound-healing response and increased apoptosis in luteolin-fed mice lead to enhanced EGFP expression in lamina propria mononuclear cells and exacerbate DSS-induced colitis (A; right panel). In the context of a primarily intact epithelial layer during colitis in IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> mice, luteolin decreases bacteria-induced EGFP expression in lamina propria mononuclear cells, which correlates with an attenuation of colitis (B; middle and right panel). Schematic representation of luteolin's impact on intestinal epithelial cells and lamina propria mononuclear cells: NF-&#x003ba;B activation in intestinal epithelial cells is likely protective (wound-healing response, anti-apoptotis), and its inhibition by luteolin consequently aggravates intestinal damage. As opposed, antigen- (e.g. bacteria-) induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation in lamina propria mononuclear cells leads to NF-&#x003ba;B dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, thus its inhibition by luteolin likely ameliorates intestinal inflammation (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000596.g009"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This work was supported by NIH ROI DK 47700 and American Institute of Cancer Research grants to C.
