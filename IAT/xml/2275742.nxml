However, the nature of the primary signal(s) targeting DNA methylation at specific genomic regions is not clear. Notably, whether histone methylation and/or chromatin remodeling proteins play a role in the establishment of DNA methylation during gametogenesis is not known. The chromosomes of mouse neonatal spermatogonia display a unique pattern of 5-methyl cytosine staining whereby centromeric heterochromatin is hypo-methylated whereas chromatids are strongly methylated.

This suggests that in neonatal spermatogonia, chromosomal 5-methyl cytosine patterns are regulated independently of changes in histone methylation, potentially reflecting a crucial mechanism to maintain pericentric heterochromatin silencing. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and fluorescence in situ hybridization, revealed that ATRX as well as H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>associate with Y chromosome-specific DNA sequences and decorate both arms of the Y chromosome, suggesting a possible role in heterochromatinization and the predominant transcriptional quiescence of this chromosome during spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results are consistent with a role for histone modifications and chromatin remodeling proteins such as ATRX in maintaining transcriptional repression at constitutive heterochromatin domains in the absence of 5-methyl cytosine and provide evidence suggesting that the establishment and/or maintenance of repressive histone and chromatin modifications at pericentric heterochromatin following genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming in the germ line may precede the establishment of chromosomal 5-methyl cytosine patterns as a genomic silencing strategy in neonatal spermatogonia.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In the mammalian germ line, parental-specific genomic imprints are erased during each generation in order to allow for their subsequent re-establishment during gametogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This process of epigenetic reprogramming is initiated during mouse embryonic development at around day 10.5 post coitum (p.c.), a time when primordial germ cells migrate to the genital ridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Re-establishment of sex-specific epigenetic modifications in the male germ line begins on days 13&#x02013;17 p.c. and continues during the first days of postnatal development in mitotically dividing neonatal spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Importantly, in contrast with the chromosomes of somatic cells, which exhibit a characteristic global DNA methylation status (as determined by 5-methyl cytosine; 5-mC staining) with weakly methylated chromatids and strongly methylated centromeric regions, the chromosomes of neonatal spermatogonia exhibit a unique DNA methylation pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For example, centromeric heterochromatin in spermatogonial cells is hypo-methylated, whereas euchromatin regions convert from a demethylated to a strongly methylated status between days 16 to 17 p.c. in the mouse germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, immediately after birth, the chromatids of germ cell chromosomes appear hyper-methylated whereas centromeric domains are globally demethylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In lower organisms such as <italic>Neurospora crassa </italic>and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>the patterns of genomic DNA methylation are directly influenced by histone methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Evidence obtained from the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>model indicates that establishment of DNA methylation patterns is essential for the subsequent di-methylation of histone H3 (H3K9<sub>me2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast, targeted deletion of the two isoforms of <italic>Suv39h</italic>, a histone methyltransferase specifically involved in tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9<sub>me3</sub>), results in altered DNA methylation of tandem repeats at pericentric heterochromatin in murine embryonic stem cells suggesting that in mammals histone tri-methylation (H3K9<sub>me3</sub>) might be required for the establishment and/or maintenance of DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although some aspects of the functional interaction between histone methylation and DNA methylation have, to some extent, been evolutionarily conserved in mammals, the precise relationship between H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>and DNA methylation is not fully understood.</p><p>Tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9<sub>me3</sub>) is a hallmark of pericentric heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Importantly, H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>provides a docking site for additional chromatin binding proteins such as heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) in an essential step for heterochromatin formation and the maintenance of a transcriptionally repressive environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, di-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4<sub>me2</sub>) is associated with transcriptionally permissive euchromatin regions in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Notably, recent evidence indicates that helicases of the SWI/SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling proteins such as ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) and the lymphoid specific helicase (LSH), also known as helicase lymphoid specific (Hells) bind to pericentric heterochromatin regions in mouse somatic cell lines where they also play an essential role in DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, whether these chromatin remodeling proteins play a role in heterochromatin formation in the male germ line is not known.</p><p>To gain insight into the relationship between global DNA methylation and histone methylation in the spermatogonial cell genome, we determined whether the unique DNA methylation patterns observed in the chromosomes of neonatal male germ cells are also reflected by similar changes in histone methylation and whether the extensive de-methylation of centromeric domains interferes with the association of heterochromatin binding proteins in mitotic germ cell chromosomes. Our results indicate that both H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>as well as ATRX remained associated with pericentric heterochromatin in spermatogonial cell autosomes regardless of the chromosomal DNA methylation status. Moreover, we found, that the high levels of global DNA methylation (5-mC) in germ cell chromatids are not necessarily coupled with changes in histone methylation. These results suggest that during early postnatal development of the male mitotic germ cell, global or chromosomal DNA methylation patterns are regulated independently of changes in histone methylation. Additionally, we found that ATRX and H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>mark the entire Y chromosome in neonatal spermatogonia. Our results are discussed within the context of the ontogeny of ATRX and its dynamic interactions with chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulatory complexes during spermatogenesis as well as the potential implications for heterochromatinization of the Y chromosome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of histone H3 methylation patterns and ATRX localization in the chromosomes of neonatal spermatogonia</title><p>The primary signals responsible for establishing and maintaining global DNA methylation and histone methylation patterns at the level of distinct chromosomal domains in the mammalian genome are not known.

In contrast, except for the presence of two chromosomes that appear globally demethylated (arrowhead and bold arrow; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;F</xref>), the majority of chromosomes in neonatal spermatogonia exhibit a unique pattern of 5-mC staining in which chromatids appear highly methylated while centromeric domains lack 5-mC staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and (thin arrow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;F</xref>). These patterns are reproducible after cross-linking of chromosomal proteins with paraformaldehyde (PFA; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;F</xref>), which is essential for subsequent detection of histone post-translational modifications, or after treatment of cells with a hypotonic solution and chromosome fixation with methanol/acetic acid (MeOH/AA), which improves chromosome spreading on the metaphase plate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G&#x02013;I</xref>) and thus facilitates the subsequent identification of individual chromosomes after fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Simultaneous analysis of 5-mC patterns and FISH with an X chromosome specific probe (green) or a Y chromosome specific probe (red; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J&#x02013;L</xref>) demonstrates that compared with the rest of the autosomes, the X chromosome (arrowhead) is hypo-methylated whereas the Y chromosome (bold arrow) exhibits a global demethylation pattern in neonatal spermatogonia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K&#x02013;L</xref>; Inset).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of Global DNA methylation patterns in the chromosomes of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and neonatal spermatogonia</bold>. <bold>A-C) </bold>Fluorescent micrographs of metaphase chromosomes from primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts showing highly methylated autosomal centromeric domains (thin arrow) as determined by 5-methyl cytosine (5-mC) staining (red). <bold>D-F) </bold>Chromosomes in neonatal spermatogonia lack global DNA methylation at pericentric heterochromatin, while 5-mC (red) decorates entire chromatids in the majority of autosomes (thin arrow).

The characteristic patterns of 5-mC staining in neonatal spermatogonia are a reliable marker to distinguish germ cell-derived chromosomes from those of somatic cell origin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>). In spite of their extensive demethylation in the germ cell lineage, pericentric heterochromatin domains exhibit a precise staining for H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>in all autosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; thin arrow). Interestingly, one chromosome on each metaphase spread analyzed consistently presented a preferential accumulation of H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>throughout the length of both chromatids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; Inset). This chromosome also appeared globally demethylated as determined by the patterns of 5-mC staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; Inset and bold arrow). In contrast, the patterns of H3K4<sub>me2</sub>, a marker of transcriptionally permissive euchromatic regions, showed a reciprocal association with germ cell chromosomes. In spite of their extensive 5-mC staining, H3K4<sub>me2</sub>remained faithfully associated with the chromatids of neonatal spermatogonia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; thin arrow) but failed to associate with pericentric heterochromatin domains.

Thus we determined whether the methylation patterns present in neonatal spermatogonia affect the recruitment of ATRX to pericentric heterochromatin. Similar to H3K9<sub>me3</sub>, ATRX remains faithfully associated with pericentric heterochromatin in the autosomes of neonatal germ cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>; thin arrow). Notably, one of the sex chromosomes, which exhibit global demethylation, consistently displayed a bright ATRX signal in all metaphase spreads analyzed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>; Inset and bold arrow). Taken together, these results suggest that in spite of extensive DNA demethylation at pericentric heterochromatin domains in the chromosomes of neonatal spermatogonia, repressive histone modifications such as H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>are already established and that chromatin-binding proteins essential to maintain a transcriptionally repressive environment, such as ATRX are efficiently recruited to pericentric heterochromatin.</p></sec><sec><title>ATRX and H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>mark the Y chromosome in neonatal spermatogonia</title><p>To determine which of the sex chromosomes showing global DNA hypo-methylation is preferentially labeled by ATRX and H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>we analyzed metaphase spreads using immunofluorescence followed by FISH in order to establish the position of the Y chromosome. Consistent with our previous experiments, ATRX binds to pericentric heterochromatin domains in the chromosomes of neonatal spermatogonia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; thin arrow). Importantly, one chromosome on each metaphase spread exhibits prominent ATRX labeling encompassing the entire length of both chromatid arms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; Inset and bold arrow). Subsequent analysis with a Y chromosome-specific probe on the same metaphase spread revealed that the prominent ATRX staining corresponds to the chromatids of the Y chromosome in all spreads analyzed (N = 108), (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;C</xref>; Inset and bold arrow). Moreover, analysis of histone methylation patterns revealed that while the Y chromosome also exhibits prominent staining with H3K9<sub>me3</sub>, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;F</xref>; Inset), no staining for H3K4<sub>me2 </sub>was detectable in the chromatids of the Y chromosome in any of the metaphase spreads analyzed (N = 98) Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G&#x02013;I</xref> (Inset and bold arrow).

Similar results were obtained after analysis of LSH (-/-) spermatogonia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This suggests that neither the patterns of H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>nor ATRX localization at pericentric heterochromatin and the Y chromosome were affected by the lack of LSH function in neonatal spermatogonia. Notably, although the lack of LSH function results in abnormal DNA methylation in somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], our results indicate that the patterns of intense 5-mC staining observed throughout the chromatids of neonatal spermatogonia were not affected by the absence of LSH protein.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Binding of ATRX to centromeric heterochromatin and the Y chromosome in neonatal spermatogonia from LSH <sup>-/- </sup>mice</bold>.

However, the patterns of ATRX nuclear localization in the male germ line are not known. Therefore, we set out to determine the nuclear compartmentalization of ATRX during spermatogenesis. ATRX is present at centromeric heterochromatin domains in somatic testicular cells as well as in &#x0003e; 90% of spermatogonial cells obtained from pre-pubertal mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

In contrast, ATRX remains associated with centromeric heterochromatin domains in pachytene stage oocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

ATRX remains undetectable in male chromosomes at the anaphase to metaphase-II transition however, prominent ATRX signals were found associated with the chromocenter in approximately 10% of round spermatids. The majority of elongated spermatid nuclei or differentiating sperm heads showed negligible ATRX protein expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Thus, in contrast with neonatal spermatogonia in which the ATRX protein marks the entire Y chromosome, meiotic spermatocyte nuclei lack ATRX staining.

To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence indicating that chromosomal 5-methyl cytosine patterns and histone methylation patterns might be regulated by independent mechanisms in neonatal spermatogonia. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies using MEFs revealed a specific association of both ATRX and H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>with pericentric repetitive sequences on the Y chromosome in somatic cells suggesting that binding of ATRX to the Y chromosome is not restricted to the germ line. In spite of its extensive global DNA hypo-methylation, the Y chromosome occupies a transcriptionally silent nuclear domain during interphase suggesting that H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>and ATRX might be important to maintain global transcriptional repression on the heterochromatic Y chromosome. Furthermore, our results indicate that epigenetic modifications on the Y chromosome during mammalian spermatogenesis are highly dynamic as indicated by the lack of nuclear ATRX staining at the pachytene stage and the chromosomes of metaphase-I or metaphase-II stage spermatocytes.</p><sec><title>Independent Regulation of Global DNA methylation and Histone Methylation in the Chromosomes of Neonatal Mouse Spermatogonia</title><p>The mammalian germ-line exhibits a unique program for genome reprogramming and transcriptional regulation. Although the majority of studies have focused on the analysis of post-meiotic haploid gene expression and chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] elegant cytogenetic analyses revealed striking changes in global DNA methylation at centromeric heterochromatin domains in neonatal spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, whether this unique distribution of chromosomal DNA methylation affects the patterns of histone modifications and/or the recruitment of pericentric heterochromatin binding proteins remained to be determined. Our results suggest that in spite of the lack of global DNA methylation both ATRX and H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>remained faithfully associated with pericentric heterochromatin domains in the chromosomes of mouse neonatal spermatogonia. Furthermore, lack of ATRX and H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>throughout the highly methylated chromatids of the same autosomes provides additional evidence for an independent regulation between global DNA methylation and histone methylation during early postnatal development of the male germ line.</p><p>Notably, these repressive chromatin modifications were also prominent in the unmethylated Y chromosome arms in both neonatal spermatogonia and MEFs. This is consistent with previous studies indicating that H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>marks the Y chromosome in embryonic stem cells and 3T3 mouse fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Our results however also revealed that presence of 5-mC at pericentric heterochromatin and the Y chromosome is not required for H3K9 methylation at least in its tri-methylated form. On the other hand, in addition to H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>and ATRX other factors might be required for the subsequent re-establishment of chromosomal 5-mC patterns at pericentric heterochromatin upon differentiation of neonatal spermatogonia.</p><p>The lack of ATRX association with Y chromosome-specific repeat sequences observed in peripheral lymphocytes both on a chromosome-wide as well as at the molecular level, might constitute yet another example of the unique epigenetic status of the lymphocyte genome. In support of this idea, the global DNA methylation of the human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and mouse Y chromosome in peripheral lymphocytes remains high compared with MEFs and neonatal spermatogonia (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that the epigenetic composition of heterochromatic domains in mouse lymphocytes might be dramatically different from other somatic cell types. For instance, in female mouse lymphocytes, the inactive X chromosome lacks macroH2A association, an otherwise common marker of the late replicating inactive X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Moreover, expression of some common heterochromatin-associated factors such as HP1 and macroH2A was shown to be dramatically reduced upon terminal differentiation of human leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>The complex interactions between DNA methylation and H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>in mammals are only beginning to be unraveled. For example, in somatic cells, DNA methylation seems to be necessary and sufficient for the establishment of some histone modifications, including di-methylation of H3K9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Consistent with this hypothesis, disruption of DNA methylation in LSH deficient mice results in the abnormal localization of H3K4<sub>me2 </sub>to pericentric heterochromatin domains in fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. However, the patterns of chromosomal 5-mC staining as well as H3K4<sub>me2 </sub>in neonatal spermatogonia from LSH deficient mice were indistinguishable from those of heterozygous controls. Thus, our results suggest that in contrast to somatic cells LSH might not be directly involved in regulating changes in di-methylation of H3K4 or in the establishment of chromosomal 5-mC patterns in the germ line. The potential relationship between DNA methylation at the single nucleotide level (CpG methylation) and the global DNA methylation patterns established by the localization of 5-mC throughout an entire chromosomal domain such as pericentric heterochromatin is not fully understood. However, CpG methylation at promoter regions of single-copy genes has been shown to co-exist with lack of chromosomal 5-mC staining on the human inactive X-chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Both major and minor satellite sequences as well as retrotransposons of the intracisternal A particle (IAP) class are protected from undergoing complete demethylation during genomic reprogramming in prenatal gonocytes in order to prevent a deleterious reactivation of retroviral elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].

However, the methylation of tandem repeats at centromeric heterochromatin in DNMT3L deficient male mice was not affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. It is conceivable that in the absence of 5-mC at pericentric heterochromatin in neonatal spermatogonia H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>and ATRX might play a role in transient repression of repetitive elements in order to prevent their transcriptional reactivation in the spermatogonial cell genome. Thus, histone methylation and recruitment of heterochromatin binding proteins may be essential for maintaining the transcriptional quiescence of pericentric heterochromatin in neonatal spermatogonia before the patterns of 5-methyl cytosine are re-established to these chromosomal domains upon subsequent differentiation of proliferating spermatogonia in order to provide a more stable repression mark.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-meiotic heterochromatinization and global transcriptional silencing of the Y chromosome</title><p>Previous studies suggested that in several mammalian cell lines DNA on both sex chromosomes is hypo-methylated compared with the rest of the autosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and that the morphologically condensed and heterochromatic Y chromosome is hypo-methylated in neonatal spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Use of X and Y-chromosome specific probes after 5-methyl cytosine staining allowed us to confirm the hypo-methylation status of the Y chromosome and unequivocally establish that the second hypo-methylated chromosome observed in neonatal spermatogonia corresponds to the X chromosome. In adult type A and type B spermatogonia the Y chromosome lays within a transcriptionally quiescent nuclear domain, although it is well established that some Y-linked genes involved in spermatogenesis are expressed within this heterochromatic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Our results extend these observations to the analysis of neonatal spermatogonia and indicate that in spite of the lack of 5-mC staining, global transcriptional repression of the Y chromosome is established prior to differentiation of spermatogonial cells and well in advance from the process of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Evidence obtained in several species ranging from flies to mammals suggests that the Y chromosome consists of about 95% heterochromatin. Heterochromatinization and the erosion of transcriptional activity on the Y chromosome might be a consequence of the accumulation of large numbers of retroelements and the requirement to silence these foreign sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Thus, in the absence of global DNA methylation, repressive histone modifications such as H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>and ATRX as well as the lack of H3K4<sub>me2 </sub>associated with repetitive sequences might play an important role in silencing deleterious repetitive elements on the Y chromosome during the critical perinatal period for transposon silencing in the male germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Dynamic epigenetic composition of the Y chromosome during spermatogenesis</title><p>Sequential changes in histone modifications on the sex chromosomes have been observed in mouse spermatocytes from the pachytene stage onwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].

Both sex chromosomes were found enriched for H3K4<sub>me2 </sub>in adult spermatocytes and round spermatids at a time when sex chromatin is transcriptionally silent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. In contrast, our results indicate that the Y chromosome in neonatal spermatogonia lacks H3K4<sub>me2 </sub>suggesting that the epigenetic composition of the Y chromosome during spermatogenesis is highly dynamic. In the female germ line, the ATRX protein binds to pericentric heterochromatin at the pachytene stage (this study) as well as in oocytes at the metaphase I and metaphase II stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, localization of the ATRX protein with centromeric heterochromatin during spermatogenesis was limited to pre-meiotic spermatogonial cells and a subset of round spermatids with rather large nuclei and one or two prominent chromocenters. Interestingly, DNA methylation at juxtacentromeric regions is heterogenous and remains low in pachytene stage oocytes and during the second meiotic division. In contrast, centromeric heterochromatin was found to be prominently methylated during meiotic progression in male germ cells, indicating that sex-specific differences in global 5-mC levels exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Differences in the patterns of ATRX nuclear localization during spermatogenesis versus oogenesis as well as the absence of ATRX staining on the Y chromosome in mouse lymphocytes suggest that the epigenetic composition of the Y chromosome may be affected by cell type or stage of differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Maintenance of CpG methylation at major and minor satellite sequences following genome reprogramming in the germ line is essential for silencing the expression of potentially deleterious repetitive elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the mechanisms involved in this process are not known. Here we provide the initial evidence for the presence of repressive histone and chromatin modifications at pericentric heterochromatin domains in neonatal spermatogonia. We propose a model in which H3K9<sub>me3 </sub>and ATRX might contribute to the maintenance of a transcriptionally repressive chromatin environment in the absence of global DNA methylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In this model, lack of chromosomal 5-mC at pericentric heterochromatin results from the global demethylation events taking place during genome reprogramming in fetal germ cells. Importantly, the establishment and/or maintenance of repressive histone and chromatin modifications may be essential for transcriptional silencing and for maintaining the levels of CpG methylation previously observed at tandem repeats following genome reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The subsequent cytosine methylation observed at pericentric heterochromatin upon spermatogonial cell differentiation may thus reinforce a repressive chromatin structure initially nucleated by chromatin remodeling proteins and histone methylation.

Histone methylation (H3K9<sub>me3</sub>) and association with chromatin remodeling proteins such as ATRX may precede the establishment of chromosomal 5-mC patterns as a mechanism to maintain a repressive chromatin environment at constitutive heterochromatin domains in neonatal spermatogonia.

Following a brief permeation of the plasma membrane with 0.03% Triton X (Biorad) in PBS for 2 minutes, the spermatogonial cell suspension was rinsed in fresh PBS and then transferred to transcription buffer supplemented as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] for 40 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C before fixation in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA; EMS Hatfield, PA) supplemented with 0.15% Triton X. Transcriptional activity was detected with an anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Boehringer Mannheim) antibody used at a concentration of 2 &#x003bc;g/ml followed by detection with an Alexa Fluor-488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). The nuclear domain corresponding to the Y chromosome in transcriptionally active cells was visualized by FISH while germ cells and somatic cells were subsequently distinguished by their corresponding 5-mC staining patterns as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Individual band intensity after chromatin immunoprecipitation was quantified using the Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Data are presented as the mean net intensity (&#x000d7; 10<sup>-3</sup>) of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and comparison of all pairs by Tukey-Kramer HSD using JMP Start Statistics (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Variation among replicates is presented as the standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences were considered significant when (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CB designed and conducted the experiments, data analysis, and participated in drafting and editing the manuscript.

In contrast the Y chromosome of primary fibroblasts (<bold>B</bold>) and neonatal spermatogonia (<bold>C</bold>) is subject to an extensive demethylation that renders it easily discernible from the rest of the autosomes (compare inset in <bold>A </bold>with insets in <bold>B-C</bold>). Thin arrows point to centromeric heterochromatin, while bold arrows mark the location of the Y chromosome. The intense 5-mC staining on chromatids of peripheral lymphocytes also precludes the clear distinction between chromatids and centromeric heterochromatin in comparison to primary fibroblasts (thin arrow; <bold>A</bold>).</p></caption><media xlink:href="1471-2199-9-29-S1.jpeg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"><caption><p>Click here for file</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), NIH through grant HD042740 to R.
