One of them, DNA methylation activity, ensures the modification of specific DNA sequences, thus preventing the host DNA from the action of the other, endonucleolytic, activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c1">1</xref>). A comparison of cloned and sequenced RM systems has revealed many examples of their horizontal transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c3">3</xref>). The successful establishment of a RM system when entering the new host requires a complete modification of the host&#x02019;s DNA before the appearance of restriction endonuclease activity, thus the need for tight regulation of genes for restriction and modification enzymes is quite evident. Three mechanisms involved in the regulation of type II RM systems have been described to date. One of them employs the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif identified at the N-terminus of the methyltransferase (Mtase). HTH motif binding to the promoter region can repress the initially high expression of Mtase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c5">5</xref>). A second mechanism exploits the modulation of promoter activity depending on the methylation status of the DNA target sequence which is recognized by the RM system and situated within the promoter region between the methylase and endonuclease (Enase) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c6">6</xref>). The third mechanism is based on the action of the small protein, designated C, which is encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) found in the vicinity of the conventional restriction and modification genes. In four systems, <italic>Bam</italic>HI, <italic>Pvu</italic>II, <italic>Eco</italic>72I and <italic>Eco</italic>RV, the gene for C protein precedes that for Enase and both of them are collinear, whereas the gene for Mtase is located divergently from <italic>C</italic>. In all four systems C acts either as an activator of Enase expression or both activator of Enase expression and repressor of Mtase expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c10">10</xref>). The organization of <italic>Kpn</italic>2I RM system differs from that of all the aforementioned systems. In <italic>Kpn</italic>2I, genes for Enase and Mtase converge, whereas the gene for C protein is located upstream from <italic>kpn2IM</italic> and is transcribed in the opposite orientation. Moreover, the regulatory protein from <italic>Kpn</italic>2I system was found to be inert with respect to Enase gene expression, but markedly depressed the expression of Mtase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c11">11</xref>).</p><p>This publication describes the cloning, sequence analysis and regulation of the plasmid-borne <italic>Esp</italic>1396I RM system from <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. strain RFL1396, whose gene organization differs from all RM systems mentioned above.

RFL1396 was examined for the presence of plasmids and the plasmid pEsp1396 of 5.6 kb was isolated and mapped. The restriction endonucleases <italic>Bgl</italic>II, <italic>Sal</italic>I, <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I were found to have unique restriction targets on pEsp1396 and were used to cleave the pEsp1396 DNA for insertion into the multiple cloning site of pUC19. Only plasmids obtained after the ligation of <italic>Bgl</italic>II-linearized pEsp1396 with <italic>Bam</italic>HI-cleaved pUC19 had the expected insert of 5.6 kb; this recombinant plasmid was named pEsp1396IRM5.6. It conferred to the host cells both the Mtase and Enase activities of <italic>Esp</italic>1396I specificity, since isolated plasmid DNA was protected from R.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I challenge <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f1">1</xref>B, lanes 7 and 11) and RR1 cells carrying the plasmid pEsp1396IRM5.6 restricted the propagation of phage &#x003bb;<sub>vir</sub><italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas their crude cell lysates had R.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f1">1</xref>B, lane 3).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequence of pEsp1396</title><p>The results of precise localization of restriction and modification genes on the cloned fragment by deletion mapping of pEsp1396IRM5.6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f1">1</xref>A) were somewhat confusing and contradictory. Three deletions from the end of the cloned fragment, which is adjacent to the unique <italic>Ecl</italic>136II target (&#x00394;<italic>Eco</italic>RI&#x02013;<italic>Sal</italic>I, &#x00394;<italic>Eco</italic>RI&#x02013;<italic>Nhe</italic>I and &#x00394;<italic>Eco</italic>RI&#x02013;<italic>Ehe</italic>I), were unrecoverable and therefore suggested the presence of the methylase gene in this region. However, three deletions from the other end of the cloned fragment (&#x00394;<italic>Hin</italic>dIII&#x02013;<italic>Xba</italic>I, &#x00394;<italic>Hin</italic>dIII&#x02013;<italic>Xho</italic>I and &#x00394;<italic>Hin</italic>dIII&#x02013;<italic>Ehe</italic>I) produced small translucent colonies for which restriction mapping revealed multiple rearrangements. Therefore, it was impossible to unambiguously determine the methylation status of the isolated plasmids. Moreover, lysates prepared from cells transformed with a pEsp1396IRM5.6 derivative containing the deletion &#x00394;<italic>Hin</italic>dIII&#x02013;<italic>Xba</italic>I demonstrated detectable activity of R.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I, while two other derivatives were restriction-deficient. Those observations indicated that the toxicities of <italic>Hin</italic>dIII&#x02013;<italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Hin</italic>dIII&#x02013;<italic>Ehe</italic>I deletion derivatives were not dependent on the expression of restriction endonuclease gene.</p><p>In order to clarify the above ambiguities, we sequenced the entire fragment corresponding to pEsp1396 linearized at a unique <italic>Bgl</italic>II target. The 5622 bp sequence was determined on both strands (EMBL accession no. AF527822). Sequence analysis revealed two large convergent ORFs and three small ORFs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f1">1</xref>A). Introduction of four extra nucleotides within the first large ORF (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f1">1</xref>A, derivative p4BP&#x0002b;) resulted in a total loss of restriction endonuclease activity, however the methylation status of isolated DNA was not changed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f1">1</xref>B, lanes 4, 8 and 12). According to these observations the first large ORF, <italic>esp13961R</italic> (nt 1713&#x02013;2636), coded for <italic>Esp</italic>1396I Enase (307 amino acids, predicted molecular weight 35.1 kDa). The second gene, <italic>esp1396IM</italic> (nt 3712&#x02013;2714), was located on the complementary DNA strand. Removal of the 3&#x02032;-terminal part of this reading frame (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f1">1</xref>A, deletion &#x00394;<italic>Xho</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Nhe</italic>I) resulted in the disappearance of modification phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f1">1</xref>B, lanes 9 and 13), suggesting that <italic>esp1396IM</italic> encoded a Mtase of 332 amino acids (predicted molecular weight 38.5 kDa). In concordance with this prediction, the Mtase was found to share homology with the large group of m6A-Mtases (data not shown) and belongs to their D<sub>21</sub> group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c22">22</xref>). There is a unique A base in each DNA strand of <italic>Esp</italic>1396I target 5&#x02032;-CC<bold>A</bold>(N)<sub>5</sub>TGG-3&#x02032; so it should be methylated if Mtase is m6A-specific. In order to verify this presumption we applied the technique of DNA cleavage interference at overlapping targets, which was described in more detail in our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c20">20</xref>). We introduced into the plasmid pACYC184 (details on the construction are available under request) sequence 5&#x02032;-<underline>CC</underline><bold>AAGCTT</bold><underline>TGG</underline>-3&#x02032; in which the target for <italic>Esp</italic>1396I (underlined) overlaps by 1 nucleotide (A base) with that for <italic>Hin</italic>dIII (bold). <italic>Hin</italic>dIII is known to be sensitive to the methylation of the first A base of its target even if only one DNA strand is methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c20">20</xref>). We found that the diagnostic site of resulting plasmid is efficiently cleaved with <italic>Hin</italic>dIII when DNA was isolated from RR1 cells, however, it is completely <italic>Hin</italic>dIII-resistant when DNA was isolated from RR1 cells carrying the plasmid pEsp1396IRM5.6 in <italic>trans</italic> (data not shown). These results allow us to suppose that <italic>Esp</italic>1396I Mtase indeed modifies A base. The 3&#x02032;-terminal ends of these two genes are separated by a 77 bp region, which contains two inverted repeats (nt 2686&#x02013;2698 and 2700&#x02013;2712) and has a potential to form a stem&#x02013;loop structure. Hence, this region could serve as a transcription terminator for both <italic>esp1396IR</italic> and <italic>esp1396IM</italic>. The gene for <italic>Esp</italic>1396I Enase is preceded by the small ORF (nt 1481&#x02013;1720), which overlaps the 5&#x02032;-terminus of <italic>esp1396IR</italic> gene by 8 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 79 residues (C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I; predicted molecular weight 9.2 kDa). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I possesses a strong HTH motif according to the Dodd and Egan weight matrix method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c19">19</xref>) and shares a 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; homology with the regulatory proteins found in some other RM systems including <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Pvu</italic>II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c24">24</xref>). DNA region <italic>rep</italic>, which is presumably responsible for the replication of pEsp1396 (nt 4026&#x02013;4518), was discovered based on a high level of similarity (84&#x00025; identity in 493 nt overlap) to the replication region of <italic>E.coli</italic> plasmid p15A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c25">25</xref>). Immediately downstream from the <italic>rep</italic> region two small collinear ORFs were identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f1">1</xref>). The first of them, <italic>rop</italic> (nt 4551&#x02013;4745), codes for a protein of 64 amino acid residues, which is highly homologous (&#x0003e;50&#x00025;) to a number of Rop&#x0002f;Rom proteins involved in the control of copy number in many plasmids, including that of the <italic>E.coli</italic> plasmid ColE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c26">26</xref>). The second ORF (<italic>orfX</italic>; nt 4745&#x02013;5176) encodes a protein of 143 amino acid residues (molecular weight 15.8 kDa) which has no homologous proteins of known function. OrfX possesses a strong HTH-like motif (calculated standard deviation score of 7.1) in its N-terminal part (data not shown).</p><p>Nucleotide sequence analysis data show that deletions resulting in the unstable plasmids (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f1">1</xref>A) eliminate either <italic>esp1396IC</italic> or both <italic>esp1396IC</italic> and <italic>esp1396IR</italic>, therefore the observed instability of shortened derivatives can most likely be attributed to the disregulated expression of the Mtase gene.</p></sec><sec><title>C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I represses expression of <italic>esp1396IM</italic> gene</title><p>Deletion mapping suggested that the product of <italic>esp1396IC</italic>, C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I, is involved in the regulation of Mtase gene expression. We attempted to construct a translational <italic>esp1396IM&#x02019;::&#x02019;lacZ</italic> fusion expecting to monitor the activity of hybrid &#x003b2;-Gal both in the presence and in the absence of regulatory protein. However, the plasmid pEspM::Lac resulted in very small and translucent colonies in the absence of regulatory gene, suggesting that uncontrolled expression of <italic>esp1396IM&#x02019;::&#x02019;lacZ</italic> is also toxic to the host. In order to resolve the toxicity problem, we placed the gene for regulatory protein under the control of tightly repressible promoter P<sub>lac&#x0002f;ara-1</sub> and used the resulting plasmid pZS-C for the transient synthesis of regulatory protein as described in our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c11">11</xref>). JM109 cells harboring both pEspM::Lac and pZS-C were cultivated either in the presence of P<sub>lac&#x0002f;ara-1</sub> inducers arabinose and IPTG or in their absence. &#x003b2;-Gal activities measured at various times of cultivation in the presence of inducers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f2">2</xref>) demonstrated an insignificant increase of activity in the first 3 h followed by a 2-fold decrease over the next 6 h. In contrast, JM109 cells grown in LB media without inducers exhibited a steady increase in &#x003b2;-Gal activity, which reached a maximal activity of &#x0223c;17 000 U in 5 h and maintained this level for an additional 4 h. The increase in &#x003b2;-Gal activity was accompanied by an almost complete arrest of culture growth after 7 h of cultivation (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the addition of either arabinose or IPTG or both to LB had no effect on the toxicity of pEspM::Lac to the host in the absence of pZS-C.</p><p>Altogether, the data indicated that a significant increase in the activity of &#x003b2;-Gal depended on a derepression of the <italic>esp1396IM</italic> promoter which controlled the expression of <italic>esp1396IM&#x02019;::&#x02019;lacZ</italic> in pEspM::Lac and that C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I was a repressor of the Mtase gene promoter. Moreover, the arrest of culture growth indicated that uncontrolled expression from the <italic>esp1396IM</italic> promoter was the most probable reason of plasmid toxicity observed in the deletion mapping experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I activates the expression of its own gene</title><p>Only the regulatory protein C.<italic>Pvu</italic>II from the <italic>Pvu</italic>II RM system was tested for the effect on the expression of its own gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c24">24</xref>) and shown to be an autogenous activator. To gain more understanding on the regulatory mechanisms of differently organized RM systems we determined the effect of C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I on the expression of both its own gene and a gene for Enase (see below). The activity of &#x003b2;-Gal produced by plasmid pEspC::Lac in which <italic>esp1396IC&#x02019;</italic> was fused with <italic>&#x02019;lacZ</italic> was measured in the presence and the absence of pBR-C providing <italic>esp1396IC</italic> gene with its own promoter in <italic>trans</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg135tb1">1</xref>). A 48-fold increase of &#x003b2;-Gal activity was observed in the presence of the gene for C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I, which clearly indicated: (i) the product of regulatory gene activated its own synthesis, and (ii) the DNA region (190 bp from <italic>Esp</italic>1396I RM system preceding the structural part of <italic>esp1396IC</italic>), which was subcloned together with the 5&#x02032; end of <italic>esp1396IC&#x02019;</italic> to yield pEspC::Lac, possessed the nucleotide sequence(s) necessary for C-mediated activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I on the expression of restriction endonuclease gene</title><p>In nearly all C protein-encoding RM systems, which have been characterized so far, the gene for regulatory protein precedes that for Enase, suggesting their cotranscription and simultaneous regulation at the transcriptional level. However, these predictions were experimentally confirmed only in the case of <italic>Pvu</italic>II system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c24">24</xref>). The observation that C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I activates the expression of its own gene was the reason to speculate that, if the genes for C and for Enase are transcribed as an operon, the C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I should also activate the expression of the Enase gene. In order to test this possibility, the translational fusion <italic>esp1396IR&#x02019;::&#x02019;lacZ</italic> preceded by the wild-type <italic>esp1396IC</italic> (and its 190 bp control region) was constructed. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells carrying the resulting plasmid pEspCR::Lac (<italic>esp1396IC</italic> gene is provided in <italic>cis</italic>) produced 64 U of &#x003b2;-Gal (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg135tb1">1</xref>). The insertion of four extra nucleotides within the coding region of <italic>esp1396IC</italic> (plasmid pEsp<sup>&#x0002b;4</sup>CR::Lac) introduced a frameshift that caused C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I polypeptide synthesis to terminate 103 nucleotides upstream from the authentic <italic>esp1396IC</italic> stop codon. This mutation was followed by &#x0003e;135-fold decrease in activity of hybrid &#x003b2;-Gal encoded by the downstream gene (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg135tb1">1</xref>). Providing a wild-type gene for regulatory protein in <italic>trans</italic> (plasmid pBR-C) had just a partial effect on the expression of the fused gene, since only a 5-fold increase in &#x003b2;-Gal activity was observed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg135tb1">1</xref>). These findings suggested the existence of additional mechanism(s), besides transcriptional regulation, which are involved in the regulation of the downstream gene for <italic>Esp</italic>1396I Enase. There are no <italic>Esp</italic>1396I targets within regulatory regions, which were investigated in this study, thus the specific methylation seems not to be the case.</p><p>Bacterial genes that code for functionally related products are often cotranscribed in a polycistronic mRNA, which is then translated into the protein products. There are many examples in which translation of the preceding gene is necessary for the efficient translation of a subsequent gene. This phenomenon, called translational coupling, has been observed for the first time in the tryptophan operon of <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c27">27</xref>). As in many cases when translational coupling took place, genes for <italic>Esp</italic>1396I regulatory protein and for Enase overlap each other. In order to test the possibility that <italic>esp1396IR</italic> is translationally coupled to the <italic>esp1396IC</italic> gene the plasmid pEsp<sup>&#x0002b;12</sup>CR::Lac was constructed. It differs from pEsp<sup>&#x0002b;4</sup>CR::Lac by an extended insertion within the gene for the regulatory protein (12 nucleotides instead of 4 nucleotides) resulting in a restored reading frame. A 10-fold increase in &#x003b2;-Gal activity was observed when translation of the mutant <italic>esp1396IC</italic> gene was terminated at the same position as in the wild-type gene (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg135tb1">1</xref>). The mutant C protein encoded by pEsp<sup>&#x0002b;12</sup>CR::Lac contained four extra amino acids in its middle part and was inactive, as assessed by independent ancillary experiments (data not shown). Therefore, the most likely explanation for the 10-fold increase in &#x003b2;-Gal activity was the restoration of coupled translation resulting in a more efficient translation of the second cistron (<italic>esp1396IR&#x02019;::&#x02019;lacZ</italic>) in conditions of unregulated (basal) transcription from the promoter, located upstream from the first cistron (<italic>esp1396IC</italic>). Activation of a ribosome binding site (RBS) via translational coupling has been found in many other polycistronic systems, and the principle of activation, at least in some cases, is a breakdown of mRNA secondary structure which masks an RBS of the distal cistron by the upstream translating ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c28">28</xref>). Computer analysis of possible secondary structures involving the region that surrounds the 5&#x02032;-terminus of <italic>esp1396IR</italic> suggested that a double-stranded mRNA structure with a &#x00394;G &#x0003d; &#x02013;7.1 could conceivably form and block ribosome access to the Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f3">3</xref>A). This observation supports the speculation that <italic>esp1396IC</italic> and <italic>esp1396IR</italic> are translationally coupled; however, additional confirmatory experiments are required.</p><p>Introduction of the wild-type gene for regulatory protein (plasmid pBR-C) into cells harboring the plasmid pEsp<sup>&#x0002b;12</sup>CR::Lac elevated the activity of &#x003b2;-Gal from 4.6 to 82 U (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg135tb1">1</xref>) and even slightly exceeded the activity determined for pEspCR::Lac, in which the <italic>esp1396IC</italic> gene is located in <italic>cis</italic>. Taken together, all the data indicated that the regulatory protein from <italic>Esp</italic>1396I RM system positively regulated the expression of the Enase gene and, most probably, performed this function by regulating the transcription of the dicistronic mRNA from its own promoter as in the case of the <italic>Pvu</italic>II system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c24">24</xref>). The existence of such dicistronic mRNA in both <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. RFL1396 and <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x0005b;pEsp1396IRM5.6&#x0005d; was tested by RT&#x02013;PCR. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA isolated from both strains with the help of random hexamer primers and subsequently used as a template for PCR amplification using <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase and a pair of primers, one of which corresponded to the 5&#x02032;-terminus of <italic>esp1396IC</italic> gene and the other one was complementary to the middle part of <italic>esp1396IR</italic> gene. Amplification of the DNA region flanked by these primers is possible only if the same mRNA (and corresponding cDNA) molecule contains the sequence information on both primers. The DNA fragment of expected size and structure was readily amplified, clearly indicating that at least a fraction of mRNA, which is specific for Enase contains also a region coding for regulatory protein (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I operator sequences and mode of action</title><p>The negative effect of the <italic>esp1396IC</italic> gene product on the expression of Mtase gene and its positive effect on the expression of both <italic>esp1396IC</italic> and <italic>esp1396IR</italic> indicated the presence of at least two operator sequences for C.<italic>Esp</italic>1396I. One of them should be located upstream of the <italic>esp1396IM</italic> gene whereas the other one should be upstream of the <italic>esp1396IC</italic> gene. Indeed, these so called &#x02018;C-boxes&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c24">24</xref>) where identified at the suspected positions by using comparative sequence analysis. The putative C-box upstream from the regulatory gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f3">3</xref>B) matched very well with the consensus sequence which was derived from the comparison of putative operator sequences found in five other RM systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c24">24</xref>). It is noteworthy that the detected C-box comprised two copies of inverted tetranucleotide repeats (however, only the 5&#x02032; repeat is perfect), each of which representing the putative recognition target for regulatory protein, which presumably acts as a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c24">24</xref>). It should be noted that the putative C-box found upstream from the Mtase gene differed markedly from the consensus of the operator sequences since it matched only one half of the consensus sequence and contained just one inverted repeat. Moreover, the structure of the C-boxes found in two other systems, <italic>Sma</italic>I and <italic>Nme</italic>SI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c29">29</xref>), which are organized and perhaps regulated like <italic>Esp</italic>1396I, is identical. These systems exhibit regulatory genes, which are preceded by operator sequences that possess two copies of inverted repeats. In contrast, the genes for Mtases are preceded by C-boxes with the only one copy of repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg135f3">3</xref>B). The importance of these differences for the regulation of Mtase and Enase genes remains to be defined experimentally.</p><p>In summary, it is possible to predicate that after the entry of <italic>Esp</italic>1396I RM system into a new host an immediate high level expression of the methylase gene is triggered accompanied by the weak expression of the regulatory protein and, most likely, by Enase gene transcription and translation. Since type II restriction endonucleases usually function as homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c1">1</xref>), the background level of Enase synthesis should not be toxic to the host cell until the Enase concentration becomes favorable for dimerization. Furthermore, during the establishment of the RM system in a new host the expression of both C gene and Enase gene should increase until the regulatory protein concentration reaches a maximal level, determined by the strength of derepressed promoter. At the same time, an increase in the repressor concentration should result in the gradual repression of the methylase gene to the level determined by the leakage of the methylase gene promoter in repressed state. Such a mechanism should ensure both a delayed appearance of the Enase during the system establishment and its maximal activity later, when the RM system is required for protection from the incoming exogenous DNA. A drop-off of the initially high methylase synthesis to a level sufficient for maintenance of methylation would also be beneficial, since it lowers the possibility for the incoming exogenous DNA to undergo methylation. It is noteworthy that similar regulation modes have been described not only for RM systems regulated by the C proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c23">23</xref>), but also for systems regulated either by the HTH motif localized at the N-terminus of the methylase protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c4">4</xref>) or by the state of methylation of the RM system recognition site localized in the intergenic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg135c6">6</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that regulation of the <italic>Esp</italic>1396I RM system has been studied in a heterologous background. Nevertheless, both <italic>Enterobacter</italic> and <italic>Escherichia</italic> are members of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family and we believe that there are no major differences in regulation of the <italic>Esp</italic>1396I genes in these two backgrounds, but this has yet to be confirmed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_31_2_743__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_31_2_743__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg135f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic map of pEsp1396IRM5.6 plasmid and deletion mapping of genes encoding the <italic>Esp</italic>1396I RM system.
