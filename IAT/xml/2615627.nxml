It is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of three subunits: RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3. It possesses four DNA-binding domains (DBD), DBD-A, DBD-B and DBD-C in RPA1 and DBD-D in RPA2, and it binds ssDNA via a multistep pathway. Unlike the RPA1 and RPA2 subunits, no ssDNA-RPA3 interaction has as yet been observed although RPA3 contains a structural motif found in the other DBDs. We show here using 4-thiothymine residues as photoaffinity probe that RPA3 interacts directly with ssDNA on the 3&#x02032;-side on a 31 nt ssDNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The replication protein A (RPA) is a single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding protein that is highly conserved in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). RPA is one of the key players in various essential processes of DNA metabolism including replication, recombination, DNA repair and telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9">4&#x02013;9</xref>). The functions of this protein are based on its DNA-binding activity and specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Its ssDNA binding properties depend on DNA length and nucleotide sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13">10&#x02013;13</xref>). RPA is a heterotrimeric protein, composed of 70-, 32- and 14-kDa subunits, commonly referred to as RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3, respectively. There are four DNA-binding domains (DBD) located in RPA1 (DBD A, DBD B, DBD C and DBD F), one located in RPA2 (DBD D) and one belongs to RPA3 (DBD E). RPA interacts with ssDNA via four DBD: DBD A, DBD B, DBD C and DBD D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>It is now accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) that RPA binds to ssDNA in a sequential pathway with a defined polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). RPA binds ssDNA with three different binding modes. First, binding initially involves an unstable recognition site of 8&#x02013;10 nt with the high-affinity DBD A and DBD B domains on the 5&#x02032;-side of the occluded ssDNA; it is designated &#x02018;compact conformation&#x02019; or 8&#x02013;10 nt binding mode. Second, this step is followed by the weaker binding of DBD C, on the 3&#x02032;-side, leading to an intermediate or &#x02018;elongated contracted&#x02019; (13&#x02013;22 nt) binding mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19">18&#x02013;19</xref>). Finally binding of DBD D on the 3&#x02032;-side forms a stable &#x02018;elongated extended&#x02019; complex characterized by a 30 nt long occluded binding site (30 nt binding mode). Although RPA3 contains an Oligonucleotide-Binding (OB)-fold motif found in the other DBDs, there is presently no biochemical evidence that this subunit directly contacts DNA. Thus positioning of the RPA3 subunit relative to the other domains is still speculative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). It has been clearly demonstrated that RPA3 is crucial for RPA function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>): RPA3 is involved in heterotrimer formation and is responsible for the polarity of binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The scope of the data indicates that either RPA3 participates only in protein&#x02013;protein interactions or that putative interaction of RPA3 with ssDNA is unstable and too transient to be detected by standard biochemical experiments. This latter possibility is likely if such interaction is provided by the 3&#x02032;-side of the ssDNA, since it has been suggested that this region might be transiently accessible to the RPA DBD domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>In the past few years, thionucleobases have been extensively used as intrinsic photolabels to probe the structure in solution of folded molecules and to identify transient contacts within nucleic acids and/or between nucleic acids and proteins, in nucleoprotein assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Thio residues such as 4-thiothymine and 6-thioguanine absorb light at wavelengths longer than 320 nm, and thus can be selectively photo-activated. Owing to the high photo-reactivity of their triplet state, they exhibit high photo-cross-linking ability towards nucleic acid bases as well as towards amino acid residues. Here we used a combination of approaches including gel retardation assays, chemical cross-linking and cross-linking with photoreactive ssDNA probes containing 4-thiothymine, introduced at a defined site in the sequence of the ssDNA, to study interactions present in human RPA (hRPA): ssDNA complexes. These studies coupled with the identification of cross-linked targets using specific antibodies revealed that in the elongated extended hRPA:ssDNA complex RPA3 closely contacts the 3&#x02032;-end positioned nucleotide and yields a covalent adduct with zero-length photolabel.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>BSA was from Roche, [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (6 &#x003bc;Ci/pmol) was from Amersham and T4 polynucleotide kinase from BioLabs.

We wished to determine whether the three binding modes could be observed on native gels without trapping.</p><p>Folding program predicts a stem loop structure with Oligo 31. However, several hard points permit us to maintain that complexes described below are formed with an unstructured ssDNA. Indeed, even if the stability of this structure in our conditions is good (&#x025b5;<italic>G</italic> = &#x02013;7 kcal/mol, <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 68&#x000b0;C), this hairpin shows two long ssDNA strands at both extremities (9 nt at 5&#x02032;-end and 8 nt at 3&#x02032;-end). These ssDNA strands are very good targets for the ssDNA binding protein as RPA. In addition, RPA is well known to remove secondary and tertiary DNA structures by a simple destabilization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Recently, we have shown that hRPA can unwind very stable compact G-quadruplex structures [&#x025b5;<italic>G</italic> &#x0003c; &#x02013;15 kcal/mol, <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> &#x02248; 70&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>)] in &#x0003c; 2 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Thus, we used incubation times of hRPA with Oligo 31 sufficiently long to remove theoretical hairpin structures.</p><p>Oligo 31 incubated for 10 min at 10&#x000b0;C with a defined amount of hRPA was loaded onto a native 5 or 7% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel; migration was performed at 10&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Oligo 31 (2 nM) was titrated with hRPA (from 2to 150 nM). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A illustrates the results of EMSA experiments obtained when 5% non-denaturating PAGE was used to separate the binding products. In the presence of hRPA, a single major band with reduced mobility was detected. In accordance with previously reported data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31 B32 B33 B34 B35">29&#x02013;35</xref>) the protein binds Oligo 31 and forms a non-covalent complex designated C. Higher concentrations of hRPA did not result in the detection of additional retarded bands. It should however be noted that at the two highest concentrations (100 and 150 nM) the single band was slightly more retarded and an additional band was discerned. When the same mixtures were separated by non-denaturating 7% PAGE three retarded complexes of different mobilities were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). At hRPA concentrations up to 10 nM, a single band designated C<sub>I</sub> appeared, that migrated like the C complex observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A; as the hRPA concentration increased, a second and then a third more slowly migrating bands, designated complex C<sub>II</sub> and C<sub>III</sub>, respectively, appeared. To identify the nature of these retarded complexes, protein&#x02013;DNA cross-linking experiments with 0.1% glutaraldehyde were performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and the reaction mixtures loaded onto 5% native gels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, glutaraldehyde treatment revealed the existence of three bands designated C&#x02032;<sub>I</sub>, C&#x02032;<sub>II</sub>, C&#x02032;<sub>III</sub>. These data indicate that C&#x02032;<sub>I</sub> is the 1:1 (hRPA:Oligo 31) covalent complex, C&#x02032;<sub>II</sub> is the 2:1 covalent complex and C&#x02032;<sub>III</sub> is the 3:1 covalent complex, and suggest that the retarded species observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) are respectively 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 complexes. This is supported by our recent results that showed that a shorter oligonucleotide (21 nt) is able to bind at least two hRPA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The 1:1 stoichiometry suggests that hRPA binds Oligo 31 in the stable 30 nt binding mode, while in the 2:1 complexes hRPA interacts in the 13&#x02013;22 nt binding mode and finally formation of 3:1 complexes would be in accordance with a less stable 8&#x02013;10 nt binding mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A at 100 and 150 nM hRPA). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Titration of Oligo 31 as a function of hRPA concentration. <sup>32</sup>P-Oligo 31 (2 nM) was incubated with the indicated amounts of hRPA and separated on a native 5% (<bold>A</bold>) or 7% (<bold>B</bold>) polyacrylamide gel.

Three distinct retarded bands were detected for each DNA probe used in the assay. To identify the nature of the retarded bands, the appropriate control experiments were performed. No crosslink formed without UV-irradiation or upon irradiation of a mixture of hRPA and Oligo 31. Addition of proteinase K to the irradiated mixture before loading onto the gel led to the disappearance of retarded bands yielding only free DNA (not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that the retarded bands correspond to adducts of ssDNA with hRPA subunits. Cross-linking efficiencies are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. As expected, the cross-linking efficiency varies with the hRPA concentration. At low protein concentrations, no cross-links were observed for Oligo 31S<sub>3-22</sub>. However a protein&#x02013;DNA adduct was observed with Oligo 31S<sub>29</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus at low protein concentrations there is a favorable contact between the 3&#x02032;-side of ssDNA and hRPA. The apparent molecular weight of each cross-linked species has been estimated to be close to 25, 42 and 83 kDa. Cross-linking of individual subunits to DNA is expected to increase their apparent masses by 10 kDa suggesting that the 25, 42 and 83 kDa species indeed correspond to the cross-linked RPA3, RPA2 and RPA1, respectively. Nevertheless, from this experiment it cannot be excluded that the fastest migrating bands (25 and 42 kDa species) correspond to cross-linked products of proteolyzed forms, generated from the larger subunits (RPA1 and RPA2), retaining their ability to bind ssDNA. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Photo-cross-linking reactions between hRPA and Oligo 31S and identification of complexes by immunoblotting.

After treatment of the membrane-immobilized protein&#x02013;DNA adducts by DNase I, the subunits were identified using Amersham ECL detection kits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Two bands were detected after incubation with each type of Ab (lanes 1): one corresponds to non cross-linked hRPA subunit and the retarded band corresponds to the cross-linked subunit. The difference in migration for each couple of bands corresponds to the mass increment of the Oligo 31S (&#x02248;10 kDa). Thus incubation with antibodies specific of RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3 demonstrated that the 25, 42 and 83 kDa products are covalent adducts of ssDNA with the RPA3, RPA2 and RPA1, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>The 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 complexes reveal 30, 13&#x02013;22 and 8&#x02013;10 nt binding modes, respectively</title><p>To illustrate the correlation of hRPA photo-cross-linking patterns with the presence of different types of complexes, the relative yields of each cross-linked species and each complex represented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> were evaluated. The data reveal that RPA1 cross-links at positions 3 and 9 whatever the nature of the complex. In the case of the centrally located s<sup>4</sup>T (Oligo 31S<sub>16</sub>) both RPA1 and RPA2 crosslink (with a higher efficiency for RPA1). In addition, formation of 2:1 and 3:1 complexes is followed by a decrease in RPA2 cross-linking and an increase in RPA1 cross-linking. However, the relative yield of RPA2 cross-linking slightly decreases upon increase in hRPA concentration suggesting that RPA2 remains in contact with ssDNA around this position in the 2:1 complex. When the photoactivable nucleotide is placed at position 22 and at low hRPA concentrations, where the 1:1 complex predominates, RPA2 is the major cross-linking target. In addition, this adduct disappears upon increasing hRPA concentrations showing a good correlation between the presence of the 1:1 complex and contact of RPA2 at position 22 of Oligo 31S. Finally, at low hRPA concentrations the DNA probe bearing photoactivable nucleotide at the position 29 (close to the 3&#x02032;-side) forms single adduct, which corresponds to cross-linked RPA3. Positioning of RPA3 at the 3&#x02032;-side is correlated with the existence of the 1:1 complex since disappearance of the RPA3 contact with DNA follows disappearance of the 1:1 complex. The appearance of the 2:1 and 3:1 complexes favors the RPA1 cross-link. Interestingly, even if the yield is low, a cross-link occurs between RPA2 and ssDNA when the 2:1 complex is formed indicating contact between RPA2 and the 3&#x02032;-side of the ssDNA. This contact is still present at the highest hRPA concentration since the 2:1 complex remains the major complex. However, we cannot exclude that RPA2 is present in this region in the 3:1 complex. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Quantification of cross-linked species. The relative amounts of cross-linked species involving RPA1 (red, long dashed line), RPA2 (blue, medium dashed line) and RPA3 (green, short dashed line) subunits were quantified for each hRPA concentration from the hRPA-Oligo 31S gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Error bar is &#x000b1;20%. The results obtained for 2 nM of hRPA were not reported since no cross-links were observed except for Oligo 31S<sub>29</sub>. To correlate the nature of the complexes with the presence of the subunit on the DNA, the relative yield of each complex was taken from data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B.

(i) In the 1:1 complex, only one molecule of the heterotrimer protein binds ssDNA in the 30-nt binding mode (elongated extended form). Thus RPA1 is localized at the 5&#x02032;-side of ssDNA and occludes &#x0223c;14&#x02013;16 nt. The following subunit bound to ssDNA is RPA2 and then RPA3 is positioned near the 3&#x02032;-end of the ssDNA. This model is in accordance with the defined 5&#x02032;- to 3&#x02032;-binding polarity of hRPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>) and clearly localizes the RPA3 subunit on the 3&#x02032;-side of the ssDNA. (ii) In the 2:1 complex, two hRPA molecules bind ssDNA in the 13&#x02013;22 nt binding mode. In this elongated contracted form, RPA3 subunits do not contact ssDNA while two RPA1 and two RPA2 subunits interact with ssDNA. The RPA2 subunits of two heterotrimers are placed around positions 16 and 29, respectively. (iii) In the 3:1 complex hRPA in mainly contacts ssDNA via RPA1 in accordance with 8&#x02013;10 nt binding mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In this compact conformation of hRPA RPA2 does not contact ssDNA. However a contact of one of the three RPA2 subunits at the 3&#x02032;-side of the ssDNA cannot be excluded. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Schematic models of the 30, 13&#x02013;22 and 8&#x02013;10 nt binding modes.

This protein tightly binds ssDNA via a multi-step mechanism with a defined 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; polarity and very high affinity and takes part in resolution of complicated DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>The data presented demonstrate different binding modes of hRPA:ssDNA using EMSA without glutaraldehyde trapping. Several factors linked to the experimental conditions can explain the observation of these three binding modes. The experiments were performed at 10&#x000b0;C, instead of the widely used 25&#x000b0;C. These conditions stabilize hRPA:ssDNA complexes. Non-denaturating 7% PAGE provides better separation of different hRPA:ssDNA complexes than the widely used 5% acrylamide or 1% agarose gels. The same observations were made by Jiang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) using a 7.5% acrylamide gel. Thus, these data obtained in the optimized conditions demonstrate existence of three species of hRPA:ssDNA complexes at varying [hRPA]/[ssDNA] ratio. Observation of high order complexes at low NaCl concentration and at high RPA concentration is correlated with the recently demonstrated binding of four hRPA molecules to a 48 nt ssDNA in saturation conditions at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and two <italic>Saccharomices cerevisiae</italic> RPA (scRPA) molecules to a 30 nt ssDNA at low NaCl concentration (20 mM) and at high [scRPA]/[ssDNA] ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).</p><p>There are four DBD located in the RPA1 (DBD A, DBD B, DBD C and DBD F), one each in RPA2 (DBD D) and in RPA3 (DBD E). RPA1 has the highest ssDNA binding affinity of the three subunits (DBD A and DBD B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>); the DBD C domain has a lower affinity for ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) while the major function of the DBD F domain is to control specific interactions of RPA with other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The DBD D domain of RPA2 has moderate ssDNA binding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Although RPA3 contains a similar OB-fold motif as found in DBDs, direct contacts of DNA with the small hRPA subunit have not been demonstrated in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). However, recent studies suggest that in the 30 nt binding mode, the four DBDs (DBD A, DBD B, DBD C and DBD D) occlude only &#x0223c;26 nt of ssDNA implying that other parts or domains of hRPA could also be partially or indirectly involved, so that 30 nt of ssDNA would be occluded by hRPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Using photo-cross-linking experiments based on photoreactivity of 4-thiothymine, and the product identification procedure based on the used specific antibodies we have demonstrated the existence of direct contact RPA3-ssDNA, bearing a photoreactive nucleotide near the 3&#x02032;-end. Thus, even if this contact is low or transient, it is clear that RPA3 (DBD E) is positioned near the 3&#x02032;-side of ssDNA in conditions of elongated extended hRPA:ssDNA complex formation. Transient or low contact could be explained by a very weak affinity of DBD E for ssDNA due to the significant structural differences observed in the OB-fold motif in DBD E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). In addition, a comparison of the ssDNA binding surfaces between RPA1 and the RPA3/RPA2 dimer showed that the lower affinity of RPA3/RPA2 can be contributed to a shallower binding crevice with reduced positive electrostatic charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). This close contact observed here significantly advances our understanding of the 30 nt binding mode of RPA. The entire contact data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A allow us to propose a schematic model of the 30 nt binding mode where RPA3 is clearly localized at the 3&#x02032;-side of the ssDNA. This model agrees with the well-characterized polarity of RPA in which RPA1 is located at the 5&#x02032;-side and RPA2 towards the 3&#x02032;-side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Localization of RPA2 around position 22 agrees with recent data that place RPA2 around position 24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) with a straight 8-nt inserted into the ssDNA between the DBD C and DBD D domains. However, significant cross-linking with RPA2 around position 16 suggests that this subunit could move along the ssDNA and be placed more or less near RPA1. From the data obtained in conditions where the 2:1 complex predominates, we propose a 13&#x02013;22 nt binding mode, RPA1 overall occluding the length of the ssDNA. On the basis of the known structures of DBD domains of RPA and of further recent data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), we propose that RPA1 interacts with ssDNA by sequential loading, from the 5&#x02032;- to 3&#x02032;-end of ssDNA, of DBD A, DBD B and DBD C domains. DBD D of RPA2 is also placed along this length of the DNA strand. At saturating RPA concentrations, when 3:1 complexes are predominantly formed, only RPA1 directly contacts with DNA in accordance with an 8&#x02013;10 nt binding mode of RPA in which only DBD A and DBD B interact with ssDNA.</p><p>Recent data obtained using similar photoreactive ssDNA with a different non monotonous sequence also demonstrated formation of hRPA:ssDNA complexes of various stoichiometries and existence of photo-cross-linking product, which can be conceivably attributed as RPA3-DNA adduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Several distinctions in non-covalent complexes formation and in photo-cross-linking patterns, as compare to the data presented here, can be explained by the differences of experimental conditions used. This also emphasized, that interaction of RPA with ssDNA is a dynamic process, which is sensitive to many factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>At higher RPA concentrations, RPA molecules compete with each other to bind to short DNA. As DBD A and DBD B of RPA bind DNA with high affinity, each RPA molecule occludes 8&#x02013;10 nt producing DNA saturated by several RPA molecules. This polymerization phenomenon is in accordance with recent data showing polymerization of RPA along long ssDNA by AFM microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). When the protein concentration decreases, more sites are available for each RPA molecule allowing binding of other DBD domains. Thus binding of DBD A and DBD B can be followed by the weakly binding DBD C on the 3&#x02032;-side, resulting in the elongated contracted (13&#x02013;22 nt) binding mode as well as by DBD D. Binding of DBD E is possible at lower protein concentrations leading to the formation of elongated extended RPA complexes characterized by a 30 nt long occluded binding site. It is interesting that RPA3 was never detected as cross-linking target of photoaffinity labeling of RPA using recessed template primers with various photoreactive groups introduced in 3&#x02032;-end of the primer; 3&#x02032;-protruding 30 nt ssDNA templates were used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The major target of photo-cross-linking with an [RPA]/[ssDNA] ratio of 1/1 was RPA2. When a recessed template primer with a template length of 13&#x02013;14 nt or less was used, the main target of cross-linking was RPA1. These data are in agreement with the model proposed here. The absence of RPA3 at the template primer&#x02014;overhang might be due to the difference in mode of RPA interaction with ssDNA and recessed template-primer DNA structure as well as by the absence of direct contact of RPA3 with template-primer overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, in the present study RPA3 was identified as the subunit of the heterotrimer directly contacting the 3&#x02032;-side of ssDNA when one molecule of hRPA in an elongated conformation binds a 31 nt ssDNA molecule. The proposed scheme of elongated complex is in good agreement with sequential 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; binding of RPA where the first DBDs A and B of RPA1 located to the 5&#x02032;-side start to interact with the DNA (8&#x02013;10 nt binding mode), followed along the DNA by DBD C (from RPA1), DBD D (from RPA2) and finally DBD E (from RPA3) binds to the DNA progressing to the 30 nt high-affinity binding mode. To identify the details of the interaction of each RPA subunit and ssDNA, isolation of protein&#x02013;ssDNA adducts and analysis by mass spectrometry methods will be employed.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>GEFLUC (to C.S.), INTAS-SBRAS grant and Program RAS Molecular and Cellular Biology (to O.L. and I.P.).
