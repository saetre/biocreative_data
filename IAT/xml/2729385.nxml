This complexity can also be seen in mouse models where it is frequently observed that in addition to the initiating genetic alteration, the resulting tumor harbors additional, somatically acquired mutations that affect the tumor phenotype. To investigate the role of genetic interactions in the development of tumors, we have made use of the E&#x003bc;-<italic>myc</italic> model of pre-B and B cell lymphoma. Since various studies point to a functional interaction between Myc and the Rb/E2F pathway, we have investigated the role of E2F activities in the process of Myc-induced lymphomagenesis. Whereas the absence of E2F1 and E2F3 function has no impact on Myc-mediated tumor development, the absence of E2F2 substantially accelerates the time of tumor onset. Conversely, tumor development is delayed by the absence of E2F4. The enhanced early onset of tumors seen in the absence of E2F2 coincides with an expansion of immature B lineage cells that are likely to be the target for Myc oncogenesis. In contrast, the absence of E2F4 mutes the response of the lineage to Myc and there is no expansion of immature B lineage cells. We also find that distinct types of tumors emerge from the E&#x003bc;-<italic>myc</italic> mice, distinguished by different patterns of gene expression, and that the relative proportions of these tumor types are affected by the absence of either E2F2 or E2F4. From these results, we conclude that there are several populations of tumors that arise from the E&#x003bc;-<italic>myc</italic> model, reflecting distinct populations of cells that are susceptible to Myc-mediated oncogenesis and that the proportion of these cell populations is affected by the presence or absence of E2F activities.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The diversity of human cancers reflects the variety of genetic changes that cause tumors to emerge and progress. Even for mice engineered with a specific cancer-causing mutation, the resulting tumors are often divergent, reflecting different additional mutations. We wanted to investigate how activities that work together can collaborate in tumorigenesis. Specifically, we are interested in Myc and the E2F family of proteins, intersecting activities that influence a cell's decision to replicate, rest, or die. We made use of an engineered mouse that develops pre-B and B cell lymphoma initiated by Myc and tested whether the loss of particular E2F family members influences these lymphomas. We found that tumor emergence was accelerated by E2F2 loss and delayed by E2F4 loss. We attributed these results to the finding that the mice lacking E2F2 have a greater proportion than usual of the most susceptible, early-stage B lineage cells and the mice lacking E2F4 have fewer of these cells. Distinct tumor types emerged with their relative proportions influenced by E2F2 and E2F4 status. We conclude that the variety of tumors probably reflect different stages of B lymphoid development that respond to Myc and that E2F proteins can influence the proportions of these different stages.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A hallmark of human cancer is genetic complexity, reflecting the acquisition of multiple mutations and gene rearrangements that give rise to the tumor phenotype. Indeed, recent large-scale DNA sequencing efforts have provided direct evidence for this complexity, revealing large numbers of alterations that characterize various tumor types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Mullighan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Wood1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Undoubtedly, this genetic complexity of cancer underlies much of the challenge in developing effective therapeutic strategies. Not only is it likely that combinations of drugs will be necessary to match the complexity and effectively treat these tumors but equally important is the ability to identify subgroups of cancers that represent more homogeneous mechanisms of disease.</p><p>An ability to model the complexity that gives rise to the tumor heterogeneity seen in human cancers would clearly enhance the understanding of the oncogenic process but also would enable the development and testing of combination therapeutics that might match this complexity. Mouse models of cancer have generally employed the use of an activated oncogene or the disruption of a tumor suppressor gene to initiate the oncogenic process. Although this represents a defined genetic alteration, it is also true that in most instances this single event is not sufficient to allow for tumor development. This can be seen in the often protracted latency of tumor development as well as the identification of specific additional genetic alterations that appear in these tumors.</p><p>An example of a well-studied genetic model for the analysis of pre-B and B cell lymphoma is the E&#x003bc;-<italic>myc</italic> transgenic mouse. In the E&#x003bc;-<italic>myc</italic> transgenic mouse c-<italic>myc</italic> is constitutively expressed in the B lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Adams1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Verbeek1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The resulting polyclonal expansion of pre-B cells is initially limited by increased apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Cory1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Additional mutations, many of which inactivate the p53 tumor suppressor pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Eischen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, then arise. This leads to the emergence of a clonal pre-B or B cell lymphoma by six months of age in mice of a mixed C57Bl/6 and 129 strain background.</p><p>Myc has been shown to induce a large number of genes that contribute to cell proliferation. These include the direct transcriptional activation of D cyclin genes, the <italic>cdk4</italic> gene encoding the kinase partner for cyclin D, and the <italic>Cdc25A</italic> gene encoding the phosphatase that removes negative regulatory phosphates from the Cdks. The induction of Cyclin D/cdk4 activity leads directly to the phosphorylation of Rb and thus activation of E2Fs. Numerous studies have demonstrated a central role for the Rb-E2F pathway in the regulation of cellular proliferation. The majority of genes encoding DNA replication and mitotic activities are under the control of E2F proteins. Indeed, recent experiments provide evidence for a role for E2Fs in coordinating transcriptional regulatory events at G1/S and G2/M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Dyson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Nevins1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Other work has shown that E2Fs also link this critical proliferative pathway with the p53 response through a capacity to induce the p19ARF/Mdm2 pathway leading to the accumulation of p53 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Bates1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Kowalik1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, E2Fs provide a mechanism to directly link the control of cell proliferation with the determination of cell fate. In addition to the connection between Myc and E2F in the control of cellular proliferation, Myc expression couples cellular proliferation with the induction of apoptosis under specific growth conditions where survival growth factors are limiting. Myc-induced apoptosis is largely dependent upon p53 signaling and, similar to E2F1, involves the induction of p19<sup>ARF</sup>, inhibition of Mdm2, and elevated p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Zindy1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The shared functional properties of the Myc and E2F transcription factors, coupled with the finding that Myc can induce E2F gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Leone1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Sears1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, raise the possibility that Myc function might be mediated, at least in part, through the action of the E2F transcription factors. Indeed, work by the Bernards laboratory revealed that in addition to targeting p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, the mitogenic activity of Myc likely involves regulation of E2Fs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Berns1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This possibility has been more directly assessed using mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from embryos deleted for specific E2F genes to evaluate the functional relationship between Myc and various E2F proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Leone2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Experiments using these E2F-deficient MEFs showed that the ability of Myc to induce S phase in the absence of other mitogens is severely impaired in MEFs deleted for <italic>E2f2</italic> or <italic>E2f3</italic>, but not <italic>E2f1</italic> or <italic>E2f4</italic>. In contrast, Myc induced apoptosis in primary serum-deprived MEFs was delayed in cells deleted for <italic>E2f1</italic>, but not affected by <italic>E2f2</italic> or <italic>E2f3</italic> deletion. Thus, at least in cell culture, the induction of specific E2F activities is an essential downstream event in the Myc pathway that controls cell proliferation versus apoptosis, and some of the functions of Myc, such as the induction of p19<sup>ARF</sup> and p53 could be explained, at least in part, with one pathway leading through E2F activation.</p><p>To address the significance of the Myc-E2F connection in a relevant, <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, we have made use of a series of E2F-deficient mouse strains, in combination with the E&#x003bc;-<italic>myc</italic> transgenic model of lymphomagenesis (MGI:2448238), to investigate whether deficiencies in E2F1, E2F2, E2F3 or E2F4 (MGI:1857424, 2179111, 2177428 and 1888951) can influence Myc's oncogenic potential. We find that there is a critical role for two E2F activities in affecting the potential for Myc-induced oncogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>As a prelude to the investigation of a role for E2F activity in Myc-mediated oncogenesis, we analyzed the pattern of tissue-specific expression of the various E2F genes.

Sibling mice, wild type, heterozygous or null for a particular E2F gene, and bearing the E&#x003bc;-<italic>myc</italic> transgene, were examined weekly for any sign of lymphoma emergence.

Upon the appearance of any of these symptoms, the mouse was sacrificed, dissected to identify any lymph node enlargement, and tumor tissue harvested for analysis. For studies assessing the pre-tumor phenotype, mice were sacrificed within three to five weeks after birth and bone marrow and spleen recovered.

While transgenic mouse models reduce this complexity by fixing one event, various studies have shown a clear heterogeneity in the tumors that develop reflecting the acquisition of additional alterations. Based on the studies we describe here, we suggest that there are at least two distinct types of B lineage lymphoma that develop in the E&#x003bc;-<italic>myc</italic> mice. In mice with wild type E2F function, the predominant tumor arising with an early onset likely reflects the relative abundance of the target cell population. We suggest that the emergence of these tumors reflects a stochastic acquisition of additional mutations. Since this is a probabilistic event, there is then an opportunity for tumors to emerge from other populations of cells with characteristics distinct from the &#x0201c;early-standard&#x0201d; tumors. We propose that the late-onset tumors develop more slowly because the target cell populations are less abundant. It is also possible that these late-onset tumors are genetically more complex, requiring more mutations than the predominant form of tumors.</p><p>The work we present here provides clear evidence for an interaction between Myc and two E2Fs as seen by the effect on timing of tumor onset and the different characteristics of the lymphomas that arise in the absence of E2F2 or E2F4. The results suggest distinct roles for the E2F2 and E2F4 proteins in the process of B lineage development that then impacts Myc-mediated oncogenesis. A role for E2F4 in cell differentiation is consistent with past work that documented abnormalities in hematopoietic lineage development as well as the development of the gut and nasal epithelia with loss of E2F4 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Rempel1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Enos1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Humbert1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Kinross1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. This past work revealed a deficiency of various mature hematopoietic cell types and defects in the differentiation of immature cells in the absence of E2F4. Taken together, these observations suggest a critical role for E2F4 activity in controlling the maturation of hematopoietic lineage cells, including the B lymphoid compartment that generates the target cells for E&#x003bc;-<italic>myc</italic>-induced lymphomagenesis.</p><p>A role for E2F2 appears to be more complex. E2F2 has generally been characterized as one of the E2Fs involved in the activation of transcription of genes essential for cell proliferation. While the other two activating E2Fs (E2F1 and E2F3) appear to be broadly expressed, E2F2 expression is largely restricted to cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Indeed, previous work has pointed to a role for E2F2 in the function and development of various hematopoietic lineages. S-phase progression is impaired in B, erythroid, and myeloid lineages in the absence of E2F1 and E2F2, consistent with a role for these E2F products as positive regulators of cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Li1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, the possibility of a more complex role for E2F2 in hematopoietic cells emerged from studies demonstrating that the loss of E2F2 appears to enhance the proliferation of T cells following antigenic stimulation, suggesting a negative role for E2F2 in defining a threshold for Ag-stimulated proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Zhu1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Murga1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this latter observation is not consistent with the results we present here regarding proliferative capacity in <italic>E2f2</italic>-null B lineage cells, it certainly is true that with Myc overexpression, the absence of E2F2 function may accelerate tumor onset by increasing the proportion of progenitor B lineage populations.</p><p>Opavsky and colleagues have recently used a bitransgenic model of Myc-induced T cell lymphomagenesis to probe the importance of E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 for Myc activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000640-Opavsky1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Analogous to our findings for B lineage lymphomagenesis, they found that <italic>E2f1</italic> or <italic>E2f3</italic> deficiencies have no effect on T cell lymphoma progression. Most importantly, <italic>E2f2</italic> deficiency accelerates tumor onset in the T cell model as it does for the E&#x003bc;-<italic>myc</italic> model. In addition, other aspects of their findings are reminiscent of our results, namely that <italic>E2f2</italic> heterozygotes have an intermediate phenotype, suggesting some haploinsufficiency, and that with <italic>E2f2</italic> deficiency there is an increased incidence of multiple tumor clones. The salient difference is that in their study, <italic>E2f2</italic> deficiency is associated with reduced apoptosis.

As a result, the population of <italic>E2f2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> tumors is also more homogeneous with respect to their phenotype, as reflected by the gene expression profiles. In contrast, we propose that the loss of <italic>E2f4</italic> results in the decrease of this population of cells and thus the frequency of appearance of standard morphology early onset tumors. There is not a complete absence of these cells since a few tumors do arise in the absence of E2F4 that cluster with the &#x0201c;early-standard&#x0201d; wild type and <italic>E2f2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> tumors. But the consequence of this depletion is enrichment for tumors with a late chronological onset, whether to the extreme of the &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; cluster or in the &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; cluster, likely due to an opportunity for these tumors to develop because of the reduced frequency of the &#x0201c;early-standard&#x0201d; variety.
