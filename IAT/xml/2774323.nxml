We investigated whether hypothalamic FTO is involved in energy-dependent overconsumption of food. We determined FTO mRNA levels in rodent models of short- and long-term intake of palatable fat or sugar, deprivation, diet-induced increase in body weight, baseline preference for fat versus sugar as well as in same-weight animals differing in the inherent propensity to eat calories especially upon availability of diverse diets, using quantitative PCR. FTO gene expression was also studied in organotypic hypothalamic cultures treated with anorexigenic amino acid, leucine. In situ hybridization (ISH) was utilized to study FTO signal in reward- and hunger-related sites, colocalization with anorexigenic oxytocin, and c-Fos immunoreactivity in FTO cells at initiation and termination of a meal.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Deprivation upregulated FTO mRNA, while leucine downregulated it. Consumption of palatable diets or macronutrient preference did not affect FTO expression. However, the propensity to ingest more energy without an effect on body weight was associated with lower FTO mRNA levels. We found that 4-fold higher number of FTO cells displayed c-Fos at meal termination as compared to initiation in the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of re-fed mice. Moreover, ISH showed that FTO is present mainly in hunger-related sites and it shows a high degree of colocalization with anorexigenic oxytocin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that FTO mRNA is present mainly in sites related to hunger/satiation control; changes in hypothalamic FTO expression are associated with cues related to energy intake rather than feeding reward. In line with that, neurons involved in feeding termination express FTO. Interestingly, baseline FTO expression appears linked not only with energy intake but also energy metabolism.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human studies show a strong association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the FTO gene with obesity and diabetes in diverse ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Common intronic variants in this gene have been linked with increased body weight and adiposity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; e.g., individuals homozygous for the rs9939609 allele, weigh ~3 kg more than those with low-risk alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. High-risk variants carry a population-attributable likelihood of overweight and obesity exceeding 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Aside from the association with BMI, variations in the FTO gene have been linked with glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], distribution of subcutaneous fat and amount of liver fat, as well as non-visceral and visceral adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. FTO codes for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent nucleic acid demethylase that likely plays a role in oxidative demethylation of 3-methylthymine and 3-methyluracil in single-stranded DNA and RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Little is known about the nature of the association between FTO and BMI; only a few basic research studies have been performed on laboratory animals. Fontanesi et al. found that FTO is associated with intermuscular fat deposition in pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. FTO mRNA is present in many tissue types, but its most abundant expression was detected in the brain, particularly, in hypothalamic nuclei which govern feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In rodents, starvation modifies FTO mRNA levels detected with real-time PCR (rtPCR) in the entire hypothalamus and in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), however both up- and downregulation have been shown, thus, FTO expression alterations may be dependent on the severity of starvation or other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These changes are independent from leptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Generation of the knock-out (KO) model was a crucial step in understanding FTO's role in body weight control. KO mice displayed decreased body weight despite consuming more standard chow than wild type (WT) controls; this effect persisted from post-natal day 2 onwards. In addition, FTO mRNA was found to colocalize with ARC proopiomelanocortin (POMC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which gives rise to, among others, a satiety factor alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and reward mediating beta-endorphin.</p><p>Animal experiments performed to date have not addressed the key issue of whether FTO's involvement in weight gain is based solely on energy-related mechanisms or there is also a reward component. The current project was designed to characterize the relationship between FTO and obesity through feeding models, molecular analyses and functional neuroanatomy in mice. Special attention was given to the hypothalamus as - aside from primarily regulating energy intake - it mediates feeding reward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>We investigated whether FTO mRNA levels respond to a brief fast. Since overeating, especially of palatable tastants, serves as an obesogenic factor, we studied the effect of short-term (48 h) overconsumption of sucrose or fat on hypothalamic FTO expression. We examined whether body weight increase induced by long-term exposure to sugar has any effect. Furthermore, individual preferences for fat versus sucrose were correlated to the baseline FTO expression. Since same-weight mice exhibited inherent differences in their propensity to consume energy especially when diverse diets were offered, we compared the baseline expression profiles in individuals that ate more to the ones that ingested fewer calories and we employed a similar rat model to confirm our findings. Organotypic cultures of the hypothalamus were used to study FTO mRNA levels following the addition of a satiating amino acid, leucine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>We performed in situ hybridization (ISH) to compare FTO expression in strictly reward-related sites to that in the hypothalamus, a region involved in both feeding for energy and reward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As FTO was found to coexpress with POMC, double ISH-immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to determine whether FTO colocalizes with another hypothalamic feeding regulator, the anorexigenic peptide, oxytocin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Finally, using IHC detection of an immediate-early gene product, c-Fos, we studied activity of FTO neurons at initiation vs. termination of feeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57BL/6J mice (Scanbur, Sweden) were housed individually or in groups of two (PCR Exp. 1, 2 and 3) in macrolon cages with LD 12:12 (lights on at 0700).

Hypothalamic FTO expression following 48-h consumption of palatable sucrose or Intralipid</title><p>Mice were given a bottle of 10% sucrose or 4.1% Intralipid in addition to chow for 48 h; controls had chow only (n = 8/group). Intralipid (Fresenius, Sweden), a palatable lipid emulsion of soybean oil, glycerol and egg yolk phospholipids, has been used in experiments utilizing liquid diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Sucrose and Intralipid were isocaloric (0.4 kcal/g), whereas the energy content of chow was 3.6 kcal/g. The solutions were similar in palatability: each mouse ingested on average 8.1 kcal of Intralipid and 7.4 kcal of sucrose daily. Total caloric intake per mouse was 10.3 kcal in the chow group, 14.1 kcal in the sucrose group and 12.9 kcal in the Intralipid group. Mice were decapitated after 48 h (between 1100 and 1200).</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment 3.

The initial body weights did not differ (controls: 27.6 &#x000b1; 0.3 g; sucrose: 27.8 &#x000b1; 0.5 g). After 3 weeks of chow and sucrose intake, mice weighed 32.1 &#x000b1; 0.4 g, whereas the chow controls weighed 29.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 g (P &#x0003c; 0.05; t-test).

During the first two days, animals got accustomed to tastants. Subsequently, according to the standards applied in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], the mice were divided based on the 5-day preference profile: 1) sucrose-preferring (n = 7), 57.0 &#x000b1; 2.2% of sucrose + Intralipid calories came from sucrose; (2) fat-preferring (n = 7), 39.2 &#x000b1; 3.0% calories came from sucrose; and (3) neutral (n = 7), sucrose was the source of 46.9 &#x000b1; 1.9% calories. Sucrose and Intralipid were later removed and only chow was given for 21 days ("washout") so that gene expression levels at endpoint were not affected by consumption of palatable tastants. The animals were decapitated (1100-1200). Body weights at the end of the palatable tastant availability and at the end of the "washout" phase did not differ between the preference groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment 5. Hypothalamic FTO expression in mice differing in calorie intake upon availability of a diverse diet</title><p>The set-up in Exp. 4 provided a diverse diet that included standard chow, palatable sucrose and Intralipid. Although animals displayed different propensities to ingest sucrose and Intralipid, some of them - regardless of preference - ingested overall (sucrose+Intralipid+chow) more energy than others. The "small eaters" (n = 10) ate daily 11.3 &#x000b1; 0.4 kcal of all tastants while the "big eaters" (n = 11), 14.4 &#x000b1; 1.2 kcal (P &#x0003c; 0.05; t-test). The difference in the amount of consumed food was significant in the environment rich in diverse foods. The initial body weight did not differ between the groups ("small eaters": 27.2 &#x000b1; 0.4 g; "big eaters": 27.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 g). The 7-day exposure to palatable diets did not induce changes in body weight (29.0 &#x000b1; 0.4 g and 28.3 &#x000b1; 0.3 g, respectively; P = 0.287). Once palatable liquids were removed and the animals had only access to chow for 21 days, energy intake did not differ between groups during this "washout phase" although a slight trend remained (cumulative intake for big eaters: 241.8 &#x000b1; 14.1 kcal vs small eaters: 221 &#x000b1; 12.6 kcal; P = 0.160) and neither did body weights (P = 0.605) at decapitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment 6. Arcuate hypothalamic FTO expression in rats that differ in calorie intake upon availability of a diverse diet</title><p>This experiment was included to examine whether the FTO expression pattern in the "big/small eaters" paradigm can be detected in rats. Male Wistar rats, housed individually with free access to chow and water, received for 10 days a 30% sucrose solution (n = 10), a bowl of lard (n = 10), or both tastants (n = 15). Animals increased their caloric intake when presented with the palatable diets (229 &#x000b1; 3.4 kcal/kg on chow and 276 &#x000b1; 5.7 kcal/kg on palatable diets; P &#x0003c; 0.0001). The animals were divided into "big eaters" (n = 17) and "small eaters" (n = 17): 249 &#x000b1; 3.0 kcal/kg for the "small eaters" and 302 &#x000b1; 5.9 kcal/kg for the "big eaters". Body weights did not differ between the groups following the exposure to palatable diets or at endpoint (P = 0.411 and 0.640, respectively).

Briefly, 21-day-old male C57BL6 mice were decapitated, the brains were removed under sterile conditions and transferred to the Gey's Balanced Salt Solution (GBSS) (Biological Industries, Israel) containing 25 mM glucose. Hypothalami were dissected and sliced into 300-&#x003bc;m thick sections using the McIlwian tissue chopper. Slices from each brain were placed separately on semiporous membranes (Millipore) inserted into six-well culture plates (Sarstedt) containing 1.2 ml of the serum-Opti-MEM medium in each well. Culture medium was a mixture of Opti-MEM (50%; Gibco), horse serum (25%) and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (25%; Gibco) supplemented with 50% D(+) glucose monohydrate (25 mM, Merc). Growing medium of the experimental group (n = 7) was supplemented with 0.3 &#x003bc;g leucine; controls (n = 7) had no leucine added.

Treating organotypic cultures of the hypothalamus with anorexigenic leucine caused downregulation of FTO mRNA as well as of two orexigenic genes, NPY and ORX (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Finally, the propensity to eat less during the exposure to a self-composed, diverse and palatable diet was associated with higher FTO mRNA levels. During the exposure, "small eaters" ate fewer calories than "big eaters" did (11.3 &#x000b1; 0.4 kcal and 14.4 &#x000b1; 1.2 kcal per day, respectively; P &#x0003c; 0.05) and, after the 3-week "washout" phase of chow intake (trend of elevated calorie intake in big eaters; P = 0.160), they had ~50% higher FTO mRNA content (P = 0.004; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>). There was no change in expression of several reference genes, including DYN, POMC, neuropeptide Y (NPY), Agouti-related protein (AGRP) and MC4R (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>). Applying a similar paradigm in rats resulted in the same outcome for the FTO mRNA in the hypothalamic ARC, i.e. "small eaters" had an elevated level of FTO (P = 0.030; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>).</p><p>ISH detection of FTO mRNA revealed expression primarily in the hypothalamus. Some sites linked with reward, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (Acb), had very little or lacked the FTO signal, whereas others, e.g., the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and parabrachial nucleus, expressed moderate levels of FTO (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Our data strongly suggest that FTO, the first gene contributing to common forms of human obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], plays a significant role in mechanisms responsible for the regulation of energy-related eating behavior.</p><p>This presumed involvement in hunger control is reflected by the neuroanatomical distribution of FTO visualized through ISH. This gene is scarcely expressed within the reward network: particularly low levels are found in the Acb and VTA which host, e.g., opioid and dopaminergic circuitry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] mediating hedonics of food intake. On the other hand, very high expression was detected in hypothalamic regions, including the PVN, ARC and dorsomedial nucleus (DMH) that encompass key genes influencing hunger and satiety, such as NPY, AGRP, POMC and MC4R.</p><p>Distribution primarily outside the "reward network" does not exclude a possibility of this gene's involvement in reward processes, especially since the molecular components of the reward system (e.g. genes encoding opioid peptides and receptors) are dispersed throughout the CNS and present also in the hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In fact, intake of palatable diets, especially those containing fat or sugar, modifies expression of reward-related genes in the hypothalamus; and reward mediators, e.g., opioid ligands, injected in this structure are particularly effective in changing intake of such foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, in our experiments we have not found evidence linking hypothalamic FTO with feeding reward. Ingestion of palatable sugar or fat did not affect FTO expression, which suggests that FTO mRNA levels do not change upon exposure to palatable tastants in general and there is no special relationship between FTO and a particular palatable macronutrient (fat or sugar). This was seen following short- (48 h) and long-term (3 weeks) intake of rewarding tastants. The outcome is in line with our previous findings showing the lack of correlation in expression of FTO and reward-related genes, including DYN and enkephalin, in rat deprivation models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, differences in animals' liking of sugar versus fat did not reflect any disparities in FTO gene activity profile. It suggests that the inherent preference for a specific macronutrient is not dependent on the baseline FTO expression in the hypothalamus. These data are of particular importance as they suggest that hypothalamic FTO's role is unrelated to eating for pleasure or inclination to choose one palatable macronutrient over another. As the mice maintained on sucrose for 3 weeks gained more weight than chow-fed controls, it also indicates that the development of overeating-driven obesity is not a causative factor in changes in FTO expression. This lack of change in FTO expression in the aforementioned models shows a striking difference from the response of other feeding-related "reference" genes studied herein, including opioids, melanocortins and MCH. Obviously, one cannot rule out the possibility that FTO outside the hypothalamus may affect or be affected by the feeding variables considered herein, including reward and preference, but hypothalamic FTO shows a strong association only with energy intake control.</p><p>Three independent studies have shown that depriving rodents of food influences FTO mRNA content in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In mice, fasting was reported to decrease expression of this gene, however, starvation applied in those studies was severe as it lasted 40-48 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Upregulation has been detected in rats. In the current study, a short-term, overnight fast, upregulated FTO mRNA. The data confirm that FTO is sensitive to a current energy status of the organism, probably in terms of both energy acquired and stored; but the results also point to the necessity of defining parameters accompanying deprivation of various magnitudes and timeframes that shape the FTO gene activity.</p><p>The Fos experiment showed that &#x0003e;4 times more FTO neurons in the PVN and ARC were "activated" at feeding termination than initiation. Activity of FTO expressing cells at the end of a meal suggests FTO's involvement in feeding inhibitory mechanisms. In fact, c-Fos IR is increased in the PVN and ARC of rodents following 1-h intake of caloric but not non-caloric tastants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, an upward trend in neuronal activity in hypothalamic cells synthesizing anorexigenic peptides has been reported: a greater percentage of Fos-positive neurons synthesizing oxytocin and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone can be detected at feeding termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Noteworthy, FTO is expressed in PVN neurons that produce oxytocin, which is released within the CNS in response to such satiation cues as increased stomach distention and high plasma osmolality. This colocalization occurs in magno- and parvocellular cells, which implies that FTO may influence the activity of oxytocin neurons that project to the posterior pituitary (magnocellular) as well as to sites linked with feeding control, including the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (parvocellular) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Our oxytocin colocalization results along with the previous report regarding POMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] indicate that FTO may be involved in mechanisms that end consummatory activity, thus, those that are closely tied with meal size (therefore, amount of ingested energy) control. A previously reported correlation in the expression of FTO and energy-related gene encoding galanin-like peptide supports this concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The question remained as to whether the role of FTO in satiety-related hypothalamic neurons, such as those positive for POMC or oxytocin, is to increase or decrease their activity. Addition of leucine, which in vivo reduces feeding and activates anorexigenic neurons synthesizing POMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], to hypothalamic organotypic cultures produced downregulation of FTO expression. This suggests that nutrient cues mediating satiation decrease FTO mRNA levels while increasing activity of the satiety network (e.g., POMC cells), hence, there is the inverse relationship between FTO and satiety.</p><p>The first studies with the use of the FTO KO murine model showed that the role of FTO in energy intake and metabolism regulation goes beyond short-term control of feeding. Surprisingly, FTO KO mice weigh less even though they exhibit relative hyperphagia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Our "big/small eaters" experiment further supports the findings obtained in the KO mice. This experiment was inspired by the observations that diversity of foods propels energy intake beyond levels required to satisfy energy needs. Interestingly, under such conditions, some individuals display a significantly higher degree of hyperphagia than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The "big eaters" - characterized by lower FTO expression (P = 0.004) - weighed the same as the "small eaters", even though during the several-day diverse food exposure period they ingested ca. 22% more energy and a slight trend of higher energy intake (P = 0.160) remained throughout the subsequent exposure to regular chow. Our data indicate that the higher energy intake that does not translate to increased body weight may be accompanied by downregulation of the FTO gene in the hypothalamus. This is in concert with the conclusion reached in the FTO KO mouse studies that not only feeding, but also energy metabolism and expenditure are affected by FTO.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Changes in hypothalamic FTO mRNA levels are associated with a deprived state as well as with the presence of the amino acid leucine that promotes satiety and feeding termination. In addition, c-Fos IR of FTO neurons in the ARC and PVN increases at the end of consummatory activity; and FTO co-localizes with anorexigenic oxytocin in the PVN. It allows us to speculate that hypothalamic FTO may be involved in the regulation of energy intake, possibly by affecting feeding termination mechanisms. Distribution of FTO mRNA mainly in hunger/satiation-related sites and lack of changes in FTO expression upon exposure to palatable tastants call into question a possible involvement of FTO in the reward component of feeding. Finally, the inherent propensity to eat more without a change in body weight is associated with low hypothalamic FTO mRNA levels. In contrast, long-term palatability-driven overconsumption (irrespective of the aforementioned individual propensity to eat different amounts of food) that leads to increase in body weight does not affect FTO expression in the hypothalamus.</p><p>Overall, our molecular and histological data strongly link hypothalamic FTO with the regulation of feeding for calories not for reward; the molecular analyses also point to a possible role of this gene in energy metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PKO - carried out the ISH experiments and tissue dissections, drafted the manuscript, RF - participated in the design of the molecular studies and design of the animal models, AMO - carried out double ISH-IHC staining, OS - carried out mouse PCR studies, JA - designed and carried out the rat FTO PCR studies, KJR - designed and carried out the organotypic tissue culture studies, ASL - participated in the statistical analyses and drafting the manuscript, HBS - participated in the design and coordination of the study and in drafting the manuscript.
