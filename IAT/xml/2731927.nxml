Chemotherapy causes further bone loss, and bone-specific treatments are only palliative. Multiple tumor-secreted factors act on the bone microenvironment to drive a feed-forward cycle of tumor growth. Effective treatment requires inhibiting upstream regulators of groups of prometastatic factors. Two central regulators are hypoxia and transforming growth factor (TGF)- &#x003b2;. We asked whether hypoxia (via HIF-1&#x003b1;) and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling promote bone metastases independently or synergistically, and we tested molecular versus pharmacological inhibition strategies in an animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We analyzed interactions between HIF-1&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; pathways in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Only vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), of 16 genes tested, were additively increased by both TGF-&#x003b2; and hypoxia, with effects on the proximal promoters. We inhibited HIF-1&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; pathways in tumor cells by shRNA and dominant negative receptor approaches. Inhibition of either pathway decreased bone metastasis, with no further effect of double blockade. We tested pharmacologic inhibitors of the pathways, which target both the tumor and the bone microenvironment. Unlike molecular blockade, combined drug treatment decreased bone metastases more than either alone, with effects on bone to decrease osteoclastic bone resorption and increase osteoblast activity, in addition to actions on tumor cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Hypoxia and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in parallel drive tumor bone metastases and regulate a common set of tumor genes. In contrast, small molecule inhibitors, by acting on both tumor cells and the bone microenvironment, additively decrease tumor burden, while improving skeletal quality. Our studies suggest that inhibitors of HIF-1&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; may improve treatment of bone metastases and increase survival.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="20"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancers frequently metastasize to bone, where they disrupt normal bone remodeling to cause bone destruction, pain, pathologic fracture, hypercalcemia, and nerve compression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006896-Roodman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides conventional radiation and chemotherapy, bisphosphonates are the only treatment available for patients with bone metastases.

Bone is a unique microenvironment in which breast cancer thrives. Growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF- &#x003b2;) are stored in the mineralized bone matrix. Breast cancers that metastasize to bone secrete factors, such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and interleukin-11 (IL-11), that stimulate osteoclastic bone destruction and the release and activation of growth factors immobilized in the bone matrix. These factors in turn act on tumor cells to promote a feed-forward cycle of tumor growth and bone destruction which contributes to the incurability of bone metastases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006896-Mundy1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Hypoxia and high concentrations of TGF-&#x003b2; in the bone microenvironment enhance tumor production of factors that drive the feed-forward cycle of bone metastasis. We asked whether the hypoxia and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways have additive or synergistic effects to promote breast cancer bone metastasis to determine if combined treatment with inhibitors of these pathways could be used to treat bone metastases.</p><p>Bone is the largest storehouse of TGF-&#x003b2; in the body. TGF-&#x003b2; has complex effects in cancer and is a growth suppressor early in tumorigenesis; however, many advanced cancers escape from growth inhibition by TGF-&#x003b2; and express prometastatic genes in response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006896-Massague1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway is activated when TGF-&#x003b2; binds to the TGF-&#x003b2; type II receptor (T&#x003b2;RII) and promotes dimerization with and activation of the TGF-&#x003b2; type I receptor (T&#x003b2;RI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006896-Massague1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Of these, only vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CXCR4, showed additive responses to TGF-&#x003b2; and hypoxia, suggesting limited crosstalk between TGF-&#x003b2; and hypoxia signaling pathways in breast cancer cells. <italic>In vitro</italic> analyses, however, may not accurately represent <italic>in vivo</italic> function. Therefore, we used a mouse model of bone metastasis to assess global crosstalk between the hypoxia and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this model, the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line reliably forms osteolytic bone lesions in nude mice when inoculated into the left cardiac ventricle. We tested the effects TGF-&#x003b2; and hypoxia on bone metastases in this model by genetic and pharmacologic approaches. In the first approach, we used genetic methods of shRNA knockdown and dominant-negative expression to specifically target the tumor cells. Genetic inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly decreased osteolysis and enhanced survival of mice with bone metastases. Combined inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; in the tumor cells had no additional effect, suggesting parallel roles for hypoxia and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in tumor cells. This approach provided proof of principle for the tumor autonomous effects of HIF-1&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in bone metastases, but it is not readily translatable to the clinic. In a second pharmacologic approach, we inhibited HIF-1&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling systemically using small molecule inhibitors to target both the tumor cells and the bone microenvironment. Inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1; or TGF-&#x003b2; with these inhibitors also decreased osteolysis, reduced tumor burden, and enhanced survival of mice with bone metastases. In contrast to the genetic models, combined pharmacologic inhibition produced an additional decrease in tumor burden compared to either alone. Systemic inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling also had independent effects on bone to decrease osteoclast and increase osteoblast activity. Thus, combined systemic inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is more beneficial than either alone due to activity on the tumor cells and the bone microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Hypoxia induces HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in bone metastatic cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo at sites of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer bone metastases</title><p>Three bone metastatic cancer cell lines: MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, PC-3 prostate cancer, and 1205Lu melanoma cells, were tested for hypoxic responsiveness by culture in 20&#x00025; or 1&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub> for 6 h.

Because breast cancer cells secrete factors which stimulate osteoclast formation and bone resorption in osteolytic metastases, we analyzed osteoclast number at sites of bone metastases from 2ME2- and SD-208-treated mice. Significantly fewer osteoclasts per millimeter of tumor-bone interface were present in bone metastases from 2ME2- or SD-208-treated mice compared to control mice (<italic>P&#x0003c;</italic>0.01).

The bone microenvironment is also hypoxic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006896-Hirao1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Hypoxia activates signaling through HIF-1&#x003b1; which, like TGF-&#x003b2;, increases many of the factors that promote the feed-forward metastatic cycle. Although previous studies have shown that both HIF-1&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways are important in bone metastases, interactions between these factors have not been reported. The aim of these studies was to determine whether TGF&#x003b2; and hypoxia act synergistically or work redundantly to promote bone metastases.</p><p>We first investigated interactions between the pathways <italic>in vitro</italic> by analyzing changes in gene expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with TGF-&#x003b2; and 1&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub>. Of 16 candidate genes, only two were increased by TGF-&#x003b2; and hypoxia: VEGF and CXCR4. VEGF, but not CXCR4, mRNA was additively increased by combined treatment with TGF-&#x003b2; and 1&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub>, and promoter activation of the two factors was also additively increased by combined treatment.

The data here suggest that VEGF is regulated similarly by TGF-&#x003b2; and hypoxia in human MDA-MB-231 cells. An HRE located 1.3 kb from the transcription start site in the human CXCR4 promoter was found to mediate its response to hypoxia. Mutation of either of two putative SBEs did not significantly inhibit TGF-&#x003b2;-stimulated CXCR4 promoter activation. The results suggest that TGF-&#x003b2; regulates CXCR4 through other SBEs in the promoter that were not tested here.</p><p>MDA-MB-231 cells did not show significant additive responses to TGF-&#x003b2; and hypoxia for the other 14 genes examined, but other targets could be responsive. Therefore we used a comprehensive approach to genetically approach to inhibit the pathways in the tumor cells by expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; shRNA and a dominant-negative T&#x003b2;RII, which then were analyzed an <italic>in vivo</italic> bone metastasis model. This approach permits assessment of the tumor autonomous effects of hypoxia and TGF-&#x003b2;, separate from their roles in the metastatic microenvironment.

Knockdown of HIF-1&#x003b1; did not yield a corresponding decrease in tumor burden at time of death. Tumor burden in mice euthanized at the same time point could not be compared in this survival experiment as mice bearing shHIF bone metastases lived significantly longer than the control groups. It is possible that knockdown of HIF-1&#x003b1; decreases osteolytic lesion development without affecting the rate of tumor growth in bone. However, this is unlikely as previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of hypoxic signaling by a dominant-negative HIF-1&#x003b1; decreased osteolytic bone destruction and tumor burden in mice euthanized at the same time point, while a constitutively active HIF had the opposite effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006896-Hiraga1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.
