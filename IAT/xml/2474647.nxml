The interaction between TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1 is crucial for heterochromatin formation and maintenance. The HP1-box, PXVXL, of TIF1&#x003b2; is responsible for its interaction with HP1.

Phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 coincides with the induction of cell cycle gene <italic>cyclin A2 </italic>at the S-phase. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the promoter of <italic>cyclin A2 </italic>gene is occupied by TIF1&#x003b2; and that such occupancy is inversely correlated with Ser473 phosphorylation. Additionally, when HP1&#x003b2; was co-expressed with TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A, but not TIF1&#x003b2;/S473E, the colocalization of TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A and HP1&#x003b2; to the promoters of <italic>Cdc2 </italic>and <italic>Cdc25A </italic>was enhanced. Non-phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 allowed greater TIF1&#x003b2; association with the regulatory regions and the consequent repression of these genes. Consistent with possible inhibition of TIF1&#x003b2;'s corepressor function, the phosphorylation of the Ser473 residue, which is located near the HP1-interacting PXVXL motif, compromised the formation of TIF1&#x003b2;-HP1 complex.

The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family of proteins (HP1&#x003b1;, HP1&#x003b2;, and HP1&#x003b3;) participates in gene silencing by forming heterochromatic structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. HP1 exhibits distinct nuclear localization patterns: HP1&#x003b1; nassociates with centromeres while HP1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b3; are largely localized in distinct nuclear regions. The nuclear arrangement of HP1 proteins and TIF1&#x003b2; is differentiation pathway-specific, and appears to be more important than changes in the levels of these proteins, which are relatively stable during all of the induced differentiation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>HP1 proteins comprise an N-terminal chromodomain, a C-terminal chromoshadow domain and a hinge domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The chromodomain functions as a protein interaction domain, bringing together different proteins in multi-protein complexes and recruiting them to heterochromatin. This domain binds to particular proteins which contain an HP1 box (PXVXL) and function at the transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The chromoshadow domain mediates the formation of homodimer. TIF1&#x003b2; interacts with the chromodomain of dimeric HP1&#x003b2; via the HP1 box of TIF1&#x003b2; in the HP1-interaction domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The TIF1&#x003b2; ntranscriptional repression activity depends on the interaction between TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This interaction is essential in the relocation of TIF1&#x003b2; from euchromatin to heterochromatin that accompanies the differentiation of primitive endoderm-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. TIF1&#x003b2; is proposed to function as a universal co-repressor protein for the KRAB zinc finger protein (KRAB-zfp) superfamily of transcriptional repressors. The recruitment of HP1 proteins by the KRAB-TIF1&#x003b2; complex to specific loci within the genome via the formation of heterochromatin-like complexes may thus silence gene activity. Gene-specific repression may be a consequence of the formation of such complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>It has been reported that TIF1&#x003b2; directly interacts with the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, which methylates specifically histone H3/Lys9 within euchromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Depletion of endogenous levels of TIF1&#x003b2; by siRNA significantly inhibited the KRAB-mediated transcriptional repression of a chromatin template and inhibited cell cycle progression. Cell death may occur if TIF1&#x003b2; is severely depleted by siRNA knockdown [unpublished observations, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]]. Similarly, the knock-down of cellular levels of HP1 proteins and SETDB1 by siRNA attenuated KRAB-TIF1&#x003b2; repression. The physiological targets and functions of TIF1&#x003b2; remain unclear. Its interactions with chromatin modification factors such as HDAC1, SETDB1 and HP1 correlate with its activities in regulating the chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation, resulting in epigenetic silencing of reporter genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A TIF1&#x003b2;-containing multiprotein complex regulates various protein activities or genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The activity of TIF1&#x003b2; may be regulated by posttranslational modifications. For example, TIF1&#x003b2; is rapidly phosphorylated by members of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-like family of kinases following DNA damage. Phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2; colocalizes with numerous damage response factors at DNA lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Recent genetic and proteomic studies in mice have shown that TIF1&#x003b2; is a developmental regulatory protein performing cellular function(s) that are critical to early embryonic development, and is a component of the interactive protein network for the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The binding of the TIF1&#x003b2; corepressor to the retrovirus primer binding site is responsible for the epigenetic silencing of retrovirus transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the interaction between TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1 or other transcription factors may account for the regulation of gene expression.</p><p>Phosphorylation of both human and mouse TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 has been identified by nuclear phosphoprotein analysis of HeLa and WEHI-231 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Ser473 is located in the HP1-interacting domain of TIF1&#x003b2; &#x02013; close to the HP1 box (amino acids 486&#x02013;490, PXVXL). The conservation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 phosphorylation in various cell lines from different species motivated this investigation of the functional significance of this modification.</p><p>The coil-coiled domain of TIF1&#x003b2; binds to E2F1 and inhibits its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The induction of <italic>cyclin A</italic>, <italic>Cdc2 </italic>and <italic>Cdc25A </italic>genes depends on E2F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Cyclin A is a cell cycle-regulating protein that participates in S-phase control and mitosis in mammalian somatic cells. The promoter of <italic>cyclin A </italic>is repressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is activated at S-phase entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Cdc2 permits the transition from G1 through S in conjunction with cyclin E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These E2F downstream genes are important to normal cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>This report shows that TIF1&#x003b2; participates in the regulation of <italic>cyclin A2</italic>, <italic>Cdc2 </italic>and <italic>Cdc25A </italic>gene expression. This regulation depends on the interaction between TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b2;, which is itself regulated by the phosphorylation state of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473. The experimental results suggest that the TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473-unphosphorylated form binds more strongly than the phosphorylated form to the promoters of <italic>Cyclin A2</italic>, <italic>Cdc2</italic>, and <italic>Cdc25A </italic>genes. The phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 may serve as a molecular switch regulating its interaction with HP1&#x003b2; and gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of TIF1&#x003b2; and phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 antibodies</title><p>Western blotting of interphase HeLa cell extract was performed to characterize the specificity of monoclonal antibody to TIF1&#x003b2;, clone 20A1.

The phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 was identified in HeLa and WEHI cells at interphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Since Ser473 is located near the HP1-binding motif, an intriguing question arises: what is the functional consequence, if any, of the phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473? To elucidate the phosphorylation state of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 during cell cycle progression, Western blotting was performed with lysates from synchronized HeLa cells. Cells were synchronized to G1/S transition using double thymidine block. Phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 was almost undetectable at the G1/S boundary under the thymidine block (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, 0 hr, S473) but the phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 was maximal 1 hour post-release from the thymidine block, during early S phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, 1 hr, S473). The level of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 decreased thereafter for 2 hours during the mid to late S-phase cell cycle progression. The level of total TIF1&#x003b2; remained relatively constant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, 20A1). The elevated cyclin A and decreased cyclin B evidenced the G1/S to S cell cycle progression of thymidine release (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 is dynamically regulated during cell cycle progression</bold>.

The gradual increase in the level of cyclin A or decrease in the level of cyclin B demonstrated the specific cell cycle stage from G1 to S (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This dynamic, biphasic (S and M phases) appearance of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 suggests that TIF1&#x003b2; may be involved in regulating the cell cycle by the switching on and off of Ser473 phosphorylation.</p><p>Various cell cycle regulated proteins may exhibit changed activity when phosphorylation modulates their stability. The total protein level of TIF1&#x003b2; remained approximately constant while the level of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 fluctuated throughout the cell cycle. To further demonstrate this dynamic fluctuation of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 level, HeLa cells were immunostained using S473 antibody. The level of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 in the cells 2 hr after serum addition markedly exceeded that in the serum-starved cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, immunofluorescence staining, compare early S and G1, S473).

To elucidate the role of TIF1&#x003b2; in regulating gene expression, we examined whether its interaction with HP1&#x003b2; was affected by the phosphorylation of S473. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments were performed using 293T cells that were co-transfected with FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2; (TIF1&#x003b2;), FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A (S473A) or FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473E (S473E) and HA-HP1&#x003b2;. The interaction between FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A and HP1&#x003b2; was stronger than that between FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473E or FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). To demonstrate that the reduced phosphorylation level of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 was related to its stronger interaction with HP1&#x003b2;, a pull-down assay was performed using purified GST-HP1&#x003b2; from <italic>E. coli </italic>and FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;, FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A or FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473E from 293T cells. GST-HP1&#x003b2; interacted with non-phosphorylated-mimetic FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A 1.6 times more effectively than with phosphorylated-mimetic FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473E (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The similarity of the level of interaction between wild-type FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2; and GST-HP1&#x003b2; and that of FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A and GST-HP1&#x003b2; (1.39 vs. 1.63) may reflect a lower phosphorylation level of wild-type FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2; here. To verify that TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 phosphorylation compromises the interaction between TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b2;, M2 or HA antibody pull-down assays were conducted using <italic>in vitro </italic>translated HA-HP1&#x003b2; and FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;, FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A, or FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473E. The results of the M2 pull-down and the HA antibody pull-down assay indeed demonstrated that the interaction between HA-HP1&#x003b2; and FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A is much stronger than that between FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473E and FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).

TIF1&#x003b2;/phospho-Ser473 was almost undetectable in the G1 phase, and climbed thereafter to reach maximum level in early S phase. As <italic>Cyclin A2 </italic>is known to be expressed in early S phase but not in G1 phase, a reasonable question arises: Is the TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 phosphorylation correlated with <italic>cyclin A2</italic>'s expression? PCR primers encompassing the E2F site were used to detect DNA fragments corresponding to the promoter region of <italic>cyclin A2</italic>. A much higher level of TIF1&#x003b2; was associated with the <italic>cyclin A2 </italic>promoter at the G1/S boundary than in early S phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, upper panel).

Histone H3 K9diMe was associated with the silencing of gene expression. The ChIP results demonstrated that the level of H3K9diMe correlated strongly with that of TIF1&#x003b2;. However, histone H3K4diMe is known to associate with actively transcribed genes. Its association with the promoter region of <italic>cyclin A2 </italic>was inversely correlated with that of TIF1&#x003b2;.

TIF1&#x003b2;/phospho-Ser473 was also elevated 2 hours after serum was added (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

Among the inhibitors tested, only the PKC inhibitor (Ro-31-8820) exhibited significant inhibition, while the CK1 inhibitor had a moderate effect on the phosphorylation of Ser473 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). An inhibitory peptide (a substrate-mimetic fragment from aa 466&#x02013;478 of TIF1&#x003b2;) that contained TIF1&#x003b2;/S471A/S473A also blocked TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 phosphorylation (data not shown). Neither CaMK-II inhibitor nor staurosporine had any effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 is located close to the HP1 box, the PXVXL motif, which is responsible for the interaction between TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1, and its phosphorylation negatively affects this interaction. The dynamic phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 suggests that this event may regulate the functions of TIF1&#x003b2; in cell cycle progression. The central question then is: How may the phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 regulate TIF1&#x003b2;-mediated gene expression? We addressed this question by investigating the potential regulatory functions of TIF1&#x003b2; on key genes for cell cycle pregression and the effects of over-expressing phosphorylation-deficient or phosphomimetic mutants of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 on cell cycle progression. TIF1&#x003b2; is proposed to function as a universal corepressor protein for the KRAB zinc finger protein (KRAB-zfp) superfamily of transcriptional repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The recruitment of HP1 proteins by the KRAB-TIF1&#x003b2; complex to specific loci within the genome through the formation of heterochromatin-like complexes may silence gene activity.</p><sec><title>The phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/S473 compromises its interaction with HP1&#x003b2; in a manner that is related to cell cycle-regulated gene expression</title><p>The disruption of the interaction between HP1&#x003b2; and TIF1&#x003b2; by the phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) suggests that this phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 may be the means of regulation of TIF1&#x003b2;- and HP1&#x003b2;-mediated gene silencing. The results of ChIP experiments suggest that the majority of TIF1&#x003b2; associated with the promoters of <italic>cyclin A2 </italic>in G1 phase cells is likely to be unphosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473. This conclusion is supported by two lines of evidence: (1) very low levels of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 were observed in G1 cells, and (2) overexpressed FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A bound to the promoters of <italic>Cdc2 </italic>and <italic>Cdc25A </italic>better than FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473E. When cells were released into the S phase, the association of unphosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 with these promoters decreased, accompanying an increased level of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473. The dynamics of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 phosphorylation and TIF1&#x003b2;-binding to the <italic>cyclin A2 </italic>promoter (during the G1 to S phase progression) indicate that un-phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 is responsible for silencing the <italic>cyclin A2 </italic>gene in the G1 phase (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The observation that HP1&#x003b2; interacted strongly with un-phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 is consistent with the ChIP results concerning the over-expressed recombinant variants, where over-expressed FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A associated better with the promoter region of <italic>Cdc2 </italic>or <italic>Cdc25A </italic>than that did FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473E (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).</p><p>The treatment of cells with cyclin A2 siRNA led to an accumulation of cells in prophase and mitosis to a degree similar to that observed for cyclin B1, consistent with the requirement of cyclin A for G1/S and G2/M transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, the ChIP results (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) and the effects of over-expressed FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473A on cell cycle progression (accumulation of G2/M cells, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) are consistent with published results for the siRNA knockdown of Cyclin A2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>HP1&#x003b2; recruitment to E2F-binding element of <italic>Cdc2 </italic>and <italic>Cdc25A </italic>promoters was affected by the phosphorylation state of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473. The level of HP1&#x003b2; recruitment to <italic>Cdc2 </italic>or <italic>Cdc25A </italic>promoter was increased when wild-type FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2; or FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A were ectopically expressed. This association was compromised by the phosphomimetic mutant, S473E, which suggests that HP1&#x003b2; recruitment is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473. Likewise, ectopically expressed HP1&#x003b2; resulted in elevated recruitment of wild-type FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2; or FLAG-TIF1&#x003b2;/S473A. These observations provide a clue that the recruitment of TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b2; could work in a positive feedback manner.</p><p>The above results demonstrate that the dynamic interconversion between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 may be crucial in the regulation of gene expression during cell cycle progression. Despite extensive efforts to perform ChIP with rabbit anti-phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 antibody, no significant result was obtained. A likely explanation of this failure is that phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 is not associated with the promoter of <italic>cyclin A2 </italic>in the G1 phase or, alternatively, the epitope in the multiprotein complex is masked from antibody access.</p><p>The way in which TIF1&#x003b2; disassociates from the HP1-containing heterochromatin is unclear. However, the findings herein provide a molecular explanation, which involves PKC-mediated phosphorylation at TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/S473 level may serve as a proliferation marker</title><p>TIF1&#x003b2; transcriptional repression activity depends on the interaction between TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This interaction is essential to the relocation of TIF1&#x003b2; from euchromatin to heterochromatin that accompanies the differentiation of primitive endoderm-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. TIF1&#x003b2; is known to interact differentially with HP1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b3; in differentiated and non-differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In non-differentiated cells, TIF1&#x003b2;/HP1 interaction occurs only in euchromatin and selectively involves HP1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b3;, but not HP1&#x003b1;. In differentiated cells, on the other hand, TIF1&#x003b2; selectively associates with HP1&#x003b2; in heterochromatin, while TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b3; interaction occurs only in euchromatin. These conclusions agree with the reduced level of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 seen here in differentiated K562 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The results herein also revealed that un-phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 interacts more strongly with HP1&#x003b2; than its phosphorylated counterpart (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These results further suggest that the phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 regulates the differential interaction between TIF1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b2;.</p><p>What may be the functional consequences of the phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 and its consequent dissociation from HP1s must be addressed. TIF1&#x003b2; interacts with E2F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], TRIP-Br and CBP/p300, and potentiates the co-activation of E2F-1/DP-1 by TRIP-Br protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 may thus be involved in this tripartite functional interaction. This suggestion is supported by our findings that the induction of <italic>cyclin A2 </italic>is accompanied by an increased level of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 and reduced binding of TIF1&#x003b2; to the promoter. A most provocative question that remains to be answered is whether the Ser473-phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2; may interact preferentially with transcription factors and serve as a coactivator.</p><p>The results also demonstrated that the level of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 peaks at early S- and M-phases. Two phosphorylation sites other than Ser473, Ser752 and Ser757, were also identified in the course of this investigation. Both sites are located in the bromodomain of TIF1&#x003b2;. The phosphorylation-deficient or phosphomimetic mutants of Ser757 did not influence the phosphorylation of Ser473 (Chang, unpublished results), suggesting that these phosphorylations may be independent events during mitosis. Other phosphorylation sites important for regulating the function of TIF1&#x003b2; have also been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The functional consequences of Ser752 and Ser757 phosphorylation remain to be investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>PKC mediated TIF1&#x003b2;/S473 phosphorylation may be involved in cell cycle progression</title><p>Numerous examples have demonstrated that PKC&#x003b4; is centrally involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The activation of PKC&#x003b4; uniquely mediates insulin-induced proliferation: PKC&#x003b4; is activated by insulin and interacts with insulin receptor and IRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

During the differentiation of embryonic carcinoma cells, the intracellular distribution of TIF1&#x003b2; changes from diffuse nuclear staining to discrete foci and colocalizes with heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The steady-state level of TIF1&#x003b2; is also decreased. The reduced levels of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 as well as the lower steady-state TIF1&#x003b2; levels in differentiated cells suggest that TIF1&#x003b2; may be mainly localized to heterochromatin in differentiated cells. In embryonic stem cells, TIF1&#x003b2; is present in complexes with various pluripotent markers, including Rex-1, Dax-1 and Nanog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 seems to be preferentially associated with cell proliferation, it is important to determine whether it resides in these complexes. In fact, the level of phosphorylated TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 may serve as a proliferation marker. The epigenetic silencing of retrovirus transcription is caused by the binding of a TIF1&#x003b2; corepressor complex to retrovirus primer binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The likely recruitment of TIF1&#x003b2; by a DNA-binding KRAB-box containing zinc finger protein for PBS-mediated silencing should be addressed, and the question of whether the regulation of the phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 or the formation of TIF1&#x003b2; corepressor complex is participating in retrovirus transcription should also be investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although the TIF1&#x003b2; co-repressor function is known to be related to HP1&#x003b2;, few studies have addressed the specific gene targets of TIF1&#x003b2;.

The key cell cycle regulatory genes, <italic>Cyclin A2</italic>, <italic>Cdc2 </italic>and <italic>Cdc25A </italic>are targeted by TIF1&#x003b2;, and phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 is associated with the activation of these genes. TIF1&#x003b2;/S473 phosphorylation is up-regulated during the S phase in HeLa cells and the interaction between HP1&#x003b2; and TIF1&#x003b2; is compromised when Ser473 is phosphorylated. These observations suggest that the phosphorylation of TIF1&#x003b2;/Ser473 may regulate gene expression by abolishing its interaction with HP1&#x003b2;.

DNA content was analyzed from 10,000 cells collected with a BD Biosciences flow cytometer in conjunction with the CellQuest software. The distribution of cell populations in the cell cycle stage was gated with CellQuest analysis program (M1, subG1; M2, G1; M3, S; and M4, G2/M). The cell cycle phase distribution (in total for 100%) in each sample after CellQuest program analysis is shown. The percentage of the cell cycle phase shown in table is also presented with bar charts (by Microsoft Excel).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and Real-time PCR</title><p>The level of gene expression was determined by real-time PCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cells using Blue extract reagent (LTK, Inc., Taiwan) following the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Samples of 5 &#x003bc;g of total RNA were reverse transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and an oligo dT primer. The primers used for real-time PCR were for <italic>Cyclin A2</italic>:</p><p>Forward: 5'-GCATGTCACCGTTCCTCCTT-3';</p><p>Reverse: 5'-CAGGGCATCTTCACGCTCTAT-3';</p><p>and for <italic>Actin</italic>:</p><p>Forward: 5'-GAGAAAATCTGGCACCACACC-3';</p><p>Reverse: 5'-ATACCCCTCGTAGATGGGCAC-3'.</p><p>All reactions were carried out using a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and ABsolute&#x02122; QPCR SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Green Mix (ABgene, Epsom, England). The amplification was carried out as follow: initial enzyme activation at 94&#x000b0;C for 15 min, then 40 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 15 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min. A total of 50 ng of each diluted reverse transcription product was used for real-time PCR in a final volume of 25 &#x003bc;l containing 160 nM of each specific primer and 1&#x000d7; ABsolute&#x02122; QPCR SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Green Mix (ABgene). The relative level of <italic>Cyclin A2 </italic>gene expression was calculated according to the comparative Ct method using the 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;CTCT </sup>formula, using the expression of <italic>Actin </italic>as an endogenous control.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CWC performed most experiments and participated in the writing of the manuscript.
