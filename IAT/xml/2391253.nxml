Although the products of other <italic>mec</italic> genes are key players in the biophysics of transduction, the mechanism by which they contribute to the properties of the channel is unknown. Here, we investigate the role of two auxiliary channel subunits, MEC-2 (stomatin-like) and MEC-6 (paraoxonase-like), by coexpressing them with constitutively active MEC-4/MEC-10 heteromeric channels in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. This work extends prior work demonstrating that MEC-2 and MEC-6 synergistically increase macroscopic current. We use single-channel recordings and biochemistry to show that these auxiliary subunits alter function by increasing the number of channels in an active state rather than by dramatically affecting either single-channel properties or surface expression. We also use two-electrode voltage clamp and outside-out macropatch recording to examine the effects of divalent cations and proteases, known regulators of channel family members. Finally, we examine the role of cholesterol binding in the mechanism of MEC-2 action by measuring whole-cell and single-channel currents in MEC-2 mutants deficient in cholesterol binding. We suggest that MEC-2 and MEC-6 play essential roles in modulating both the local membrane environment of MEC-4/MEC-10 channels and the availability of such channels to be gated by force in vivo.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: DEG, degenerin; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; PHB, prohibitin homology; PON, paraoxonase; TRN, touch receptor neuron.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Sensing force is ubiquitous in cellular life, with uses ranging from protection from osmotic shock in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levina et al., 1999</xref>) to the appreciation of the softest touch on human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johansson and Vallbo, 1979</xref>). Among medically relevant modes of force transduction in humans are flow regulation in the kidney, blood pressure regulation in vasculature, hearing, proprioception in musculature, nociception, and cutaneous touch. Each of these processes is likely to involve many molecules that have proven difficult to identify, possibly due to their rarity. In contrast, genetic analysis of touch in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has proven fruitful for identifying the molecular components of mechanotransduction machinery, including four membrane proteins (MEC-2, MEC-4, MEC-6, and MEC-10). These proteins form amiloride-sensitive, Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-selective sensory mechanotransduction channels in the touch receptor neurons (TRNs) responsible for detecting low-intensity touches in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Hagan et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, these proteins also form amiloride-sensitive Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2002a</xref>).</p><p>MEC-4 and MEC-10 are pore-forming subunits that belong to the superfamily of degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) ion channel proteins that are conserved in metazoans. DEG/ENaC proteins are predicted to share a common topology consisting of two transmembrane helices, intracellular N and C termini, and a large extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kellenberger and Schild, 2002</xref>). Recent structural data confirm this topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>). MEC-2 and MEC-6 are auxiliary subunits required for channel function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Hagan et al., 2005</xref>). Replacing the wild-type alanine at the degenerin (<italic>d)</italic> position in MEC-4 (A713) or MEC-10 (A673) with residues larger than cysteine induces TRN degeneration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang and Chalfie, 1994</xref>) and increases channel open probability in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>d</italic> position is at the extracellular end of the second transmembrane domain and its side chain interacts with the first transmembrane domain of the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>). This structural observation is consistent with our finding that mutations at the <italic>d</italic> position in MEC-10 can both enhance and suppress gain-of-function mutations in MEC-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2007</xref>). Taking advantage of the increased open probability in mutants, we study gain-of-function mutants of both MEC-4 and MEC-10 with an alanine to threonine substitution at the <italic>d</italic> position. For clarity, we refer to these mutants as MEC-4d and MEC-10d and to heteromeric channels as MEC-4d/10d channels.</p><p>Defects in the genes encoding MEC-2 and MEC-6, which are coexpressed with MEC-4 and MEC-10 in TRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2002a</xref>), suppress degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalfie and Wolinsky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang and Chalfie, 1994</xref>), suggesting that these proteins might be critical for channel function. Consistent with this idea, MEC-2 and MEC-6 dramatically enhance macroscopic currents carried by heteromeric MEC-4d/10d channels in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes without increasing the expression of either protein in the plasma membrane. Together, MEC-2 and MEC-6 increase macroscopic current by more than 100-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2002a</xref>). It is not known how these auxiliary proteins achieve their remarkable effect without increasing surface expression. All available evidence suggests that the effects of MEC-2 and MEC-6 on current are similar in wild-type and degenerin mutant channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2002a</xref>). Under this assumption, we use mutant channels with increased open probability to facilitate measurement of the effects of auxiliary subunit coexpression.</p><p>Like some other prohibitin-homology (PHB) domain proteins (SMART database; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de</ext-link>), MEC-2 is associated with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and does not cross the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 1995</xref>). In its central PHB domain, MEC-2 is 65% identical to human stomatin and 62% identical to SLP-3. In mice, both stomatin and SLP-3 are expressed in the cell bodies and nerve terminals of dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mannsfeldt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wetzel et al., 2007</xref>). Loss of stomatin reduces the response of a single class of somatosensory neurons to mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martinez-Salgado et al., 2007</xref>). SLP-3 is required in several classes and also plays a critical role in texture discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wetzel et al., 2007</xref>). MEC-2 binds the N-terminal domain of MEC-4 through its central PHB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2004a</xref>). MEC-2 is palmitoylated and binds cholesterol directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huber et al., 2006</xref>). The double-cysteine mutant MEC-2 (C140/174A) is no longer palmitoylated and has reduced cholesterol-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huber et al., 2006</xref>). MEC-2(P134S), which recapitulates the <italic>u274</italic> allele of the <italic>mec-2</italic> gene, fails to bind cholesterol in vitro, but localizes to the plasma membrane in HEK293T cells and binds to DEG/ENaC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huber et al., 2006</xref>). Considered together with the finding that <italic>mec-2(u274)</italic> animals are touch insensitive, these data suggest that cholesterol binding is required for normal MEC-2 activity. Both palmitoylation and cholesterol binding are likely to fine tune the association between MEC-2, the pore-forming subunits MEC-4 and MEC-10, and the plasma membrane and may recruit specialized lipid microdomains to the vicinity of the MEC-4 channel. MEC-2 is not the only PHB protein likely involved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch sensation. UNC-24 is coexpressed with MEC-2 in the TRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2004a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">b</xref>) and several PHB proteins, including UNC-24, appear to associate with cholesterol-rich, detergent-resistant membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sedensky et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>With a short cytoplasmic N terminus and a single transmembrane domain, the majority of the MEC-6 protein is extracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>). In its extracellular domain, MEC-6 is homologous to human paraoxonase (PON1), an enzyme that hydrolyzes organophosphates and has a role in preventing heart disease through its association with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Draganov et al., 2000</xref>). By structural and functional criteria, several residues in PON1 are believed to be important for enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yeung et al., 2005</xref>). Only one of these residues is conserved in MEC-6, N143, suggesting that MEC-6 lacks enzymatic activity. Association between PON1 and HDL particles is believed to involve two amphipathic helices, one of which is proposed to extend hydrophobic aromatic residues into the lipid interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harel et al., 2004</xref>). This domain, including a series of aromatic residues arranged along one side of the helix, is conserved in MEC-6 (unpublished data) and may facilitate association between MEC-6 and the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Wild-type MEC-6 is required for proper localization of the channel complex in vivo but not in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, MEC-6 has at least two roles, only one of which is recapitulated in heterologous cells.</p><p>Among known regulators of ENaC activity are various serine proteases. There is a growing body of evidence that proteases can modify ENaC activity in diverse ways (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Planes and Caughey, 2007</xref>). For example, furin seems to be involved in post-translational processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughey et al., 2004</xref>), membrane-bound channel-activating proteases (CAPs) regulate the channel after insertion into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vallet et al., 2002</xref>), and soluble proteases such as trypsin activate channels dwelling in a near-silent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caldwell et al., 2004</xref>), though it has been suggested that this activation may be indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bengrine et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use mutations at the <italic>d</italic> position to render channels constitutively active in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and use single-channel, macropatch, and whole-cell recording to investigate the mechanism by which the auxiliary subunits MEC-2 and MEC-6 enhance channel activity. We explore the roles of MEC-2 and MEC-6 in block by divalent ions, sensitivity to proteases, single-channel properties, and surface expression. Finally, we demonstrate that MEC-2 and MEC-6 have a role in promoting an active state of the channel and show that this activity is lost in MEC-2 mutants deficient in cholesterol binding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Molecular Biology</title><p>Constructs encoding full-length MEC-4d and MEC-10d as well as myc-tagged MEC-4d were propagated in SMC4 bacteria (American Type Culture Collection accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="PTA-4084">PTA-4084</ext-link>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2007</xref>).

Analogue signals were filtered at 200 Hz (8-pole Bessel filter) and sampled at 1 kHz. A 60-Hz notch filter was used to minimize line noise. Oocytes were superfused with control saline containing (in mM) Na-gluconate (100), KCl (2), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1), and Na-HEPES (10), adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH.

Single-channel conductance and open probability were calculated from all-points histograms derived from leak-subtracted records that were 4.7 min long on average.

Surface proteins were labeled by incubating oocytes in OR-2 medium containing membrane-impermeant reagent EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce Chemical Co., 16 mg/ml) for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 ml of 500 mM glycine, pH 7.5 (1 min), and washed in 500 mM glycine (three times) and fresh OR-2 (three times).

It is not known whether proteases can also activate MEC-4/10 channels. We investigated this by applying chymotrypsin, a serine protease known to activate ENaCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chraibi et al., 1998</xref>), to MEC-4d/10d channels expressed in oocytes. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, chymotrypsin application increases amiloride-sensitive currents in whole oocytes. The slight shift of reversal potential toward zero is likely due to sodium loading of the cell, and is observed on similar timescales when no protease is applied (unpublished data). Chymotrypsin increased current by approximately twofold in the presence and absence of MEC-2 and MEC-6, indicating that neither auxiliary protein affects sensitivity to proteases. These data indicate that the mechanisms by which protease and MEC-2/MEC-6 increase current are distinct.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Activation by extracellular chymotrypsin.

We considered two possible explanations. First, auxiliary proteins could increase the total number of channels at the oocyte membrane. Prior work showing that neither MEC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2002a</xref>) nor MEC-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>) increases surface expression makes this explanation unlikely, however. Nonetheless, it is formally possible that surface expression increases when both MEC-2 and MEC-6 are present. We tested this idea by comparing the amount of myc-tagged MEC-4d expressed in the plasma membrane in the presence and absence of both MEC-2 and MEC-6. We found that addition of MEC-2 and MEC-6 did not produce a detectable change in the amount of myc-tagged MEC-4d protein in the plasma membrane (Fig. S2).</p><p>Second, the auxiliary proteins could act by increasing the fraction of active membrane-inserted channels. That is, in the absence of these subunits, active channels are rare, but exhibit properties similar to those bound to MEC-2 and MEC-6. To demonstrate this directly, we injected varying amounts of cRNA encoding MEC-2 along with constant amounts of cRNA encoding MEC-4d/10d and MEC-6. We measured current and surface protein levels in parallel and found that while surface protein level does not change detectably, current increases with the amount of MEC-2 cRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Since MEC-2 cannot form channels by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2002a</xref>), has a modest effect on single-channel conductance, and has no effect on steady-state open probability, this finding demonstrates that increasing the amount of MEC-2 enhances current by increasing the fraction of membrane-inserted MEC-4d protein that carries current.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Surface expression and current amplitude as a function of MEC-2 cRNA.

Specifically, we tested which aspects of MEC-2 function were required for its current-enhancing effect. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, we targeted three residues involved in cholesterol binding: P134, C140, and C174. Replacing the wild-type cysteine with alanine at amino acids 140 and 174 eliminates palmitoylation and reduces cholesterol binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huber et al., 2006</xref>).

We found that coinjection of the palmitoylation mutant MEC-2(C140/174A) produces currents larger than those in the absence of MEC-2, but smaller than those recorded with wild-type MEC-2. Coinjection of MEC-2(P134S) produces none of the current enhancement provided by wild-type MEC-2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>); amiloride-sensitive currents were indistinguishable from those recorded in the absence of MEC-2. Currents produced by the triple mutant MEC-2(P134S, C140/174A) were indistinguishable from those produced by single mutant MEC-2(P134S) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Characterization of cholesterol-binding mutants of MEC-2.

In six patches excised from oocytes expressing MEC-4d/10d &#x0002b; MEC-2(P134S, C140/174A) &#x0002b; MEC-6, the single channel conductance was similar to that of channels lacking MEC-2, and significantly different from channels with wild-type MEC-2 (P &#x0003c; 0.01). These data emphasize the importance of cholesterol binding for the modification of channel biophysics by MEC-2.</p><p>The inability of MEC-2 isoforms containing the P134S mutation to enhance macroscopic current cannot be explained by a lack of protein, since mutant MEC-2 isoforms were readily detected in whole-cell lysates. (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huber et al., 2006</xref>), wild-type MEC-2 appeared as a doublet near the predicted molecular weight. The P134S mutation altered the relative intensity of the two bands. Though the molecular basis for this observation is unclear, one appealing possibility is that cholesterol-modified MEC-2 is the dominant isoform and, like cholesterol-bound Hedgehog protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Porter et al., 1996</xref>), migrates more quickly than the isoform lacking cholesterol.</p><p>These findings suggest that cholesterol binding enhances channel activity and imply that depleting membrane cholesterol should decrease current. To test this, we treated oocytes expressing MEC-4d&#x0002b; MEC-2 with a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor (pravastatin) and a cholesterol chelator (methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin). This dual treatment was designed to mitigate differences in membrane cholesterol between animals as well to deplete membrane cholesterol. In cells harvested from one animal (out of six), this treatment significantly decreased (P &#x0003c; 0.005) amiloride-sensitive current compared with untreated control cells harvested from the same animal: 24.6 &#x000b1; 2.5 &#x003bc;A (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 17) vs. 41.3 &#x000b1; 4.7 &#x003bc;A (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14). These results, while suggestive, are inconclusive and suggest that sensitivity to this treatment depends on an unknown factor that varies between animals.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>What Defines an Active MEC-4 Channel Complex?</title><p>Here we present data showing that MEC-2 and MEC-6 govern transitions between an unavailable or silent state and one in which MEC-4d/10d channels are available to be activated. Based on these data, we propose that the MEC-2 and MEC-6 auxiliary subunits are permissive regulators of MEC-4 sensory mechanotransduction channels both in heterologous cells and in vivo. Consistent with this model, MEC-2 is required for force-dependent gating in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Hagan et al., 2005</xref>). The in vivo role of MEC-6 is more complex, since it is also required for channel localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>This study also demonstrates the existence of multiple closed and open states in constitutively active channels. How these states might be involved in the regulation and activity of the channel is not yet clear, but the analysis does reveal a complexity of gating. Except for a MEC-2&#x02013;dependent 30% increase in &#x003b3;, MEC-4d/10d channel behavior is qualitatively and quantitatively similar in the absence or presence of MEC-2, MEC-6, or both MEC-2 and MEC-6.</p></sec><sec><title>Divalents and the MEC-4 Sensory Transduction Channel</title><p>We have shown that the divalent ions Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block channels formed by the MEC-4 complex in a voltage-dependent manner. A voltage-dependent block of similar affinity has been reported in certain mutant versions of ENaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schild et al., 1997</xref>) and in the related acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Waldmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Weille and Bassilana, 2001</xref>).</p><p>One interesting consequence of block by divalent ions is that a significant fraction of current in whole-cell recordings has likely been blocked by divalents in control recording solutions. Also, due to the difference in divalent affinity between channels with and without MEC-2 and MEC-6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), a larger fraction of current would be blocked in cells lacking MEC-2 and MEC-6. This would have led to an underestimate of current in these cells and accounts for some fraction of the increase in macroscopic current ascribed to MEC-2 and MEC-6. If this difference in affinity for block by divalent ions was the only effect of MEC-2 and MEC-6, coexpression of the auxiliary subunits would increase current by 50%. As this maneuver increases current by &#x0223c;100-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>), a difference in divalent block only accounts for a small fraction of the effect of auxiliary subunits.</p></sec><sec><title>The Role of MEC-10 in the Complex</title><p>Several lines of evidence point to MEC-10 as an inhibitory unit of the sensory transduction channel. First, MEC-10&#x02013;induced neurodegeneration is a weaker phenotype that can be suppressed by many alleles of other <italic>mec</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang and Chalfie, 1994</xref>). Second, while MEC-10 is not required for MEC-4 channel activity in oocytes, coexpressing MEC-10 decreases macroscopic current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2002a</xref>). However, the effect of MEC-10 on single-channel properties seems to be small or nonexistent. Comparing our present results for channels composed of MEC-4d/10d and MEC-2 to values previously reported for channels composed only of MEC-4d and MEC-2, we find &#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> (38.3 pS vs. 38.0 pS) and <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> (0.79 vs. 0.86) to be very similar. Taken together, these results indicate that MEC-10 may regulate the MEC-4 channel complex activity by a similar mechanism to that proposed for MEC-2 and MEC-6, that is, by controlling the number of channels accessible for activation. However, the synergistic current enhancement given by MEC-2 and MEC-6 is largely independent of the presence of MEC-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that these effects work in parallel.</p></sec><sec><title>The Interaction between MEC-2 and the Channel Pore</title><p>MEC-2, which cannot form channels on its own and is associated only with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, modifies the MEC-4 channel pore. Two lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, MEC-2 decreases the affinity of the MEC-4 channel for two open channel blockers: amiloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>) and divalent ions (this study). Second, MEC-2 significantly increases single-channel conductance. These effects could reflect a long-range conformational change in the channel pore produced by MEC-2, cholesterol binding, or both. Alternatively, they could indicate that MEC-2 directly modifies the inner vestibule of the channel. Additional studies will be required to distinguish among these possibilities. One region of MEC-2 that could affect the inner vestibule and account for the ability of MEC-2 to increase single channel conductance is a stretch of negatively charged amino acids (297&#x02013;314) that could potentially concentrate Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions near the pore. In support of this idea, three glutamate residues (E297, E299, and E314) are mutated to lysine in three <italic>mec-2</italic> alleles (<italic>u318</italic>, <italic>e1514</italic>, and <italic>u217</italic>, respectively) that disrupt touch insensitivity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2004a</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Could Accessory Proteins Regulate Membrane Environment?</title><p>Membrane environment is intimately tied to channel function, with particular regard to proteins that sense force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anishkin and Kung, 2005</xref>). This is most obvious in channels that can be activated by membrane stretch alone, such as MscL and MscS, but could be equally important in the activation of channels by force delivered through other modalities. Several recent models propose methods to couple membrane properties such as curvature, thickness, and fluidity to force activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Markin and Sachs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moe and Blount, 2005</xref>). The cocrystallization of head groups of detergent molecules in the recent ASIC1 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>) provides evidence that hydrophobic molecules, including lipids, may also bind channels directly.</p><p>An appealing possibility is raised by the cholesterol and fatty acid binding properties of MEC-2 and the importance of these properties for function. MEC-2 can easily be conceived as having a strong role in regulating the membrane environment of the channel, either by localizing the complex to regions of high cholesterol or by directly recruiting cholesterol to the area of the membrane surrounding the channel. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that MEC-2 oligomerizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huber et al., 2006</xref>) and our finding that MEC-2 enhances channel activity in a dose-dependent manner. MEC-2 may alter membrane environment as a function of the quantity of protein present by increasing cholesterol concentration proportionately. This could be a consequence of cholesterol's putative role in local thickening and stiffening of the bilayer and shifting the lateral pressure profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cantor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gandhavadi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niemela et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The membrane environment is potentially a unifying mechanism for the roles of MEC-2 and MEC-6. While nothing is known about the affinity of MEC-6 for cholesterol or other membrane components, paraoxonases are known to be associated with HDL particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Draganov et al., 2000</xref>) and PON1 has one nontransmembrane helix proposed to mediate lipid interaction via aromatic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harel et al., 2004</xref>). This helix is likely present in MEC-6, and several of the highlighted aromatic amino acids are conserved; we propose that this helix may enhance lipid association in MEC-6 as well. While it remains highly speculative, the modes of action and synergism of MEC-2 and MEC-6 could be explained if each regulates the membrane environment on its respective leaflet of the bilayer, MEC-2 on the intracellular and MEC-6 on the extracellular side. Thus, the membrane environment is likely to be a critical parameter of channel activity and, possibly, of force-dependent gating in vivo<italic>.</italic></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200709910_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200709910_1.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_131_6_jgp.200709910__JGP_200709910_FS1.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_131_6_jgp.200709910__JGP_200709910_FS1-01.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200709910_2.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_131_6_jgp.200709910__JGP_200709910_FS2.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_131_6_jgp.200709910__JGP_200709910_FS2-01.jpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank G.
