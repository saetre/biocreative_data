Analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have revealed high human <italic>CYYR1 </italic>expression in cells belonging to the diffuse neuroendocrine system (DNES). These cells may be the origin of neuroendocrine (NE) tumors. The aim of this study was to conduct an initial analysis of sequence, splicing and expression of the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA in human NE tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA coding sequence (CDS) was studied in 32 NE tumors by RT-PCR and sequence analysis. A subtle alternative splicing was identified generating two isoforms of <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA differing in terms of the absence (CAG<sup>- </sup>isoform, the first described mRNA for <italic>CYYR1 </italic>locus) or the presence (CAG<sup>+ </sup>isoform) of a CAG codon. When present, this specific codon determines the presence of an alanine residue, at the exon 3/exon 4 junction of the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA. The two mRNA isoform amounts were determined by quantitative relative RT-PCR in 29 NE tumors, 2 non-neuroendocrine tumors and 10 normal tissues. A bioinformatic analysis was performed to search for the existence of the two <italic>CYYR1 </italic>isoforms in other species.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <italic>CYYR1 </italic>CDS did not show differences compared to the reference sequence in any of the samples, with the exception of an NE tumor arising in the neck region. Sequence analysis of this tumor identified a change in the CDS 333 position (T instead of C), leading to the amino acid mutation P111S. NE tumor samples showed no significant difference in either <italic>CYYR1 </italic>CAG<sup>- </sup>or CAG<sup>+ </sup>isoform expression compared to control tissues. <italic>CYYR1 </italic>CAG<sup>- </sup>isoform was significantly more expressed than CAG<sup>+ </sup>isoform in NE tumors as well as in control samples investigated. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that only the genomic sequence of <italic>Pan troglodytes CYYR1 </italic>is consistent with the possible existence of the two described mRNA isoforms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A new "subtle" splicing isoform (CAG<sup>+</sup>) of <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA, the sequence and the expression of this gene were defined in a large series of NE tumors.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The cysteine/tyrosine-rich 1 gene (<italic>CYYR1</italic>) is a large gene of 107 kb that we have previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] on human chromosome 21 (21q21.2). <italic>CYYR1 </italic>is composed of 4 small exons separated by three large introns and it encodes a small 154-amino acid polypeptide conserved in vertebrates. The most prominent feature of the protein family is the presence of a central cysteine- and tyrosine-rich domain, highly conserved from fish to humans and including a CCSYYAY box. There is also a proline-rich region, localized at carboxy-terminus, consisting of three repeated PPPY motifs. A putative transmembrane domain was identified in all proteins of the family by different prediction methods, along with a signal peptide suggesting the possible location of the CYYR1 protein in the cell or cell compartment membrane. <italic>CYYR1 </italic>product has no similarity to any known protein and its function is unknown.</p><p>Two different <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA species were identified using Northern blot analysis: they were consistent with two isoforms arising from alternative polyadenylation. The expression pattern of the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>human gene appears to be broad, as <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA was detected in all 12 human tissues tested, except peripheral blood leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Valuable data about the function of the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>gene were added by human expressed sequence tag (EST) database analysis. This was possible because the main source of tissues and cells used in the construction of libraries, from which most of the <italic>CYYR1</italic>-related ESTs were retrieved, included carcinoid tumor of the lung, melanocytes, parathyroid tumor cells, fetal adrenal tissue, follicular carcinoma of the thyroid, pineal gland and gastrointestinal tissue. A common feature of all these tissues is that they are composed of or include cell types belonging to the dispersed neuroendocrine system (DNES). The term "neuroendocrine" has been used to define cells such as neurons and endocrine cells that secrete their products in a regulated manner in response to a specific stimulus, and share a common phenotypic program, characterized by the expression of specific markers such as neuropeptides and chromogranins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These cell types are typical of vertebrates and the EST expression data are consistent with the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>phylogenetic analysis.</p><p>It is assumed that NE tumors can originate from normal NE cells. NE tumors are divided, according to the WHO (World Health Organization) classification, into well-differentiated tumors or carcinomas, poorly differentiated carcinomas and mixed endocrine-exocrine carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], according to their histological and cytological features.</p><p>The aim of this study was to analyze the sequence, splicing and expression of the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>gene in human neuroendocrine tumors. First, the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA coding sequence (CDS) was studied in a large series of NE tumors and a P111S mutation in the only neck-derived tumor was identified. Sequence analysis also allowed us to identify a "subtle" splicing isoform due to the existence of two functional acceptor splicing sites in the sequence CAGCAG at the 3' end of intron 3. Both isoforms, which encode two polypeptides &#x02013; differing in terms of the absence or presence of one amino acid &#x02013; were found in normal and neoplastic tissues. Their relative expression was investigated by a quantitative relative RT-PCR (reverse transcription &#x02013; polymerase chain reaction) method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sample collection</title><p>Sample selection was focused on neuroendocrine tumors from multiple anatomic sites (mostly from the digestive system) with varying differentiation grades (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Tumors were classified according to the WHO classification of endocrine tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The specimens were obtained from 16 males and 11 females ranging between 43 and 79 years of age (mean age of 63.6 years). We used representative portions of 32 tumor specimens (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) labelled NE 1 to NE 32 (15 samples: well differentiated endocrine carcinomas, WDEC; 13 samples: poorly differentiated endocrine carcinomas, PDEC; 4 samples: mixed exocrine-endocrine tumors, MEET). Samples were collected for the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute (Tampa, FL) Tissue Procurement Facility, under institutional review board protocols. The resection-to-preservation (freezing) time was kept to less than twenty minutes. Sample storage consisted of liquid nitrogen (n = 30) and -80&#x000b0;C (n = 2) for a mean storage period of 41.65 months. Prior to RNA isolation, twelve of these tumor samples underwent independent pathological review by a single pathologist (DC) and were macrodissected while frozen to select tumor-rich areas and decrease the amount of stroma and non-neoplastic elements surrounding the target tumor tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA sources</title><p>Total RNA from the NE samples was extracted using the TRIzol (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Due to the absence of tissues entirely composed of DNES cells, which are by definition part of a diffuse system of cells, a set of 8 commercial total RNA samples from several whole normal human organs was used as control: prostate (pool of 16 normal adult whole prostates), brain (one normal adult whole brain), heart (one normal adult whole heart), colon (pool of 2 normal adult colons), small intestine (pool of 2 normal adult small intestines), stomach (pool of 15 normal adult stomachs), thymus (pool of 13 normal adult thymuses) and skeletal muscle (pool of 2 normal adult skeletal muscles). All RNA samples were purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA).</p><p>In order to compare the RNA expression of some NE tumor samples (metastatic liver, pancreas and breast tumors) with non-neuroendocrine tumors and corresponding normal tissues, commercial total RNAs from 2 non-neuroendocrine tumors (pancreas and breast tumors) and from the 2 corresponding normal tissues were used in a second experiment. The non- neuroendocrine tumor total RNAs were obtained from a pancreas acinar cell carcinoma (T2N0M0, stage 1B) and from a breast invasive ductal carcinoma (T4N1M0, stage 3B), and were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX, USA). The 2 normal total RNAs were from a pancreas (normal human pancreas pooled from a 35-year-old Caucasian male) and a breast (normal adult mammary gland pooled from a 27-year-old Caucasian female), and were purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech.</p><p>RNA was quantified using both UV spectrophotometry and standard agarose gel. Quantification of electrophoresed RNA was obtained by comparison with standard markers using the gel imaging system Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Primer design</title><p>The primers for amplifications were designed using the Amplify software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], following standard criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

The size of the expected PCR product was 605 bp.</p><p>For the quantitative relative <italic>CYYR1 </italic>CAG<sup>-</sup>/CAG<sup>+ </sup>analysis, we designed three primers: a forward primer common to both mRNA forms (#3 5'-GTCTTGCTTCCGAAGTTGGTCCTGC-3'), based on exon 1, and two specific reverse primers for CAG<sup>- </sup>and CAG<sup>+ </sup>forms, respectively. Each reverse oligonucleotide was based on the exon 3/exon 4 boundary, and was specific for only one of the two isoforms, containing two mismatches at the last three bases of the 3' end, one being the 3'-residue compared to the sequence of the other isoform (#4 5'-GTGACCGTAGGGTGGTGGTCCAGG-3' for <italic>CYYR1 </italic>CAG<sup>- </sup>form, primer #5 5'-GTGACCGTAGGGTGGTGGTCCTGC-3' for <italic>CYYR1 </italic>CAG<sup>+ </sup>form). The expected size of PCR product was 321 bp with primers #3 and #4, and 324 bp with primers #3 and #5.</p><p>To amplify the beta-2 microglobulin (<italic>B2M</italic>) housekeeping gene for RNA quantity normalization in quantitative relative RT-PCR analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], we used forward primer #6 5'-GCGGGCATTCCTGAAGCTGACAGCA-3' and reverse primer #7 5'-TACATCAAACATGGAGACAGCACTC-3', with an expected PCR product size of 586 bp.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>For all samples, total RNA (2 &#x003bc;g) was reverse transcribed at 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min in 50 &#x003bc;L of final volume using cloned Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse-transcriptase 400 U (Promega, Madison, WI; used with companion buffer), 2.5 &#x003bc;M oligo dT-15, 2 &#x003bc;M random hexamers and 500 &#x003bc;M of each dNTP (deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate).</p><p>PCR experiments to obtain amplicons for sequence analysis were performed in 50 &#x003bc;L final volume, containing 5 &#x003bc;L reverse transcription mix, 1 U Taq Polymerase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) with companion reagents (0.2 mM of each dNTP, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1&#x000d7; PCR buffer), and 0.3 &#x003bc;M of each primer. An initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94&#x000b0;C was followed by amplification for 40 cycles, (30 sec at 94&#x000b0;C, 30 sec at 63&#x000b0;C, 45 sec at 72&#x000b0;C) and final extension for 7 min at 72&#x000b0;C.</p><p>PCR experiments for quantitative relative analysis were performed in 30 &#x003bc;L of final volume, containing 3 &#x003bc;L of reverse transcription mix, 0.6 U of Taq Polymerase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) with companion reagents (0.2 mM of each dNTP, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1&#x000d7; PCR buffer), and 0.2 &#x003bc;M of each primer.</p><p>To standardize all PCR reactions for quantitative relative analysis, we prepared a single mix with PCR buffer 1&#x000d7;, dNTPs, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and Taq Polymerase. Subsequently, this mix was dispensed into three aliquots and a different primer pair was added to each one. The cDNA samples were added after each mix has been divided into individual tubes. Each PCR reaction was performed in duplicate. In preliminary PCR experiments, we evaluated PCR products after 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 cycles (data not shown), in order to find the conditions allowing the quantification of <italic>B2M</italic>, <italic>CYYR1 </italic>CAG<sup>- </sup>and <italic>CYYR1 </italic>CAG<sup>+ </sup>RT-PCR products, respectively, at the maximum distance from the cycle corresponding to the reaction plateau. PCR reactions were performed with high stringency: an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94&#x000b0;C was followed by amplification for 25 (<italic>B2M</italic>) or 35 (<italic>CYYR1 </italic>CAG<sup>- </sup>or CAG<sup>+</sup>) cycles (30 sec at 94&#x000b0;C, 30 sec at 63&#x000b0;C, 45 sec at 72&#x000b0;C), and a final extension for 7 min at 72&#x000b0;C.</p><p>In a first experiment, 32 NE tumor samples were studied along with the standard set of 8 normal tissues (see the paragraph <italic>RNA sources </italic>above).

Alignment underlines that the encoded amino acids corresponding to the CAG<sup>-</sup>/CAG<sup>+ </sup>exon junction in the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA are well conserved from amphibians to bovines. Two amino acids conserved in all analyzed species (YP) are always followed by a couple of amino acids, one of which is always alanine (A): the same amino acid encoded by the rarer human mRNA isoform CAG<sup>+</sup>. In fish, a conserved block is found downstream of the CAG<sup>-</sup>/CAG<sup>+ </sup>exon junction.</p><p>No sequence with NE 16 mutation was found in the analyzed databases.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Neuroendocrine cells in the organism are part of a diffuse system of cells with neuroendocrine features characterized by ultrastructural features (presence of dense core granules of 100&#x02013;400 nm diameter) and immunohistochemical phenotypes (pan-neuroendocrine markers and specific hormonal products) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We first described <italic>CYYR1 </italic>gene as a novel locus on human chromosome 21, encoding a product with no similarity to any known protein. Based on the observation that the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>gene appears to be expressed, as evaluated by EST database analysis, in several types of neuroendocrine cells, we decided to investigate <italic>CYYR1 </italic>sequence and expression in a large series of human NE tumors. We also wanted to obtain new data about the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>gene, which has never been studied in-depth and whose product function is, at the moment, unknown.</p><p>Sequence analysis of the 32 NE samples tested showed a CDS sequence identical to that previously described in normal subjects, except for a case in which we identified a point mutation. The mutation is a C-T transition, apparently in heterozygotic state, leading to a P111S change predicted in the encoded product. This change is not present in any human sequence obtained from either finished sequence or EST databases. The replaced proline amino acid is situated one position before the first PPPY motif, which is present in three copies in the carboxy-terminus of the CYYR1 protein. This motif is known to be present in some viral proteins, where it is required for virus budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and it is also described in proteins involved in interactions between cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Due to the general relevance of proline for protein structure, and to its proximity to a functional motif, it may be speculated that this change could affect the CYYR1 function. Interestingly, the only NE mutated sample among those analyzed is a tumor arising in the neck region, a less common site of origin of neuroendocrine tumors.</p><p>In addition, a known SNP has been found in some samples: a C-T change at the third position of codon 67.</p><p>Sequence analysis was also useful to show an unexpected "subtle" splicing isoform of <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA, derived from the alternative use of an AG acceptor splice site located at the 3' end of <italic>CYYR1 </italic>intron 3, leading to the generation of mRNA isoforms which differentiate by only three bases. This new isoform encodes a predicted product with an adjunctive alanine (A) amino acid at position 112, located just before the glycine (G) preceding the first PPPY motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Due to its position, it is likely that this adjunctive amino acid could affect CYYR1 function, allowing the presence of two protein products whose relative expression is regulated by alternative splicing. Alternative splicing leading to mRNA isoforms encoding slightly different polypeptides had been reported only anecdotally until a recent systematic survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This work has demonstrated the relative frequency of this phenomenon in several vertebrate genomes, underlining its biological relevance as a means to increase functional complexity generated by the same locus sequence.</p><p>Systematic analysis by RT-PCR proved that both isoforms are expressed in all 29 NE and 8 normal tissue samples investigated, with the constant prevalence of the CAG<sup>- </sup>isoform, as also confirmed by human EST database analysis. We also accurately quantify the relative expression of the two forms, using an approach whose reliability we have previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We found that the most commonly expressed isoform is the CAG<sup>- </sup>isoform, the first described mRNA for <italic>CYYR1 </italic>locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The ratio between the expression of the two isoforms shows a greater variability with respect to a comparable gene such as the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (<italic>IGF1R</italic>). We previously found that <italic>IGF1R </italic>undergoes a "subtle" splicing with a tight regulation in both normal and neoplastic cells, leading to a constant 3:1 ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, when organs similar to those in which tumors arose were used as controls, statistical analysis failed to identify a significant difference in the <italic>CYYR1 </italic>CAG<sup>-</sup>/CAG<sup>+ </sup>ratio, as well as in the normalized CAG<sup>+ </sup>or CAG<sup>- </sup>mRNA level, between NE and normal samples. The EST database seems to support, for several tissues, a high expression of <italic>CYYR1 </italic>in some neuroendocrine tumors. For example, among the 19 <italic>CYYR1</italic>-related ESTs with "lung" origin, 12 are derived from lung carcinoid, and among the 12 ESTs with "pancreas" origin, 11 are derived from insulinoma. However, 10 of the lung carcinoid ESTs derive from the same library, as well as all the insulinoma ESTs. In general, EST database may provide indications about gene expression profile, but data are of limited statistical value.</p><p>To investigate the biological relevance of the "subtle" splicing of <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of all available sequence databases. <italic>CYYR1 </italic>locus "subtle" splicing has actually been observed only in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, while in <italic>Pan troglodytes </italic>the genomic sequence is consistent with its existence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have described a new "subtle" splicing isoform for <italic>CYYR1 </italic>locus and alterations of sequence and expression of this gene in a large series of NE tumors. The <italic>CYYR1 </italic>mRNA isoform expression level was comparable in tumor samples and normal tissues, and a missense mutation was identified in one tumor sample. The <italic>CYYR1 </italic>CAG<sup>- </sup>isoform was significantly more expressed than the CAG<sup>+ </sup>isoform in NE tumor as well as in control samples investigated. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the functional role of CYYR1 products in both normal and neoplastic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>B2M, beta-2 microglobulin; BLAST, basic local alignment search tool; BLASTN, Blast nucleotide-nucleotide; cDNA, DNA complementary to RNA; CDS, coding sequence; dbSNP, single nucleotide polymorphism database; dNTP, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate; DNES, diffuse neuroendocrine system; EST, expressed sequence tag; htgs, high throughput genomic sequences; IGF1R, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor; mRNA, messenger RNA; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information; NE, neuroendocrine; nr, non redundant; RT-PCR, reverse transcription &#x02013; polymerase chain reaction; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; TAE, tris-acetate-EDTA; TBE, tris-borate-EDTA.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LV designed the study, carried out the molecular genetic studies, participated in the sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript.
