Ascorbic acid is capable of partially dissolving quartz crystals, leading to an increase of soluble silica concentration and to the generation of new radical sites on the quartz surface. The reaction is specific for the crystalline forms of silica. It has been already demonstrated an increased cytotoxicity and stronger induction of pro-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by ascorbic acid pre-treated quartz (QA) compared to untreated quartz (Q) in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Taking advantage of the enhanced macrophage response to QA as compared to Q particles, we investigated the first steps of cell activation and the contribution of early signals generated directly from the plasma membrane to the production of TNF-&#x003b1;, a cytokine that activates both inflammatory and fibrogenic pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we demonstrate that TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA synthesis and protein secretion are significantly increased in RAW 264.7 macrophages challenged with QA as compared to Q particles, and that the enhanced response is due to an increase of intracellular ROS. Plasma membrane-particle contact, in the absence of phagocytosis, is sufficient to trigger TNF-&#x003b1; production through a mechanism involving membrane lipid peroxidation and this appears to be even more detrimental to macrophage survival than particle phagocytosis itself.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together these data suggest that an impairment of pulmonary macrophage phagocytosis, i.e. in the case of alcoholic subjects, could potentiate lung disease in silica-exposed individuals.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Inhalation of crystalline silica can induce a pulmonary inflammation characterized by the slow formation of lung fibrotic nodules that cause impairment of pulmonary function, eventually leading to death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The severity of the pathology strictly depends on the structural characteristics of quartz particles.

After 24 hours cell viability was reduced by 30% in cells incubated with Q particles and by 70% in cells challenged with QA particles compared to control, untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, Q and QA bars versus C).

Pre-incubation of cells with the antioxidant BHT completely preserved cell viability in the presence of Q or QA particles co-incubated with DXS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, Q+D+B and QA+D+B bars).</p><p>The percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated in parallel in the same set of experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). FACS analyses of phosphatydilserine-positive plasma membranes in cells challenged with Q or QA particles revealed a very low extent of apoptosis (3.6&#x02013;3.7%) for both treatments. Necrosis, in turn, amounted to 32% in Q-treated cells and 55% in QA-treated cells after 24 hours. DXS-pre-treatment before addition of Q or QA resulted in even a higher level of necrosis with no significant variations of apoptosis compared to Q and QA treatments alone. Finally, BHT pre-incubation of cells before addition of particles in the presence of DXS, completely prevented both necrosis and apoptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The toxicity of crystalline silica in mammals is known since many years to the medical community involved in the field of occupational diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Development of a long-term lung disease upon inhalation of silica particles is known to correlate with silica properties such as the crystalline structure and the presence of freshly fractured particle surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Cell response to quartz particles appears to be strictly related to the abundance of surface radicals, which trigger macrophage activation by means of specific inflammatory and pro-apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Our group recently demonstrated that specific chemical modifications occurring on the quartz surface after exposure to ascorbic acid (AA) increase quartz cytotoxicity and macrophage activation, evaluated through the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and production of prostaglandins in the murine cell line RAW 264.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>It is well known the presence of micromolar concentrations of AA in the lung fluids, where this molecule is believed to give a prominent contribution to the antioxidant defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Conversely, our findings are suggesting a new, peculiar role for AA in the pathogenesis of quartz-induced lung disease. The ability of AA to enhance the cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory properties of quartz particles in the lung may explain the specific reactivity of mammals towards quartz among the different structural forms of silica.</p><p>Results from other research groups have already put in evidence an involvement of AA in the development of quartz-induced lung injury <italic>in vivo</italic>, with the observation that guinea pigs fed an ascorbate-rich diet and exposed to quartz show a higher degree of infiltration of inflammatory cells in lung fluids compared to controls fed low doses of AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Taking advantage from the ability of AA to enhance macrophage response to quartz particles, we investigated the early events following quartz contact with the macrophage plasma membrane and triggering the synthesis and release of TNF-&#x003b1;, a key cytokine in the development of lung fibrosis after silica inhalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Results obtained demonstrate that TNF-&#x003b1; secretion and mRNA synthesis are significantly increased in RAW 264.7 macrophages challenged with AA-treated quartz (QA) compared to untreated quartz (Q) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and that the higher pro-inflammatory effect of QA over Q is even more evident in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). This cytokine is produced by activated lymphocytes recruited by macrophages at a later stage of the inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These results suggest that the quartz surface modifications caused by AA could be relevant not only during the first steps of the lung inflammatory response but also subsequently. The long-lasting presence of quartz particles in the lung and their continuous exposure to AA, inducing the chemical modifications already demonstrated <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] may indeed favour an escalation of the inflammatory response, as observed during the development of silicosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Intracellular ROS play a fundamental role in the silica-induced transduction pathway leading to TNF-&#x003b1; production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In our experimental model, both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and OH<sup>&#x02022; </sup>radicals were found to be key signals in the enhanced production of TNF-&#x003b1; in QA-stimulated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), as cytokine synthesis was significantly reduced by presence of the two specific ROS scavengers catalase and mannitol. Conversely, the divalent-iron chelator desferoxamine, had no effect, suggesting a mechanism different from the Fenton reaction for generation of OH<sup>&#x02022; </sup>radicals. In fact, <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments have already demonstrated the generation of OH<sup>&#x02022; </sup>radicals from the direct reaction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>with the quartz surface, a mechanism strongly enhanced by the previous AA treatment of the crystalline dust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>To assess the direct role of the plasma membrane in the silica-induced TNF-&#x003b1; production, we focused on the very first step of macrophage phagocytosis of quartz which is known to be mediated by scavenger receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Thus, we used a specific scavenger receptor inhibitor, dextran-sulphate (DXS), to impair phagocytosis of Q and QA particles in RAW 264.7 cells and establish the role of the contact between particle and plasma membrane in triggering TNF-&#x003b1; synthesis.</p><p>Pre-incubation with DXS, as well as with Cytocalasin B, a common phagocytosis inhibitor, completely inhibited quartz phagocytosis in RAW 264.7 cells as demonstrated by confocal microscopy images showing an absence of quartz internalization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane II and III).</p><p>Phagocytosis of quartz particles by RAW 264.7 cells was followed by a significant (three-fold) increase of the intracellular concentration of free silicates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), indicating that a partial dissolution of quartz indeed occurs after internalization, in contrast to the currently held inability of macropahges to dissolve quartz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>DXS treatment of the cells, and Cytocalsin B as well, also prevented the increase of the intracellular silica concentration, in line with its inhibitory effect on phagocytosis. DXS treatment prevented quartz phagocytosis and partial digestion by macropahges, but not the ability of cells to establish contact with the particles, as observed by confocal microscopy on living RAW 264.7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Membrane lipid peroxidation was significantly higher in QA- compared to Q-treated cells, and DXS pre-treatment further increased lipid peroxidation in both cell samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These results, confirmed also by use of Cytocalsin B, another phagocytosis inhibitor, indicate that contact of quartz particles with the plasma membrane, which is prolonged in the absence of quartz internalization, is responsible for lipid peroxidation.</p><p>Conversely, pre-treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with DXS prior to challenge with Q and QA particles, significantly reduced ROS production which is secondary to phagocytosis.</p><p>Pointedly, in DXS-pretreated cells production of TNF-&#x003b1; increased signficantly after exposure to Q, and even more to QA, compared to cytokine release from cells where phagocytosis was not inhibited (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This result indicate that membrane lipid peroxides generated independently of phagocytosis induce production of TNF-&#x003b1;. This conclusion is further sustained by the complete inhibition of both Q- and QA-induced TNF-&#x003b1; synthesis in the presence of DXS by the lipid peroxide scavenger BHT. Both the two mechanisms, i.e. ROS production after quartz internalization and lipid peroxides generation during membrane-particle contact, are likely to happen physiologically and consequently being synergistic in activating macrophage response.</p><p>In line with the increased oxidative damage of the plasma membrane, viability of DXS-pretreated cells was severely reduced after 24 hours incubation with Q and, even more, with QA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). The observed reduced cell viability was almost due to necrosis while the extent of apoptosis was minoritary (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). The lipid peroxidation inhibitor BHT prevented cell death in cells challenged with Q or QA in the presence of DXS.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that reaction of quartz with AA increases toxicity of crystalline silica inducing a higher macrophage production of TNF-&#x003b1;, the pro-inflammatory cytokine currently believed to be mainly responsible for generation of lung fibrosis after exposure to silica [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, this is the first demonstration that plasma membrane contact with quartz, in the absence of phagocytosis, is sufficient to trigger membrane lipid peroxidation, TNF-&#x003b1; release and cell death and this appears to be even more detrimental to macrophage survival than particle phagocytosis itself.</p><p>Taken together these data suggest that an impairment of macrophage phagocytosis could exacerbate lung disease in silica-exposed individuals. This could be the case in alcoholic subjects, where pulmonary macrophage function is compromised, resulting in defective phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This would imply that alcohol abuse or other pathologic conditions impairing macrophage phagocytosis could be a risk factor for silica-induced lung disease and a detrimental condition facilitating complications by means of the prolonged macrophage contact with unphagocytosed particles.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AA: ascorbic acid; Q: untreated quartz; QA: ascorbic acid-pretreated quartz; ROS: reactive oxygen species; COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; BAL: broncho-alveolar lavage; DXS: dextran sulphate; Cyto: Cytocalasin B; BHT: butyl hydroxytoluene; MTT: dimethylthiazol diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide; HBSS: Hank's balanced salt solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SS: conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation, manuscript writing; MM: conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation; CF: acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation; MP: acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation; FB acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation, UB: critical revision and final approval; MG conception and design, critical revision and final approval.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was partially supported by 2004 CIPE Regione Liguria funds.
