From the extents of intra-subunit, endogenous disulfide bond formation between cysteines substituted for the residues just outside the membrane domain, we infer that the extracellular flank of S0 is surrounded on three sides by the extracellular flanks of TM helices S1 and S2 and the four-residue extracellular loop between S3 and S4. Eight different double cysteine&#x02013;substituted alphas, each with one cysteine in the S0 flank and one in the S3&#x02013;S4 loop, were at least 90% disulfide cross-linked. Two of these alphas formed channels in which 90% cross-linking had no effect on the V<sub>50</sub> or on the activation and deactivation rate constants. This implies that the extracellular ends of S0, S3, and S4 are close in the resting state and move in concert during voltage sensor activation. The association of S0 with the gating charge bearing S3 and S4 could contribute to the considerably larger electrostatic energy required to activate the BK channel compared with typical voltage-gated potassium channels with six TM helices.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>G.

BK channel is opened by a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and by depolarization. The outward K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> flux conducted by the BK channel moves the membrane potential in the hyperpolarizing direction, suppressing activation of voltage-dependent channels. To the extent that an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration is due to the activation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, the BK channel is a negative feedback regulator of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration.</p><p>The BK channel pore is formed by a tetramer of &#x003b1; subunits. BK &#x003b1; is homologous to the pore-forming subunit of other voltage-gated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, as can be seen, for example, in its alignment with K<sub>v</sub>1.2 and K<sub>v</sub>AP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), the structures of which have been determined to high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Long et al., 2005</xref>). All voltage-dependent K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels have six transmembrane (TM) helices, S1&#x02013;S6. The BK &#x003b1; subunit has an additional TM helix, S0, which is N terminal to S1&#x02013;S6. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wallner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meera et al., 1997</xref>). Where S0 is located relative to S1&#x02013;S6 in the folded structure of BK &#x003b1; has not previously been examined.</p><p>Previous work has implicated S0 in the expression and function of the channel. Transfection of cells with BK lacking S0 yielded neither functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wallner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morrow et al., 2006</xref>) nor biochemically detectable channels on the cell surface (unpublished data). The &#x003b1; mutants F25W, L26W, and S29W, which are on the same side of the predicted S0 helix, yielded channels with rightward shifted conductance&#x02013;voltage (G-V) curves compared with wild-type (WT) &#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koval et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, replacement of S0 and the preceding N-terminal residues of human BK &#x003b1; with the comparable residues in <italic>Drosophila</italic> BK &#x003b1; interfered with the functional modulation of this chimera by human &#x003b2;1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wallner et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>We used disulfide cross-linking to determine the relative proximities of S0 to the other TM helices in &#x003b1; and to determine the effects on channel function of tethering S0 to its neighboring TM helices. We substituted cysteine (Cys) for the first four residues we predicted would just flank the extracellular end of the membrane-embedded portions of the TM helices and expressed 47 double-Cys &#x003b1; mutants containing one Cys flanking S0 and another Cys flanking one of the other TM helices. We determined both the extent of endogenous disulfide bond formation (in the absence of added oxidizing agents) in &#x003b1; heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells and trafficked to the cell surface and the functional effects of the cross-links. We conclude that the extracellular end of S0 is centrally positioned among the extracellular ends of the voltage sensor domain helices, S1&#x02013;S4, and is particularly close to the extracellular ends of S3 and S4 in both the resting and active states of the voltage sensor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cross-linker</title><p>In most experiments, no oxidizing agent was added to the cells. In experiments to test the susceptibility of two Cys on the cell surface to reform a disulfide after reduction, we used the doubly charged oxidant, 4,4&#x02032;-(azodicarbonyl)-bis-[1,1-dimethylpiperazinium, diiodide] (quaternary piperazinium diamide [QPD]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kosower et al., 1974</xref>), the synthesis of which was based on that of 4,4&#x02032;-(azodicarbonyl)-bis-[1-methylpiperazide] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bose et al., 1984</xref>). In brief, <italic>N</italic>-methylpiperazine was added slowly to a solution of 0.5 equivalent of diethyl diazenedicarboxylate in petroleum ether:ether (3:1) at 0&#x000b0;C. After 4 h stirring at room temperature, the product was filtered and crystallized from hexane/benzene as golden needles. It was quaternized by treatment with excess methyl iodide in acetonitrile at room temperature to yield QPD as a yellow-orange solid. The structure was confirmed by NMR (1H NMR[DMSO-d6, 400 MHz] &#x003b4; [ppm] 3.97 [m, 4H], 3.83 [m, 4H], 3.57 [m, 4H], 3.52 [m, 4H], 3.19 [s, 12H]); the purity was &#x0003e;98%.</p></sec><sec><title>Constructs</title><p>Mutants of the BK &#x003b1; subunit (<italic>mSlo1</italic>, <italic>KCNMA1</italic>, GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_010610">NM_010610</ext-link>) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange XL (Stratagene).

In a typical sample, lysate of &#x0223c;25% of the cells from a 100-mm plate in 240-&#x003bc;l lysis buffer was mixed with 30 &#x003bc;l of a 50% slurry of Neutravidin beads, previously washed and suspended in PBS. The beads were washed seven times with lysis buffer (without NEM and protease inhibitors) and two additional times with HRV buffer (in mM, 150 NaCl, 50 Tris, pH 7.5, 1 EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100). The beads were mixed with 5 U of HRV-3C protease (Novagen) in 50 &#x003bc;l HRV-3C buffer and nutated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. To elute bound protein and fragments released by cleavage, we added 100 &#x003bc;l 8 M urea, 4% SDS, 200 mM Tris, pH 8, and heated the mixture to 100&#x000b0;C for 2 min. After a short spin, the supernatant was collected. A 75-&#x003bc;l portion was treated with 2 &#x003bc;l of 400 mM DTT to reduce disulfides. Both the unreduced and the reduced portions were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted by sequential treatment with anti-BK-&#x003b1;-C-terminus antibody (BD Bioscience), horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and ECL reagent (Pierce Super Signal West).

We calculated the extent of cross-linking, uncorrected for the efficiency of cleavage, from the lane with the unreduced portion and the efficiency of protease cleavage from the lane with the reduced portion. The calculation of the corrected extent of cross-linking is as follows (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In the reduced lane, the density of the 110-kD band divided by the sum of the densities of the 110-kD band and the 125-kD band is the fraction of &#x003b1; cleaved by protease; i.e., the efficiency of cleavage. In the unreduced lane, the same quotient is the uncorrected fraction of &#x003b1; that was not cross-linked, and hence ran as 110-kD after cleavage. This fraction was corrected to 100% cleavage by dividing it by the efficiency of protease cleavage, yielding the corrected fraction of &#x003b1; that was not cross-linked. The corrected fraction of &#x003b1; that was cross-linked equals one minus the corrected fraction of uncrosslinked &#x003b1;.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Determination of disulfide cross-linking.

In this background, we substituted Cys for the four residues flanking S0, S1, and S2, and two of the four residues in the loop between S3 and S4. In addition, in the pWT &#x003b1; background, we substituted Cys for eight residues flanking S5 and six residues flanking S6. Among all the possible combinations, we tested 47 double-Cys mutants, in which one Cys was in the flank of S0 and one Cys was in flank of one of the other helices. We focused our analysis on cell surface channels, assuming that only well-folded and assembled &#x003b1; tetramers were trafficked to the surface membrane. We selected these channels by biotinylating the surface proteins in intact cells with the relatively impermeant sulfoNHS-LC-biotin and by capturing the biotinylated channels on avidin beads after cell lysis. The efficiencies of transfection and cell surface expression of the double-Cys &#x003b1; mutants involving S0&#x02013;S4 and of pWT &#x003b1; were similar.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitating Intrasubunit Cross-links</title><p>The &#x003b1; subunit has an apparent molecular mass of &#x0223c;125 kD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knaus et al., 1995</xref>).

Given the structure of the homologous K<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>), any cross-linking between S0 and S5 or S6 was likely to be between different subunits and to result in dimers or higher oligomers. Nevertheless, we first tested double-Cys mutants of &#x003b1;, one Cys flanking S0 and one Cys flanking S5 or S6, in the same subunit. These resulted in no significant cross-linking. These constructs, however, yielded poor surface expression, and the mutants tested showed no function, even after reduction with DTT. In a second approach, we coexpressed equal amounts of two single-Cys &#x003b1; mutants, an &#x003b1; with a Cys substituted in the S0 flank and an &#x003b1; with a Cys substituted in the flank of S5 or S6. All single mutants with a Cys just in S5 or S6 expressed well and resulted in functional channels. The hybrid channels resulting from transfection with both an &#x003b1; S0 mutant and &#x003b1; S5 or S6 mutant also expressed well. Because there was no detectable cross-linking between S0 and any Cys within four residues of the membrane domain of either S5 or S6, we made Cys mutations further out from the membrane. We tested Cys substituted for the first eight residues flanking S5 and for four residues among six flanking S6. There was &#x0003c;8% cross-linking among any of the 32 different combinations of S0 and S5 Cys mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>) and among any of the 16 combinations of S0 and S6 Cys mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>; also Table S1). To control for possible interference with the cross-linking by Cys277 in the pore helix (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), we also retested all of these combinations in a background in which Cys277 was mutated to Ala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Savalli et al., 2006</xref>), none of which showed any more cross-linking than previously seen (unpublished data).

These effects could reflect the cross-linking of Cys substituted for residues that in the native structure are in different positions in the different states of the voltage sensor, or the effects could reflect a perturbation of a static part of the structure that in turn affects parts that do move. Again, that these perturbations do not completely disrupt channel function and that the extents of endogenous cross-linking are moderately high indicate that the Cys involved, and the native residues they replaced, are not far apart in either the resting or the activated states of the voltage sensor.</p></sec><sec><title>Reducing and Reforming Disulfides on the Cell Surface</title><p>In three double-Cys mutants with large &#x00394;V<sub>50</sub>s, we tested by reduction of the disulfide on the cell surface whether the functional changes were due to disulfide bond formation per se or to the effects of the mutations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

Thus, for these two mutants, the cross-link could be reduced and reformed at the cell surface with similar effects on V<sub>50</sub> to those resulting from endogenous cross-linking.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Disulfide Cross-linking</title><p>Our approach to locating S0 among the other TM helices, S1&#x02013;S6, was to mutate to Cys, one at a time, at least the first four residues just extracellular to the membrane domain of the TM helices. In the polar juxtamembrane environment, the Cys thiol can ionize to the reactive thiolate and is accessible to oxidizing reagents and oxidizing enzymes. Furthermore, Cys just outside the membrane domain of different TM helices are more or less in the same plane parallel to the membrane. Because at least four consecutive positions are mutated, all directions parallel to the membrane are sampled, whatever the local secondary structure, and in neighboring segments at least some substituted Cys are likely to be pointing toward each other and susceptible to disulfide bond formation.</p><p>The induction of disulfide bond formation between substituted Cys has been widely used to infer the structure and structural dynamics of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass et al., 2007</xref>). In Shaker K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, disulfide bond formation between substituted Cys has provided evidence for the proximity between the extracellular end of S4 of one subunit and the extracellular end of S5 of an adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elliott et al., 2004</xref>), an arrangement that is compatible with the model in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>. Also in Shaker, cross-linking was obtained between the extracellular end of S4 and positions approximately six residues from the extracellular ends of S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campos et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Even though the centers of the sulfur atoms in a disulfide are only 3 &#x000c5; apart, disulfide bond formation has been induced between Cys SH known to be 15 &#x000c5; apart in the crystal structure of a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butler and Falke, 1996</xref>). This is consistent with the fluctuating nature of protein structures, where even some moderately distant residues have finite probability of colliding, the shorter the distance, the greater the probability. Based on this, the relative proximities of cysteines have been inferred from the relative rate constants for disulfide bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass et al., 2007</xref>). Distance, however, is not the only determinant of the rate constant for disulfide bond formation. Structural flexibility and the likelihood of overcoming steric hindrance and of achieving the correct orientation for reaction may differ in different parts of a protein. The electrostatic environment also plays a role in at least two ways: it affects the pK<sub>A</sub> of the cysteine thiol (the thiolate is the reactive species), and it affects the collision probability of the charged reactants. At the water-accessible surface of a protein, these effects are modest in the absence of a local, high concentration of positive or negative side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hansen et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We determined the extent of endogenous disulfide bond formation in intact cells. No oxidizing agent was added. Endogenous disulfide formation of a protein targeted to the cell membrane can be due to uncatalyzed Cys thiol oxidation by dissolved O<sub>2</sub> (i.e., spontaneous disulfide formation) or to catalytic oxidation by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) homologues in the ER(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004</xref>), by secreted PDI homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 1999</xref>), or by secreted oxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2006</xref>). Endogenous disulfide bond formation between juxtamembrane Cys in membrane proteins has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Whitley et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jansen and Akabas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Iscla et al., 2007</xref>). For membrane-spanning proteins, only Cys in the extracytoplasmic domain or close to the exofacial lipid&#x02013;water interface are substrates for PDI homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of PDI and its homologues provides a rationale for relating the extent of disulfide bond formation to the proximity of the Cys involved. These enzymes make and break disulfides repeatedly in the context of chaperone-enabled refolding, so that at the end of the process the disulfides formed are the most stable ones possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004</xref>). It seems likely that if there are only two extracellular Cys accessible in the target protein, then the extent of disulfide formation should depend on the stability of this target disulfide relative to the stability of the disulfide between the two Cys in the catalytic site of the PDI homologue. Thus, the stability of the PDI catalytic site disulfide provides a baseline. Like the rate constant for disulfide bond formation discussed above, the stability of the target disulfide depends on the proximity of the two Cys in a stable structure of the protein. The stability of the disulfide-bonded structure will depend on the differences in both electrostatic and nonelectrostatic terms in the free energy difference between the disulfide bonded structure and the structures with free cysteines. We sought to determine the average proximity of short segments of the BK &#x003b1; by testing multiple Cys pairs to average out the effects of relative orientation and local electrostatics.</p><p>We quantitated the extent of endogenous disulfide bond formation in &#x003b1; trafficked to the plasmalemma in intact cells.

In a model of BK &#x003b1; based on a Rosetta model of K<sub>v</sub>1.2 in the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2006</xref>), we placed a circle representing the extracellular end of S0 in a location that satisfies qualitatively the relative proximities estimated from the mean extents of cross-linking and is consistent with the lack of cross-linking to S5 and S6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). The extracellular end of S0 is in a cove three-quarters surrounded by the extracellular ends of S1&#x02013;S4, closest to the short loop between S3 and S4.</p><p>Our inference is based not only on the high extent of endogenous cross-linking of the S0 flank to the S1 and S2 flanks and to the S3&#x02013;S4 loop but also on the lack of significant cross-linking to the flanks of S5 and S6. We guarded against the possibility that this lack of cross-linking could be due to a misalignment normal to the membrane plane by testing Cys substituted in positions six (S6) and eight (S5) residues from the predicted extracellular side of the membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). There was a small extent of cross-linking of S0 to Cys five and eight residues from the membrane domain of S5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>), most likely a reflection of the flexibility of the S0 flank and the increased flexibility of the S5 flank some distance from the membrane. Could the meager extent of cross-linking of S0 to S5 and S6 be due to the suppression of the reactivity of the Cys due to local negatively charged residues? Although we do not know the exact three-dimensional structure of these regions in BK &#x003b1;, Asp and Glu are not concentrated in the sequences around the residues mutated to Cys (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). There are as many negatively charged residues in or around the flanks of S1 and S2, which did cross-link to S0, as around the flank of S5, which did not cross-link to S0. Furthermore, the flank of S0 is positively charged, which should more than compensate for the effect of negatively charged residues around a Cys in another flank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hansen et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional Effects of Cross-linking</title><p>Our initial purpose of looking at the functional effects of the cross-linking was to determine whether or not a cross-linked &#x003b1; was in a near-native conformation. Our assumption was that near-normal function implies near-normal structure. We found that each of the 16 double-Cys mutants that we tested for function were expressed at the cell surface and were functional. Thus, the most highly cross-linked double-Cys mutants were functionally competent and had near-native structures.</p><p>Of course, the combination of the mutation of two native residues to Cys and the cross-linking of the Cys by a disulfide bond must perturb the native structure to some extent. What can we infer about the structural dynamics of the cross-linked segments from the functional effects of cross-linking? This question is easiest to answer for cross-links that form endogenously to a high extent and have no functional effects. Two cross-links between S0 and S3&#x02013;S4, R20C to L199C and R17C to R201C, had almost no effect on the V<sub>50</sub> or on the rate constants for activation and deactivation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E&#x02013;H</xref>; Fig. S2). Because the extents of endogenous cross-linking of these pairs were 96% and 88%, respectively, we conclude that the two Cys in each of these pairs, and the native residues that they replaced, are near neighbors in the resting state of the voltage sensor in which disulfide bond formation takes place. But they are also likely to be closely apposed in the activated state of the voltage sensor, because the cross-linked structures favor neither the open nor the closed state. If the cross-link stabilized either state, &#x00394;V<sub>50</sub> would have been significantly different than zero, which it was not. Furthermore, the two Cys (and the native residues that they replaced) are unlikely to move relative to one another during the transitions between states, because the cross-linking of the substituted Cys has little effect on the kinetics of opening and closing. We conclude that the two Cys, and the residues that they replaced, are close neighbors in the closed, open, and transition states of the channel.</p><p>The native residues, R20 and L199, are predicted to be the first residues just flanking the membrane domains of S0 and S3, respectively. Thus, the adjacent membrane domains of S0 and S3 in both the deactivated/closed and activated/open states and in the transition states are also close. Similarly, R17C and R201C formed a cross-link between the S0 flank and the S3&#x02013;S4 loop, two residues from the membrane domain of S4. It seems likely that the four residues flanking the extracellular end of S0 and the four-residue loop between S3 and S4 follow close, parallel trajectories, because all of the double-Cys mutants in these segments cross-linked nearly completely (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>; Table S1). Thus, to the extent that the extracellular ends of S3 and S4 move during activation and deactivation, the extracellular end of S0 moves with them. Some of the cross-links between the S0 flank and the S3&#x02013;S4 loop do result in changes in V<sub>50</sub> or in the rate constants of activation and deactivation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E&#x02013;H</xref>), which is consistent with some differences in the interface between these segments in the resting, transition, or activated states.</p><p>Whatever the interactions are between the S0 flank and the S3&#x02013;S4 loop, their residues are not irreplaceable for the function of &#x003b1; alone, because deletion of the N-terminal extracellular residues, starting with R20, did not perturb the function of &#x003b1;; this deletion did, however, prevent the modulation of the V<sub>50</sub> by by &#x003b2;1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morrow et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the effect of S0 on the properties of the BK voltage sensor must depend on interactions either with the S0 membrane domain, for which there is evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koval et al., 2007</xref>), and/or with the intracellular S0&#x02013;S1 loop.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible Effect of S0 on Voltage Sensor Properties</title><p>Compared with other voltage-gated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, BK channel V<sub>50</sub>s for both gating current and for opening are shifted to much more positive voltages.
