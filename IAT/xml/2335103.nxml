The hormone is composed of two non-covalently linked subunits, the common alfa subunit (hCG&#x003b1;) and the hormone specific beta subunit (hCG&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone physiologically produced by the placenta to maintain the progesterone production of corpus luteum of pregnancy, which prepares the uterus for implantation and for embryonic and placental development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The ectopic production of hCG and its subunits by patients with nontrophoblastic cancers has been reported by many authors lately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The free subunit was originally considered as biologically non-functional, however it was shown recently that free &#x003b2;-subunit may stimulate tumor growth or inhibit its apoptosis and the elevated serum level of hCG&#x003b2; is frequently associated with higher aggressiveness of cancer and its resistance to therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>We recently reported the expression of hCG&#x003b2; in patients with nontrophoblastic gynecological cancerous tissues showing that the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin is produced by individual cancer cells. The distribution and the amount of hCG was heterogeneous and was not characteristic for all of the cells of the study tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Here we confirm that the presence of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin's mRNA and protein is a characteristic feature of cervical carcinomas. The biological mechanisms behind the association of <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>expression in cancer cells remains unclear. Silencing gene expression provides a powerful tool for analyzing gene function, however the effectiveness of RNA inhibition strategies has been variable. Based on this we investigated a novel mRNA silencing methodology as a method to study <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>role in human cervical cancer cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>. Since nearly all mRNAs are postranscriptionally modified by 5'capping, splicing, 3' cleavage and polyadenylation it was postulated that agents interfering with processing of specific transcripts have the potential to be an effective anti-RNA strategy. Recently an approach for reducing mRNA output of a target gene was reported that is based on a modified U1 snRNA transcript as an effector. The interaction of U1 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle) via base paring close to the polyadenylation signal results in inhibition of the cleavage or polyadenylation portion of the 3' end processing reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This effect was applied to suppress other genes. A significant inhibition of gene expression was achieved by using a modified U1 snRNA in which the first 10 nucleotides have been substituted with a sequence complementary to the gene of interest present within the terminal exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In our study we exploit 5' end-mutated U1 snRNAs to block the expression of <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>in a cervix carcinoma cell line. The results have been demonstrated that U1 snRNA base paired to this target mRNA inhibits the expression of the beta subunit of human gonadotropin gene causing apoptotic death of affected cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of hCG&#x003b2; is a characteristic feature of cervix carcinoma cancer</title><p>To verify at the molecular level the presence of <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>in uterine cervix carcinoma, total RNA was isolated from cancer tissue of patients, reverse transcribed, and a 210 bp fragment corresponding to <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>nucleotides 348&#x02013;557 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_033043">NM_033043</ext-link>] was amplified.

Numerous studies demonstrated that besides placenta and malignant trophoblastic disease, varieties of tumors of different origin secreted hCG and especially its &#x003b2;-subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. As previously demonstrated by Acevedo and Hartsock, in a nude mouse model, high expression of membrane-associated hCG&#x003b2; correlates with primary malignant growth and metastatic phenotype of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The findings of present study indicate the <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>gene is active in uterine cervix cancers. In all 15 specimens of the cervical carcinomas that were analyzed, the transcripts of <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>were present. Even in slightly advanced carcinomas such as carcinoma of uterine cervix, FIGO stage 0, IA we found the mRNA of <italic>hCG&#x003b2;</italic>. At the same time we showed that tissue lacking the cancerous changes did not express <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>mRNA. The RT-PCR results were proofed by immunohistochemical analysis, which revealed that hCG is expressed in cancer cells within a cervical carcinoma. Thus, the expression of <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>is a characteristic feature of cervical tumor tissue, however the role of hCG in tumorogenesis is unknown.</p><p>The discovery of the crystal structure of hCG demonstrated that dimeric hCG forms the cystine knot structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

We used a new strategy to knock down the expression of <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>in cultured cervix carcinoma cells. Mammalian U1 snRNP contains ten proteins bound to U1 snRNA and binds to the exon-intron boundary of pre-mRNA to direct early steps of splicosome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Binding involves the interaction between nucleotides 2&#x02013;11 of the human U1 snRNA and the 5' splice site of pre-mRNA. A modified U1 snRNA can be used as an alternative to siRNA, antisense RNA or ribozyme approach for reducing the mRNA output of a target gene. In our study we examined whether binding of modified U1 snRNAs to 10 nucleotide regions within the terminal exon of human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit was able to inhibit the hormone synthesis.</p><p>We demonstrated that U1 complementary to three different target regions of <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>pre-mRNA results in suppression of the hormone expression both on the mRNA and protein level. The fact that three different modified U1 snRNAs gave similar results would argue that <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>reduction, as opposed to off-target effects by each modified U1 snRNA, is responsible for the effects we observe. Our results indicated that HeLa cells trasfected with U1 snRNA anti-<italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>constructs showed 2&#x02013;3-fold inhibition of human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit transcripts. In cancer cells expressing the modified U1 snRNAs hCG protein was undetectable. Further analysis showed that knocking down gonadotropin expression significantly increases the apoptosis rate what was shown by flow cytometry and morphological changes characteristic for apoptotic process. Thus, the inhibition of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin expression leads to induction of programmed cell death.</p><p>It was already shown that the addition of anti-hCG&#x003b2; antibodies to the culture media of bladder cancer cell line inhibit the growth of the cells which produce endogenous free hCG&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore Rivera et al., as a result of applying the antisense RNA specific to <italic>hCG&#x003b2;</italic>, demonstrated the loss of tumorogenic potential of human lung cancer cells (ChaGo cells), cultured <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Also the transfection of an antisense chorionic gonadotropin beta gene into choriocarcinoma cells suppressed cell proliferation and increased the apoptosis-positive rate of JAr cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Recent reports suggest that free hCG&#x003b2; is acting as a growth-stimulating factor, but the population growth is not the result of increased replication rate but of reduction in cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Since the induction of epithelial cell apoptosis is a well-established action of TGF&#x003b2; and the topological homology of hCG&#x003b2; and TGF&#x003b2; was previously shown it was suggested that the anti-apoptotic effect of hCG&#x003b2; could potentially occur by blocking the TGF&#x003b2; receptor. Blocking of the receptor by free hCG&#x003b2; could prevent any further interactions with other components that are necessary for initiating cytoplasmic signaling that leads to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The inhibition of <italic>hCG&#x003b2; </italic>expression by modified U1 snRNAs caused apoptosis both in cells expressing U1 <italic>anti-hCG&#x003b2; </italic>construct as well as in neighbouring cells, lacking the modified U1 snRNA. This neighboring cell effect could be explained by a decreased level of hCG&#x003b2; in culture medium, which allows the interactions between the receptor and ligands essential for induction of apoptosis. Therefore our results are in good agreement with the date published previously.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the study demonstrated that blocking of human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit by modified U1 complementary to three different target regions of its pre-mRNA results in suppression of the hormone expression both on the mRNA and protein level. The knocking down gonadotropin expression significantly increases the apoptosis rate of affected cells.</p><p>While current anti-hCG&#x003b2; therapeutic strategies are based on antibody blockade of ectopically expressed hCG&#x003b2; here we demonstrated, <italic>in vitro</italic>, the potential of mRNA silencing gene technology to achieve the same therapeutic results via the same molecular mechanism, increased endogenous apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The specimens of gynecological cancer tissue were obtained from patients treated by surgery at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences in 2004 &#x02013; 2006.
