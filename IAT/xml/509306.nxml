In yeast, a large set of UPR target genes has been experimentally determined, but the previously characterized unfolded protein response element (UPRE), an upstream activating sequence (UAS) found in the promoter of the UPR target gene <italic>KAR2,</italic> cannot account for the transcriptional regulation of most genes in this set. To address this puzzle, we analyzed the promoters of UPR target genes computationally, identifying as candidate UASs short sequences that are statistically overrepresented. We tested the most promising of these candidate UASs for biological activity, and identified two novel UPREs, which are necessary and sufficient for UPR activation of promoters. A genetic screen for activators of the novel motifs revealed that the transcription factor Gcn4p plays an essential and previously unrecognized role in the UPR: Gcn4p and its activator Gcn2p are required for induction of a majority of UPR target genes during ER stress. Both Hac1p and Gcn4p bind target gene promoters to stimulate transcriptional induction. Regulation of Gcn4p levels in response to changing physiological conditions may function as an additional means to modulate the UPR. The discovery of a role for Gcn4p in the yeast UPR reveals an additional level of complexity and demonstrates a surprising conservation of the signaling circuit between yeast and metazoan cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The yeast unfolded protein response activates a large set of target genes, but a characterized element found in the promoter of one target, KAR2, cannot account for most targets.

When the protein folding capacity of the ER is exceeded or experimentally impaired, unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR allows the ER to communicate with the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Patil1">Patil and Walter 2001</xref>), where a comprehensive gene expression program is induced to adjust the protein folding capacity of the cell according to need.</p><p>In the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> unfolded ER proteins stimulate the ER-resident bifunctional transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease Ire1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Cox2">Cox et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Mori2">Mori et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Sidrauski1">Sidrauski and Walter 1997</xref>). When activated, Ire1p excises a 252-nucleotide intron from the mRNA encoding Hac1p, a bZIP transcription factor required for induction of all UPR target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Cox1">Cox and Walter 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Mori3">Mori et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Sidrauski1">Sidrauski and Walter 1997</xref>). Removal of the <italic>HAC1</italic> intron and subsequent ligation of the two liberated exons by tRNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Sidrauski2">Sidrauski et al. 1996</xref>) produces a spliced mRNA that is efficiently translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Kawahara1">Kawahara et al. 1997</xref>). In the absence of splicing, the intron blocks translation of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Ruegsegger1">R&#x000fc;egsegger et al. 2001</xref>). Splicing is therefore a prerequisite for Hac1p production and thus serves as the key regulatory step in the UPR. When it is produced, Hac1p binds an upstream activating sequence (UAS), the unfolded protein response element (UPRE), found in the promoters of UPR target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Mori1">Mori et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Kohno1">Kohno et al. 1993</xref>), thereby stimulating the transcriptional response to protein unfolding.</p><p>Several salient features of the UPR are conserved between yeast and metazoans. In metazoans, Ire1p orthologs Ire1-&#x003b1; and Ire1-&#x003b2; remove a short intron from the <italic>XBP-1</italic> mRNA, which encodes a bZIP transcription factor analogous to Hac1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Wang1">Wang et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Miyoshi1">Miyoshi et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Urano1">Urano et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Calfon1">Calfon et al. 2002</xref>). The metazoan UPR, however, is implemented by at least two additional ER-resident sensors, which are thought to act in parallel and induce multiple downstream transcriptional activators not known to exist in yeast. A second branch of ER-to-nucleus signaling is mediated by ATF-6, a bZIP transcription factor that is synthesized as an integral ER transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Haze1">Haze et al. 1999</xref>). Upon UPR induction, ATF-6 is proteolytically cleaved, liberating a soluble fragment that moves to the nucleus to induce transcription in association with XBP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Wang2">Wang et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Ye1">Ye et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Steiner1">Steiner et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Yoshida1">Yoshida et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Lee1">Lee et al. 2002a</xref>). A third branch of the metazoan UPR provides translational control by the ER transmembrane kinase PERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Harding1">Harding et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Liu1">Liu et al. 2000</xref>). When activated in response to protein misfolding in the ER, PERK phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF-2&#x003b1;, thereby down-tuning translation of many mRNAs (and decreasing the translocational load on the ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Harding2">Harding et al. 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Harding3">2000b</xref>). Under conditions of limiting eIF-2&#x003b1; activity, however, some mRNAs containing short upstream open reading frames (ORFs) in their 5&#x02032; UTR are preferentially translated. One of these mRNAs encodes a third bZIP transcription factor, ATF-4, which collaborates with XBP-1 and other cellular stress signaling factors to activate UPR targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Harding2">Harding et al. 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Harding4">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Ma1">Ma et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>The UPR target genes of yeast have been comprehensively defined by microarray expression profiling, where they comprise a significant fraction of the yeast genome (381 genes, more than 5&#x00025; of the ORFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Travers1">Travers et al. 2000</xref>). The UPR target genes encode many proteins that play critical roles in the ER, the Golgi apparatus, and throughout the secretory pathway. Hence, the UPR can be thought of as a means of homeostatic control, serving to remodel the secretory pathway according to the cell's need.</p><p>The set of 381 genes was defined by microarray hybridization expression profiling, using a stringent quantitative &#x0201c;filter&#x0201d; that required the expression profile of each target gene to closely match that of previously known and well-characterized UPR target genes. In particular, the filter demanded that the expression profile of a target gene closely correlate to that of canonical UPR targets over a time course of UPR induction, and that induction be significantly greater in wild-type (WT) than in either &#x00394;<italic>ire1</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>hac1</italic> cells.</p><p>The identification of this vast set of target genes poses an enigma in light of the previously characterized UPRE. The UPRE was originally defined as a 22-bp sequence element of the <italic>KAR2</italic>/BiP promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Mori1">Mori et al. 1992</xref>) and subsequently carefully refined to nucleotide precision as a semipalindromic seven-nucleotide consensus, CAGNGTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Mori4">Mori et al. 1998</xref>). Point mutations in any one of the six conserved nucleotides or deletion of the central nucleotide was shown to have severely detrimental effects on the ability of the element to function as an autonomous UAS when placed into an otherwise silent promoter. Yet, inspection of the 381 promoter sequences of the experimentally defined set of target genes failed to reveal a recognizable UPRE in most of them. This observation is particularly surprising given that the UPRE is thought to be the Hac1p binding site, and <italic>HAC1</italic> has been shown to be required for activation of all UPR target genes. One possible resolution to this paradox is that additional, heretofore unrecognized UPREs exist that are required for the activation of the genes lacking the &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; UPRE. A requirement for new <italic>cis</italic>-activating sequences in the promoters of UPR target genes raises the possibility that such sequences could be bound by other <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, alone or in combination with Hac1p, and thus contribute to the transcriptional complexity of the UPR.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Computational Identification of Target Motifs</title><p>To identify sequence motifs shared by the set of UPR target genes, we employed a bioinformatics approach to build a &#x0201c;dictionary&#x0201d; of putative regulatory elements from the promoters of these genes. In this approach, DNA sequence is considered as a &#x0201c;text&#x0201d; (a long string of nucleotides), which is modeled as having been composed by concatenating &#x0201c;words&#x0201d; (short oligonucleotides) drawn from a probabilistic &#x0201c;dictionary&#x0201d; according to their frequencies. To infer the dictionary from the observed text, we employed the previously developed computational algorithm, MobyDick, which was developed based on a probabilistic segmentation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Bussemaker1">Bussemaker et al. 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Bussemaker2">2000b</xref>). MobyDick has been used previously to identify regulatory sites in large sets of promoters activated during sporulation or by specific cell-cycle stage.</p><p>We first constructed a dictionary from the UPR target gene promoters. To this end, we compiled a text from the promoters of all 381 UPR target genes as previously defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Travers1">Travers et al. 2000</xref>). We defined the promoter region for each ORF as the 600 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. Probabilistic segmentation analysis using the MobyDick algorithm indicated that the target gene promoters are best modeled by a dictionary of about 300 words of eight nucleotides or less (for details of this and subsequent calculations, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; a complete report of the dictionary with associated statistics appears in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). These words represent the sequences that are most frequent in the target gene promoters.</p><p>Because words with similar sequences are likely to possess similar biological activity, we considered groups of related words as units in our subsequent analysis. We grouped the dictionary into motifs by performing every possible pairwise alignment between all words, and then clustering words with high mutual alignment scores. A motif may contain two or more words, or just a single word. For a multiword motif, the words defining the motif are similar to one another and share common core sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>). The clustering procedure yielded about 100 motifs, about half of which contain multiple words.</p><p>We reasoned that motifs that are likeliest to represent bona fide regulatory elements will be nonrandomly distributed in the genome and appear more often in the UPR target gene promoters than expected by chance. Therefore, we counted the number of times each motif (i.e., a sequence match to any of the words the motif comprises) appeared in the approximately 6,000 promoters in the genome, and computed from this figure the frequency with which each motif would be expected to appear in a promoter if it were distributed randomly throughout the genome. We then counted the number of times the motif was actually found in the 381 target promoters and calculated the probability <italic>P</italic> of this many or more appearances occurring by chance. A small <italic>P</italic> value (high &#x02212;log<sub>10</sub><italic>P</italic>) indicates that the motif is overrepresented relative to the expectation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g001">Figure 1</xref>A shows the motifs ranked in order of decreasing overrepresentation, with &#x02212;log<sub>10</sub><italic>P</italic> for each motif plotted against this rank. We chose the eight highest-ranking motifs (open circles) as candidates for experimental testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), analyzing a single example of each (underlined sequences).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experimental Verification of Novel UPREs</title><p>To determine whether any of the eight candidate motifs would function as bona fide UPREs, we introduced three tandem repeats of a single representative sequence of each motif into a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter construct that contains a crippled version of the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter that is transcriptionally silent in the absence of a UAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Guarente1">Guarente and Mason 1983</xref>). Analogous constructs containing the &#x0201c;classical,&#x0201d; <italic>KAR2</italic>-derived UPRE inserted upstream of the core promoter have been shown to drive transcription of this reporter gene under ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Mori1">Mori et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Cox2">Cox et al. 1993</xref>). As a positive control for UPR-dependent gene expression, we used a construct containing a triple repeat of the <italic>KAR2</italic>-derived UPRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Cox1">Cox and Walter 1996</xref>). We transformed the resulting plasmids into yeast and assayed for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in response to ER stress.</p><p>Of the eight reporter constructs, the two containing Motif 1 and Motif 8 were transcriptionally activated when cells were treated with tunicamycin (Tm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), or dithiothreitol (DTT) (unpublished data), both inducers of the UPR. The other six motifs showed no activity above baseline (unpublished data). Neither Motif 1 nor Motif 8 showed any activity in the absence of ER stress, and no activation was observed upon UPR induction in either &#x00394;<italic>ire1</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>hac1</italic> strains. Hence, as with the &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; UPRE, these two motifs are sufficient to confer transcriptional activation upon a promoter in an <italic>IRE1</italic>-<italic>, HAC1</italic>-<italic>,</italic> and ER stress-dependent manner. We therefore conclude that the bioinformatics analysis has identified two novel UPREs present in target gene promoters; hereafter, we refer to Motif 1 and Motif 8 as UPRE-2 and UPRE-3, respectively. Correspondingly, we shall refer to the classical, <italic>KAR2</italic>-derived UPRE as UPRE-1.</p><p>To test whether these motifs are also necessary for transcriptional activation, we designed <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter constructs derived from two native promoters in which the motifs appear. We chose for UPRE-2 the promoter of <italic>ERO1,</italic> encoding an ER resident redox protein, and for UPRE-3 the promoter of <italic>DHH1,</italic> encoding an RNA helicase. Both genes are robust targets of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Travers1">Travers et al. 2000</xref>) and lack a recognizable UPRE-1. First, we verified that the reporters responded to ER stress in a UPR-dependent manner. WT but not &#x00394;<italic>ire1</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>hac1</italic> cells bearing the UPRE-2-containing <italic>ERO1</italic>-promoter-driven reporter expressed higher levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase after treatment with DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, &#x0201c;&#x0002b; UPRE-2&#x0201d; columns). In a mutant version of this reporter construct, in which the UPRE-2 was ablated and replaced by an unrelated sequence of identical length, inducibility of the <italic>ERO1</italic> promoter was decreased by approximately 4-fold (&#x0201c;&#x02212; UPRE-2&#x0201d; columns). Similarly, WT but not &#x00394;<italic>ire1</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>hac1</italic> cells bearing the UPRE-3-containing <italic>DHH1</italic>-promoter-driven reporter expressed higher levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase after treatment with DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, &#x0201c;&#x0002b; UPRE-3&#x0201d; columns); ablation of UPRE-3 from the <italic>DHH1</italic> promoter entirely eliminated induction by ER stress ( &#x0201c;&#x02212; UPRE-3&#x0201d; columns).</p><p>Taken together, the data presented so far indicate that, as with the classical UPRE-1, UPRE-2 and UPRE-3 are both sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) and necessary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g002">2</xref>C) to confer UPR inducibility on a target promoter. The addition of UPRE-2 and UPRE-3 to the repertoire of UPREs triples the number of genes in the UPR target set whose induction we can explain by invoking the presence of a well-defined UAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Identification of High-Copy Activators of UPRE-2</title><p>The existence of functional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that differ in sequence from the canonical UPRE-1 suggests that <italic>trans</italic>-activating factors other than Hac1p may bind these elements. Alternatively, Hac1p, alone or accompanied by another factor or factors, may be able to recognize multiple sequences. To distinguish between these possibilities and potentially reveal novel regulatory factors, we attempted to identify genes which, when overexpressed, activate transcription of the UPRE-2 reporter plasmid in the absence of an ER stress signal. The design of this screen recapitulates the approach which identified <italic>HAC1</italic> as a high-copy activator of the UPRE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Cox1">Cox and Walter 1996</xref>).</p><p>We transformed a strain bearing the UPRE-2-<italic>lacZ</italic> reporter with a 2-&#x003bc;m-plasmid-derived ( high-copy) genomic DNA library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Miller1">Miller et al. 1984</xref>). A &#x00394;<italic>ire1</italic> strain was used in order to focus the screen on genes acting downstream of <italic>IRE1.</italic> Use of the &#x00394;<italic>ire1</italic> strain also avoided a background of false positives resulting from library plasmids encoding secretory proteins whose overexpression might activate Ire1p. Transformants were plated on synthetic defined media and, after appearance of colonies, overlaid with soft agar containing the &#x003b2;-galactosidase substrate X-gal. Colonies that turned significantly more blue than control (untransformed) colonies were recovered and rescreened by the same assay. Plasmids from positively rescreened clones were retransformed into the &#x00394;<italic>ire1</italic> UPRE-2-<italic>lacZ</italic> strain to verify plasmid linkage of the activator phenotype.</p><p>We screened a total of 112,000 transformants, representing a predicted genomic coverage of approximately 50x. Thirty-eight positive transformants passed through repetition and plasmid linkage tests, and 18 of these stably maintained the activator phenotype over many generations. Positive plasmids fell into two classes, as defined by the minimal region of overlap of their insert sequences. One class of inserts (ten plasmids) shared the <italic>IRE1</italic> locus and surrounding sequences; <italic>IRE1</italic> has been previously shown to be activated by overexpression and is a high-copy activator of UPRE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Cox2">Cox et al. 1993</xref>). Recovery of this locus demonstrates that the screen was able to capture genes of physiological relevance to the pathway.</p><p>The second class of positive inserts (eight plasmids) shared the <italic>GCN4</italic> locus. <italic>GCN4</italic> encodes a bZIP transcription factor, which has been well-characterized as a component of the cellular response to amino acid starvation and other stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Natarajan1">Natarajan et al. 2001</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Hinnebusch2">Hinnebusch 1997</xref>) but has not been previously demonstrated to play a role in the UPR.

Likewise, oligo 2 was specifically shifted by extracts from UPR-induced cells (compare lane 6 to lane 5). The binding activity is specific: for both oligos, the mobility shift was competed out by 100-fold excess of an unlabeled identical sequence (lanes 3 and 7) but not by a transcriptionally inactive point mutant of the same sequence (lanes 4 and 8). The binding activity is dependent on an intact UPR. No gel retardation was observed for either sequence in an &#x00394;<italic>ire1</italic> mutant (lanes 9 and 12), in which Hac1p cannot be synthesized. Likewise, in both &#x00394;<italic>gcn4</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>gcn2</italic> mutants, the binding activity observed in WT cells was absent. In both &#x00394;<italic>gcn4</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>gcn2</italic> mutants, however, a faster migrating complex appeared, which likely represents Hac1p alone binding the oligos (lanes 10, 11, 13, and 14).</p><p>To demonstrate Gcn4p and Hac1p binding conclusively, we performed supershift analyses of the WT complex by addition of antibodies to either protein. We constructed a strain expressing both HA-epitope-tagged Hac1p and myc-tagged Gcn4p. Extracts from Tm-treated cells were incubated with antibodies against either or both tagged proteins. Antibodies recognizing either the tagged Gcn4p-myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6) or HA-Hac1p (lanes 7 and 8) supershifted the bound complex to different extents (compare lanes 7 and 8 to lanes 3 and 4). Hence, both Gcn4p and Hac1p can bind to sequences containing UPRE-1 and UPRE-2. Addition of both antibodies to the same binding reaction resulted in an ultrashifted band, migrating more slowly than the bands in either of the single antibody reactions (lanes 9 and 10). If Hac1p and Gcn4p bound DNA in distinct, separate complexes, we would expect to see two bands of identical mobility to those seen in lanes 5&#x02013;8. We conclude that the mobility-shifted complex observed in UPR-induced WT cells therefore must contain both transcription factors, since no ultrashift would occur if the proteins were bound to separate complexes, and that Hac1p and Gcn4p act together at the same location to activate transcription upon UPR induction. (Similar gel-shift experiments performed with an oligonucleotide representative of UPRE-3 failed, indicating that transcription factor binding may be of reduced affinity at this sequence. This interpretation is consistent with the overall lower activity of the UPRE-3 reporter constructs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p><p>Further evidence that Gcn4p can bind UPRE-2 is provided by the observation that overexpression of <italic>GCN4</italic> alone in an otherwise WT cell, in the absence of ER stress, resulted in a mobility shift for oligo 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 2). This complex migrated faster than the WT complex (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 4). Because the extract was made from untreated cells, no Hac1p was present, indicating that the complex contains Gcn4p alone. The <italic>GCN4</italic>-dependent shift is not observed for oligo 1, consistent with observations above that Gcn4p overproduction is sufficient to activate transcription of a UPRE-2 reporter but not a UPRE-1 reporter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Reciprocally, Hac1p is present in the &#x00394;<italic>gcn4</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>gcn2</italic> mutants, but Gcn4p is absent; it therefore seems likely that the faster migrating bands in &#x00394;<italic>gcn4</italic>/&#x00394;<italic>gcn2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, lanes 10, 11, 13, and 14) represent oligonucleotides bound to Hac1p alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Identification of Novel UASs</title><p>Beginning only with the set of genes induced by the UPR and the promoter sequences of all genes in the genome, we computationally identified candidate motifs that obeyed the statistical properties we would expect of regulatory sequences, i.e., high frequency in UPR target promoters, and enrichment in the target promoters relative to the rest of the promoters in the genome. Two of these motifs, UPRE-2 and UPRE-3, are both necessary and sufficient to confer ER stress responsiveness in an <italic>IRE1</italic>- and <italic>HAC1</italic>-dependent manner on promoters which contain them. These novel sequences are activated under the same conditions as UPRE-1. Functional non-synonymy of these sequences, however, is illustrated by the activation of UPRE-2 by <italic>GCN4</italic> overexpression alone, a condition under which UPRE-1 and UPRE-3 are silent, and by the quantitative difference with which the motifs respond to UPR activation (UPRE-2 &#x0003e; UPRE-1 &#x0003e; UPRE-3). Although the two new UPRE sequences look at first glance entirely different from the well-characterized UPRE-1, one of them may share &#x0201c;half-site&#x0201d; similarity: UPRE-2 has a three base identity with UPRE-1 at the 3&#x02032; end (TACGTG versus CAGNGTG); whether these bases make equivalent contacts with the bound transcription factors remains to be determined. Taken together, the sequence diversity of the motifs conferring similar transcriptional control upon binding of the same transcriptional activators illustrates the difficulty of predicting biological regulation from promoter sequences alone, even if binding sites in one context are well defined experimentally.</p><p>The identification of these novel sequences allows a greater proportion of UPR target gene regulation to be explained within the paradigm of modular transcriptional control, i.e., in which a &#x0201c;portable&#x0201d; sequence module (a UAS) located within a promoter confers pathway responsiveness on the gene in question. The two novel motifs described triple the number of target genes whose regulation can be described in terms of a modular control mechanism, thus adding significantly to the repertoire of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements known to act in the UPR.</p><p>And yet, the resulting description of UPR transcription remains incomplete, as approximately 50&#x00025; of the target genes still lack a recognizable UPREs. It may be that more biologically active motifs exist among the 109 motifs that emerged from the overrepresentation analysis, as many of the untested motifs are overrepresented relative to chance in the UPR target set by many orders of magnitude. For the eight motifs tested, we tested whether a motif was necessary for promoter induction only if it had already been shown to be sufficient in the artificial promoter system. Because of this experimental approach, it remains possible that some motifs not found to be sufficient are dependent for their activity on some contextual parameter (e.g., particular nearby flanking sequences). Thus it may be that some UPREs are not generally portable to other contexts, but are nonetheless necessary for UPR responsiveness of the native promoters in which they reside. Also, particularly rare motifs would have been omitted from the dictionary; thus, it is possible that complementary computational approaches might allow detection of uncommon motifs that this analysis missed. Finally, some UASs may remain ultimately undiscoverable within the paradigm of modular regulation. Motifs that are particularly sensitive to chromatin structure or position relative to the transcription initiation site would not be detected by an approach that neglected these parameters.</p><p>It might be argued that the approach here enjoys no relative advantage over testing random oligonucleotides from UPR promoters. If every sequence from each target promoter were to be tested for activity, it is possible that additional elements not revealed by the bioinformatic approach would be discovered. For example, the residual upregulation of <italic>ERO1</italic> after removal of UPRE-2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) suggests that at least one cryptic element exists in that promoter. On the other hand, the <italic>DHH1</italic> promoter shows no residual upregulation after removal of UPRE-3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). If the average number of sites (candidate plus cryptic) per promoter is similar (1&#x02013;2) throughout the target gene set, our computational approach represents a highly efficient means of identifying a subset of regulatory motifs. On the other hand, if the average is significantly higher, it is possible that testing random subsequences of target promoters would also be efficient. From the small number of promoters we studied in depth, it is not possible to calculate a meaningful upper bound for the average number of undiscovered regulatory sites per promoter. Nonetheless, within the sample size of our study, the yield of active regulatory sites per candidate tested (two of eight) is much higher than any reasonable a priori estimate of the density of regulatory elements in the UPR target promoters.</p><p>One indication of a possible shortcoming of our computational approach is the finding that the probabilistic segmentation did not return the classical UPRE-1 as a significant &#x0201c;word,&#x0201d; i.e., the approach failed to generate a comprehensive list of all known active UPREs. The absence of UPRE-1 from the dictionary indicates that no sequence matching the experimentally defined degenerate consensus CAGNGTG is intrinsically overrepresented in the target promoters, i.e., this motif does not occur in the &#x0201c;text&#x0201d; of target gene promoters with a higher frequency than that with which its component subsequences would appear together by chance. Neither is this sequence overrepresented in the target promoter set relative to the promoters of the nontarget genes. The motif CAGNGTG has an overrepresentation score &#x02212;log<sub>10</sub><italic>P</italic> of 0.37, far beneath the enrichment of any of the 109 motifs assembled from dictionary words (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Hence, among genes that possess a UPRE-1 in their promoters, there are more instances of unresponsiveness to the UPR than instances of regulation, even though UPRE-1 has been experimentally demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for upregulation in response to ER stress.</p><p>A plausible resolution to this paradox may be that the UPRE-1 is heavily dependent on context. The experiments that defined the key core nucleotides proceeded by single point mutation at each position while holding constant the identity of all other nucleotides from the source 22-bp stretch of the <italic>KAR2</italic> promoter; thus the seven-nucleotide &#x0201c;core sequence&#x0201d; may only specify those bases which are necessary for activity, but not define a module which is generally functional outside its original context of flanking sequence. If this were the case, we would not expect to recover UPRE-1 in a bioinformatic analysis of all target genes. Indeed, alignment of the <italic>KAR2</italic> promoter from <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> and three related budding yeasts reveals that UPRE-1 lies in the middle of a highly conserved 21-bp sequence which is 100&#x00025; identical across three of the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). This conserved stretch may represent a context that is essential for the transcriptional function of the core sequence. We speculate that recognition of the extended context may be performed by Hac1p without the collaboration of Gcn4p, as suggested by the observation that promoters which contain a UPRE are more dependent on <italic>GCN4</italic>/<italic>GCN2</italic> than are those genes in which a short modular UAS has not been identified (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, histograms <italic>o</italic> and <italic>p</italic>).</p><p>Despite these qualifications, the approach has successfully uncovered novel information about how the UPR is regulated. The appealing aspect of the strategy described here is that such studies are not limited to the UPR but can be generally employed in the study of any transcriptional response in any organism for which promoter sequences for all genes are known and in which the comprehensive genomic output of the response can be measured by expression profiling. The sole requirement of the probabilistic segmentation/overrepresentation computations is that a partition of the genome (into &#x0201c;target genes&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;nontarget genes&#x0201d;) be made on the basis of some meaningful difference in expression levels under the conditions of interest; the analysis thereafter proceeds by comparing the distribution of candidate motifs in the target gene set and the remainder of the genome. Further refinement of the mathematical tools therefore promises to be of invaluable help in our quest for a comprehensive understanding of the logic and complex interactions of transcriptional programs in eukaryotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title><italic>GCN4</italic> Is an Essential Transcription Factor of the UPR</title><p>The overexpression screen for activators of UPRE-2 revealed a role for the transcription factor Gcn4p, which we show to be required not only for activity of UPRE-2 but for all three known UPREs.

It therefore seems likely that Gcn4p and Hac1p stimulate transcription by binding promoter DNA as a heterodimer, although we cannot rule out higher order complexes.</p><p>The promoter sequences UPRE-1 and UPRE-2 have identical genetic requirements for activation, but their behavior in response to genetic perturbations is not strictly identical. UPRE-2 can be activated by high levels of <italic>GCN4</italic> alone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), but UPRE-1 cannot. This can be explained by the binding studies, which demonstrate that UPRE-2 (but not UPRE-1) can bind Gcn4p in the absence of Hac1p (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2); indeed, Gcn4p is known to bind DNA as a monomer as well as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Cranz1">Cranz et al. 2004</xref>) and can bind DNA sequences containing even a consensus half-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Hollenbeck1">Hollenbeck and Oakley 2000</xref>).</p><p>The basis for this differential affinity for Gcn4p is strongly suggested by a refined consensus sequence for UPRE-2, and is illustrated by multiple species alignment of the <italic>ERO1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). We searched for examples of UPRE-2 core sequences that were conserved in UPR target genes across five yeast species, and extracted core and flanking sequences to derive a generalized consensus (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The resulting consensus was revealed to be T(C/T)ACGTGT(C/T)(A/C), which differs from the experimentally established UPRE-1 consensus by two nucleotides essential for activity in the <italic>KAR2</italic> promoter context. The conserved extended context of UPRE-2 in this promoter aligns with a consensus binding site for Gcn4p defined by computational analysis of the set of promoters that bind Gcn4p in a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (analysis by W. Wang and H. Li, unpublished data; chromatin immunoprecipitations in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Lee2">Lee et al. 2002b</xref>).

The match between UPRE-2 and the Gcn4p consensus is imperfect (five of seven positions), suggesting that the association with Gcn4p and UPR promoters is not identical to the binding of Gcn4p to its &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; amino acid starvation targets. Rather, these observations suggest that the proposed Gcn4p/Hac1p heterodimeric complex binds to a composite site, of which UPRE-1 and UPRE-2 represent different forms with stronger relative affinities to Hac1p and Gcn4p, respectively. Such a model would explain the residual upregulation of UPRE-1-containing genes in a &#x00394;<italic>gcn2</italic> mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, histogram <italic>j</italic>), which retains some expression of Gcn4p. In the absence of Hac1p but in the presence of high concentrations of Gcn4p (e.g., when <italic>GCN4</italic> is overexpressed), Gcn4p can bind the UPRE-2 on its own, either as a homodimer or a monomer.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Upregulation of Gcn4p by ER Stress</title><p>The transient upregulation of Gcn4p levels, which we observe upon UPR induction, may therefore serve to increase the transcriptional output of the response, especially early in the response. Most UPR target genes are robustly induced after 15 min of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Travers1">Travers et al. 2000</xref>); hence, the increase in Gcn4p levels occurs at a time suggestive of a role in the initial response.</p><p>Gcn4p itself mediates a broad transcriptional program in response to a diverse set of cellular conditions and stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Natarajan1">Natarajan et al. 2001</xref>). The recruitment of Gcn4p therefore provides an opportunity for crosstalk between regulatory pathways and fine-tuning of the magnitude of the UPR. For example, under amino acid starvation, Gcn4p levels are high relative to the baseline of normal growth. In this state, cells with accumulated unfolded ER protein might wish to upregulate ER-associated protein degradation (one output of the UPR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Casagrande1">Casagrande et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Friedlander1">Friedlander et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Travers1">Travers et al. 2000</xref>) beyond the level normally provided by the UPR. Such a mechanism might provide for an additional source of amino acids through protein catabolism. Elevated Gcn4p levels and the concomitant increased induction of UPR target genes would serve this need. This view raises the possibility that those genes that most stringently require <italic>GCN4</italic> for normal UPR induction are those that are most urgently required by the cell under specific conditions, under which UPR is induced <italic>and</italic> Gcn4p levels are high for reasons unrelated to ER stress.

According to the circuit diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g008">Figure 8</xref>A, <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA splicing retains its role as the &#x0201c;switch&#x0201d; that turns the UPR on or off. Gcn4p, whose levels appear to be limiting for the extent of gene regulation, would therefore play a role in setting the &#x0201c;gain&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;volume&#x0201d; of the response, perhaps allowing communication from other stress response pathways in the cell. Such a gain control could serve as an adjunct to the &#x0201c;Super-UPR&#x0201d; (S-UPR) gain control described in the accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Leber1">Leber et al. 2004</xref>), whereby an <italic>IRE1-</italic>independent ER surveillance mechanism regulates the transcription of the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA in response to compound stresses on the secretory pathway. S-UPR induction proceeds unimpaired in &#x00394;<italic>gcn4</italic> cells, indicating that the S-UPR is mechanistically distinct from the regulation described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Leber1">Leber et al. 2004</xref>). Whereas the S-UPR monitors conditions of the ER, the <italic>GCN4</italic> branch would integrate information gleaned from the cytosol. Both of these gain controls have the potential to act not only as modulators of the magnitude of the response but also as a tuning dial: UPR targets respond differentially to increased level of <italic>HAC1</italic> during the S-UPR (see the Class 1, 2, and 3 genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g006">Figure 6</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Leber1">Leber et al. &#x0005b;2004&#x0005d;</xref>). Likewise, different UPR targets exhibit differential dependence on Gcn4p, as is apparent from the variable upregulation of UPR targets in &#x00394;<italic>gcn4</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>gcn2</italic> mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020246-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

Hac1p can bind to the known UPREs, but by itself forms a protein&#x02013;DNA complex that is not competent to upregulate transcription. Gcn4p, which is present at a basal level in cells under normal growth conditions as a result of baseline Gcn2p activity, is unable to bind UPREs in the absence of Hac1p. Gcn4p may bind some UPRE sequences, providing a weak bypass of Hac1p, when it is present at physiologically elevated levels. When Hac1p is produced, Gcn4p is recruited to the UPRE, presumably forming a more stable ternary complex containing promoter DNA, Gcn4p, and Hac1p, and transcription is induced. This ternary complex could be established serially, in which case an inactive Hac1p/UPRE complex would be recognized by Gcn4p, or by recognition of the UPRE by a preformed heterodimer of Gcn4p and Hac1p.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Conservation between Yeast and Mammalian UPR</title><p>Advances in the understanding of the metazoan UPR system has been richly informed by the study of yeast. The elucidation of a role for Gcn4p in the yeast UPR allows us to draw even stronger parallels between the yeast and metazoan systems. In higher eukaryotes, the ER-resident transmembrane kinase PERK is activated by protein unfolding. PERK's cytosolic domain is homologous to Gcn2p and likewise phosphorylates eIF-2&#x003b1;, thereby downregulating general translation but also promoting the selective translation of mRNAs containing upstream ORFs in their 5&#x02032; UTR sequences. One of these mRNAs encodes ATF-4, a bZIP transcription factor that represents the metazoan ortholog of Gcn4p. Intriguingly, and in strict analogy to the joint action of Gcn4p and Hac1p proposed here, ATF-4 in metazoan cells collaborates with the Hac1p ortholog XBP-1 to stimulate UPR target gene transcription.</p><p>The analogies between the roles of Gcn4p/Hac1p/Gcn2p and ATF-4/XBP-1/PERK suggest that the function of these proteins has been amazingly conserved in the UPR, although the nature of the connections between pathway components may have been adapted over evolutionary time: Yeast does not have an identified PERK ortholog that feeds ER-derived information into the <italic>GCN4</italic> branch of the network.

Nonetheless, the addition to the repertoire of the yeast UPR effectors of an additional transcription factor (Gcn4p) and of a mechanism for transcriptional regulation of Hac1p (S-UPR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Leber1">Leber et al. 2004</xref>) suggests that the UPR functions as a regulatory network, with its opportunities for crosstalk with other pathways and regulation by cellular state. But most importantly, both the central players and the connectivity of the circuits involved appear to be conserved among eukaryotes and evolutionarily ancient.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Computational and quantitative methods</title><p>To build the dictionary of putative regulatory elements for UPR target genes, we first extracted the 600-bp upstream regions of all UPR target genes. To get rid of simple repeats unlikely to be regulatory elements (such as AT-rich repeats and transposable elements), we removed exact repeats of lengths 15 bp or longer, and kept the remaining fragments of lengths longer than 50 bp. What remained was the input sequence for the dictionary construction. We used the MobyDick algorithm based on probabilistic segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Bussemaker2">Bussemaker et al. 2000b</xref>) to build a dictionary of putative regulatory elements. MobyDick builds the dictionary by iterating through fitting and testing steps.

We normalized the scores to fall between 0 and 1 by the largest score.

Regulation of Gcn4p levels by Gcn2p under changing cellular conditions adds an additional layer of gain control. Together, activity levels of Hac1p, Gcn4p, and the proposed UPR modulatory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020246-Leber1">Leber et al. 2004</xref>) collaborate to determine the magnitude of the transcriptional output signal.</p><p>(B) Mechanism of Gcn4p/Hac1p action at target promoters. In the absence of Hac1p, Gcn4p is present in the cell as a consequence of baseline activity of Gcn2p. At normal concentrations, Gcn4p is unable to bind or activate a target UPRE, but it may bind when Gcn4p levels are elevated. Upon induction of the UPR, Ire1p is activated and Hac1 is synthesized. Hac1p can bind, but not activate, target UPREs. Binding of target DNA by a Gcn4p/Hac1p heterodimer results in a transcriptionally active complex. Gcn4p levels are upregulated under UPR induction, perhaps as a consequence of stabilization by interaction with Hac1p.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020246.g008"/></fig><table-wrap id="pbio-0020246-t001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Yeast Strains</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020246.t001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="pbio-0020246-t002" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Yeast Plasmids</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020246.t002"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest.</bold> The authors declare that no conflicts of interest exist.</p></fn><fn id="n2" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> CP and PW conceived and designed the experiments.
