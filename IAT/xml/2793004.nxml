Microarray analysis of gene expression revealed that some genes involved in the immune response, small GTPase regulation, transcription, cell adhesion and the regulation of exocytosis were significantly up and down regulated in cells from CHM patients compared to controls. Finally, CHM fibroblasts secreted significantly lower levels of cytokine/growth factors such as macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) beta and interleukin (lL)-8.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We demonstrated for the first time that peripheral cells of CHM patients had increased pH levels in lysosomes, reduced rates of proteolytic degradation and altered secretion of cytokines.

Biotin-labeled cRNA was then synthesized from double-stranded cDNA using the BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Santa Clara, CA). cRNA was purified using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA) and fragmented into 35&#x02013;200 base pair fragments by metal-induced hydrolysis (200 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8.2, 500 mM KOAc, 150 mM MgOAc) at 94&#x000b0;C for 35 minutes. Fifteen micrograms of fragmented biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized onto Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for 16 h at 45&#x000b0;C and 60 rpm. GeneChips were then washed and stained as per the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). This procedure includes the removal of non-hybridized material. Staining was then performed with phycoerythrin-streptavidin and signal amplification by a second staining with biotinylated anti-streptavadin and phycoerythrin-streptavidin. Fluorescence from hybridized cRNA was detected using the Hewlett-Packard GS2500 Gene Array Scanner. Quality control measures included a requirement that scaling factors, percent of genes called present, average intensity, background values, housekeeping 3&#x02032;/5&#x02032; ratios and measured intensities of spiked-in controls all fall within predefined ranges.

Relative changes in gene expression were calculated using a variation of the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method. This method first subtracts from the gene threshold cycle (Ct) value, the average of the Ct values of 5 housekeeping genes (B2M, HPRT1, RPL13A, GAPDH, and ACTB), yielding a &#x00394;Ct value normalized to the RNA amounts for each of the four conditions studied.

Cells containing pHrodo-TM Bioparticles-R, DQ-ovalbumin-BODYPY FL-dye or collagen-coated FluoSpheres were analyzed with BD FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Appropriate gating of forward and side scatter excluded dead cells, unincorporated particles, and debris.

Signal intensity values were normalized using an adaptive variance stabilizing, quantile-transformation named S10 (PJ Munson, GeneLogic Workshop of Low Level Analysis of Affymetrix GeneChip Data, 2001, software available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://abs.cit.nih.gov/MSCLtoolbox">http://abs.cit.nih.gov/MSCLtoolbox</ext-link>). In order to apply statistical tests to the data, the variance of the replicates should be nearly uniform over the range of expression levels. The S10 transformation approximates a common logarithm transform over the central working range of the assay and thus differences of S10-transformed data values can be interpreted as log ratios or simply &#x0201c;log-fold changes&#x0201d;. A major advantage of this approach over the ordinary log-ratio is that changes in S10-transformed values have a uniform variance over the full expression scale.

For example, human RPE cultures models would be hard to obtain from CHM patients, and further culture and manipulate. The use of peripheral cells and primary cultures derived from CHM patients could be extremely helpful since the existing paradigm for CHM pathogenesis is lacking a number of key data regarding the tissue specificity of REP-1 regulation.

Previous studies have suggested that the reduction or absence of REP1 could have a variable effect on the prenylation of Rabs and therefore could affect different aspects of the trafficking in the RPE and other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Seabra1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Corbeel1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Tolmachova1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>We hypothesized that underprenylation of certain Rabs would probably influence the pH level in lysosomes, and exocytosis/secretion of cells. Indeed knock down of the CHM gene resulted in an increase in the secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) by human fetal RPE cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Gordiyenko1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. These cells, while maintaining a polarity in culture, secreted more MCP-1 and IL-8 to both apical and basal compartments in culture. In contrast, fibroblasts from CHM patients, when compared to normal controls, secreted significantly lower levels of MCP-1, PEDF, TNF-alpha, FGF and IL-8. Differences observed between the secretion patterns of the human fetal RPE after REP-1 knock down and peripheral cells from CHM patients could be explained by: (1) the differences in physiology of adult and fetal tissues, (2) the difference in prenylation levels of specific Rab proteins in RPE and other cell types leading to differences in the regulation of secretion in different tissues. These effects of relative absence of REP-1 and absence of REP-1 on secretion have not been previously reported. Differences in the regulation of secretion between the different cell types with reduced/absent levels of REP-1 could explain the tissue specific degeneration that occurs in choroideremia. For example, Rab27a plays a crucial role in the exocytosis of lytic granules in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and Rab27b is a key regulator of dense granule secretion in platelets and other secretary cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Izumi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Tolmachova2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Tolmachova3">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Stinchcombe1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Izumi2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Rab27 is also present at high levels in the RPE and choriocapillaris and its under-prenylation could contribute to the degenerative process. Interestingly, whereas Rab27 is also expressed in a variety of secretary and neuronal cells involved in synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Gomi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Mizuno1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Menager1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Fukuda1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Fukuda2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>; neuronal degeneration, outside the retina, has not been reported in CHM patients. Increased exocytic activity of damaged RPE cells has been proposed to play a role in the development of AMD and the retinal degeneration due to the chloroquine toxicity. Possibly the disordered cell function observed in fibroblasts and monocytes from CHM patients represents a subclinical CHM phenotype that was not previously recognized and offers the opportunity for further research.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Different Mutations in CHM Gene Could Affect mRNA and Protein Stability</title><p>Mutated forms of REP-1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008402-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>), except L550P, were all visibly absent in primary fibroblasts and monocytes derived from CHM patients. Of interest, 4 mutations in the <italic>CHM</italic> gene (I460X, Y504 X, L550P and I553X) occur in domain 2 (residues 93&#x02013;270 and 447&#x02013;553), almost the same area of the &#x003b2;-sheet formed by residues 546&#x02013;556, 450&#x02013;460, 500&#x02013;515 shown in cyan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008402-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A, B</bold></xref>).

We hypothesized that the position of the mutation could significantly influence the stability of REP-1 and the severity of the CHM phenotype. Since the CHM RPE cells are not available for study, fibroblasts and monocytes from patients are the only viable models of CHM that allow genotype/phenotype correlations to be drawn; correlating individual mutations with cellular defects and the clinical severity of the disease. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-vandenHurk1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-MacDonald3">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Surprisingly, we did not see a compensatory increase in the protein and RNA levels of REP-2 in fibroblasts or monocytes from CHM patients. REP-2 expression was uniformly found to be very low. In addition, we observed a significant difference (more than 10 fold) in the levels of REP-1 mRNA in peripheral tissues of patients carrying different CHM mutations. Some patients' cells demonstrated REP-1 mRNA levels similar to control; however, in others the mRNA levels were quite low. Generally, low levels of CHM mRNA could be explained by nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008402-Rebbapragada1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, differences in mRNA levels between CHM patients could be determined by the position of mutations in REP-1 that may or may not target the mRNA for nonsense-mediated decay. This observation could lead to treatment strategies for patients, including chaperone molecules to prevent RNA degradation or small molecules that force the read through of premature stop codons in the <italic>CHM</italic> gene.</p><p>To date, no clinical studies have reported the effect of different mutations in the <italic>CHM</italic> gene on tissues other than the eye. Our observations indicate that despite the variety of mutations found in CHM patients, in each case the effect of the mutation was the same in disordering trafficking and exocytosis in fibroblasts and monocytes. As well, the retinal phenotype of these patients was typical of the spectrum expected at the various ages of the patients. The peripheral tissues of CHM patients will be useful models that reflect the defects in trafficking that underlie this retinal phenotype and provide additional data to explain the mechanism REP-1 compensation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the personnel of the NEI clinic with sample collection and the patients who generously agreed to undergo testing and provide blood and tissue samples.
