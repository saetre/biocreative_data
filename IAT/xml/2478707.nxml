To gain an overall insight into the entire CCCH zinc finger gene family and to evaluate their potential role in macrophage activation, here we performed a genome-wide survey of CCCH zinc finger genes in mouse and human. Totally 58 CCCH zinc finger genes in mouse and 55 in human were identified and most of them have not been reported previously.

In addition to host defense, activated macrophages play a central role in atherogenesis, autoimmunity, and a variety of inflammatory diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Burke1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Ma1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Much attention has focused on the pro-inflammatory signaling in activated macrophages but little is known about the mechanisms that negatively control inflammation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the inflammatory processes in macrophages is essential for development of novel drug therapies against inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis.</p><p>Previously, we have identified a novel CCCH zinc finger protein, which was significantly induced by MCP-1 in human monocytes and thus designated as MCP-induced protein (MCPIP), as negative regulator of macrophage activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Zhou1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Liang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The CCCH-zinc finger was originally identified in tristetraprolin (TTP, also known as Zfp36) family, which contains four members Zfp36, Zfp36l1, Zfp36l2 and Zfp36l3. This protein family contains two tandem CCCH-zinc fingers and binds to AU-rich elements (ARE) in mRNA, leading to the removal of the poly(A) tail from that mRNA and increased rates of mRNA turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Carballo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Lai1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. TTP-deficient mice developed a systemic inflammatory syndrome with severe polyarticular arthritis and autoimmunity, as well as medullary and extramedullary myeloid hyperplasia due to excess circulating TNF&#x003b1;, resulting from the increased stability of the TNF&#x003b1; mRNA and subsequent higher rates of secretion of the cytokine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Taylor1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Zfp36l2, like its better-known relative Zfp36, is also a mRNA-binding and destabilizing protein and functions in the physiological control of female fertility at the level of early embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Ramos1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP, also known as Zc3h2), which is also a CCCH-type zinc finger protein, can directly bind to specific viral RNA sequences through its CCCH zinc finger motifs and cause profound and specific loss of viral mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Gao1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Guo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Rc3h1 (also known as Roquin) is a conserved protein containing both a ring-finger and a CCCH-type zinc finger. Recent studies revealed that roquin repressed autoimmunity by limiting inducible T-cell co-stimulator mRNA through promoting its degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Vinuesa1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Yu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these studies imply that CCCH zinc finger proteins may be critical regulators in immunity and inflammatory response.</p><p>To gain an overall insight into the entire CCCH zinc finger gene family and to evaluate their potential role in macrophage activation, we first performed a genome-wide survey of CCCH zinc finger genes in mouse and human. 58 CCCH zinc finger genes total in mouse and 55 in human were identified and most of them have not been reported previously. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the mouse CCCH zinc finger family was divided into 6 groups. Meanwhile, we employed quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) to profile their tissue expression patterns in adult mice. Cluster analysis showed that most of CCCH genes were broadly expressed in all of tissues examined with various levels. Interestingly, several CCCH genes were enriched in macrophage-related organs such as thymus, spleen, lung, intestine and adipose. Consistently, a comprehensive assessment of changes in expression of the 58 members of the mouse CCCH zinc finger family during macrophage activation also revealed that these CCCH zinc finger genes were associated with the activation of bone marrow-derived macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This study not only identified a functional module of CCCH zinc finger genes in the regulation of macrophage activation but also provided the framework for future studies to dissect the function of this emerging gene family.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of CCCH zinc finger gene family in mouse and human</title><p>The previous research revealed that CCCH zinc finger protein contained 1&#x02013;6 copies of CCCH-type zinc finger motifs characterized by three Cys and one His. Berg et al. defined that the CCCH family is a group of zinc-finger protein consisting of canonical C-X<sub>6&#x02013;14</sub>-C-X<sub>4&#x02013;5</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Berg1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. After analysis of entire CCCH family in Arabidopsis and rice, Wang et al. re-defined that the CCCH proteins are characterized by one to six C-X<sub>4&#x02013;15</sub>-C-X<sub>4&#x02013;6</sub>-C-X<sub>3</sub>-H motifs which are glycine-rich and phenylalanine-rich sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Wang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. To uncover the entire CCCH family in mouse and human, we first searched several database including EMBL-EBI, Pfam and SMART using the terms &#x0201c;CCCH-type zinc finger&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;C3H-type zinc finger&#x0201d;. Then, we used the CCCH motif sequences from defined CCCH proteins as our query to BLAST the non-redundant protein database at GenBank. After carefully checked the sequences and removed the redundancies, a total of 58 mouse genes encoded CCCH zinc finger containing proteins were identified and listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002880-t001">Table 1</xref>. 55 human counterparts were also identified (data not shown). Three CCCH genes BC003883, BC019429 and Zfp36l3 were only found in murine genome, but not human. Out of the 58 mouse CCCH zinc finger proteins, 32 proteins were totally unknown. Among the other 26 known proteins, 20 proteins have been reported to be involved in RNA metabolisms including pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA transportation, subcellular localization, and stability/degradation, such as TTP family, CPSF4 family, muscleblind like family and U2af family etc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Carballo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Barabino1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Zhang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

finger proteins</title><p>To evaluate the evolutionary relationships within the mouse CCCH gene family, we performed a phylogenetic analysis by using the software of &#x0201c;MegAlign&#x0201d; from DNASTAR Inc. As shown by the neighbor-joining tree that was constructed based on the alignment of the amino acid sequences of the CCCH proteins, the mouse CCCH zinc finger family can be divided into six groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002880-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). When using different method (e.g. MEGA4.0) to construct the tree, similar results were consistently reproduced. While many proteins belonged to same subfamily were clustered into same groups as expected, other proteins, previously not recognized as same subfamily, were clustered together, suggesting that they may belong to same subfamily. For example, BC003883 may form a subfamily with U2af1 and U2af1l4. Zc3h3 may be belonged to Cpsf4 subfamily. Zc3h4, Zc3h6 and Zc3h8 may form another subfamily. Interestingly, Zc3h12 family was clustered into same group with Zfp36 family and Rc3h family, suggesting that they may share similar functional features. In fact, they are all involved in the regulation of immunity and macrophage inflammation.</p><fig id="pone-0002880-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002880.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic analysis of 58 mouse CCCH genes.</title><p>The unrooted neighbor-joining tree was constructed based on the alignment of the full-length amino acid sequences of 58 mouse CCCH proteins using ClustalW from DNASTAR.

For example, Rbm22, Rbm26, Rbm27, BC003883, U2af1, U2af1l4, Zrsr1 and Zrsr2 contain 1&#x02013;2 RNA-recognized motifs, suggesting that they may bind to RNA and involve in RNA processing. Indeed, U2af1 is a small subunit of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor and play important role in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Kanadia1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Many CCCH proteins such as Helz, Nkn1, Ppp1r10, Prr3, Rbm22, Rbm26, Rbm27, Rc3h1, Zc3h12a, Zfp36, Zfp36l2, Zc3h4, Zc3h6 and Zc3h10 contain 1&#x02013;2 proline-rich domains. Proline-rich domain usually mediates protein-protein interaction, suggesting that those proteins may form a complex with other proteins and performed distinct functions. In consistent with the phylogenetic analysis above, the proteins in same family displayed similar domain architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002880-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). For example, Zc3h12 family members all contain a single CCCH zinc finger motif at the middle region. Rc3h1 and Rc3h2 contain a single CCCH motif at the middle region and a ring-finger at N-terminal. In addition, the evidence that BC003883 has much similar domain architecture with U2af1 and U2af1l4 further supports the family prediction based on the phylogenetic analysis above.</p><fig id="pone-0002880-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002880.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Schematic structures of 58 mouse CCCH proteins.</title><p>The figure is schematic structures of 58 CCCH zinc finger proteins identified in mouse.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002880-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, 25 CCCH proteins contain single CCCH motif. The other 33 CCCH proteins contain two or multiple CCCH motifs. To further determine the sequence features of these CCCH motifs, we performed phylogenetic analysis based on the alignment of the amino acid sequences of the CCCH zinc finger motifs. Since the multiple motifs in same protein are usually similar and have redundant function, the first CCCH motif in these proteins was selected for analysis. In addition, several well-studied CCCH motifs from other species such as HUA1 and AtCPSF30 (from plant), NAB2 and Zfs1 (from yeast), MEX-5 and PIE-1 (from worm) and Clipper (from fly) were also imported. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002880-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, the tree topology, as well as the subfamily organization, was much similar to that constructed from the full-length CCCH proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002880-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). As expected, the proteins within same subfamily exhibit the common CCCH motifs, suggesting the major functional role of CCCH motif in these proteins. Consistently, BC003883 shared a similar CCCH motif with U2af1 and U2af1l4, and Zc3h4, Zc3h6 and Zc3h8 were clustered into one subfamily, further supporting that they may be from same subfamily and may have similar function. Interestingly, three putative orthologs (BC019429 and HUA1, Helz and PIE-1, Zc3h11a and Clipper) were identified in the tree.

According to the expression profiles, CCCH genes can be classified into three groups. The largest group including 44 CCCH genes was broadly expressed in more than half but not all tissues with various expression levels. The other two groups were much smaller, but displayed distinct distribution patterns.

The third group including Mbnl3, Zfp36l2, Zfp36, Zc3h12a, Zc3h12d, Zc3h7a and Leng9 was highly enriched in macrophage-related organs such as spleen, lung, intestine, thymus, aorta and adipose tisuue, suggesting that they may involve in the regulation of innate immunity and inflammatory response.

According to the expression profiles, CCCH genes can be classified into three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002880-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The largest group including 29 CCCH genes was constantly expressed during the time course of macrophage activation. Interestingly, 11 members of CCCH proteins were significantly increased during macrophage activation with distinct patterns. Mkrn3, Nupl2, Mkrn2 and Ppp1r10 obtained first peak at 2 hours, then declined to basal level at 8 hours, but increased again at 16 hours of stimulation. Zc3h4, Zfp36, Zc3h7a and Tiparp were transient induced within 4 hours and then declined in the remained time. Remarkably, Zc3h12a, Zc3h12c and Leng9 shared similar expression patterns with several macrophage activation markers such as TNF&#x003b1;, MCP-1, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, which dramatically increased at 4 hours and sustained at least for 24 hours.

The objective of this study is to comprehensively and non-redundantly identify all of mouse and human CCCH zinc finger genes on a whole-genome scale, and subsequently to obtain a global view of this gene family in the context of macrophage activation. As a consequence of whole genome searching, totally 58 CCCH genes were identified in mouse and 55 in human. The family size of human and mouse CCCH genes is smaller than the size of CCCH gene family in Arabidopsis and rice, which contain 68 and 67 members respectively. Although most of CCCH proteins are less characterized, some CCCH proteins play important roles in many cellular processes especially RNA metabolism. For example, Cpsf4 and U2af1 are important components in the protein complex controlling pre-mRNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Barabino1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Zhang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Three CCCH genes BC003883, BC019429 and Zfp36l3 were only found in murine genome, but not human. In addition, ZC3H11B does not exist in mouse, but exist in human as a pseudogene and not analyzed in this study.</p><p>Based on the amino acid sequence alignment, the whole CCCH gene family can be divided into 6 groups. Some subfamilies were clustered into same groups, suggesting that they may have some functional association. For example, Zc3h12 family was consistently to cluster into same group with Zfp36 family by full-length protein sequences or CCCH motif sequences, strongly suggesting these two families may share some similar functional features. Indeed, both Zfp36 and Zc3h12a are important regulators in macrophage inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Liang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Carballo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, our recent work showed that Zc3h12a also feedback regulated macrophage inflammation by a distinct mechanism.

The other interesting finding is several new subfamilies have been identified by clustering analysis and domain architecture assembly. BC003883 may be a new member of U2af1 family and also functions as a splicing factor. Zc3h1 may belong to same subfamily with Zc3h2 (also known as ZAP) and Zc3hav1l.

The question is what CCCH motif really does? Traditionally, zinc finger proteins are regarded as DNA-binding proteins. Recent studies demonstrated that zinc fingers can also mediate interaction to RNA, protein and even lipids. However, emerging evidence revealed that, as an unusual family of zinc finger proteins, the CCCH-type zinc finger proteins mainly bind to RNA and, therefore, facilitate their metabolism or processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Brown1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Hall1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, the structure analysis revealed that each CCCH zinc finger module from Zfp36l1 binds to the sequence UAUU; thus, the tandem zinc fingers bind to UAUU-UAUU. This sequence is remarkably similar to the nonamer (UUAUUUAUU) that was identified as the functional ARE motif in biochemical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Hudson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest that CCCH-zinc finger may be a novel RNA-binding motif. However, there is also evidence that some CCCH zinc finger motifs bind to DNA or proteins. For example, Zc3h8 (also known as fetal liver zinc finger protein 1, Fliz1) directly binds to a regulatory element located within the first intron of GATA-3 gene through its CCCH motifs and strongly represses GATA-3 transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Hwang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Niu et al. used chromosome immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrate that Zc3h12a (also known as Mcpip) binds to the promoters of cadherin 12 and cadherin 19 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Niu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The Arabidopsis CPSF30 ortholog, AtCPSF30, possesses an unexpected endonucleolytic activity to selectively degrade RNA, which also contains three copies of CCCH motifs. Surprisingly, mutation in the first CCCH motif of the protein abolish RNA binding by AtCPSF30 but have no discernible effects on nuclease activity. In contrast, mutations in the third CCCH motif eliminate nuclease activity of the protein, suggesting that even in the same protein different CCCH motifs may play different but coordinative roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Addepalli1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, CCCH motif primarily mediates RNA binding and involves in RNA metabolism. However, it may also bind to DNA or proteins and exert transcriptional regulation or specific enzymatic activity.</p><p>To further understand the function of the whole CCCH gene family, we utilized QPCR to profile their expression patterns in 16 adult mouse tissues. The advantage of using QPCR-expression profiling of selected gene arrays to study complex physiologic as well as pathophysiologic processes was recognized previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Bookout1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Barish1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Cluster analysis revealed that most of CCCH genes were broadly expressed in almost all tissues examined with various expression levels. Interestingly to note that several CCCH genes including Zc3h12a, Zc3h12b, Zc3h12c, Zc3hav1l, Tiparp and Zc3h7a were clustered in same group, which were highly enriched in macrophage-related organs such as spleen, thymus, lung, intestine and colon. To further evaluate the potential involvement of the entire CCCH family in macrophage activation, we used QPCR to assess their dynamic expression changes during LPS-induced macrophage activation. Although most of CCCH genes were expressed in macrophages, 23 CCCH genes showed dynamic expression changes during the time course of LPS-stimulated macrophage activation. Interestingly, the group enriched in macrophage-related organs including Zc3h12a, Zc3h12d, Zfp36l2, Zc3h7a, leng9 and Mbnl3 displayed dynamic expression patterns during macrophage activation, strongly suggesting that they may play important role in the regulation of macrophage activation.</p><p>The extremely interesting family is Zc3h12 family, which was clustered into same group with Zfp36 family based on the amino acid alignment of both full-length proteins and CCCH motifs. Zc3h12a (also designated as MCPIP) was significantly increased in ischemic heart and promoted cell apoptosis, and mediated MCP-1 induced angiogenesis, suggesting that it may be an important player in human ischemic heart disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Zhou1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Niu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Our recent studies also demonstrated that at least one member of this family Zc3h12a strongly inhibited macrophage activation by repressing NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Liang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, Liang and Fu, unpublished data. However, how it exerts this action or does any RNA component involve in this process is under investigation. Recent report showed that overexpression of Zc3h12D (also designated as p34) exerts tumor suppressor function and an A/G SNP of Zc3h12D was associated with lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002880-Wang2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering NF-&#x003ba;B signaling is over-activated in most of cancer, it would be extremely interesting to observe whether Zc3h12D is also a negative regulator of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling.</p><p>In summary, we have identified the whole CCCH gene family. Through unbiased clustering analysis, several new subfamilies previously not recognized were discovered. The quantitative expression profiles of whole gene family both in normal mouse tissues and across the course of macrophage activation not only help to identify a functional module of CCCH zinc finger genes in the regulation of macrophage activation but also provide the framework for future studies to dissect the function of this emerging family.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Identification of CCCH-zinc finger protein family in mouse and human</title><p>To identify the entire CCCH protein family across whole genome, we first searched several protein databases EMBL-EBI, SMART, and Pfam using the terms &#x0201c;CCCH-type zinc finger&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;C3H-type zinc finger&#x0201d;.
