Fusion must be regulated so that carrier vesicles only fuse with the appropriate acceptor compartment. This control is exerted on several levels by a variety of regulatory proteins including SM proteins, Rab proteins, and tethering complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McNew, 2008</xref>). Additionally, specific interactions between SNARE proteins are an important factor in the specificity of vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sollner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McNew et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>SNARE proteins are the core machinery of intracellular membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). They are characterized by a &#x0223c;60 amino acid domain (the SNARE domain) through which they form heterooligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weimbs et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, most SNARE proteins contain a C-terminal transmembrane domain adjacent to the SNARE domain. Interaction of a SNARE protein anchored in the vesicle membrane (a v-SNARE) with SNARE proteins in the target membrane (t-SNAREs) leads to the assembly of the SNARE domains into a parallel four-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poirier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). Bundle formation drives the transmembrane domains of the SNAREs into close proximity and is proposed to provide the potential energy necessary to allow mixing and fusion of the lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Discrete SNARE complexes control fusion at every level of the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pelham, 1999</xref>). This has led to the suggestion that assembly of cognate SNAREs into exclusive complexes could be a central mechanism for the control of vesicle fusion in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sollner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McNew et al., 2000</xref>). Though isolated SNARE domains show little or no binding specificity in vitro, when full-length SNAREs are reconstituted into synthetic liposomes, only specific combinations can mediate fusion of the artificial bilayers, suggesting that this could be the basis for in vivo control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McNew et al., 2000</xref>). However, many SNAREs have been found to participate in more than one fusion event in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Parlati et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paumet et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2004</xref>), again raising the question of how the participation of an individual SNARE in a particular fusion event is regulated.</p><p>The process of sporulation in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> provides a useful model in which to address the question of SNARE specificity. During sporulation, fusion of post-Golgi vesicles with the plasma membrane stops, and instead these vesicles are directed to specific sites in the cytoplasm where they fuse to form new membrane compartments termed prospore membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Neiman, 1998</xref>). One prospore membrane envelops each of the four nuclei produced by meiosis, packaging the nuclei into four daughter cells or spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Neiman, 2005</xref>). In concert with this change in the target compartment of exocytic vesicles comes a change in one of the SNARE proteins required for their fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Neiman, 1998</xref>).</p><p>In vegetative cells, vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane use a SNARE complex that is composed of one of two redundant t-SNAREs Sso1 or Sso2, a second t-SNARE subunit, Sec9, and one of two redundant v-SNARE proteins Snc1 or Snc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aalto et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Protopopov et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brennwald et al., 1994</xref>). Sec9 is a member of the SNAP25 subfamily of SNARE proteins, which differ from other SNAREs in that they lack a transmembrane domain but contain two SNARE helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oyler et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brennwald et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weimbs et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, a SNARE complex acting at the plasma membrane contains one helix from Sso1 or Sso2, one helix from Snc1 or Snc2, and two helices from Sec9. During sporulation, when exocytic vesicles fuse to generate a prospore membrane, the SNARE complex used is slightly different. Sso1 is required for this fusion, but Sso2 does not function in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jantti et al., 2002</xref>). An <italic>sso1</italic> single mutant, though normal for vegetative secretion, is completely blocked in fusion during sporulation. Direct evidence that Snc1 or Snc2 function at the prospore membrane has not been reported, but a role for these v-SNAREs has been inferred by their localization to the prospore membrane during sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neiman et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, the most notable difference is that the t-SNARE Sec9 is not required for fusion at the prospore membrane. Rather, it is replaced by a second sporulation-specific SNAP25 family member, the Spo20 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Neiman, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Sec9 and Spo20 are specialized for their sites of action. Ectopic expression of <italic>SPO20</italic> in vegetative cells cannot rescue the growth defect of a <italic>sec9-4<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutant at 37&#x000b0;C, nor can overexpression of <italic>SEC9</italic> during sporulation restore sporulation to a <italic>spo20</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Neiman, 1998</xref>). Chimera studies indicated that the basis of specificity is different for each protein. The ability of Spo20 to work at the prospore membrane requires a lipid-binding motif in its N-terminal domain that is not present in Sec9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Neiman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nakanishi et al., 2004</xref>). Targeting of Sec9 to the prospore membrane allows it to largely compensate for loss of <italic>SPO20</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakanishi et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the ability of Sec9 to function at the plasma membrane is a property of its SNARE domains. Forms of Spo20 in which the SNARE domains are substituted with those of Sec9 can replace <italic>SEC9</italic> in vegetative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neiman et al., 2000</xref>). Changes in genes involved in lipid metabolism were also found to promote the function of Spo20 in vegetative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coluccio et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, in vitro experiments comparing Sso1/Sec9&#x02013;Snc2 and Sso1/Spo20&#x02013;Snc2 complexes demonstrated that the Spo20-containing assemblies are less potent fusogens and that the stability of the assembled complexes is lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). These results suggest that the inability of Spo20 to function at the plasma membrane may be a function of it forming complexes that provide insufficient binding energy to overcome a barrier to fusion at that compartment.</p><p>An assembled SNARE complex incorporates sixteen interfaces where the side chains from all four helices pack together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). The packing interactions are primarily hydrophobic contacts, except at the central or &#x0201c;zero layer&#x0201d; interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). There, the interaction is mediated by polar binding between conserved glutamine and arginine side chains. Most SNARE complexes conform to a 3Q:1R rule, i.e., at the zero layer, three glutamine residues interact with one arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fasshauer et al., 1998</xref>). In the yeast plasma membrane SNARE, Sso1/Sso2 and both helices from Sec9 contain a glutamine residue, and Snc1/Snc2 provides the arginine residue. If the central layer glutamine in Sso1 is mutated to arginine, this mutant form of Sso1 is not functional; however, function can be restored by coexpression of a form of Snc2 in which the arginine has been changed to glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Katz and Brennwald, 2000</xref>). Such compensatory Q/R mutations also work in other SNARE complexes and have been used to demonstrate that specific pairs of SNARE proteins function together in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Graf et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The interpretation of the Spo20 experiments described above assumes that the Snc1/Snc2 proteins function as the v-SNARE for fusion at the prospore membrane. To test this, we sought to use compensatory Q/R mutations in the SNARE domains of Sso1 and Snc2 to demonstrate a direct role of Snc2 during sporulation. We report here that strains carrying an Sso1<sup>Q224R</sup> mutation failed to sporulate, and that compensatory mutations in none of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> R-SNAREs can rescue this sporulation defect. Sporulation is reduced by mutation of the central layer glutamine of Sso1 to any other residue, whereas vegetative growth is largely unaffected by these changes. The sensitivity of sporulation to changes in the Sso1 ionic layer residue, we show, is due to the presence of Spo20 in the prospore membrane SNARE complex. Co-expression of a Spo20 chimera carrying the Sec9 SNARE helices with the Snc2<sup>R52Q</sup> allele rescues the sporulation defect of the <italic>sso1</italic><sup>Q224R</sup> mutant. Mutation of two residues located at binding interfaces in the SNARE domain of Spo20 to the corresponding residue in Sec9 allows Spo20 to function in concert with Sso1<sup>Q224R</sup> and Snc2<sup>R52Q</sup> proteins. This mutant form of Spo20 also shows enhanced ability to rescue <italic>sec9-4<sup>ts</sup></italic> in vegetative cells. In vitro, the mutant Spo20 forms tighter complexes with Sso1 and Snc2 and is a more efficient fusogen than the wild-type protein. These results demonstrate that the intrinsic binding energy of the SNARE domains can help control the specificity of vesicle fusion in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Compensatory mutations in Snc2 cannot rescue the sporulation defect of a mutation in the Sso1 central ionic layer</title><p>Prospore membrane formation requires the t-SNAREs Sso1p and Spo20p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Neiman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jantti et al., 2002</xref>). Though the v-SNAREs Snc1p and Snc2p localize to the prospore membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neiman et al., 2000</xref>), direct evidence of their involvement in prospore membrane assembly has not been reported. Compensatory Q/R mutations in the central ionic layer of a t-SNARE and a v-SNARE have been used to demonstrate specific SNARE interactions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Katz and Brennwald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Graf et al., 2005</xref>). To examine the possible role of the Snc proteins during sporulation, we introduced a plasmid carrying the <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> allele into strain HI3 (<italic>sso1</italic>/<italic>sso1</italic>) alone or in combination with a plasmid carrying the <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> allele. As expected, the <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> allele did not rescue the sporulation defect of the <italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Neither <italic>SNC2</italic> nor <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> were capable of restoring sporulation in this context (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This failure of <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> to rescue the sporulation defect raises the possibility that Snc2p does not participate in vesicle fusion at the prospore membrane. We therefore examined whether mutation of the central layer arginine to glutamine in any of the other <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> R-SNAREs (Snc1, Ykt6, Sec22, Nyv1) could restore sporulation to the <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> strain. As with <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic>, none of these mutant SNAREs could compensate for the <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> mutation (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Compensatory mutation of <italic>SNC2</italic> cannot rescue the sporulation defect of <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic>.</bold> Strains HI3 (<italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic>) or HI75 (<italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso1&#x00394; sso2&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso2&#x00394;</italic>) were transformed with the CEN plasmids expressing the indicated genes and sporulated in liquid culture. Sporulation was assessed by observation in the light microscope and by ether test. To determine percentage of sporulation, at least 500 cells were counted for each strain. For HI75, the plasmid carrying the wild-type <italic>SSO1</italic> was lost by growth on 5-FOA before cells were assayed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1831089f01"></graphic></fig><p>To ensure that <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> was indeed capable of suppressing <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> in our strains, we constructed a strain homozygous for deletion of <italic>SSO1</italic> and <italic>SSO2</italic> and kept alive by the <italic>SSO1</italic> gene on a centromeric plasmid (HI75). When the <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> mutation was introduced into this strain, the plasmid bearing the wild-type gene could be lost only when the <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> allele was also present. The resulting strain is viable because of the compensatory interaction between the two mutant SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Katz and Brennwald, 2000</xref>). However, as with the results in the <italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic> strain, the presence of <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> does not rescue the sporulation defect associated with <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Together, these results suggest either that no R-SNARE proteins are involved in fusion at the prospore membrane, and therefore they cannot compensate for the <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> mutation, or that fusion at the prospore membrane is particularly sensitive to the proper configuration of side chains at the central ionic layer in the SNARE complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Vegetative yeast cells are largely insensitive to mutation of the t-SNARE ionic layer</title><p>To further explore the role of the central ionic layer in Sso1 function, codon 224 was mutated and alleles bearing all possible amino acid replacements of the glutamine were constructed. Each of these <italic>sso1<sup>Q224X</sup></italic> alleles was introduced on a plasmid into strain HI75 (<italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso1&#x00394; sso2&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso2&#x00394;</italic> p<italic>SSO1</italic>) and the transformants were then transferred to plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to select for loss of the wild-type <italic>SSO1</italic>-containing plasmid. Like <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic>, <italic>sso1<sup>Q224P</sup></italic> failed to grow on 5-FOA, indicating that a proline substitution at this position also interferes with Sso1 function. Though arginine cannot function, lysine is weakly tolerated at this position as cells containing <italic>sso1<sup>Q224K</sup></italic> as their only source of Sso protein were viable, but slow growing at elevated temperature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The phenotype of <italic>sso1<sup>Q224K</sup></italic> may be due to the presence of the positively charged side chain because, as with <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic>, coexpression of <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> suppressed the slow growth of <italic>sso1<sup>Q224K</sup></italic> (unpublished data). However, other than these three mutations, all other amino acids at position 224 were well tolerated. As judged by colony size, strains carrying these <italic>sso1<sup>Q224X</sup></italic> alleles as their sole form <italic>SSO</italic> grew as well as those carrying <italic>SSO1</italic> even at low or high temperatures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; not depicted). Thus, despite the strong evolutionary conservation of ionic layer glutamine, the yeast plasma membrane SNARE can tolerate a wide variety of residues at this position.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutation of Sso1Q224 is well tolerated in vegetative growth.</bold> Strain HI75 (<italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso1&#x00394; sso2&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso2&#x00394;</italic>) was transformed with CEN plasmids carrying all possible amino acid substitutions at position 224 of Sso1 and the plasmid carrying the wild-type <italic>SSO1</italic> was lost by plasmid shuffle, leaving the mutant as the sole form of Sso protein in the cell.

Unlike growth rate, sporulation was sensitive to changes at this position (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). All of the mutations caused a reduction in sporulation efficiency, varying from a two- to fourfold to several hundredfold with small or polar amino acids better tolerated than large hydrophobic or positively charged side chains. Substitution of glutamine 224 to lysine, which causes slow vegetative growth, led to a complete loss of sporulation, as did the arginine and proline mutations (examined in the <italic>sso1</italic> single mutant strain) that cannot support vegetative growth. Substitution to leucine or tryptophan had no effect on growth rate, yet these mutants displayed strong sporulation defects. Thus, mutations such as <italic>sso1<sup>Q224W</sup></italic> behave as sporulation-specific alleles of <italic>SSO1</italic>; they are as effective as wild-type in supporting vegetative growth but poorly support sporulation. These results suggest that the inability of <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> to rescue the sporulation defect of <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> might be caused by the sensitivity of sporulation to changes in the ionic layer residue of Sso1, rather than an indication that Snc2 does not function at the prospore membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Sporulation is sensitive to mutation of Sso1Q224.</bold> Strains HI3 (<italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic>) (for Sso1Q224R, Q224P, and Q224K) or HI75 (<italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso1&#x00394; sso2&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso2&#x00394;</italic>) (all other substitutions) expressing an <italic>SSO1</italic> gene with the indicated amino acid substitution from a CEN plasmid were sporulated, and the percentage of sporulation in the culture was measured.

However, examination of GFP-tagged forms of the proteins revealed that both display an SPB-associated fluorescence in <italic>sso1</italic> mutant cells indistinguishable from wild-type Snc2 protein and consistent with localization to prospore membrane precursor vesicles (unpublished data).</p><p>An alternative possibility is the existence of a sporulation-specific protein whose interaction with Sso1 and/or Snc2 is sensitive to these mutations. As Sec9 works with these proteins in vegetative cells and Spo20 replaces it during sporulation, Spo20 would be a candidate for such a factor. To test the possibility that the switch to Spo20 during sporulation is the basis for the <italic>sso1<sup>Q224X</sup></italic> phenotypes, we examined the ability of chimeras in which the helices of Spo20 are replaced with those of Sec9 (<italic>PSPS</italic>) to rescue the <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> sporulation defect. Strain HJ3 (<italic>sso1&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>sso1&#x00394; spo20&#x00394;</italic>/<italic>spo20&#x00394;</italic>) carrying p<italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> was transformed with an empty vector, or one carrying <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic>, as well as high copy plasmids expressing either wild-type <italic>SPO20</italic> or the <italic>PSPS</italic> chimera. Expression of <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> or <italic>SPO20</italic> alone did not increase the frequency of sporulation and, similarly, co-overexpression of <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> and <italic>SPO20</italic> had no effect. Expression of <italic>PSPS</italic> alone resulted in some increase of sporulation; however, coexpression of both <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> and the <italic>PSPS</italic> chimera resulted in sporulation at levels comparable to the same strain carrying <italic>SSO1</italic> and <italic>SPO20</italic> plasmids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This result demonstrates that <italic>snc2<sup>R52Q</sup></italic> can contribute to suppression of <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic>, indicating that Snc2 does participate in fusion at the prospore membrane.

To address this possibility, HA-tagged &#x00394;50-Spo20, Spo20<sup>C224L,S231N</sup>, or PSPS were expressed in combination with either wild-type Sso1 and Snc2 or Sso1<sup>Q224R</sup> and Snc2<sup>R52Q</sup> in an <italic>sso1 sso2</italic> strain. Lysates were made from each strain and the Spo20 proteins immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were then blotted and probed with anti-HA, anti-Sso1, or anti-Snc2 antibodies to examine association of the three SNARE proteins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In the presence of both the wild-type and mutant Sso1 and Snc2 proteins the same pattern was seen; the PSPS chimera precipitated significantly more Sso1 and Snc2 than Spo20<sup>C224L,S231N</sup>, which in turn brought down slightly more Sso1 and Snc2 than the wild-type Spo20. Though these immunoprecipitations do not provide a direct measure of affinity, the increased association of PSPS and Spo20<sup>C224L,S231N</sup> with both forms of Sso1 and Snc2 are consistent with the idea that they bind more avidly to their partner SNAREs than wild-type Spo20. Interestingly, all three forms of Spo20 exhibited greater association with the Sso1<sup>Q224R</sup> and Snc2<sup>R52Q</sup> proteins than with the wild-type SNAREs. Because the amount of SNAREs in complex reflects both the rates of assembly and of disassembly, we suggest that the general increase in the amount of SNARE complexes seen with Sso1<sup>Q224R</sup>/Snc2<sup>R52Q</sup> might reflect a role for the central ionic layer in complex disassembly, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scales et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutation of the Spo20 helices increases binding of Sso1 and Snc2.</bold> Strain HI75 (<italic>sso1&#x00394; sso2&#x00394;</italic>) was transformed with high copy plasmids expressing 3xHA tagged forms of &#x00394;3-51Spo20, &#x00394;3-51Spo20<italic><sup>C224L</sup>,<sup>S231N</sup></italic>, or &#x00394;3-51PSPS chimera.

We previously reported that Sec9-containing complexes are significantly more stable than Spo20 complexes during equilibrium unfolding reactions with chemical denaturants where the concentration of Guanidinium-HCL required to disrupt 50% of the ternary SNARE complex was reduced 2.1M for Sec9 vs. 0.9M for Spo20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). When the Spo20<sup>C224L,S231N</sup>-containing SNAREs were examined, a concentration of 1.1M Guanidinium-HCL disrupted 50% of these ternary complexes, indicating that they were more stable than those with Spo20, though still well below the stability of Sec9 complexes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>). This moderate improvement in stability of the Spo20<sup>C224L,S231N</sup>-containing complexes is consistent with the slight increase in binding of Spo20<sup>C224L,S231N</sup> to Sso1 and Snc2 seen in the IP experiments (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Together with the liposome fusion data, these results suggest that modest changes in affinity can have strong effects on the fusogenic properties of the SNAREs. For the neuronal SNARE SNAP-25 it has similarly been found that mutation of interface residues can result in large differences in function while only modestly altering stability of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sorensen et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The use of compensatory mutations in the central ionic layer of the SNARE domain has proven to be an effective means to demonstrate the participation of different SNARE proteins in the same complex in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Graf et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we attempted to use this technique to demonstrate a role for the Snc1/2 proteins in fusion at the prospore membrane. A compensatory mutation in <italic>SNC2</italic> could only rescue the sporulation defect of <italic>sso1<sup>Q224R</sup></italic> when expressed in concert with forms of Spo20 carrying the Sec9 SNARE helices. Similar results were obtained using a compensatory mutation in <italic>SNC1</italic> (unpublished data). These results demonstrate, first, that the Snc1 and Snc2 proteins indeed function as the R-SNARE subunit of the prospore membrane SNARE complex and, second, that placement of the central layer arginine in different helices is not functionally equivalent. In this instance, swapping the glutamine and arginine between the Sso1 and Snc2 helices creates a SNARE bundle that is more sensitive to the composition of other interface layers in the complex. When Spo20 is the partner, the binding energies at other interfaces are insufficient to overcome the weaker central layer interactions.</p><p>During the course of this work, a crystal structure of the SNARE complex containing the Sso1, Snc2, and Sec9 helical domains was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Strop et al., 2008</xref>). When this structure is used to model in the Spo20 cysteine and serine side chains at the &#x0002b;3 and &#x0002b;5 interface layers, the Spo20 residues result in an apparent loss of packing interactions between the side chains (unpublished data), consistent with our results indicating that the Sec9 residues at these positions improve stability of the SNARE complex. Mutational analysis of interface residues in SNAP-25 revealed that interactions in the N-terminal half of the SNARE domain are important for promoting priming or docking of the vesicle, whereas interactions in the C-terminal half of the SNARE helix are critical to drive membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sorensen et al., 2006</xref>). In this regard, it is noteworthy that the critical interfaces differentiating the ability of Spo20 and Sec9 to promote fusion at the plasma membrane lie in the C-terminal domain, suggesting that fusion and not docking is the affected step. Again, this is consistent with the results we observe in the liposome fusion assay.</p><sec><title>Role of the central ionic layer</title><p>Our results raise questions about the function of the central ionic layer present in all SNARE complexes. We found that vegetative secretion was remarkably insensitive to mutation of the glutamine found at this layer in Sso1. Mutation to proline, which would likely disrupt the SNARE helix, or to arginine or lysine, which would introduce positive charges that clash with the arginine on the Snc2 helix, reduced or eliminated function. However, any other amino acid at this position was well tolerated. This is quite surprising in light of the strong conservation of this glutamine in all syntaxin-family SNARE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bock et al., 2001</xref>). Our results with Spo20 suggest one possible explanation for this apparent paradox. The sensitivity of Spo20-containing complexes to alteration of glutamine 224 would provide selective pressure for its maintenance in Sso1. It may be that other SNARE complexes more closely resemble Spo20- than Sec9-containing SNAREs and are sensitive to perturbation of the central ionic layer.</p><p>The ability of mutant forms of Sso1 to function well raises the question of the conservation not just of the glutamine residue, but also of the ionic layer. The ionic layer has been shown to be important for efficient disassembly of the neuronal SNARE complex in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scales et al., 2001</xref>), and our immunoprecipitation data are consistent with this idea. However, the lack of growth phenotype of the <italic>SSO1<sup>Q224</sup></italic> mutations suggests that disassembly must still occur with reasonable efficiency in the mutants. Another suggested explanation is that the ionic layer allows the multiple helices to assemble in the appropriate register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fasshauer et al., 1998</xref>). Examination of the interface residues in defined SNARE complexes reveals that interfaces with one or two polar residues are not uncommon. However a charged residue or more than two polar residues is quite rare (unpublished data). In our experiments, three of the four helices still contain polar or charged residues (two glutamines and an arginine). Therefore, this may still provide sufficient information to assemble the complex in register. Though mutation of all the central ionic layers to hydrophobic residues did not disrupt assembly of the neuronal SNARE complex in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scales et al., 2001</xref>), it would be interesting to determine if combining additional ionic layer changes with <italic>SSO1<sup>Q224</sup></italic> changes in the yeast SNARE would result in a much more severe fusion defect.</p></sec><sec><title>Control of SNARE specificity in vivo</title><p>The switch from Sec9- to Spo20-dependent fusion during sporulation provides an excellent system to explore the mechanisms by which a change in a single SNARE subunit can alter the target specificity of a particular class of vesicle. Our results here, along with those previously reported, allow us to answer this question. The specificity of Sec9 and Spo20 for their respective membranes is reinforced in three ways. First, transcriptional control, in wild-type cells <italic>SPO20</italic> is transcribed only during sporulation and so cannot function in constitutive secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Neiman, 1998</xref>). The second mechanism is control of intracellular localization. Efficient targeting of Sec9 to the prospore membrane, either by fusing it to the Spo20 lipid binding motif or to an integral membrane protein, allows Sec9 to restore some degree of sporulation to <italic>spo20</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neiman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakanishi et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, as we show here, SNARE specificity can be controlled by the strength of the binding interactions between the SNAREs themselves. As the binding energy required for a given fusion event will depend on the potential energy barrier to fusion of the two membranes involved, this form of regulation is linked to the lipid composition of the membranes.</p><p>Control of localization and strength of binding are likely to be general mechanisms contributing to SNARE specificity. In liposome binding experiments, the R-SNARE Sec22 is capable of mediating fusion in concert with Sso1 and Sec9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McNew et al., 2000</xref>). This result has been suggested to indicate the existence of a direct ER-to-plasma membrane secretion step in yeast, as found in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2005</xref>). Alternatively, it may be that, though Sec22 is capable of forming productive complexes with Sso1 and Sec9, it does not do so because its localization as a v-SNARE is limited to the cis Golgi- and ER-directed vesicles that do not dock with the plasma membrane in vivo. Consistent with this idea, overexpression of a Sec22<sup>R157Q</sup> mutant cannot rescue sporulation of the Sso1<sup>Q224R</sup> mutant even in the presence of the PSPS chimera (unpublished data), suggesting that Sec22 cannot participate in prospore membrane fusion events in vivo.</p><p>A recent study revealed that a suboptimal interface at the &#x0002b;7 layer in the neuronal <italic>syx-1A</italic> gene is important for allowing calcium-mediated regulation of secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lagow et al., 2007</xref>). Mutation of the threonine residue at this position in syx-1A to the corresponding isoleucine residue in syx-2 led to constitutive fusion. Thus, as with Spo20 and Sec9, in the neuronal SNARE complex tuning of the strength of binding interactions is important for allowing proper regulation of vesicle transport.</p><p>Finally, Spo20 and Sec9 provide a useful model for the evolution of novel SNARE complexes. During the evolution of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>, a whole genome duplication occurred that ultimately gave rise to many related gene pairs in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wolfe and Shields, 1997</xref>). Sec9 and Spo20 arose from this duplication event. In yeasts that diverged from the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lineage before the duplication, such as <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, a single Sec9/Spo20 related gene participates in fusion at both the plasma membrane and the prospore membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lineage, the duplication event allowed the two paralogues to become specialized for action at distinct compartments where the ancestral protein functioned at both membranes.
