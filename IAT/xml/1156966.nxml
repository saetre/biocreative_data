SmpB promotes the binding of tmRNA to the ribosome but there is uncertainty about the number of participating SmpB molecules as well as their ribosomal location. Here, the interaction of SmpB with ribosomal subunits and ribosomes was studied by isolation of SmpB containing complexes followed by chemical modification of ribosomal RNA with dimethyl sulfate, kethoxal and hydroxyl radicals. The results show that SmpB binds 30S and 50S subunits with 1:1 molar ratios and the 70S ribosome with 2:1 molar ratio. SmpB-footprints are similar on subunits and the ribosome. In the 30S subunit, SmpB footprints nucleotides that are in the vicinity of the P-site facing the E-site, and in the 50S subunit SmpB footprints nucleotides that are located below the L7/L12 stalk in the 3D structure of the ribosome. Based on these results, we suggest a mechanism where two molecules of SmpB interact with tmRNA and the ribosome during <italic>trans</italic>-translation. The first SmpB molecule binds near the factor-binding site on the 50S subunit helping tmRNA accommodation on the ribosome, whereas the second SmpB molecule may functionally substitute for a missing anticodon stem&#x02013;loop in tmRNA during later steps of <italic>trans</italic>-translation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Translation of the genetic information from nucleotide sequences (mRNAs) to amino acid sequences (proteins) takes place on the ribosome&#x02014;a large ribonucleoprotein complex that consists of two subunits with distinct functions. Bacterial ribosomes (70S) are composed of a small (30S) subunit, containing 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and &#x0223c;20 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins), and a large (50S) subunit, which contains 23S rRNA, 5S rRNA and more than 30 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p><p>Each subunit has three tRNA-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>): the A (aminoacyl) site, where the incoming aminoacylated tRNA binds; the P (peptidyl) site, where the tRNA with the nascent peptide chain is bound after translocation; and the E (exit) site, from where the deacylated tRNA leaves the ribosome. The molecular interactions of A-, P- and E- site bound tRNAs with the 70S ribosome are revealed in the 3D structure of the mRNA programmed 70S ribosome in complex with tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). During normal translation, aminoacylated tRNAs are delivered to the decoding centre (DC) in the A-site of the small ribosomal subunit in complex with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). EF-Tu binds, similar to other auxiliary GTPase factors in protein synthesis, to the factor-binding site close to the GTPase-activating centre (GAC) of the large subunit. The peptidyl transferase centre in the large ribosomal subunit catalyses peptide-bond formation between the peptide in the P-site and the amino acid in the A-site and then elongation factor G promotes the translocation of the newly formed peptidyl tRNA from the A- to the P-site resulting in an empty A-site, a peptidyl tRNA in the P-site and a deacylated tRNA in the E-site. The newly synthesized proteins are released when the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>)].</p><p>During <italic>trans</italic>-translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), a hybrid transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) molecule and its helper protein SmpB (small protein B) rescue ribosomes stalled on truncated mRNAs lacking stop codons. tmRNA possesses a tRNA-like domain (TLD), which is aminoacylated with alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and an mRNA-like domain, containing an internal open reading frame (ORF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) encoding a proteolysis tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). tmRNA, charged with alanine and in complex with EF-Tu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and SmpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), binds to the empty A-site of a stalled ribosome. The nascent polypeptide on the P-site tRNA of the ribosome is then transferred to the Ala-tmRNA and <italic>trans</italic>-translation resumes on the internal ORF of tmRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Eventually, a protein marked for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) is released, allowing the ribosome to recycle back to a new round of initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>SmpB is the only known protein co-factor of tmRNA, which is essential for <italic>trans</italic>-translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). It is a small protein with a globular &#x003b2;-barrel domain and a basic C-terminal tail similar to that of ribosomal protein S17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). The &#x003b2;-barrel domain has an extended oligonucleotide-binding (OB) fold with basic residues concentrated to opposing surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). It has been suggested that SmpB uses those surfaces to interact simultaneously with tmRNA and 16S rRNA serving as a bridge between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). It has been shown that although a tail-truncated SmpB binds both to the ribosome and to tmRNA with high affinity, it cannot support <italic>trans</italic>-translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). As discussed below, the C-terminal tail of SmpB is suggested to assist in Ala-tmRNA accommodation into the 70S A-site by extending into the DC and mimicking a missing codon&#x02013;anticodon interaction between tmRNA and the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>A high-resolution crystal structure of a complex containing SmpB and the TLD of tmRNA from <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) reveals that one side of the OB fold in SmpB binds to the elbow region of the TLD and stabilizes its D-loop in an extended conformation. The C-terminal tail of SmpB is disordered and cannot be traced in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Cross-linking to and footprinting on tmRNA by SmpB [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>); N. Ivanova, M. Lindell, M. Pavlov, L. Holmberg Schiavone, E.G.H. Wagner and M. Ehrenberg, manuscript in preparation] confirm that SmpB interacts with the D- and connector-loops of the TLD.</p><p>In the cell SmpB is predominantly ribosome-bound, independently of the presence of tmRNA, suggesting that SmpB could be associated with ribosomes at other times than during <italic>trans</italic>-translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Existing data indicate that SmpB may be in complex with tmRNA during the entire <italic>trans</italic>-translation cycle on the ribosome [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>); N. Ivanova, M. Lindell, M. Pavlov, L. Holmberg Schiavone, E.G.H. Wagner and M. Ehrenberg, manuscript in preparation], but it is still uncertain how many copies of SmpB bind to the ribosome and tmRNA during <italic>trans</italic>-translation. The cryo-EM structure of the kirromycin-stalled tmRNA&#x02022;SmpB&#x02022;EF-Tu&#x02022;ribosome complex only shows one molecule of SmpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), whereas biochemical studies indicate that ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and tmRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) can bind two and three SmpB molecules, respectively.</p><p>The cryo-EM structure suggests that SmpB interacts primarily with the 50S subunit, whereas tmRNA interacts with the GAC of the 50S subunit and the DC of the 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). At the same time, modelling of the SmpB&#x02022;TLD crystal structure into the map of the 70S ribosome suggests that SmpB is oriented towards the DC of the small ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). To reconcile these two structural models, it has been suggested that SmpB re-orients during the accommodation of tmRNA into the ribosomal A-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In this model, SmpB would first bind to the factor-binding site of the 50S subunit as seen in the cryo-EM structure. Then, upon accommodation of tmRNA into the ribosomal A-site, SmpB would be reoriented to the DC of the small ribosomal subunit and use its C-terminal tail to substitute for the lack of anticodon stem&#x02013;loop (ASL) in tmRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). It has also been proposed that SmpB should dissociate from tmRNA at later stages of <italic>trans</italic>-translation upon peptidyl-tmRNA translocation to the P-site of the ribosome to make room for the entry of a native aminoacyl-tRNA into the A-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>The absence of consensus regarding the mode of the interaction between SmpB and the ribosome prompted us to characterize interactions of free SmpB with ribosomal subunits and ribosomes. To this end, SmpB containing ribosomal complexes isolated by gel-filtration were probed by chemical modification and hydroxyl radical cleavage of ribosomal RNA. The results show that 70S ribosomes contain two binding sites for SmpB, one close to the P-site of the small subunit and one near the factor-binding site of the large subunit. This observation suggests that two different SmpB molecules participate in <italic>trans</italic>-translation.

Both the ribosome and the factor mixes were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C, mixed in equal volumes, incubated for varying times and quenched by formic acid to a final concentration of 17%. The cognate reaction was carried out with a quench-flow instrument (Chemical-Quench-Flow ModelQF-3, KinTek Corp.). Dipeptide formation was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with on-line radio-detection (&#x003b2;RAM3; INUS Inc., USA) from the ratio of the area of the [<sup>3</sup>H]fMet-Phe (or [<sup>3</sup>H]fMet-Leu) dipeptide peak and the sum of the areas of the dipeptide and [<sup>3</sup>H]fMet peaks. Samples for the HPLC were prepared and processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Here, we have searched for possible interaction sites between the ribosome-associated protein SmpB and ribosomal RNA by chemical modification and subsequent primer extension analysis of SmpB containing or SmpB-free ribosomes and ribosomal subunits.</p><sec><title>Binding of SmpB to 30S, 50S and 70S particles</title><p>Ribosomal complexes containing SmpB were formed by incubating ribosomes or ribosomal subunits with 2.5- or 5-fold excess of SmpB over ribosomes/subunits in TMK buffer containing 5 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>.

The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> clearly show that the 70S ribosome could accommodate two molecules of SmpB in agreement with earlier data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>The 30S and 50S subunit bound 0.8 and 0.6 molar equivalents of SmpB, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). From the elution profiles, it is also apparent that SmpB was present in small amounts in all fractions following the major elution peak containing 30S, 50S or 70S ribosomes. This indicates continuous dissociation of SmpB from complexes while they moved through the gel-filtration column. The amount of dissociated SmpB was significantly larger for 50S&#x02022;SmpB than for 30S&#x02022;SmpB complexes and was very small for the 70S&#x02022;SmpB complex, indicating tighter SmpB binding to the 70S ribosome than to the ribosomal subunits. From these experiments, we concluded that SmpB bound both to the 30S and 50S subunits in a 1:1 molar ratio and to 70S ribosomes in a 2:1 molar ratio. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were reproducible in different buffer systems, including polymix buffer and the TMK buffer used in the chemical modification experiments. Moreover, the addition of pure tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> or bulk tRNA from <italic>E.coli</italic> in a 2&#x02013;5 molar excess over ribosomes or subunits before the application of the SmpB containing complexes to the column did not affect the stoichiometry of SmpB in the complexes after elution from the column (data not shown). This observation shows that SmpB binding to 70S ribosomes and to subunits was specific.</p></sec><sec><title>Footprinting of ribosomal RNA</title><p>Ribosomal RNA in SmpB containing complexes or in free subunits/ribosomes was modified with DMS or kethoxal or cleaved with hydroxyl radicals generated from Fe(II)&#x02013;EDTA.

Free hydroxyl radicals are not base-specific but instead induce strand scissions in the sugar&#x02013;phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The modified or cleaved nucleotides were identified by primer extension and gel electrophoresis using an ABI 377 sequencer.</p><p>All of 23S, 5S and 16S rRNA, except their 3&#x02032; ends, were analysed and the modification patterns of rRNA in SmpB-containing complexes were compared with those in SmpB-lacking complexes. The results show that SmpB protected bases/the sugar&#x02013;phosphate backbone in specific regions in 16S rRNA, located to its central and 3&#x02032;-major domains. In 23S rRNA, the backbone was protected in defined regions of domains II, V and VI. The results are summarized in the proposed secondary structure models of 16S and 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The reactivity of nucleotides was affected to a different extent by the binding of SmpB to ribosomes or subunits.</p><p>In general, the presence of SmpB reduced the reactivity of bases or the phosphate backbone by 30&#x02013;70%. The reduction was stronger in 16S than in 23S rRNA, as to be expected from the higher affinity of SmpB for the 30S than for the 50S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Footprinting of 16S rRNA in 30S subunits and 70S ribosomes</title><p>SmpB footprinted nucleotides in the central (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A&#x02013;C</xref>) and 3&#x02032;-major (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>) domains in the 16S rRNA. The strongest hydroxyl radical footprints are seen in the 790-loop and connecting helix H24 in the backbones surrounding positions 776&#x02013;778, 784&#x02013;787, 790&#x02013;795, 798&#x02013;802 and 807&#x02013;809 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The largest reduction in reactivity (by 70%) by the association of SmpB to the 30S subunit is seen for positions 785&#x02013;787. Moreover, in the loop, G791 was protected from kethoxal modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), whereas A790, A794 and C795 were weakly protected from DMS modification by the formation of SmpB&#x02022;30S complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Another position in the central domain that was affected in the complexes was G693 in the 690-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Two peaks were seen in this region of the fluorogram, probably due to stuttering of the reverse transcriptase at G693 since the adjacent base is a uracil that should not be accessible for kethoxal modification.</p><p>In the linker region (helix H27) between the central and 3&#x02032;-major domains, bulging nt G926 and G927 were protected from kethoxal modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). G927 base pairs with U1390 but this does not exclude modification at the N-2 position by kethoxal. The backbone connecting helices H30 and H31 (positions 954&#x02013;959) was protected from cleavage by the free hydroxyl radicals in the SmpB&#x02022;30S complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Finally, the N-3 position of C1400 in the 3&#x02032;-minor domain of 16S rRNA became more exposed to DMS modification within the SmpB-containing complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>No additional footprints were seen in 16S rRNA in 70S ribosomes. Instead, the reactivity of several nucleotides decreased or disappeared as a result of the interaction of the 50S subunit with the 30S subunit. Thus, the hydroxyl radical cleavages in H24 and its apical 790-loop were abolished by the association of subunits into ribosomes [data not shown; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>)]. Moreover, the DMS- and kethoxal-reactivity of A790 and G791, respectively, in the 790-loop disappeared upon the formation of 70S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), whereas the DMS-reactivity of A794 and C795 was less affected.

Moreover, the reactivity of C1400 was also increased in the SmpB&#x02022;70S complex compared with ribosomes lacking SmpB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Footprinting of 23S rRNA in 50S and 70S particles</title><p>We failed to find any base-specific footprints in 23S rRNA in the 50S subunit even at a 5-fold molar excess of SmpB over ribosomes. Instead, the phosphate backbone was protected in three regions from hydroxyl radical cleavage by SmpB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The reactivity was reduced by 30&#x02013;50% in the SmpB&#x02022;50S complex compared with the empty subunit. In helix H89 and its apical loop in domain V, the backbone around positions 2470&#x02013;2474 was protected from cleavage when SmpB was bound to the 50S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The footprint was centred on nt U2473 in the 2475-loop. The second protected region was the &#x003b1;-sarcin/ricin-loop in domain VI, positions 2655&#x02013;2656 and 2661&#x02013;2664 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Here, the backbone surrounding U2656 was most strongly affected. Finally, the backbone surrounding nt U1065&#x02013;A1067, A1073&#x02013;C1075 in the apical loop of helix H43 and A1095 in the apical loop of helix H44 of domain II was less accessible to the hydroxyl radicals when SmpB was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In this case, the footprint was centred on nt A1067.</p><p>SmpB-footprints were slightly stronger in the 1070- and 1095-regions in the 70S ribosome compared to in the 50S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The accessibility of the 2475-loop was reduced in the 70S ribosome compared with the 50S subunit but the SmpB-footprint was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, the SmpB-footprint in the &#x003b1;-sarcin/ricin-loop was missing in the SmpB&#x02022;70S complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping of the footprints to the molecular models of 16S and 23S rRNA</title><p>The SmpB-footprints were mapped to the 3D structures of 16S and 23S rRNA from the <italic>E.coli</italic> ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The footprinted nucleotides in 16S rRNA in the 690- and 790-loops, in helix H24, in the linker region between the central and 3&#x02032;-major domains (helix H27) and in the single-strand region connecting helices H30 and H31 are located to the platform and the neck region of the 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, the SmpB-footprints on helix H24 form a continuous surface on its solvent-exposed side, indicating a strong binding site of SmpB on the free 30S subunit in this region of 16S rRNA. The SmpB protection of nt 954&#x02013;959, linking helices H30&#x02013;H31, is too far away from the footprint on helix H24, to be explained by a direct contact with the same molecule of SmpB. Instead, SmpB binding may induce conformational changes in the 30S subunit that lead to the protection of the phosphate-backbone in the 954&#x02013;959 region of 16S rRNA. Alternatively a second, partially filled SmpB-binding site is lost upon the formation of 70S ribosomes.</p><p>When the SmpB-footprints are compared with tRNA interaction sites in the 70S ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) almost all footprints on the 30S subunit are in the vicinity of the P-site facing the E-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The only exception is the exposed nt C1400 that is in the middle of the P-site. This is clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, where the A-site tRNA is yellow and the view is along the AC stem into the decoding cleft. The data thus suggest that SmpB binds in the vicinity of the P-site of the empty 30S subunit.</p><p>In 23S rRNA, the SmpB-footprinted nucleotides in the 1070-, 1095-, 2470- and 2660-regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) are located below the L7/L12-stalk of the 50S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). It is evident that the protected nucleotides in the 1070- and 1095-regions are situated very close to the protected nucleotides in the apical loop of helix H89. Moreover, the sugar&#x02013;phosphate backbone of the footprinted nucleotides forms a continuous patch on the solvent-accessible surface of 23S rRNA. It remains protected by SmpB not only in the free 50S subunit but also in the 70S ribosome, suggesting that there is a binding site of SmpB in this area of the 50S subunit. The footprint on the &#x003b1;-sarcin/ricin-loop is clearly separated from the other footprints in the 3D structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), but may all the same come from a direct interaction of SmpB, since the distance between the two regions is &#x0003c;20 &#x0212b; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>To find out whether the footprints in the 70S ribosome were the result of the interaction of one or more molecules of SmpB with the ribosome, the distances between footprinted nucleotides in the two subunits were measured. The two closest regions, footprinted in the 70S ribosome, are the 790-loop in 16S rRNA and helix H89 in 23S rRNA, and these are &#x0003e;70 &#x0212b; apart in the crystal structure of the 70S ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).

The footprinting data suggest that one binding site is in the neck region of the 30S subunit close to the 30S P-site. The other binding site, on the 50S subunit, is close to the factor-binding site and to the so-called GAC, composed of helices H43 and H44 and r-protein L11. The data also show that several SmpB protected sites that are present on either one of the isolated subunits disappear in the 70S ribosome.</p><p>In 16S rRNA, these sites are often involved in inter-subunit contacts. Thus, the DMS reactivity of A790, the kethoxal reactivity of G791 as well as the hydroxyl radical footprints in helix H24 and the connecting 790-loop disappear upon subunit&#x02013;subunit association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). This makes it more difficult to evaluate the SmpB binding to the 790-region in 16S rRNA in the 70S ribosome. However, base-specific SmpB-footprints are still seen at positions 794 and 795, suggesting that SmpB interacts with this region of 16S rRNA in the 70S ribosome. Moreover, SmpB still footprints the 690-loop and nucleotides G926 and G927 in the 70S ribosome with no additional footprints detected elsewhere in 16S rRNA, indicating that the binding of SmpB is not shifted on the 70S ribosome compared with the 30S subunit. Altogether, this suggests that SmpB interacts with similar regions in the 70S ribosome and the 30S subunit, although the interaction with the former must be perturbed by the subunit&#x02013;subunit bridge B2b formed by the 790-loop and helices 69 and 71 in 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, in 23S rRNA, SmpB-footprints disappear in the &#x003b1;-sarcin/ricin-loop even though this loop is not involved in 70S formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). In the apical loop of helix H44, which is part of the GAC, the SmpB-footprints are stronger in the 70S ribosome than in the 50S subunit. This suggests a small shift of the SmpB-binding site on the 50S subunit towards the GAC, when the 70S ribosome is formed.</p><p>There is a small but significant increase in the accuracy of codon reading by the presence of SmpB on the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This effect is much smaller than the large accuracy changes induced by the presence of antibiotics or restrictive mutations in r-protein S12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). This shows that SmpB affects A-site-related processes even though our footprinting results do not suggest that SmpB binds to the 30S A-site of the ribosome. However, it is possible that it is the 50S-bound SmpB that affects translation accuracy by subtly changing the interaction of ternary complexes with the GAC on the 50S subunit of the ribosome.</p><p>A comparison of the SmpB-footprints in 16S rRNA with the interaction sites of P- and E-site bound tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) show that SmpB footprints nucleotides that are normally interacting with the ASLs of P- and E-site bound tRNAs (positions 34&#x02013;39, where 35&#x02013;37 is the anticodon). These sites overlap on the 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). The data presented here support a model where SmpB could functionally substitute an absent ASL of tmRNA when peptidyl-tmRNA subsequently moves into the P- and E-site of the 30S subunit. Interestingly, the N-3 position of C1400 that is situated in the P-site of the 30S subunit is more susceptible to methylation by DMS when SmpB is bound to the ribosome. At the same time, SmpB footprints G926, i.e. &#x0223c;10 &#x0212b;, from C1400 in the 3D model of 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). This suggests that SmpB binds in close proximity to the ribosomal P-site and affects its conformation. This notion is supported by the observation that SmpB footprints nt A790 and G791 (in the 790-loop) in the 30S subunit. Formation of bridge B2b in the 70S ribosome or interaction of the ASL of P-site bound tRNA with the backbone in the 790-loop stabilize the interaction between bases A790 and G791 and the backbone at positions 1497&#x02013;1498 in 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that SmpB may favour similar interactions in the empty 30S subunit. Furthermore, SmpB may stabilize the post-translocation peptidyl-tmRNA&#x02022;SmpB&#x02022;ribosome complex, thereby ensuring an accurate shift in codon reading from the mRNA to the tmRNA mode. In addition, SmpB may be important for rapid translocation of tmRNA from the A- to the P-site and then from the P- to the E-site by making up for missing interactions, between tmRNA and the ribosomal P-site that are important for translocation of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>).</p><p>The footprints in the apical loop of H89 and in helices H43 and H44 in the 50S subunit are consistent with the SmpB-positioning in the cryo-EM structure of the complex between Ala-tmRNA and 70S ribosomes in the presence of EF-Tu&#x02022;GDP&#x02022;Kirromycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In this complex, SmpB is modelled in the electron density map so that it simultaneously contacts the TLD and the apical loop of helix H89 and is in close proximity to helices H69 and H71 in domain IV of 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Our footprints in the H89 helix are in general agreement with the proposed placement of SmpB in the cryo-EM structure. However, the absence of SmpB-footprints on helices 69 and 71, both in the free 50S subunit and in the 70S ribosome, indicates that the actual SmpB-binding site on the 50S subunit should be located closer to the 1070- and 1095-loops than in the cryo-EM reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>The probable binding site of SmpB on the 30S subunit, presented here, can be compared with the proposal by Gutmann <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In their model, based on docking of the crystal structure of the SmpB&#x02022;TLD complex into the structure of the 70S ribosome in complex with the A-site tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), SmpB is oriented towards the A-site of the small subunit. In contrast, our data suggest that SmpB binds close to the P-site, rather than to the A-site of the 30S subunit. One reason for this discrepancy could be that the A-site positioning of SmpB requires the presence of tmRNA on the ribosome and that it occurs only after Ala-tmRNA accommodation in the A-site of the 50S subunit.</p><p>Our results show that purified SmpB binds to both 30S and 50S particles in 1:1 molar ratios and to 70S ribosomes in a 2:1 molar ratio. The mapping of the SmpB-footprinted nucleotides on the crystal structure of the 70S ribosome shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> indicates that it is highly unlikely that one SmpB molecule could account for footprints both in the platform region of the 30S subunit and for the footprints below the L7/L12-stalk of the 50S subunit, since these two regions are more than 70 &#x0212b; apart in the 70S crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Therefore, the footprinting data support the notion that two molecules of SmpB bind to the empty 70S ribosome. SmpB bound to the 30S subunit was not observed by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). One explanation similar to that of Gutman <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) could be that SmpB moves from its 50S location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) to the 30S location concomitantly with the accommodation of Ala-tmRNA in the A-site of the 50S subunit or, more probably, at a later stage in <italic>trans</italic>-translation after translocation of the peptidyl-tmRNA into the P-site as discussed above. For example, it could be that the 50S footprint corresponds to the entry to and the 30S footprint to the exit from the ribosome of the TLD domain of tmRNA in complex with SmpB. However, in order for the 50S-oriented SmpB in the pre-accommodation cryo-EM-structure of the SmpB&#x02022;Tu&#x02022;GDP&#x02022;Ala-tmRNA complex to become oriented towards the A-site in the post-accommodation state as in the model by Gutman <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), the D-loop of tmRNA through which SmpB binds to tmRNA must rotate by more than 100&#x000b0; with respect to the orientation of the acceptor stem of tmRNA. This huge conformational change in tmRNA upon its A-site accommodation is hardly feasible. Therefore, we suggest an alternative that involves two molecules of SmpB. One remains bound to the 50S subunit as in the cryo-EM reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), while the other SmpB molecule is bound to tmRNA, as in the docking model by Gutmann <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The latter SmpB molecule subsequently follows tmRNA as it moves from site to site on the ribosome during <italic>trans</italic>-translation. It could functionally substitute for the missing ASL of tmRNA, as it moves from A- to P- to E-site and thus be responsible for the observed footprints on the 30S subunit. The strong footprints we observe in the P-site of the 30S subunit may reflect the relatively strong affinity of SmpB for the small ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This binding energy could be the key to how SmpB facilitates translocation of tmRNA from the A- to the P-site. In summary, we suggest that two SmpB molecules participate in <italic>trans</italic>-translation, one facilitating the interaction of tmRNA with the 50S subunit and the other facilitating the tmRNA interaction with the 30S subunit. The 30S-oriented SmpB molecule could simply have been missed in the cryo-EM reconstruction, due to the relatively low resolution (13&#x02013;15 &#x0212b;) of the electron density map in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Future experiments will be required to discriminate between the one- and the two-SmpB scenarios in <italic>trans</italic>-translation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>L.H.S. thanks Odd Nyg&#x000e5;rd for general support.
