(CT)<sub>n</sub>&#x000b7;(GA)<sub>n</sub> repeats &#x0005b;henceforth designated (CT)<sub>n</sub>&#x0005d; have been found in promoter regions of many genes, at recombination hotspots and at replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c8">8</xref>). Deletion or mutation of these sequences in promoter regions reduces gene expression, implying that these sequences have functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c11">11</xref>).</p><p>(CT)<sub>n</sub> sequences that possess mirror symmetry can form H-DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c13">13</xref>). The H-DNA structure consists of a right-handed pyrimidine-purine-pyrimidine (dY-dR-dY) triple-helix with a looped-out purine single-stranded region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c14">14</xref>). The triple-helix is formed by the Hoogstein pairing of one polypyrimidine strand, aligned in the major groove, to the parallel polypurine strand of the polypurine-polypyrimidine duplex. The Hoogstein pairing of cytosine and guanine requires protonation of the N3 position of cytosine, hence, this structure is favored by acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c6">6</xref>). Negative supercoiling also favors the formation of H-DNA. Hampel and Lee have shown that DNA triplexes can form at physiological pH and ionic conditions when millimolar amounts of polyamines are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Suggestive evidence for the <italic>in vivo</italic> formation of H-DNA comes from studies using monoclonal antibodies specific for triplex DNA. These antibodies cross-react with regions of metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei of mouse myeloma cells in a reproducible pattern that differs from the pattern obtained using antibodies specific for B-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c16">16</xref>). Treatment of cells with anti-triplex antibodies disrupted both transcription and DNA replication of mouse myeloma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c17">17</xref>). Recently, Ohno <italic>et al</italic>. have combined a monoclonal antibody approach with a milder, non-denaturing protocol for oligonucleotide hybridization to single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c18">18</xref>). Their results demonstrate the presence of triplex DNA in centromeric regions of interphase chromosomes. The existence of triplex DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> is also suggested by the growing number of proteins identified with the ability to bind triple-helical DNA with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c21">21</xref>). It should be noted, however, that many of these proteins also have the ability to bind double-stranded DNA.</p><p>Numerous investigators have used the single-stranded region of the H-DNA structure as a diagnostic marker for H-DNA formation. S1 nuclease assays have identified potential regions of H-DNA within the promoter regions of many genes, including the <italic>Hmga2</italic> gene in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c22">22</xref>), the histone genes in both sea urchins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c23">23</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c24">24</xref>), the heat shock genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c8">8</xref>) and a sodium channel subunit gene in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c25">25</xref>). Potential H-DNA-forming homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrimidine tracts placed upstream of the &#x003b2;-lactamase promoter resulted in an increase in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c26">26</xref>). However, potential H-DNA sequences were found to have an inhibitory effect when placed upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c27">27</xref>). Recent transfection experiments have also demonstrated both positive and negative effects of potential H-DNA-forming sequences on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c28">28</xref>).</p><p>Homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrimidine sequences could influence transcription through several possible mechanisms. It has been suggested that the tendency of these sequences to adopt alternative DNA conformations such as H-DNA could be used to absorb negative supercoils generated in the wake of RNA polymerase, facilitating DNA unwinding within the transcription bubble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c29">29</xref>). Homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrimidine sequences could also exert their effects by influencing the chromatin structure of the gene promoter. (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequences have been shown to play a role in the formation of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DH sites), nucleosome-free regions of chromatin that often encompass important gene regulatory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c31">31</xref>). This activity could be a direct consequence of the homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrmidine sequence itself. Several studies have demonstrated that intermolecular triplexes can alter histone&#x02013;DNA contacts and translational positioning of nucleo somes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c34">34</xref>). Furthermore, H-DNA appears to induce kinks in the adjacent B-form helices that would probably be inimical to nucleosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c35">35</xref>).</p><p>Homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrimidine sequences could also influence chromatin structure by serving as binding sites for regulatory proteins or important chromatin assembly factors. This possibility has been particularly well studied in the case of the <italic>Drosophila hsp26</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c38">38</xref>). Two DH sites, which encompass the heat shock elements (HSEs), are observed on either side of a positioned nucleosome prior to heat shock induction. The two (CT)<sub>n</sub> regions within the promoter of the <italic>hsp26</italic> gene are required for optimal gene expression and are critical for the formation of the DH sites at this locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c40">40</xref>). Deletion or sequence substitution of the (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats dramatically reduces the accessibility of the HSEs, thereby limiting the inducibility of the gene. We have previously demonstrated that these (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats are bound by GAGA factor <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c40">40</xref>); O&#x02019;Brien <italic>et al</italic>. confirmed this interaction at the <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> through protein&#x02013;DNA crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c41">41</xref>). GAGA factor is believed to affect several steps in the process of transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c37">37</xref>). Significantly, <italic>in vitro</italic> chromatin assembly systems have been used to demonstrate that GAGA factor can play an important role in nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c43">43</xref>).</p><p>Siegfried <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats proximal to the <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter could adopt an S1-sensitive structure <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting the formation of H-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c44">44</xref>). The question therefore arises as to whether homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrimidine sequences exert their function solely by acting as binding sites for <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors such as GAGA factor or if they can also drive creation of accessible sites in the nucleosome array through the formation of unusual DNA structures such as H-DNA. The <italic>hsp26</italic> gene provides an excellent <italic>in vivo</italic> system to test the latter possibility. We have used DNA modifying chemicals as probes to elucidate the structure of the proximal <italic>hsp26</italic> homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrimidine sequences and unequivocally show that this sequence element can adopt an H-DNA conformation. We then analyzed variants of this sequence <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> to assess the potential role of H-DNA formation in setting <italic>hsp26</italic> chromatin structure and providing for inducible gene expression. Our data indicate that the capacity to form H-DNA cannot substitute for GAGA factor-binding sites in the function of this promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the primer extension and linear amplification experiments were: Oligo 1, 5&#x02032;-GGCTGTTTCTTTTGCGCTC-3&#x02032;; Oligo 2, 5&#x02032;-GCAAA GTTGCTTTGAGTTG-3&#x02032;; Oligo 3, 5&#x02032;-TTGGGAAAG GTTAGTTAG-3&#x02032;; Oligo 4, 5&#x02032;-CTAGAAGAGTCCGG-3&#x02032;; Oligo 5, 5&#x02032;-CGAGCTCGGTACCC-3&#x02032;.

We carried out base-specific chemical modification experiments to elucidate the structure of this region <italic>in vitro</italic>. The reactivity of a given base, at a given reagent concentration and temperature, is dependent on the time-average solvent accessibility of the chemically reactive position on the base. Hydrogen bonding interactions, such as in Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing or Hoogstein base pairing, decrease the average solvent accessibility of those nitrogens involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c52">52</xref>).</p><p>The chemicals used in this study were DMS, kethoxal, CMCT and KMnO<sub>4</sub>; the use of these reagents has been reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c55">55</xref>). The positions of each base modified by these reagents are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f2">2</xref>. DMS reacts primarily with guanine at position N7, with adenine at N1 and N3 and with cytosine at N3. DMS modification of adenine (at N1) will only occur with those bases that are unpaired for a significant amount of time. On the other hand, DMS can modify the N7 position of guanine and the N3 position of adenine in B-DNA. The N7 position of guanine is protected from DMS modification by the Hoogstein hydrogen bonding that occurs in triple-helical DNA. Kethoxal reacts with the N1 and N2 positions of guanine; these modifications will occur primarily when that base is unpaired. CMCT reacts with thymine at N3 and with guanine at N1; both modifications require that the bases be primarily unpaired. Finally, KMnO<sub>4</sub> reacts with pyrimidines (T &#x0003e; C) at the 5&#x0003d;6 double bond; it has much weaker, but detectable, reactivity with guanine (see below). Base stacking prevents KMnO<sub>4</sub> modification of the 5&#x0003d;6 double bond of pyrimidines in B-DNA; reactivity at this position occurs when stacking interactions are disrupted, as in single-stranded regions or unusual double-stranded conformations.</p><p>The location and degree of the chemical modifications in nucleic acids can be mapped, at nucleotide resolution, using primer extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c56">56</xref>). A chemically modified base can, in most cases, impede the elongation of various polymerases, resulting in a premature pause or termination of polymerization at the base that is modified, and usually at the position one nucleotide before that base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c57">57</xref>). In almost all cases observed here, a chemically modified nucleotide results in a double termination pattern, regardless of the nature of the chemical modification. We have observed a few examples of termination only at the modified base, usually with KMnO<sub>4</sub>-modified T residues, as well as subtle sequence-dependent variations in the relative intensities of bands comprising a double termination site. However, no ambiguities have been encountered in determining the nucleotide location and extent of the chemical modifications from the Sequenase&#x02122; elongation termination patterns.</p><p>The supercoiled plasmid pGhsp26.11, which contains the intact promoter region of the <italic>hsp26</italic> gene (see Materials and Methods), was probed with DMS, kethoxal, CMCT and KMnO<sub>4</sub> in pH 7.8 or pH 5.0 buffer at 4 and 37&#x000b0;C. Analyses of the modifications on the purine strand are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>A. Data from the primer extension reactions from these experiments on both the purine and pyrimidine strands are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>B. Data for both strands were obtained by using two oligonucleotides, one complementary to each of the strands, which flank the (CT)<sub>n</sub> region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f1">1</xref>). As predicted, the data clearly indicate that this segment shifts to H-form DNA at pH 5.0. On the purine strand, nucleotides G<sub>&#x02013;110</sub>&#x02013;G<sub>&#x02013;104</sub> were protected from DMS modification, indicating that these seven bases are involved in stable base triplets and comprise the core of the triple-helical region of the H-DNA structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>A, compare DMS lanes 3 and 4 with DMS lanes 1 and 2 in the region denoted with the parenthesis). These data are consistent with those obtained by Glaser <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c10">10</xref>) using the chemical reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) (summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>B).</p><p>The adenosine nucleotides in the region between A<sub>&#x02013;103</sub> and A<sub>&#x02013;87</sub> showed an increase in DMS sensitivity and the G residues in this region were CMCT-reactive, indicating that the 3&#x02032; half of the purine strand adopts a single-stranded conformation (see bracketed regions on the gel in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>A). Note that under denaturing conditions, pH 7.0 and 90&#x000b0;C, the DNA is so extensively modified that the polymerase does not extend far from the primer, and the products are often not visible in this section of the gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>A, lanes 5). There was also a weak, but reproducible, reactivity of the G residues between G<sub>&#x02013;101</sub> and G<sub>&#x02013;89</sub> to KMnO<sub>4</sub>. The single-stranded region of the purine strand also includes T<sub>&#x02013;86</sub>, which was CMCT- and KMnO<sub>4</sub>-reactive, and G<sub>&#x02013;85</sub>, which reacted with both DMS (N7) and CMCT (N1).</p><p>On the pyrimidine strand, the nucleotides T<sub>&#x02013;103</sub>&#x02013;T<sub>&#x02013;100</sub> were KMnO<sub>4</sub> reactive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>B). These bases are located at the center of the inverted repeat of the (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequence and are likely located at the tip of the H-DNA structure. These bases, however, were not reactive with either DMS (modifies N3 of C residues) or CMCT (modifies N3 of T residues). Thus the N3 positions of these pyrimidines are somehow protected from chemical modification in the H-DNA structure. At the 5&#x02032; H-DNA&#x0002f;B-DNA junction, pyrimidine strand bases C<sub>&#x02013;114</sub>, G<sub>&#x02013;113</sub>, T<sub>&#x02013;112</sub> and T<sub>&#x02013;111</sub> reacted with DMS, CMCT and KMnO<sub>4</sub>, respectively, while A<sub>&#x02013;112</sub> and A<sub>&#x02013;111</sub> of the purine strand were sensitive to DMS. The 3&#x02032; H-DNA&#x0002f;B-DNA junction can be located around position &#x02013;84 by the chemical reactivity patterns of both strands. On the pyrimidine strand, T<sub>&#x02013;87</sub> was CMCT reactive and A<sub>&#x02013;86</sub> was DMS sensitive.</p><p>UV photofootprinting experiments can be used to pro vide information on the time-average flexibility of the pyrimidine strand under acid pH conditions. It has been shown that the yield of pyrimidine photodimers (primarily &#x0005b;6&#x02013;4&#x0005d;-photoproducts) is diminished in the triple-helical region of H-DNA structures due to the increased rigidity of the stacked pyrimidine bases in the triplex core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c58">58</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>B summarizes the results of UV photofootprinting&#x0002f;primer extension experiments on pGhsp26.CT at pH 5.0 compared to pH 7.8. Repression of pyrimidine photodimerization occurs at bases C<sub>&#x02013;110</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>&#x02013;90</sub>, thought to be the triple-helical core of the H-DNA structure. One base, T<sub>&#x02013;103</sub>, located 3 nt 5&#x02032; of the center of the (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequence, shows no repression of UV-induced damage; this base is located in the loop at the apex of the H-DNA structure. Based on the results of our chemical modification and UV photofootprinting experiments, we conclude that the non-B-DNA conformation adopted by the (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats in the <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter is canonical H-form DNA with a 7 bp triplex core, a four base turn at the apex and 4 bp of perturbed structure on either side of the core as the DNA readjusts to a B-form structure.</p><p>A model that incorporates these features is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>C. Several aspects of this model refine the model suggested earlier by noting patterns of DEPC and S1 sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c10">10</xref>). The pyrimidine strand from &#x02013;96 to &#x02013;90 forms Hoogstein base pairs with the purine strand from &#x02013;104 to &#x02013;110, winding along the major groove to form a DNA triplex. Note that two bases, A<sub>&#x02013;102</sub> and A<sub>&#x02013;103</sub>, may be Hoogstein base paired to the pyrimidine strand at positions T<sub>&#x02013;97</sub> and T<sub>&#x02013;98</sub>, yet are not base paired with T<sub>&#x02013;103</sub> and T<sub>&#x02013;102</sub>. The position of the loop in the pyrimidine strand (&#x02013;103 to &#x02013;99) is based on reactivity to KMnO<sub>4</sub> and lack of protection from UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation. The single-stranded purine region (&#x02013;99 to &#x02013;85) is suggested by increased reactivity to KMnO<sub>4</sub>, CMCT, kethoxal and DMS. Pyrimidines C<sub>&#x02013;85</sub>&#x02013;T<sub>&#x02013;89</sub> also exhibit increased reactivity to these reagents, indicating that they spend a significant amount of time unpaired.</p></sec><sec><title>A point mutation in the (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequence alters the chemical modification pattern throughout the region</title><p>As a first experiment to analyze the potential role of H-DNA in the regulation of the <italic>hsp26</italic> gene, we studied the structure and function of an <italic>hsp26</italic> (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequence containing a T&#x02192;C point mutation at position &#x02013;107. This transition is predicted to prevent the formation of a base triplet located in the middle of the triple-helical core of the H-DNA structure, thus destabilizing the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c8">8</xref>). Glaser <italic>et al</italic>. constructed a <italic>hsp26</italic> transgene carrying this mutation and tested its function <italic>in vivo</italic>; the transgene showed wild-type levels of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c10">10</xref>). We were interested in determining whether the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> mutation has an effect on the formation and stability of the H-DNA structure.</p><p>Analyses of the chemical modifications of supercoiled plasmid pGhsp26.C107 using DMS, CMCT and KMnO<sub>4</sub> are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>B. At 4&#x000b0;C, the DMS protection pattern on the purine strand is very weak but reproducible. In particular, G<sub>&#x02013;110</sub>, A<sub>&#x02013;109</sub>, G<sub>&#x02013;108</sub> and G<sub>&#x02013;106</sub> demonstrated weak protection from DMS modification at pH 5.0 compared to pH 7.8. However, G<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> reacted with DMS identically at both pH levels, indicating that it is not involved in a Hoogstein base pair. Nucleotides A<sub>&#x02013;102</sub>&#x02013;T<sub>&#x02013;86</sub> of the purine strand showed enhancement of chemical reactivity in a pattern very similar to the wild-type (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequence. The pyrimidine strand also showed weak chemical modification patterns at 4&#x000b0;C using DMS, CMCT and kethoxal that were very similar to the wild-type data. However, there were subtle changes in the KMnO<sub>4</sub> modification patterns relative to the wild-type sequences. Specifically, nucleotides T<sub>&#x02013;103</sub>&#x02013;T<sub>&#x02013;97</sub> were reactive in the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequence, while only T<sub>&#x02013;103</sub>&#x02013;T<sub>&#x02013;99</sub> were reactive in the wild-type structure. Also, pyrimidines T<sub>&#x02013;96</sub>&#x02013;T<sub>&#x02013;89</sub>, which are completely protected from KMnO<sub>4</sub> reactivity in the wild-type (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequence at both pH 5.0 and 7.8, showed weak KMnO<sub>4</sub> reactivity in the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> mutant at 4&#x000b0;C and pH 5.0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>B). Interestingly, the chemical modification patterns of the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> sequence are temperature sensitive. The patterns of KMnO<sub>4</sub> and DMS reactivity of the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> sequence were completely altered at 37&#x000b0;C&#x0002f;pH 5.0 compared to the 4&#x000b0;C reactions, and the CMCT and the DMS patterns at 37&#x000b0;C&#x0002f;pH 5.0 were identical to the B-DNA chemical modification patterns seen at 37&#x000b0;C&#x0002f;pH 7.8.</p><p>We also examined the effects of the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> mutation using the UV photofootprinting assay. In contrast to the results obtained from chemical modification, the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> sequence demonstrates essentially no change in pyrimidine photodamage at pH 5.0 compared to pH 7.8 (i.e. no photofootprint due to H-DNA formation; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f3">3</xref>B). Taken together, these data suggest that the H-DNA structure in the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> mutant is destabilized compared to the wild-type sequence. Given the changes in the chemical modification patterns, it is difficult to determine whether the H-DNA structure still forms (albeit for shorter periods of time) or whether alternative structures predominate.</p></sec><sec><title>An alternative H-DNA-forming sequence cannot functionally replace the (CT)<sub>n</sub> mirror repeat <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Given the above results, it is clear that major alterations in sequence are needed to generate test structures that can and cannot form the H-DNA structure. In order to assess the possible role of H-DNA in gene expression, we designed a series of <italic>hsp26</italic> transgenes to test whether H-DNA-forming sequences can contribute to formation of the native chromatin structure, and the associated heat shock-inducible expression, in the absence of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors such as GAGA factor. If H-DNA exerts a positive effect on chromatin architecture and gene expression, we should detect this effect through <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, even if H-DNA forms transiently. We designed a series of <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter fragments with mutations or sequence substitutions in the (CT)<sub>n</sub> region. These altered sequences were fused in-frame to the <italic>E.coli lacZ</italic> gene, and the <italic>hsp26-lacZ</italic> fusion genes were introduced into the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome by P-element-mediated germline transformation.</p><p>Transgene Con-2 serves as a control for our <italic>in vivo</italic> test (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref>). It is made in such a way that the 50 bp (CT)<sub>n</sub> region of the <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter is replaced by a fragment of the same length containing three continuous (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats, two of which form a 27 bp long mirror repeat. To examine the possible role of H-DNA <italic>per se</italic>, we analyzed additional <italic>hsp26-lacZ</italic> transgenes in which the CT mirror repeat in Con-2 had been replaced by a (CCTTT)<sub>5</sub>CC mirror repeat, with and without the adjacent 9 bp (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats (transgenes H&#x0002f;CT and H&#x0002f;Ri, respectively; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref>). (CCTTT)<sub>5</sub>CC is the same length as the CT mirror repeat and retains the homopyrimidine mirror symmetry, but destroys the alternating pattern of C and T nucleotides. We reasoned that if the (CT)<sub>n</sub> region could function through the formation of an H-DNA structure, then replacement of the CT mirror repeat with the (CCTTT)<sub>5</sub>CC mirror repeat should have minimal effects on the native chromatin structure and expression of the transgene. In contrast, if (CT)<sub>n</sub> can function only through binding of GAGA factor, this change should have major effects on chromatin structure and gene expression. Transgene GA&#x0002f;CT lacks the mirror symmetry and homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrimidine sequence entirely, so this sequence is not predicted to form H-DNA. It does, however, contain two short (CT)<sub>n</sub> elements predicted to bind GAGA factor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref>).</p><p>To confirm correct design of the constructs, DNA with various alterations in the (CT)<sub>n</sub> region (&#x02013;135 to &#x02013;85) was examined for its ability to bind GAGA factor and to form H-DNA <italic>in vitro.</italic> As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f5">5</xref>, GAGA factor can bind to the (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats in all the constructs tested, but fails to bind the (CCTTT)<sub>5</sub>CC mirror repeat (H&#x0002f;Ri) or random sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref>, &#x00394;CT&#x0002f;Ri) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c40">40</xref>). On construct GA&#x0002f;CT, the GAGA factor footprint encompasses both the predicted binding sites.</p><p>To monitor H-DNA formation, we used S1 nuclease assays to detect the single-stranded homopurine region in supercoiled plasmids pCon-2, pH&#x0002f;CT and pH&#x0002f;Ri (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f6">6</xref>). Treatment of each of these plasmids with S1 nuclease results in a short DNA fragment following <italic>Bsu</italic>36I digestion. The cut site maps to approximately &#x02013;100, as anticipated. No S1 cleavage was detected in plasmid pGA&#x0002f;CT, indicating that this DNA sequence does not form H-DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f6">6</xref>). We also examined an additional plasmid, p&#x00394;CT&#x0002f;Ri, in which the (CT)<sub>n</sub> region was replaced with a random DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c40">40</xref>); as expected, no S1 cleavage was detected in this plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f6">6</xref>). Thus S1 cleavage, indicative of the ability to form H-DNA, is limited to those constructs with an extensive homopyrimidine segment in an inverted repeat.</p><p>We then determined the levels of heat shock-inducible expression from each of the transgenes <italic>in vivo</italic>. For this study, the heat shock inducibility of the control transgene Con-2 was set at 100&#x00025; and the values from the other lines normalized to Con-2. When tested for heat shock-inducible expression at 37&#x000b0;C, transgene H&#x0002f;CT exhibits reduced levels of expression, 59&#x00025; that of Con-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref>). We analyzed the chromatin structure of H&#x0002f;CT by assessing the accessibility of the two <italic>Xba</italic>I restriction sites located within the two HSEs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f1">1</xref>) using nuclei isolated from non-heat-shocked flies. This <italic>Xba</italic>I accessibility assay allows one to determine quantitatively whether the sequence replacement changes the overall chromatin structure of the transgene, specifically the positions of the DH sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c50">50</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f7">7</xref> and summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref>, the accessibility at both the proximal <italic>Xba</italic>I site (&#x02013;51) and the distal <italic>Xba</italic>I site (&#x02013;351) is reduced, to 40 and 39&#x00025; of that in Con-2, respectively. Thus, a change in the (CT)<sub>n</sub> mirror repeat to the (CCTTT)<sub>5</sub>CC mirror repeat, which retains the H-DNA-forming capacity but destroys the GAGA factor-binding sites, has pronounced effects on chromatin structure formation and heat shock-inducible expression.</p><p>To further confirm the above observations, we analyzed transgene H&#x0002f;Ri, in which the remaining 9 bp (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeat present in H&#x0002f;CT is replaced by random sequences. In H&#x0002f;Ri, no obvious GAGA factor-binding sites are present in the region, although the (CCTTT)<sub>5</sub>CC can still form H-DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f6">6</xref>). The heat shock inducibility of H&#x0002f;Ri is severely decreased, to 10&#x00025; that of Con-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref>). Accessibility at both the proximal and the distal <italic>Xba</italic>I sites in H&#x0002f;Ri decreases to 11 and 25&#x00025; compared to that in Con-2, respectively (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f7">7</xref>). Thus, transgene H&#x0002f;Ri behaves similarly to transgene &#x00394;CT&#x0002f;Ri, in which the entire (CT)<sub>n</sub> region has been replaced by a random sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of transgene H&#x0002f;Ri is lower than that of &#x00394;CT&#x0002f;Ri.</p><p>As a final test for H-DNA function <italic>in vivo</italic>, we tested transgene GA&#x0002f;CT. The <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter sequence in this transgene is unable to form H-DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f6">6</xref>) but is able to bind GAGA factor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f5">5</xref>). The heat shock inducibility of transgene GA&#x0002f;CT is comparable to that of Con-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref>). As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg369f7">7</xref>, the accessibilities of the proximal and the distal <italic>Xba</italic>I sites in GA&#x0002f;CT are also highly comparable to those in Con-2. Taken together, these data show that the CT mirror repeat in the (CT)<sub>n</sub> region is not essential for chromatin structure formation and heat shock inducibility of the transgene; two relatively short GAGA-binding elements are sufficient to assume the normal function of the (CT)<sub>n</sub> region. Furthermore, the presence of H-DNA-forming sequences, either alone or in conjunction with short (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequences, is not sufficient to impart wild-type levels of heat shock-inducible expression and normal pre-heat shock chromatin structure to the transgene. Based on these observations, we conclude that the capacity to form H-DNA cannot substitute for the capacity to bind GAGA factor in driving formation of DH sites.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>The (CT)<sub>n</sub> region forms H-DNA <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>The promoter proximal (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequence within the <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter (from &#x02013;135 to &#x02013;85 bp relative to the start site of transcription) has the capacity to form an S1-sensitive structure <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c44">44</xref>). The chemical modification analysis presented in this study establishes unequivocally that the unusual DNA structure adopted by this region is canonical H-DNA with a dY-dR-dY triple-helix and a single-stranded homopurine region. The data from our chemical modification experiments indicate that the triple-helical region encompasses seven Watson&#x02013;Crick and Hoogstein base pairs. This is a more limited region of triple-helical DNA than previously proposed for this sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c10">10</xref>). A four base loop, located at the axis of mirror symmetry, is suggested by sensitivity of the bases to both KMnO<sub>4</sub> and pyrimidine dimer formation. Evidence for a fairly rigid loop structure is provided by protection of these bases from DMS and CMCT and from intra-strand UV photocrosslinking (data not shown).</p><p>The detailed analysis of the native H-DNA structure presented here permits us to re-examine a point mutation originally used to attempt to eliminate triplex formation. This C&#x02192;T transition at &#x02013;107 was introduced into <italic>hsp26</italic> transgenes to test the function of the (CT)<sub>n</sub> mirror repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c10">10</xref>). Our present analysis of the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> mutant verifies the prediction that a mutation that eliminates the homopyrimidine mirror repeat can disrupt H-DNA structure. The UV photofootprinting data provide evidence for a destabilized H-DNA structure, given the complete lack of protection from photodimerization observed at pH 5.0. However, this disruption appears to be incomplete and may result in novel alternative DNA conformations. The chemical modification pattern of the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> mutant at pH 5.0 is not identical to that obtained at neutral pH. Much of the homopyrimidine strand from &#x02013;96 to &#x02013;89 remained sensitive to KMnO<sub>4</sub> at pH 5.0, indicating a disruption of local base stacking interactions. The DMS-reactive bases from &#x02013;102 to &#x02013;86 on the purine strand indicate that this region may still be single stranded; however, the fact that the protected region is somewhat shorter suggests that the adjacent region is not entirely triple-helical, even at 4&#x000b0;C. The temperature sensitivity of the chemical modification patterns indicates that whatever unusual DNA structure is formed, it is much less stable than that of the native sequence. These results indicate that the C<sub>&#x02013;107</sub> point mutation was insufficient to resolve the role of DNA structure in the <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter region.</p></sec><sec><title>A triplex-forming DNA element cannot substitute for GAGA factor-binding sites in creating an open chromatin structure</title><p>Several studies have indicated the presence of triplex DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c18">18</xref>). However, pervious experiments using DEPC and piperidine to probe <italic>Drosophila</italic> nuclei did not detect single-stranded DNA at the <italic>hsp26</italic> (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c10">10</xref>). More recently, we have utilized chemical modification and ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction to examine the <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter for evidence of H-DNA structure <italic>in vivo</italic>. While the method was sensitive enough to reveal the presence of the stable paused RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c37">37</xref>) at the <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter, it did not detect H-DNA (data not shown). The negative results could be due to any number of reasons, including protection of the DNA by protein binding, transient formation of alternative DNA structures and so forth. Therefore, we devised a test for possible function of H-DNA, rather than test directly for the structure itself.</p><p>To assess the possible contribution of H-DNA-forming sequences to gene expression, we designed mutant <italic>hsp26</italic> constructs with the goal of divorcing the triplex-forming ability of the (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats from their ability to bind GAGA factor. We reasoned that the elimination of GAGA factor-binding sites would create a sensitive test system for positive biological effects of H-DNA, even if H-DNA forms transiently. Our results show that the presence of a triplex-forming sequence is not sufficient to establish native chromatin structure and wild-type levels of gene expression when other positive regulatory elements have been deleted. Transgene H&#x0002f;CT, in which two longer GAGA factor sites are replaced while a shorter element remains, shows reduced accessibility of the HSEs within the two DH sites, accompanied by a reduction in heat shock-inducible expression. The removal of the remaining GAGA factor-binding site in transgene H&#x0002f;Ri renders the DH sites almost completely inaccessible prior to heat shock. As expected, this transgene is almost completely unresponsive to heat shock. In fact, construct H&#x0002f;Ri exhibited less expression than construct &#x00394;CT&#x0002f;Ri, which lacked the homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrimidine sequence. This raises the possibility that the H-DNA-forming sequence itself may have repressive effects on <italic>hsp26</italic> expression in the absence of positive regulatory elements such as GAGA factor-binding sites.</p><p>Jim&#x000e9;nez-Garc&#x000ed;a <italic>et al</italic>. have demonstrated that GAGA factor has the ability to bind (CT)<sub>n</sub> triple-helical DNA of the dY-dR-dY type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c21">21</xref>). The experiments that we present here do not address the possibility that GAGA factor could bind and perhaps stabilize an intramolecular triplex at the native <italic>hsp26</italic> promoter. Bhat <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that GAGA factor is associated with the centromeric regions of metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c59">59</xref>), regions that are relatively devoid of genes but rich in homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrimidine sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c60">60</xref>). Some have suggested that triplex DNA might be associated with chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c20">20</xref>). If this suggestion bears out, perhaps GAGA factor might play a role in this process through its association with triplex DNA at the centromere.</p><p>Transgene GA&#x0002f;CT contains two blocks of (CT)<sub>n</sub> that are sufficient for completely normal chromatin structure and heat shock inducibility. These results are consistent with an earlier investigation showing that relatively short (CT)<sub>n</sub> sequences can impart wild-type levels of expression to <italic>hsp26</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c51">51</xref>). Studies of other <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes, such as <italic>hsp70</italic>, <italic>Ubx</italic> and <italic>actin</italic> 5C, have also indicated the importance of short (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats (5&#x02013;10 bp in length) in transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c62">62</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly studies also show that short (CT)<sub>n</sub> repeats function well in directing assembly of an open chromatin structure in a GAGA factor-dependent reaction at a <italic>Drosophila hsp70</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c43">43</xref>). It has been demonstrated that GAGA factor recognizes sequences as short as a 3 bp GAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg369c63">63</xref>). In our test system, normal function of the proximal (CT)<sub>n</sub> region appears to require at least two stretches of (CT)<sub>n</sub>, perhaps indicating a requirement for six minimal GAGA factor-binding sites. None of these shorter sequences can adopt an H-DNA conformation. Thus while GAGA factor can bind (CT)<sub>n</sub> triplexes, the ability to form triplex DNA is not critical for GAGA factor function.</p><p>The study we have presented is one of the few examples in which a DNA element capable of adopting an unusual DNA conformation has been tested independently of its other biological activities (i.e. binding <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors). Our results clearly show that the ability to form H-DNA is insufficient to generate the normal chromatin structure required for expression of a test gene. A triplex-forming DNA element was unable to substitute for a conventional GAGA factor-binding site <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, the ability of other homopurine&#x000b7;homopyrimidine sequences to adopt unusual DNA conformations might be less significant than their roles as binding sites for transcriptional activators or chromatin anti-repressors. Although H-DNA may yet prove to play a part in gene expression, DNA replication or chromosome condensation, the present study suggests a more limited biological role for this unusual DNA conformation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg369f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Map of the <italic>hsp26-lacZ</italic> control transgene.
