The uterine cavity was evaluated anatomically by transvaginal ultrasound scan and hysterosalpingography and/or hysteroscopy in order to detect mullerian malformations or the presence of fibroids or polyps. Endocrinological assessment included screening for diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, hyperprolactinemia, luteal insufficiency, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Basal FSH, LH, and estradiol, and luteal phase progesterone, TSH, prolactin levels, and fasting glucose were evaluated in all patients. In addition, trans-vaginal USG and androgens levels were assessed to look for PCOS. Chronic inflammation owing to immunological disease such as erythematosus lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic sclerosis were also studied. Serum level of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antimithocondrial antibodies (AMA), and smooth muscle cells antibodies (SMA), rheumatoid arthritis, and levels of C reactive protein were assessed.

Patients were well matched according to age. Ninety patients showed alteration of hemostasis with a trend toward thrombophilia. Eighty-three patients with 2 or more early pregnancy losses and 7 patients with 1 or more late pregnancy loss were enrolled. Patients with RPL showed more gestations (median 3.1 vs 1.7 of control group), although only 10% ended with delivery of a living neonate.</p><p>Thrombophilia was present in 90/115 patients (78%) of study group compared with 12/75 (16%) of control subjects (p &#x0003c; 0.001, significant, s). Eighty-four patients showed isolated hemostatic abnormalities with a trend toward hypercoagulable state, while 6 patents showed combined defects inducing a hypercoagulable state, too.</p><p>The evaluation of the analyzed thrombophilic conditions revealed that factor V Leiden heterozygosity was present in 6/115 (5.2%) patients with RPL vs 1/75 (1.3%) subjects of control group (p 0.091, ns); factor V Leiden homozygosity was absent in both study and control groups (statistical analysis not performed) (data not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-btt-2-897">Table 2</xref>). Prothrombin A20210G heterozygosity was present in 18/115 (15%) patients with RPL vs 2/75 (2.6%) control (p 0.001, s), while prothrombin A20210G homozigosity was absent both in study and control groups (statistical analysis not performed) (data not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-btt-2-897">Table 2</xref>). MTHFR C677T homozygosity was present in 35/115 (30.0%) patients with RPL vs 7/75 (9.3%) control (p: 0.001, s).</p><p>We did not find any subjects with antithrombin III deficiency in either group (statistical analysis not performed) (data not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-btt-2-897">Table 2</xref>).

LAC and anticardiolipin antibodies were both present in 2/115 study group subjects (1.7%).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Alteration of hemostasis with a trend toward thrombophilia has been frequently associated to RPL. Several published studies seem to differ not only on the frequency of specific alteration but also on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of enrolled patients. For this reason we may observe also great differences about the involvement of thrombophilia during the evaluation of patients with RPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-btt-2-897">Robertson et al 2006</xref>). However, the incidence of thrombophilia seems to increase if any causes of miscarriage, such as endocrine alterations and uterine malformations, are also excluded from the study population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-btt-2-897">Sarig et al 2002</xref>). Our data confirmed this trend and showed a strong association, reaching nearly 78%, of one or more thrombophilic defects in women with RPL if other common causes of miscarriage are excluded. Before evaluating thrombophilia in our selected patients, we excluded several conditions associated with miscarriage such as uterine malformation, anovulation, tube patency, endocrine diseases (ie, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, hyperprolactinemia, luteal insufficiency, and PCOS), chronic and/or infectious diseases, and karyotype alterations.</p><p>Our data are also of interest if the frequency of specific thrombophilic defects is analyzed. We did not find a strong association with factor V Leiden gene polymorphism and RPL, while we did find an increased frequency of prothrombin A20210G gene polymorphism compared with control subjects and also with other studies. Our data for prothrombin A20210G gene polymorphism was statistically significant. However, these differences from previous studies may be linked also to ethnic background, according to published data on geographical distribution of these gene variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-btt-2-897">Ioannou et al 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-btt-2-897">Rosendaal et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-btt-2-897">Sarig et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-btt-2-897">Zalavras et al 2003</xref>). This reason may also explain the strong impact of the homozygosity of the MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism, which is present in the homozygosity gene variants in nearly 30% of the enrolled patients. Although MTFHR C677T gene polymorphism is a well recognized thrombotic risk factor, in particular for venous thromboembolism, data on its role in the pathophysiology of RPL per se is still a matter of discussion because of the role of folic acid in homocysteine metabolism. From another point of view, the relevant incidence of the MTHFR C677T gene variant may also be due to ethnic background, and for this reason we may also observe an increased incidence of the TT genotype in the control group (ie, nearly 16%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-btt-2-897">Rozen 2001</xref>). However, from a metabolic point of view previous studies may underestimate the involvement of homocysteine metabolism and MTHFR C677T gene variants in RPL: usually MTHFR C677T gene variants are analyzed only if a thrombotic disease, such as RPL, is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Yet the role of folic acid fortification during pregnancy is well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-btt-2-897">Andersson et al 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-btt-2-897">Bonnette et al 1998</xref>) for preventing neural tube defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-btt-2-897">Smithells et al 1980</xref>), and this folic acid fortification may determine also a transient reduction in homocysteine levels during pregnancy.</p><p>We did not find in our population homozygosity for prothrombin A20210G or factor V Leiden gene polymorphisms, or antithrombin deficiency. However, we did find a low incidence of protein C deficiency in our population, and these data seem to be in agreement with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-btt-2-897">Sarig et al (2002)</xref>.</p><p>An increased frequency (statistically significant) of protein S deficiency was also found in our population, highlighting again its relevance in these patients affected by RPL. These data are also in agreement with those previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-btt-2-897">Sanson et al 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-btt-2-897">Sarig et al 2002</xref>).</p><p>We found also a statistically significant increased incidence of antiphospholipid syndrome in women with RPL compared with control, which agrees with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-btt-2-897">Sarig et al 2002</xref>).</p><p>Particular attention should also be paid to the incidence of combined defects in women with RPL, which reached nearly 10% of investigated women. This observation could be very interesting for future studies because previous case control studies have underlined a potential role of combined thrombophilic defects in women with late pregnancy loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-btt-2-897">Gris et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-btt-2-897">Sotiriadis et al 2007</xref>). We observed that more than 60% of our patients showed not only late pregnancy loss, as already reported in the literature, but also early RPL. Because our data on the role of combined thrombophilic defects in women with RPL reach statistical significance, even though the reduced number of selected patients was few, the role of combined thrombophilic defects in women with any type of recurrent pregnancy should be analyzed in further studies.</p><p>Our data emphasizes the role of thrombophilia in women with RPL. Specific research on the alteration of hemostasis in this clinical setting is particularly relevant in order to establish a possible protocol that supports clinical surveillance and follow up associated with thromboprophylaxis of these patients, both for repeated pregnancy loss and deep venous thrombosis, which is still a common complication in pregnant women. For the frequency of thrombophilic defects, we confirmed a major role for protein S deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome, prothrombin A20210G gene variants, and MTHFR C677T gene variants, which has been reported previously. Interestingly, our data differ from those previously published in terms a reduced frequency of factor V Leiden gene variant. However, this gene variant should be also considered in this clinical setting because it has been observed in several of our patients, although its frequency did not reach statistical significance, probably because of a different ethnic distribution in our geographical area.</p><p>Alteration of hemostasis with a trend toward hypercoagulable state should be evaluated soon if patients affected by RPL do not show other causes of miscarriage. Because such patients may show an asymptomatic hyperocagulable state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-btt-2-897">Di Micco et al 2004</xref>) and because antithrombotic treatment in thrombophilic pregnant women with previous RPL has been shown to improve prognosis of related pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-btt-2-897">Brenner et al 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-btt-2-897">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-btt-2-897">Stephenson et al 2004</xref>), the possibility of starting early antithrombotic treatment (ie, before the beginning of pregnancy) should be studied, based on aspirin and/or low-molecular-weight heparin in order to evaluate further improvements in pregnancy outcome of thrombophilic women.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
