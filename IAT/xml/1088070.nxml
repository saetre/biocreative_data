It remained to be shown, however, whether tethering to the membrane <italic>per se</italic> could be responsible for inactivation, i.e. whether such relocation leads to a spatial separation from the chromosome that results in inactivity or whether other mechanisms are involved. We, therefore, investigated the activity of Lac repressor artificially attached to the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cytoplasmic membrane. We demonstrate that this chimeric protein perfectly represses transcription initiated at the <italic>tac</italic> operator&#x02013;promoter present on a plasmid and even in the chromosome. Moreover, this repression is inducible as normal. The data suggest that proteins localized to the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane in principle have unrestricted access to the chromosome. Thus sequestration to the membrane in terms of physical separation from the chromosome cannot account alone for the inactivation of regulatory proteins. Other mechanisms, like induction of a conformational change or masking of binding domains are required additionally.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the past decade a novel mode of activity control of regulatory proteins has been revealed in bacteria. In this mode, transcription factors shuttle between their binding sites on the chromosome and the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane, where they are held inactive. In response to a specific stimulus, these regulators are again released from the membrane and can bind back to their target sites on the chromosome [for a recent review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>)].</p><p>The first example of such a mechanism was the regulation of the proline utilization (<italic>put</italic>) operon by PutA in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). PutA has been shown to be a bi-functional protein. In the absence of proline, PutA remains in the cytoplasm, where it binds to the <italic>put</italic> operators and represses <italic>put</italic> gene expression. When an excess of proline is present, proline binds to PutA. Binding of proline, combined with reduction of the PutA protein by the membrane-associated electron transport chain, leads to release of PutA from its operators and its association with the membrane. From this location it catalyzes the degradation of proline to glutamate.</p><p>Another elegant system where membrane sequestration of a repressor leads to induction of its assigned genes is represented by the <italic>mlc</italic> regulon in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The repressor Mlc controls expression of several genes involved in carbohydrate utilization [for reviews see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)]. One of them is <italic>ptsG</italic> encoding the EII<sup>Glc</sup> transport protein of the phosphotransferase system (PTS). Mlc is in turn regulated by the transport activity of EII<sup>Glc</sup>. In the absence of substrate for EII<sup>Glc</sup>, Mlc binds to its operator sites and represses transcription. When EII<sup>Glc</sup> is engaged in transport, it binds Mlc, thereby sequestering it to the membrane, which leads to concomitant de-repression of the Mlc-controlled genes. It has recently been shown that an artificial attachment of Mlc to the cytoplasmic membrane by fusion to the LacY permease causes de-repression of Mlc-controlled genes even in the absence of EII<sup>Glc</sup>, suggesting that tethering of Mlc to the membrane alone, rather than binding to EII<sup>Glc</sup>, may lead to its inactivation as a repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Not only repressors but also activator proteins were shown to be sequestered to the membrane in response to their cognate signals and concomitantly kept inactive. These include MalT of <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), TraR of <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) and NifL of <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, in this case an inhibitor of a gene activator protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In most of these cases the molecular reason for inactivity of the membrane-localized regulatory proteins is not clear, but it has been proposed that a spatial gap may exist between the membrane and the chromosome with the consequence that the transcription factors have to &#x02018;shuttle&#x02019; back to the nucleoid to gain access to their binding sites in the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). However, in one case, the DNA binding gene activator protein ToxR of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, it has been demonstrated that this protein is naturally membrane-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In addition, we have previously shown that the transcriptional antiterminator protein BglG from <italic>E.coli</italic> that is regulated in its activity by a membrane spanning sugar transport protein can be artificially tethered to the membrane without impairing its function. The membrane-bound BglG protein is capable of interacting with its chromosomally encoded nascent RNA target sequence, catalyzing transcriptional read-through with virtually no difference to wild-type BglG, and it is perfectly regulated in its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). These observations suggested that in principle there should be no mechanistic necessity for a regulatory protein like BglG to leave the place of its own regulation, i.e. the membrane, in order to interact with its target sequences.</p><p>However, for activator proteins like ToxR or BglG transient interactions with their cognate target sequences could be sufficient to stimulate gene expression. Furthermore, actively transcribed DNA is believed to often reside close to the membrane, especially when co-translational insertion of proteins into the membrane takes place. For efficient transcriptional repression, however, occupation of the operator binding site by the repressor protein for most of the time is required and no or little transcription should occur that could redirect the operator DNA to the membrane. It, therefore, was an open question whether repressor proteins could exist or be engineered that function from the cytoplasmic membrane. Here, we addressed this question and artificially anchored the <italic>E.coli</italic> Lac repressor to the cytoplasmic membrane. We demonstrate that this membrane-attached LacI protein perfectly represses transcription initiation at a chromosomally located <italic>tac</italic> operator&#x02013;promoter and that it can be released from repression by the addition of isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as inducer. Our experiments suggest that membrane-attached and soluble Lac repressor proteins find their operator site in the chromosome with similar efficiency. Together, our results suggest that membrane sequestration of a repressor protein <italic>per se</italic> cannot be the reason for its inactivation. Other mechanisms are required. The concept that membrane sequestration provides a spatial separation from and prevents access to the chromosome has thus to be revised.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids, strains and growth conditions</title><p>The strains and plasmids used and their relevant characteristics are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

The correct nucleotide sequences of PCR-derived fragments in the various plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Bacteria were routinely grown in 2YT broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin at 30 &#x003bc;g/ml, chloramphenicol at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml and ampicillin at 100 &#x003bc;g/ml, if not otherwise indicated).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of chimeric <italic>lacI</italic> fusion genes</title><p>Plasmid pFDX4151 was the ancestor of plasmids carrying the different chimeric <italic>lacI</italic> derivatives. It was constructed by a three fragment ligation combining the ClaI&#x02013;PstI- and the Psp1406I&#x02013;ClaI-fragments of plasmid pFDX500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) with a PCR fragment which was amplified with primers #631 (5&#x02032;-CGTATAACGTTACTGGTTTCATATGCACCACCCTGAATTG) and #632 (5&#x02032;-GCCGGGAAGCTAGAG) from plasmid pFDX500 as template and digested with Psp1406I and PstI. This construction changed the start codon of <italic>lacI</italic> from GTG to ATG and simultaneously created an NdeI site overlapping with the start codon that allowed the insertion of foreign DNAs in-frame with <italic>lacI</italic>. For construction of the <italic>M13gene8</italic>-<italic>lacI</italic> fusion gene, the <italic>M13gene8</italic> was amplified by using primers #293 (5&#x02032;-GGGATTTAAACATATGAAAAAGTCTTTAGTCCTCAAAGC) and #294 (5&#x02032;-TTTAAAGTACTTGCTTTCGAGGTGAATTTCTTAAA) and plasmid M13mp18 as template. The PCR fragment was digested at the NdeI and Csp6I sites within the primers and inserted into the NdeI site of plasmid pFDX4151, resulting in plasmid pFDX4152. For the construction of plasmid pFDX4154 carrying the <italic>galK&#x02032;-lacI</italic> fusion gene, the 5&#x02032;-part of <italic>galK</italic> encompassing the first 32 codons was amplified by using the primers #636 (5&#x02032;-GATATACATATGGCTAG) and #637 (5&#x02032;-CACTGCATTAATAGCAAGGACAGGC) and plasmid pFDX3225 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) as template. The PCR fragment was digested at the NdeI and AseI sites within the primers and inserted into the NdeI site of plasmid pFDX4151.

First, codons 96&#x02013;132 of the &#x003bb;<italic>cI</italic> gene encoding a flexible linker were amplified by using primers #634 (5&#x02032;-AAAGAGTATCATATGGACCCGTCACTT) and #635 (5&#x02032;-CTCCTCATTAATGCTTACCCATCTCTC) and plasmid &#x003bb;dv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) as template. The PCR fragment was digested at the NdeI and MseI sites within the primers and inserted into the NdeI site of plasmid pFDX4151 resulting in the intermediate construct pFDX4153 carrying a &#x003bb;<italic>cI&#x02032;</italic>-<italic>lacI</italic> fusion gene. Next, the digested PCR fragments from above, encompassing the 5&#x02032;-part of <italic>galK</italic> and <italic>gene8</italic>, respectively, were inserted into the NdeI site of plasmid pFDX4153, resulting in plasmids pFDX4155 and pFDX4156. In order to replace the ribosomal binding site (RBS) in front of <italic>lacI</italic> and its various chimeric derivatives, the sequence upstream was amplified by using primers #646 (5&#x02032;-GTTGCCATTGCTGCAGGC) and #647 (5&#x02032;-GCATATCGCATATGTATATCTCCTTCTTGACTCTCTTCCGGGCGCTAT; contains the RBS of <italic>T7gene10</italic>) and plasmid pFDX4152 as template. The PCR fragment was digested at the PstI and NdeI sites within the primers and used to replace the corresponding fragment in plasmids pFDX4151, pFDX4152, pFDX4154, pFDX4155 and pFDX4156 resulting in plasmids pFDX4165, pFDX4157, pFDX4158, pFDX4159 and pFDX4160, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of a <italic>tacOP-lacZ</italic> reporter cassette and integration into the chromosomal <italic>attB</italic> site</title><p>Plasmid pFDX3551 carries a <italic>tacOP-lacZ</italic> cassette with the relatively weak RBS sequence of the <italic>bglG</italic> gene in front of <italic>lacZ</italic>.

For this purpose the protein to be anchored is fused to the <italic>C</italic>-terminus of the coat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). We made use of this tool to attach the Lac repressor to the membrane. To this end, a translational fusion of the <italic>lacI</italic> gene encoding Lac repressor to the exact 3&#x02032; end of <italic>gene8</italic> was constructed and placed on a low copy plasmid under control of the <italic>lacI</italic> promoter. In order to determine whether an <italic>N</italic>-terminal extension would generally impair the function of Lac repressor, a control fusion comprising the first 32 codons of the <italic>galK</italic> gene fused to <italic>lacI</italic> was also constructed. The <italic>galK</italic> gene encodes galactokinase, a soluble protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>The DNA binding domain of Lac repressor encompasses the first 60 <italic>N</italic>-terminal amino acid residues. It thus appeared conceivable that the tight tethering of this domain to the membrane could negatively interfere with its DNA binding ability. We, therefore, constructed additional fusion genes in which codons 96&#x02013;132 of the &#x003bb;<italic>cI</italic> repressor gene encoding a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) were placed between the <italic>lacI</italic>- and the <italic>gene8</italic>- or <italic>galK</italic>-part of the respective fusion genes.</p><p>In order to allow investigation by gel electrophoresis of whether the fusion proteins are stable <italic>in vivo</italic> and indeed attached to the membrane, a second set of isogenic vectors was constructed in which the RBS of <italic>lacI</italic> was replaced by the stronger RBS of gene<italic>10</italic> of phage<italic>T7</italic>, leading to a higher expression of the different Lac repressor derivatives. Transformants carrying the respective expression plasmids were analyzed by [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine labeling and subsequent SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As a control, the untransformed strain was also employed. Labeled protein bands became visible, which were exclusively present in the extracts of the respective transformants expressing LacI (39.6 kDa), the &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;&#x003bb;CI&#x02013;LacI) fusion (49.6 kDa) or the &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;LacI) fusion (45.3 kDa). The positions of these proteins on the gel fitted well with the calculated molecular weight of the respective LacI derivatives, indicating that they are properly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, compare lanes 1, 7, 13 and 19; data not shown for the GalK&#x02013;LacI and the GalK&#x02013;&#x003bb;CI&#x02032;&#x02013;LacI fusion proteins).</p><p>In order to test the stability of the different LacI derivatives, the labeled cultures were chased with unlabeled methionine for different times prior to protein extraction and SDS&#x02013;PAGE. All LacI derivatives were stable over the tested period of 30 min, as was the wild-type LacI protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, compare lanes 14&#x02013;18 and 20&#x02013;24 with lanes 8&#x02013;12; data not shown for the GalK&#x02013;LacI and the GalK&#x02013;&#x003bb;CI&#x02032;&#x02013;LacI fusion proteins).</p><p>Next, we wanted to verify that the Gene8 fusion proteins were indeed tightly attached to the cytoplasmic membrane. We, therefore, performed a subcellular fractionation of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled transformants harboring the wild-type <italic>lacI</italic> gene or the &#x003c6;(<italic>gene8</italic>-<italic>lacI</italic>) and the &#x003c6;(<italic>gene8</italic>-&#x003bb;<italic>cI</italic>&#x02032;<italic>-lacI</italic>) fusion genes, respectively, by sucrose gradient centrifugation, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The untransformed strain served as a control. The soluble and membrane fractions were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE along with the unfractionated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It can be seen that both the &#x003c6;(Gene8-LacI) as well as the &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;&#x003bb;CI&#x02032;&#x02013;LacI) fusion proteins were present in the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lanes 8 and 11) but not in appreciable amounts in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lanes 7 and 10). The wild-type LacI protein, on the other hand, was only visible in the soluble fraction, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lane 4). Its amount was, however, lower than that detected with the [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled whole cell extracts analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Since the amount of LacI was similarly reduced in case of the unfractionated control sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lane 6), it is feasible that this reduction was due to the TCA precipitation step which was performed with all samples analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> but not with those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This difference has, however, no impact on the main conclusion that both, the &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;LacI) as well as the &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;&#x003bb;CI&#x02032;&#x02013;LacI) fusion protein are stable and are anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Membrane-attached Lac repressor is active in transcriptional repression</title><p>The important question was whether or not the membrane-attached LacI proteins are functional in repression and thus in operator binding, and if so, whether or not repression by these proteins could be relieved by the addition of IPTG, a gratuitous inducer for wild-type Lac repressor. To this end, strain R1279 in which the chromosomal <italic>lac</italic> operon is deleted, was co-transformed with the various plasmids carrying the different <italic>lacI</italic> derivatives under control of the wild-type <italic>lacI</italic> RBS and in addition with reporter plasmid pFDX3551. This plasmid carries a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene under control of the <italic>tac</italic> promoter which is controlled by the main <italic>lac</italic> operator <italic>O</italic><sub>1</sub> that overlaps with its transcriptional start site. When strain R1279 was transformed with this reporter plasmid alone, high &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities of &#x0223c;5000 U were produced which were unaffected by the absence or presence of IPTG, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, bars 1). The additional presence of plasmid pFDX500 delivering wild-type Lac repressor led to the synthesis of 51 U in the absence and of 1640 U in the presence of IPTG. Thus, the expression of <italic>lacZ</italic> was repressed 32-fold by wild-type Lac repressor in this reporter system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, bars 2). Nearly identical values were obtained when the LacI delivering plasmid pFDX4151 carrying an NdeI site that overlaps with the <italic>lacI</italic> start codon was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, bars 3). Thus, the introduction of this site and the exchange of the GTG start codon against ATG had no appreciable effect on repression. The expression of the &#x003c6;(GalK&#x02013;LacI) fusion protein yielded activities which were similar to those obtained with the wild-type LacI protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, compare bars 3 and 4), indicating that the fusion of a foreign polypeptide to the N-terminus of LacI may in general not have deleterious effects on repression and thus on binding of the Lac repressor to its operator. Expression of the membrane-anchored &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;LacI) fusion protein led to the synthesis of 2250 U of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities in the presence of IPTG which were reduced to 120 U in its absence. Thus, the membrane-anchored &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;LacI) protein was indeed able to efficiently repress expression of the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene. Moreover, this repression could be relieved 19-fold by the addition of IPTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, bars 5). The presence of the flexible protein linker of the &#x003bb;CI protein had no effect on the repression activity of the &#x003c6;(GalK&#x02013;&#x003bb;CI&#x02032;&#x02013;LacI) protein when compared with the &#x003c6;(GalK&#x02013;LacI) protein without this linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, compare bars 4 and 6). In contrast, the &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;&#x003bb;CI&#x02032;&#x02013;LacI) protein was less active in transcriptional repression when compared with the &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;LacI) fusion protein lacking the &#x003bb;CI-linker. Therefore, induction was only 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, compare bars 7 and 5). Obviously, the &#x003bb;CI-linker negatively interfered with the operator binding ability of this membrane-attached Lac repressor protein.</p></sec><sec><title>The membrane-attached LacI proteins regulate expression of a chromosomal gene</title><p>The experiments presented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) demonstrate that the membrane-attached Lac repressor proteins are indeed active in transcriptional repression. However, in these tests the <italic>lacO<sub>1</sub></italic> target site was encoded on a plasmid. Although plasmids appear to be clustered and partitioned within a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) they may be more readily accessible by membrane-localized DNA binding proteins than sequences within the nucleoid. The question was thus still open whether the membrane-located Lac repressor protein would have free access and tightly bind to a chromosomally located operator site. In order to address this question, the <italic>tacOP-lacZ</italic> reporter cassette present in plasmid pFDX3551 was integrated into the &#x003bb; <italic>attB</italic> site in the chromosome by site-specific recombination. However, this strain yielded very low &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities [&#x0003c;100 Miller units already in the absence of Lac repressor (data not shown)], making it difficult to precisely compare activities of the various Lac repressor derivatives. Therefore, the isogenic strain R2171 was constructed in which the more efficient ribosome binding site of gene<italic>10</italic> of phage <italic>T7</italic> was placed in front of <italic>lacZ</italic>. This strain yielded &#x0223c;4000 U of &#x003b2;-galactosidase, a convenient activity for the intended experiments. As expected, the presence of IPTG had no effect on this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, bars 1). Transformants of this strain harboring plasmids pFDX500 and pFDX4151, respectively, that both encode the wild-type Lac repressor yielded 30&#x02013;40 U of &#x003b2;-galactosidase. These activities increased 70&#x02013;80-fold in the presence of IPTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, bars 2 and 3), verifying that expression of the chromosomal <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter cassette is perfectly regulated by the wild-type repressor in an inducer-dependent manner. Very similar results were obtained in the presence of plasmids pFDX4154 and pFDX4155 encoding the &#x003c6;(GalK&#x02013;LacI) and the &#x003c6;(GalK&#x02013;&#x003bb;CI&#x02032;&#x02013;LacI) fusion proteins, respectively, demonstrating once again that this fusion of a foreign peptide to the N-terminus of LacI has no negative effect on Lac repressor function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, bars 4 and 6). When strain R2171 was transformed with plasmid pFDX4152 that encodes the membrane-anchored &#x003c6;(Gene8-LacI) chimeric repressor, the transformants synthesized only 34 U of &#x003b2;-galactosidase. Thus, the membrane-anchored repressor is able to repress the <italic>tac</italic> promoter present in the chromosome as efficiently as the wild-type repressor. Addition of IPTG resulted in 3760 U or a 111-fold induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, bars 5). Thus, the membrane-attached LacI derivative is capable of regulating the expression of the chromosomal <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene as efficiently as the wild-type repressor. Finally, the membrane-anchored &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;&#x003bb;CI&#x02013;LacI) fusion protein delivered by plasmid pFDX4156 was tested. Presence of this plasmid led to 53 U of &#x003b2;-galactosidase in the absence of IPTG and to 3560 U in its presence, which is a 67-fold induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, bars 7). This result corroborates the above observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, bars 7) that the presence of the &#x003bb;CI-linker may slightly impair operator binding of the membrane-anchored repressor.</p></sec><sec><title>Membrane-attached and soluble LacI proteins exhibit similar kinetics of binding to chromosomally located operator <italic>lacO1</italic></title><p>The experiments above demonstrated that the membrane-attached &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;LacI) fusion protein is capable of efficiently repressing expression of the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene and thus of binding to a chromosomally located operator, <italic>lacO1</italic>. The addition of IPTG led to release from this repression. Moreover, repression as well as inducibility were quite similar with its membrane-anchored fusion derivatives as compared with the wild-type repressor, suggesting that even the equilibrium constants for binding of the operator sequence are similar. However, in the experiments described above, cultures were pregrown without IPTG, split and subsequently grown in the presence or absence of IPTG before enzyme activities were determined. Thus, these data allow no conclusion about the initial rate of operator occupancy. To address this question, cultures of the transformants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were pregrown in the presence of IPTG. Subsequently, they were washed free of IPTG to allow establishment of repression, and the kinetics of decline of &#x003b2;-galactosidase as a function of time was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the absence of repressor, specific activity remained constant as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, diamonds). In all other cases, enzyme activities declined with time as a result of re-establishment of repression. In these cases, the remaining activities represent the sum of dilution of enzyme activities by cell growth and of the basal enzyme synthesis under repressing conditions. As can be seen, the slopes of decline of enzyme activities are similar in all cases. The differences that can be seen reflect the differences in repression as revealed by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and support the conclusion that the membrane-anchored &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;LacI) repressor protein represses the <italic>tac</italic> promoter at least as efficient as the wild-type repressor. Thus, not only the equilibrium constants but also the initial rate of finding the operator target appears to be similar within the time frame of these kinetics for the membrane-localized and soluble repressor proteins. Taken together, it can be concluded that a membrane-attached Lac repressor protein can find and bind its operator sequence present in the chromosome as efficient as the soluble wild-type LacI protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that the <italic>E.coli</italic> Lac repressor retains its activity when it is artificially fixed with its N-terminus to the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. From this location it represses the expression of a <italic>tacOP-lacZ</italic> reporter cassette present on a plasmid and even in the chromosome with the same efficiency as the wild-type repressor. Moreover, addition of IPTG as an inducer resulted in the same de-repression exhibited by the wild-type repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The data indicate that the equilibrium constants for the occupation of chromosomal <italic>lac</italic> operator <italic>O<sub>1</sub></italic> must be similar for the membrane-localized &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;LacI) protein and the wild-type Lac repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Pulse-chase experiments verified that the chimeric &#x003c6;(Gene8&#x02013;LacI) protein is stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Subcellular fractionations demonstrated that the chimeric repressor protein is stably anchored to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>However, we did not demonstrate that the membrane-anchored fusion protein is capable of regulating the authentic <italic>lac</italic> operon. Indeed, when we replaced the wild-type <italic>lacI</italic> gene by the <italic>gene8-lacI</italic> fusion gene within the context of the authentic <italic>lac</italic> operon in the chromosome, expression of the operon was only weakly repressed. However, very similar results were obtained when the <italic>lacI</italic> gene was replaced by one of the <italic>galK-lacI</italic> fusion genes (data not shown). Thus, a fusion to the N-terminus of the Lac repressor encompassing its DNA binding domain generally leads to a defect in repressor function in its authentic context, the <italic>lac</italic> operon. In this context, full repression requires cooperative binding of LacI to one of two auxiliary operators in addition to operator <italic>O</italic><sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). This cooperative binding requires the tetramerization of LacI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). It may be concluded from our data that a fusion of a foreign peptide to the <italic>N</italic>-terminus of LacI in general may negatively interfere with its binding capability to the main operator, <italic>O</italic><sub>1</sub>, when auxiliary binding sites are present.</p><p>Nevertheless, our data clearly demonstrate that a membrane-anchored Lac repressor does have unrestricted access to the chromosomally located <italic>lacO1</italic> operator. Thus, not only transcriptional antiterminator proteins like the <italic>E.coli</italic> BglG protein can be engineered to work from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) but also transcriptional repressor proteins that have to occupy their binding sites for most of the time and be able to bind back fast in order to achieve efficient repression. Thus, a physical gap between membrane and chromosome does not exist. It appears that either the chromosome already resides in the vicinity of the membrane, making a physical movement of the regulator unnecessary, or that the chromosome dynamically rearranges very fast allowing free access to its sequences from the membrane. This view is in agreement with early studies that reported the chromosome to be associated with the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>A major consequence of our results is that membrane sequestration of gene regulators in terms of their physical separation from the chromosome alone cannot account for their inactivation. A well-studied case of a gene activator that shuttles between the chromosome and the membrane is MalT of <italic>E.coli</italic>. Upon maltose transport MalT is released from the membrane-bound subunit MalK of the maltose transporter which is a prerequisite for MalT activity. It has been known for a long time that even a soluble form of MalK inhibits <italic>mal</italic> gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, at least when overproduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Recently, it has been demonstrated that soluble MalK is able to inhibit MalT activity in a purified transcription system by blocking the binding of the inducer maltotriose to MalT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Thus, membrane sequestration of MalT appears to be just a secondary effect as a consequence of its interaction with the membrane-localized MalK subunit rather than to be directly responsible for MalT inactivity. The quorum-sensing activator protein TraR of <italic>A.tumefaciens</italic> in the presence of the homoserine lactone signal exists as an active dimer in the cytoplasm, whereas in its absence TraR is sequestered to the membrane in an inactive, monomeric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). It, thus, appears that the subcellular localization of TraR modulates its oligomerization state and thereby indirectly regulates the activity of TraR.</p><p>In a recent study, it was found that different sites in the chromosome significantly differ in their accessibility to phage &#x003bb; integrase catalyzed site-specific recombination. In fact, several loci were found that were even designated &#x02018;black holes&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). On the other hand, the <italic>E.coli</italic> chromosome is generally accessible <italic>in vivo</italic> along its entire length to restriction enzymes suggesting that there are no extensive stably bound structural components that prevent their access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Our tests were performed with lac operator <italic>O</italic><sub>1</sub> integrated into the &#x003bb; <italic>attB</italic> site of the <italic>E.coli</italic> chromosome. We are currently investigating with the aid of a transposon borne <italic>tacOP-lacZ</italic> cassette whether differences in the accessibility to repression by the membrane-bound Lac repressor exist within the chromosome. Our finding that membrane-bound Lac repressor can tightly bind to its operator should in principal allow to tether almost any DNA sequences containing <italic>lac</italic> operator to the cytoplasmic membrane and to study the consequences. For example, DNA topology or chromatin structure could be captured between two operator sites and released upon the addition of IPTG, and the consequences for recombination, gene expression or DNA replication could be studied.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank G.
