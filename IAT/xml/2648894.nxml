MMP7 has been related to the loss of tumor cell response to cytotoxic agents although the exact mechanism is not fully understood. Moreover, MMP7 is an independent prognosis factor for survival in patients with colorectal cancer. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of MMP7 and its cross-talk with the Fas/FasL system during the acquisition of oxaliplatin resistance in colon cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>For this purpose we have developed three different oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines (RHT29, RHCT116 p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>, RHCT116 p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) from the parental HT29, HCT116 p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and HCT116 p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> colon cancer cells. MMP7 basal expression was higher in the resistant compared to the parental cell lines. MMP7 was also upregulated by oxaliplatin in both HT29 (p53 mutant) and RHCT116 p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> but not in the RHCT116 p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>. Inhibition of MMP by 1,10-phenantroline monohydrate or siRNA of MMP7 restores cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in both HT29 and RHCT116 p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> but not in the RHCT116 p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>. Some of these effects are caused by alterations in Fas receptor. Fas is upregulated by oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells, however the RHT29 cells treated with oxaliplatin showed a 3.8-fold lower Fas expression at the cell surface than the HT29 cells. Decrease of Fas at the plasma membrane seems to be caused by MMP7 since its inhibition restores Fas levels. Moreover, functional analysis of Fas demonstrates that this receptor was less potent in inducing apoptosis in RHT29 cells and that its activation induces MAPK signaling in resistant cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taking together, these results suggest that MMP7 is related to the acquisition of oxaliplatin-resistance and that its inhibition restores drug sensitivity by increasing Fas receptor. Furthermore, Fas undergoes a change in its functionality in oxaliplatin-resistant cells inducing survival pathways instead of apoptotic signals.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oxaliplatin has shown excellent efficacy in the treatment of colorectal cancer in combination with 5-fluorouracil.

However, despite the fact that the mechanisms influencing treatment responses are well known, it appears that the major process leading to chemotherapy resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Mitsiades1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> is the ability of cancer cells to evade cell death signals. This loss of response to apoptosis-induction during development of drug resistance resembles the normal tumor progression process, in which malignant cells also undergo molecular changes providing them with mechanisms against cell death induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Micheau1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Peter1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Fas (APO-1/CD95), a 48 kDa membrane protein belonging to the TNF receptor superfamily, activates caspase-dependent apoptosis in susceptible cells when is activated by its natural ligand (FasL). Many cancer cells acquire survival advantage during tumor progression by decreasing its sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Peter1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Khong1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Some mechanisms affecting Fas sensitivity include downregulation of Fas protein expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Strand1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and blockade of the active receptor site by the soluble form of Fas ligand (sFasL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Mitsiades1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, or by both. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are also implicated in the survival advantage of malignant cells influencing the Fas/FasL pathway.</p><p>MMPs are zinc-dependent enzymes associated with many types and stages of cancer. These enzymes promote metastasis and tumor growth through a variety of mechanisms such as ECM degradation, regulation of angiogenesis and modulation of innate immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Chambers1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result of MMP activity tumor cells can develop mechanisms to evade immune responses, resulting in promotion of tumor survival, acquisition of metastatic phenotype and further tumor dissemination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Overall1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. MMP7 (matrilysin), is a metalloproteinase with prometastatic function related to: 1) early tumor development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Egeblad1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, 2) metastatic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Kurokawa1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and 3) clinical outcome in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Wang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Maurel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We have observed in patients with advanced colorectal cancer that MMP7 is an independent prognostic factor for shorter survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Maurel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, probably because this enzyme can affect tumor cell responsiveness to chemotherapy. MMP7 has been widely studied in cancer progression not only by its implication in ECM degradation and metastasis promotion, but also by its role in the Fas/FasL system regulation and in the apoptosis responsiveness of tumor cells. MMP7 modulates Fas expression and activation, generating the soluble forms of FasL by cleavage of its membrane form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Mitsiades1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and by cleaving Fas receptor itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Strand1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In both cases, induction of apoptosis by Fas activation can be blocked by MMP7 activity.</p><p>It is well known that morphological and phenotypical characteristics that confer tumor cells advantage against Fas-induced apoptosis are different during tumor progression. In fact, alterations in functional Fas status seem to be produced in parallel to tumor progression towards a more metastatic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Peter1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Liu1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In CRC cell lines different metastatic subpopulations pre-exist within the heterogeneous primary cells. It is known that these cell subpopulations are resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis and that the selective pressure that favours the outgrowth of these metastatic cells selects also for populations with altered Fas functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Liu1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, loss of Fas expression and functionality during tumor progression is not the unique mechanism accounting for the acquisition of apoptosis resistance. Increased MMP7 expression also contributes to the selection of cells with reduced sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Strand1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Wang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Fingleton1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, to drug cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Mitsiades1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and to changes in the metastatic phenotype. The apoptotic-effects of some cytotoxic agents such as doxorubicin are mediated by upregulation of Fas and FasL expression, and by activation of the apoptotic signalling in the neighbouring cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Mitsiades1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Regarding this, MMP7 can protect cells against death by cleavage of both Fas receptor and its ligand from the cell surface, reducing the effectiveness of FasL in triggering apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Mitsiades1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Strand1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Wang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Fingleton1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the present work, we demonstrate that MMP7 expression increases when tumor cells acquire resistance to oxaliplatin. The inhibition of MMPs restores cell sensitivity either with a chemical inhibitor or with inhibition of MMP7 by siRNA, in part by increasing the levels of Fas receptor at the cell surface. One mechanism by which oxaliplatin induces cell death is by Fas upregulation, as previously described for other cytotoxic drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Mitsiades1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we have observed that in resistant cells the upregulation of Fas expression by oxaliplatin is partially blunted. Moreover, in these cells Fas, which normally activates apoptotic pathways, switches its function and induces the expression of survival proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MMP7 is related to the acquisition of resistance to oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells</title><p>Some authors have observed that addition of MMP7 to cell cultures protects cells from drug cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Mitsiades1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and from cytotoxic T-cell killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Strand1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, but whether MMP7 exerts these effects physiologically or if its expression is related to the acquisition of drug resistance remains unresolved.

These oxaliplatin-resistant cells show an IC50 several fold higher (RHT29 80 &#x000b5;M, RHCT116 p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> &#x0223c;8 &#x000b5;M and &#x0223c;15 &#x000b5;M RHCT116 p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) than the parental (HT29 &#x0223c;5&#x02013;7 &#x000b5;M, HCT116 p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> &#x0223c;1.75 &#x000b5;M and &#x0223c;2 &#x000b5;M HCT116 p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>),as determined by MTS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004728-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and they are more resistant to oxaliplatin induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004728-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), as analyzed by annexin/IP staining (5-fold double staining for HT29 compared to 2-fold double staining for RHT29).

Since MMP7 seems to be the most important protease related to the cleavage of Fas and FasL, we used MMPs inhibitor for the next set of experiments assuming that the effects of this inhibitor in other proteases would be less significant. Regarding Fas expression, oxaliplatin increases the cell surface form of Fas in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004728-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) similarly to other cytotoxic agents that activate apoptotic pathways by Fas upregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Micheau1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Kaufmann1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, these reports are based on studies aimed at inducing or inhibiting gene expression, which may not reflect the real physiological situation. In this report, we demonstrate that upregulation of MMP7 expression is a direct result of the acquisition of resistance to oxaliplatin, supporting its role in the development of drug-resistance. During the generation of resistant cell lines, only few clones may survive each round of therapy, suggesting that inside the heterogeneous tumor cell population only cells with high expression of MMP7 survive. These results are consistent with the findings reported by others, where it was observed that exogenous addition of MMP7 also increases resistance to drug-induced cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Mitsiades1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, since MMP7 seems to promote tumor survival, it is interesting to note that oxaliplatin treatment also induces MMP7 expression both in normal as well as in resistant cells. This implies a paradoxical effect since a treatment directed to activate apoptotic pathways also induces the expression of proteins that protect cells from death. Moreover, the results obtained with the RHCT116 p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> cell line suggest that upregulation of MMP7 is dependent on p53 status.</p><p>One of the mechanisms by which MMP7 protects cells is by favouring the shedding of FasL from cell surface and increasing the proportion of sFasL available to bind Fas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Mitsiades1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. From the results of this work it can be proposed that MMP7 protects cells against Fas-induced cell death by a similar pathway, by cleaving FasL and increasing sFasL, but also by cleaving Fas and decreasing the number of receptors at the plasma membrane. However, it is important to note that during the acquisition of resistance to oxaliplatin a positive loop evolves where the treatment itself upregulates MMP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004728-g008">Figure 8</xref>). From this point of view, the NF-&#x003ba;B system, which is activated in the oxaliplatin-resistant cells, is also playing a tumor-promoting role regulating FasL synthesis. However, it has to be considered that in these cells Fas is not activating the apoptotic pathways, but promoting pathways related to cell survival and migration. Therefore, it can be suggested that this positive loop generated by oxaliplatin treatment could, at the end, promote tumor progression by Fas activation and induction of tumor-promoting pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004728-g008">Figure 8</xref>). We are currently testing this hypothesis experimentally.</p><fig id="pone-0004728-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004728.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Mechanism of acquisition of resistance to oxaliplatin-induced cell death.</title><p>A) In a tumor with <italic>low levels of MMP7</italic> oxaliplatin is able to induce an upregulation of Fas receptor at the plasma membrane (1), allowing its activation by cells expressing FasL, such as cytotoxic cells or the surrender cells of the tumor (2).

Then, the cell pellet was mixed with 100 &#x000b5;l of melted agar and after its solidification the agar plugs were processed for paraffin embedding as regular biopsies. The blocks obtained were used to construct the cell line array using a tissue microarrayer (Beecher Instruments) and a 2-mm-gauge needle.</p><p>Array sections of two micrometer thickness were placed on slides and used for Fas immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal anti-Fas antibody DX2.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> experiments</title><p>Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the regulations of our institution's ethics commission, following the guidelines established by the government of Catalonia, Spain. Twenty female athymic nude mice (Harlan), 4&#x02013;5 weeks old were used in this study. The mice were bred at the Medical School animal facility laboratory and kept under specific pathogen-free conditions at constant ambient temperature (22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C) and humidity (30&#x02013;50&#x00025;). The mice were given sterilized food and tap water <italic>ad libitum.</italic></p><p>To produce colon carcinoma xenografts, HT29 and RHT29 cells were grown to 80&#x00025; confluence and trypsinized. Cell viability was confirmed by trypan blue exclusion. Only suspensions consisting of single cells with &#x0003e;90&#x00025; viability were used for subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells in 50 &#x000b5;l of PBS in mouse left flank. Treatment began 2 weeks after inoculation, with mice bearing &#x0223c;100-mm<sup>3</sup> subcutaneous tumors. Groups of mice (each group n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) were randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments: a) Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline solution once a week (control group), b) administration i.p. of oxaliplatin 10 mg/kg once per week during 27 days. Tumors were measured twice per week with a caliper square and, their volumes calculated by the formula: (a&#x000d7;b<sup>2</sup>)/2, where <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are the larger and the smaller diameter, respectively. At the end of treatments animals were sacrificed and the tumors removed, minced, placed into liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>qRT-PCR Analysis</title><p>Total RNA from tumor cells was isolated with Ultraspec (Biotecx) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 1 &#x000b5;g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Archived Kit (Applied Biosystems). Negative controls, including those without RNA and reverse transcriptase, were used to confirm the absence of genomic DNA contamination. Quantitative PCR analysis was done on the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems). For determination of gene expression Assay-on-demand (Applied Biosystems) was used (Hs00159163_m1 for MMP7, Hs00181225_m1 for FasL, Hs_00531110_m1 for Fas), which consist of a 6-FAM dye-labeled TaqMan MGB probe and the corresponding unlabeled primers. The PCR reaction mixture consisted of 5 &#x000b5;M of each primer, 10 &#x000b5;l of master mix (TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems) and 2 &#x000b5;l of cDNA. Transcript levels were normalized to those of beta-actin (Hs99999903_m1), which was used as endogenous control. Each experiment and every determination were done at least in triplicate, and the levels of MMP7, Fas and FasL were calculated using the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Transfection with antisense MMP7</title><p>Silencing of MMP7 was done by Stealth RNAi technology from Invitrogen, which provides three different chemical modified oligonucleotides against three different regions of the RNA target. Before silencing experiments, the protocol was adjusted to ensure a minimum of 80&#x00025; of RNA knockdown assessed by qPCR. According to the manufacturer's instructions cells in a 96 multiwell plate were reverse transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and 20 nM of each stealth, and 24 hours latter cells were treated with different doses of oxaliplatin as mentioned before. Cell viability was determined after 72 hours by MTS assay. For negative controls, cells were treated with lipofectamine alone or with a GC control (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Cytometric determinations</title><sec id="s4h1"><title>Determinations of cell surface Fas and FasL expression</title><p>For the detection of cell surface Fas and FasL expression, cells were treated with oxaliplatin (10 &#x000b5;M), 1,10-phenantroline monohydrate (5 &#x000b5;M) or both for 72 hours. Then, cells attached to the plate and from the supernatants were washed with PBS, resuspended in blocking buffer (BSA 1&#x00025;-PBS) and placed on ice for 30 min. Cell surface staining of tumor cells was done with the following primary monoclonal antibodies: anti-Fas mAb (clone DX2) or anti-FasL mAb (clone NOK1) in blocking buffer for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were then washed 3 times with BSA1&#x00025;-PBS and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 hour at 4&#x000b0;C. Control cells without staining were use to determine the settings of autofluorescence, and cells stained with secondary antibody were used to ensure the specificity of the primary antibodies. Stained cells were then analyzed on a FACscan flow cytometer using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and data processed by the software CellQuest. Twelve thousand cells were analyzed for each sample, and every experiment was performed in triplicate. Results are expressed in arbitrary units and have been calculated according to the formula: (fluorescence of each treatment/fluorescence of control cells).</p></sec><sec id="s4h2"><title>Annexin V/IP staining</title><p>For the characterization of oxaliplatin resistance HT29 and RHT29 cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates, allowed to attach overnight and subsequently cultured in medium containing oxaliplatin (10 &#x000b5;M) for 48 hours. For the analysis of apoptosis induction, cells were seeded as mentioned before and treated with oxaliplatin (10 &#x000b5;M), 1,10-phenantroline monohydrate (5 &#x000b5;M) or both for 24 h. Then, cells were treated with the Fas-activating antibody CH11 for additional 48 h. To determine the protective effects of MMP7 against oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis cells seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates were treated with rhMMP7 5 ng/ml for 24 hours and then treated with oxaliplatin (10 &#x000b5;M) for additional 24 hours. In all studies apoptosis was determined using Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining Kit (Roche), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells from the culture supernatants and those attached to the plate were blocked for 30 min with 1&#x00025; of albumin and then incubated for 15 min with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). Controls (binding buffer only, PI only, and annexin-V only) were used to set appropriate detector gains, compensation, and quadrant gates in the FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Twenty thousand cells for each sample were analyzed by the CellQuest software. Every experiment was performed in triplicate</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Western blot</title><p>The determinations of the total and activated forms of Erk 1/2 and p38 MAPK and the activated form of NF-&#x003ba;B were performed by Western blotting analysis as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004728-Lee1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> in cells treated with CH11 (150 ng/ml) for 24 hours.
